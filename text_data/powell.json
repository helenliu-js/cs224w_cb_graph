    "text": "For release on delivery\n11:25 a.m. EDT\nApril 4, 2025\nEconomic Outlook\nRemarks by\nJerome H. Powell\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nSociety for Advancing Business Editing and Writing Annual Conference\nArlington, Virginia\nApril 4, 2025\n\nThank you for having me here today. Monetary policy is more effective when the\npublic understands what we are doing and why. Through your work, journalists like you\nhelp promote that greater understanding. I am sure this room full of reporters does not\nlack for questions to ask. Before addressing a few of those, I will briefly summarize the\noutlook for the economy and monetary policy.\nAt the Fed, we are squarely focused on achieving the dual-mandate goals\nCongress has given us of maximum employment and stable prices. While uncertainty is\nhigh and downside risks have risen, the economy is still in a good place. The incoming\ndata show solid growth, a labor market in balance, and inflation running much closer to,\nbut still above, our 2 percent objective.\nRecent Economic Data\nAfter a couple of years of solid growth, many forecasters have anticipated\nsomewhat slower growth this year. The initial reading for first-quarter GDP will be\nreleased later this month. The limited hard data are consistent with a slower but still solid\ngrowth outlook. At the same time, surveys of households and businesses report dimming\nexpectations and higher uncertainty about the outlook. Survey respondents point to the\neffects of new federal policies, especially related to trade. We are closely watching this\ntension between the hard and soft data. As the new policies and their likely economic\neffects become clearer, we will have a better sense of their implications for the economy\nand for monetary policy.\nLooking across many indicators, the labor market appears to be broadly in\nbalance and is not a significant source of inflationary pressure. This morning’s jobs\nreport shows the unemployment rate at 4.2 percent in March, still in the low range where\n\n- 2 -\nit has held since early last year. Over the first quarter, payrolls grew by an average of\n150,000 jobs a month. The combination of low layoffs, moderating job growth, and\nslowing labor force growth has kept the unemployment rate broadly stable.\nTurning to the other leg of our dual mandate, inflation has declined sharply from\nits pandemic highs of mid-2022. It has done so without the kind of painful rise in\nunemployment that has often accompanied periods of tight monetary policy that are\nneeded to reduce inflation. More recently, progress toward our 2 percent inflation\nobjective has slowed. Total PCE prices rose 2.5 percent over the 12 months ending in\nFebruary. Core PCE prices, which exclude the volatile food and energy categories, rose\n2.8 percent. Looking ahead, higher tariffs will be working their way through our\neconomy and are likely to raise inflation in coming quarters. Reflecting this, both\nsurvey- and market-based measures of near-term inflation expectations have moved up.\nBy most measures, longer-term inflation expectations—those beyond the next few\nyears—remain well anchored and consistent with our 2 percent inflation goal. We\nremain committed to returning inflation sustainably to our 2 percent objective.\nMonetary Policy\nTurning to monetary policy, we face a highly uncertain outlook with elevated\nrisks of both higher unemployment and higher inflation. The new Administration is in\nthe process of implementing substantial policy changes in four distinct areas: trade,\nimmigration, fiscal policy, and regulation. Our monetary policy stance is well positioned\nto deal with the risks and uncertainties we face as we gain a better understanding of the\npolicy changes and their likely effects on the economy. It is not our role to comment on\nthose policies. Rather, we make an assessment of their likely effects, observe the\n\n- 3 -\nbehavior of the economy, and set monetary policy in a way that best achieves our dual-\nmandate goals.\nWe have stressed that it will be very difficult to assess the likely economic effects\nof higher tariffs until there is greater certainty about the details, such as what will be\ntariffed, at what level and for what duration, and the extent of retaliation from our trading\npartners. While uncertainty remains elevated, it is now becoming clear that the tariff\nincreases will be significantly larger than expected. The same is likely to be true of the\neconomic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth. The size and\nduration of these effects remain uncertain. While tariffs are highly likely to generate at\nleast a temporary rise in inflation, it is also possible that the effects could be more\npersistent. Avoiding that outcome would depend on keeping longer-term inflation\nexpectations well anchored, on the size of the effects, and on how long it takes for them\nto pass through fully to prices. Our obligation is to keep longer-term inflation\nexpectations well anchored and to make certain that a one-time increase in the price level\ndoes not become an ongoing inflation problem.\nWe will continue to carefully monitor the incoming data, the evolving outlook,\nand the balance of risks. We are well positioned to wait for greater clarity before\nconsidering any adjustments to our policy stance. It is too soon to say what will be the\nappropriate path for monetary policy.\nConclusion\nWe understand the benefits of a solid economy where workers can find jobs and\ninflation is low and predictable. We also understand that elevated levels of\nunemployment or inflation can be damaging and painful for communities, families, and\n\n- 4 -\nbusinesses. That is why we at the Fed will continue to do everything we can to achieve\nour maximum-employment and price-stability goals.\nThank you. I look forward to your questions.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n9:00 a.m. PDT (12:00 p.m. EDT)\nApril 5, 2017\nWelcoming Remarks\nby\nJerome H. Powell\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Expanding the Impact: Increasing Capacity and Influence,” the 2017 Interagency\nMinority Depository Institution and Community Development Financial Institution Bank\nNational Conference\nLos Angeles, Calif.\nApril 5, 2017\n\nThank you, Donna. Good morning and welcome to the Federal Reserve. We are\nhonored to have you here today as we host the biennial Interagency Minority Depository\nInstitution (MDI) and Community Development Financial Institution Bank Conference.\nMy colleagues from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and I are especially\nhonored to be hosting you in Los Angeles. As you probably know, all of the previous\nInteragency MDI conferences have been held on the East Coast, mainly in Washington,\nD.C. However, because the largest concentration of minority banks is located here in\nSouthern California, it seemed natural to bring this conference west.\nThe Federal Reserve seeks to support MDIs in a number of ways, including our\nPartnership for Progress, our program for outreach and technical assistance to MDIs.\nBoth the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation share our goal of preserving and promoting MDIs because you are critical\ninstitutions to the communities you serve and the larger U.S. economy. And I note that\nCongress has also recognized your importance, mandating our respective agencies to help\nsupport MDIs. From the perspective of someone who sits on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee, I see many ways that the Federal Reserve can not only support MDIs but is\nitself also supported by them, and I would like to talk about four of these ways today.\nFirst, half of our monetary policy mandate is maximum sustainable employment.\nThat means that we need to be aware of employment trends across all communities in\nAmerica, not just the top-line averages, since unemployment rates vary significantly\nacross races and geographies. For the first time, last year, we put into our Monetary\nPolicy Report to Congress a section that detailed how post-recession economic gains\n\n- 2 -\nhave been distributed across races.1 You, as MDIs, are committed to understanding and\nserving these diverse communities. I know that, for example, your small business loans\nto minority business owners make a difference in the employment rates of minority\ncommunities. I thank you for that work, and we will continue to work closely with you\nto better understand the employment dynamics of underserved and minority\ncommunities.\nSecond, the Fed is unique as a research institution. We have many economists on\nstaff and therefore have the ability to engage in wide-ranging research that may be useful\nto your firms and communities. Specific to MDIs, we commissioned two new research\npapers for this conference to better understand trends in the MDI banking field. In\naddition, we have two new research papers on MDIs out of the Chicago Fed, one that\nexplores MDI primary markets, and one that looks at MDI small business lending.\nTomorrow you’ll have an opportunity to hear about and discuss this new research, which\nwill be finalized later this year.\nThird, we have a great deal of expertise in community banks, which I know most\nof you are. Of the 829 state member banks that the Federal Reserve directly supervises,\n97 percent are community banks. Therefore, we spend a good deal of time thinking\nabout the issues facing community banks and how to help them be competitive in today’s\neconomy. I recognize that as MDIs you share many of the same issues as other\ncommunity banks, and also some issues that are unique to your sector. We want to work\nwith you to better understand those issues and to help you, where possible, to better serve\nyour communities.\n1 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Monetary Policy Report (Washington: Board of\nGovernors, June 21, 2016), www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/20160621_mprfullreport.pdf.\n\n- 3 -\nFourth, and last, the Fed has a unique Community Development function that\nseeks to mobilize ideas, networks, and approaches that address a wide range of\ncommunity and economic development challenges. One thing that makes our\nCommunity Development function unique is that we have deep geographic coverage at\nthe 12 Reserve Banks and their Branch locations. Last year, we combined the resources\nof our Supervision and Regulation division with those of our Community Development\ndepartment to staff our Partnership for Progress. By bringing in Community\nDevelopment, we brought in a new perspective, one that has an explicit focus on low-\nand moderate-income communities. We know that you serve many of these same\nindividuals and communities, and we are asking our Community Development staff\naround the country to reach out to you to gather your perspectives on the communities\nyou serve to identify emerging issues of which we should be aware.\nIn closing, your institutions are important to the American economy and our\nunderstanding of that economy. Therefore, on behalf of the Federal Reserve, I’d like to\nonce again thank you for the work you do in your communities and welcome you to Los\nAngeles.",

Powell\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nReservation Economic Summit 2022\nNational Center for American Indian Enterprise Development\nLas Vegas, Nevada\nMay 24, 2022\n\nGood morning, and welcome. It is a great pleasure to welcome all the attendees\nto RES 2022.\nThe National Center for American Indian Enterprise Development has been a\nstrong and consistent partner to the Federal Reserve, collaborating with us on small\nbusiness COVID surveys, serving on the Leadership Council for the Minneapolis Fed’s\nCenter for Indian Country Development, and moderating our policy webinar series on\ntribal enterprise diversification, just to name a few.\nTrust is earned and developed through relationships. This is particularly\nimportant in Indian Country. The Federal Reserve has built an enduring and sturdy bond\nwith the National Center, and we value that partnership.\nWe are excited to be participating in this year’s conference, learning alongside\nyou. There is undoubtedly more research and engagement to be done on the specific and\nunique economic needs of tribal nations and Indigenous communities. RES 2022 is a\ngreat meeting ground for such collaboration.\nThe best insight and analysis come from people who live and work in\ncommunities and have an inside view of the struggles and opportunities within. The\nFederal Reserve System has made a priority of engaging with leaders and stakeholders on\nopportunities most relevant to tribal economic prosperity. For example, input from tribal\nstakeholders has been invaluable to informing the important work of modernizing the\nCommunity Reinvestment Act, which was incorporated into the recently published\nproposal that we are looking forward to getting comments on. We also value the growing\nrepresentation of tribal voices on our boards of directors and advisory councils at Reserve\nBanks, helping us to better understand economic conditions in Indian Country.\n\n- 2 -\nMany of you are aware of the Center for Indian Country Development (CICD),\nour national institute dedicated to helping tribes reach their full economic potential. We\nare excited to be expanding its capacity to conduct economic research and data analysis\nto support the long-term economic prosperity of Indian Country, in partnership with\nIndian Country. We look forward to CICD’s ongoing collaboration with tribal\ncommunities on research and data.\nAdditionally, an initial St. Louis Fed partnership with the Osage Nation, to\nprovide youth financial education, has led to partnerships with tribal governments across\nthe country that provide personal finance education, often in their Native languages.\nTribal leaders nationwide have also joined recent listening sessions to discuss the impacts\nof inflation. Similar sessions were held on our pandemic response facilities, which were\nadapted after hearing their input.\nOther Federal Reserve partnerships with Indian Country include initiatives on\naccess to credit; Native community development financial institutions; financial\neducation programs tailored to early childhood, secondary, and higher education;\nworkforce development; housing; social services; and elder programs.\nAnd as part of our ongoing effort to deepen our understanding of tribal\neconomies, last year, the Federal Reserve Board announced that we had joined the\nCentral Bank Network for Indigenous Inclusion, along with the Reserve Bank of New\nZealand, the Bank of Canada, and the Reserve Bank of Australia. This is part of our\ncommitment to learning best practices and expanding our international partnerships with\ncentral banks that are similarly invested in supporting Indigenous people and\ncommunities.\n\n- 3 -\nThe Federal Reserve works for all of us, and our research and analysis must\nreflect the specific needs and circumstances of all of our communities. I am grateful for\nour partnership with the National Center for American Indian Enterprise Development,\nand I want to thank you, as well as all our colleagues, advisors, and stakeholders who\nhelp us work toward a stable and inclusive economy for all.\nThank you.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n8:15 p.m. EST\nFebruary 28, 2019\nRecent Economic Developments and Longer-Term Challenges\nRemarks by\nJerome H. Powell\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nCitizens Budget Commission 87th Annual Awards Dinner\nNew York, New York\nFebruary 28, 2019\n\nIt is a pleasure to speak here this evening at the 87th Awards Dinner. Tonight I\nwill start with the near-term outlook for the U.S. economy. Then I will turn to a topic\nthat is inspired by the Citizens Budget Commission’s mission statement, which focuses\non the “well-being of future New Yorkers.” I imagine that future New Yorkers attending\nthis dinner in 50 years may not look back on the near-term outlook in February 2018 as\nvery interesting or important. So, tonight, after a brief review of the here and now, I will\nfocus on an issue that is likely to be of more lasting importance: the need for policies that\nwill support and encourage participation in the labor force, promote longer-term growth\nin our rapidly evolving economy, and spread the benefits of prosperity as widely as\npossible.\nThe State of the Economy and Near-Term Prospects\nBeginning with the here and now, Congress has charged the Federal Reserve with\nachieving maximum employment and stable prices, two objectives that together are\ncalled the dual mandate. I am pleased to say that, judged against these goals, the\neconomy is in a good place. The current economic expansion has been under way for\nalmost 10 years. This long period of growth has pushed the unemployment rate down\nnear historic lows (figure 1). The employment gains have been broad based across all\nracial and ethnic groups and all levels of educational attainment as well as among the\ndisabled (figure 2).1 And while the unemployment rate for African Americans and\nHispanics remains above the rates for whites and Asians, the disparities have narrowed\nappreciably as the economic expansion has continued.\n1 The unemployment rate of those with a disability and between the ages of 16 and 64 fell from more than\n16 percent in 2011 to less than 9 percent in 2018. Meanwhile, their labor force participation rate has been\nrising over the past few years. In 2018, about 8 percent of the population aged 16 to 64 reported\nthemselves as having a disability, and their labor force participation rate was 33 percent.\n\n- 2 -\nNearly all job market indicators are better than a few years ago, and many are at\ntheir most favorable levels in decades. After lagging earlier in the expansion, wages and\noverall compensation--pay plus benefits--are now growing faster than a few years ago\n(figure 3). It is especially encouraging that the labor force participation rate of people in\ntheir prime working years, ages 25 to 54, has been rising for the past three years. More\nplentiful jobs and rising wages are drawing more people into the workforce and\nencouraging others who might have left to stay.\nIn addition, business-sector productivity growth, which had been disappointing\nduring the expansion, moved up in the first three quarters of 2018. Rising productivity\nallows wages to increase without adding to inflation pressures. Sustained productivity\ngrowth is a necessary ingredient for longer-run improvements in living standards.\nThe price stability side of our mandate is also in a good place. After remaining\nbelow our target for several years, inflation by our preferred measure averaged roughly\n2 percent last year (figure 4). Inflation has softened a bit since then, largely reflecting the\nrecent drop in oil prices. Futures markets and other indicators suggest that oil prices are\nunlikely to fall further, and if this proves correct, oil’s drag on overall inflation will\nsubside. Consistent with that view, core inflation, which excludes volatile food and\nenergy prices and often provides a better signal of where inflation is heading, is currently\nrunning just a touch below our 2 percent objective. Signs of upward pressure on inflation\nappear muted despite the strong labor market.\nWhile the data I have discussed so far give a favorable picture of the economy, it\nis also important to acknowledge that not everyone has shared in the benefits of the\nexpansion to the same extent, and that too many households still struggle to make ends\n\n- 3 -\nmeet.2 In addition, over the past few months we have seen some crosscurrents and\nconflicting signals about the near-term outlook. For instance, growth has slowed in some\nmajor economies, particularly China and Europe. Uncertainty is elevated around some\nunresolved government policy issues, including Brexit and ongoing trade negotiations.\nAnd financial conditions have tightened since last fall. While most of the incoming\ndomestic economic data have been solid, some surveys of business and consumer\nsentiment have moved lower. Unexpectedly weak retail sales data for December also\ngive reason for caution.\nGiven the positive outlook but also muted inflation pressures and the\ncrosscurrents I just mentioned, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will be\npatient as we determine what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds\nrate may be appropriate to support our dual-mandate objectives. This common-sense\nrisk-management approach has served the Committee well in the past.\nI will turn now from the near-term outlook to the question of how the economy\nwill perform over the long haul.\nLonger-Term Challenges and Opportunities\nFrom 1991 through 2007, the economy expanded annually at about 3 percent,\nsimilar to the pace for much of second half of the 20th century. Since 2007, however,\ngrowth has averaged just 1.6 percent. If the earlier 3 percent growth had persisted over\nthe past 12 years, incomes today would be almost 20 percent higher than they now are.\n2 For example, a Federal Reserve survey indicates that in early 2018, after nearly a decade of growth, as\nmany as 40 percent of households were unprepared for an emergency expense of as little as $400. Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System (2018), Report on the Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households\n(Washington: Board of Governors, May), available at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20180522a.htm.\n\n- 4 -\nFrom the standpoint of future Americans, if the slower growth persists for a half-century,\nincomes will end up roughly half of what they would have been.\nWhy has growth slowed, and what can we do about it? To understand the causes\nof the slowdown, it is useful to divide growth into two components: (1) growth in the\ncumulative number of hours of worked by all workers and (2) growth in the amount of\noutput derived, on average, from each hour of work. We refer to output per hour of work\nas “labor productivity.” From 1991 through 2007, when the economy expanded at a\n3 percent average rate, hours worked increased about 1 percent a year and economy-wide\nproductivity grew about 2 percent (figure 5).3 Since 2007, both of these growth factors\nhave slowed by about half, with hours worked annually increasing only 0.5 percent from\n2008 to 2018 and productivity rising just 1 percent on average.4\nGrowth in hours worked has slowed, in part, because of slower U.S. population\ngrowth. Birth rates have edged down, and immigration has slowed. Not only is the total\npopulation growing more slowly, but the share of the population in their prime working\nyears is falling steadily as the very large baby-boom generation is moving into retirement.\nDemographic factors are generally slow moving and predictable, and there is no surprise\nin the fact that slower population growth and the retirement of the baby boomers are now\ncontributing to slower growth in the total amount of work performed in the economy.\nThere is another factor contributing to the slower growth in hours, however, and\nthis factor is more surprising and more troubling. To be counted as “in the labor force,” a\n3 These estimates are based on the Congressional Budget Office’s (2019) estimates for potential GDP for\nthe Budget and Economic Outlook: 2019 to 2029 (Washington: CBO, January),\nhttps://www.cbo.gov/publication/54918. Economy-wide productivity includes the nonbusiness sector.\n4 John G. Fernald, Robert E. Hall, James H. Stock, and Mark W. Watson (2017), “The Disappointing\nRecovery of Output after 2009,” NBER Working Paper No. 23543 (Washington: National Bureau of\nEconomic Research, June), https://www.nber.org/papers/w23543.\n\n- 5 -\nperson must either be employed or have looked for work within the past four weeks. The\nshare of people of working age who are actually in the labor force has fallen significantly\nsince the late 1990s. This decline raises the important question of why have people of\nworking age increasingly chosen not to work.\nThe data suggest that there are both positive and more problematic forces at work.\nFor example, among those aged 16 to 24, participation in the labor market has fallen from\nabout 65 percent in the 1990s to 55 percent now (figure 6). But this drop in participation\nappears to reflect young people getting more education. The fraction of this age group\nwho are neither in school nor in the labor force has held fairly constant at around\n11 percent, and measures of school enrollment are up.5 Higher educational attainment is\nmuch more important in today’s job market than in the past, and investing in education\ntoday has long-term benefits for both the student and for society.6 Statistics confirm that\nhigher educational attainment is associated with higher labor force participation, lower\nunemployment, and higher wages.\nTurning to those aged 25 to 54, the participation picture is more troubling.\nAmong prime-age men, participation has been falling for more than 60 years, with the\ndecline averaging about 1.5 percentage points per decade (figure 7). For women,\nparticipation rose over the second half of the 20th century until peaking in the late 1990s.\nSince then, women’s participation has dropped just a bit.\n5 It is also true that a smaller share of students are holding down a job while in school.\n6 For example, see Maria E. Canon, Marianna Kudlyak, and Yang Liu (2015), “Youth Labor Force\nParticipation Continues to Fall, but It Might Be for a Good Reason,” Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis,\nRegional Economist (St. Louis, Mo.: FRB St. Louis, January),\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/regional-economist/january-2015/youth-labor-force.\n\n- 6 -\nTo put these numbers in context, let’s look at data from other advanced\neconomies. Prime-age male participation has fallen some across most of these economies\nsince 1995 (figure 8). But the decline in the United States has been much larger than\nmost, and U.S. participation was below the middle of the pack at the outset. As a result,\nthe United States now has the fourth lowest participation rate among 34 advanced\neconomies. For women’s participation, the details are different, but the bottom line is\nsimilar. In the mid-1990s, the United States ranked in the upper tier for prime-age\nwomen’s participation, but since then participation by women has advanced rapidly in\nmany countries while it has declined slightly in the United States. Now the United States\nis sixth lowest among these 34 countries.\nResearchers have investigated numerous possible reasons for the decline in prime-\nage participation. Among men, the drop in participation is much sharper for those with\nonly a high school education or less. The drop for women is also sharper for those who\nare high school educated. This pattern is consistent with the idea that a modern economy\ndemands ever-higher skills, and that workers without those skills are being left behind\n(figure 9). But the international experience suggests that this outcome is not inevitable:\nThe drop in participation among those with less education is much smaller in some\ncomparable countries than in the United States.7\nThe research into labor force participation in the United States and across the\nworld does not find a magic fix, but it does suggest a variety of policies that might better\nprepare people for the modern workforce as well as support and reward labor force\n7 Mary C. Daly, Joseph H. Pedtke, Nicolas Petrosky-Nadeau, and Annemarie Schweinert (2018), “Why\nAren’t U.S. Workers Working?” Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, FRBSF Economic Letter 2018-24\n(San Francisco: FRB San Francisco, November 13), https://www.frbsf.org/economic-\nresearch/publications/economic-letter/2018/november/why-are-us-workers-not-participating.\n\n- 7 -\nparticipation.8 I should note that the Fed has neither the tools nor the mandate to directly\naddress the forces that are holding back labor force participation. We can contribute by\nfostering a strong labor market, in accordance with our mandate. While it is not the Fed’s\nrole to advocate particular labor force policies, I do want to put a spotlight on this\nimportant issue. I strongly believe policies that bring prime-age workers into productive\nemployment, particularly those who may have been left behind because of low skills or\neducational attainment, could bring great benefits both to those workers and to our\neconomy.\nThe second factor accounting for the slowdown in GDP growth is the slower pace\nof labor productivity growth, or output per hour worked. When measured annually, labor\nproductivity growth is volatile, but focusing on five-year averages, we can see that from\n1975 through 2007, productivity growth averaged about 2 percent while fluctuating\nbetween about 1 and 4 percent (figure 10). Since then, growth seems to have settled at\nthe low end of that historical range. Unlike the situation with labor force participation,\nthe slowdown in productivity growth is also evident in most advanced economies, and the\nU.S. experience is roughly comparable to that of other countries.\nThere is an ongoing debate over the causes and implications of this global\nslowdown in productivity growth. Some argue that the rapid growth seen over much of\nthe 20th century was historically anomalous, and that we are destined to return to the\nslower growth of centuries past. Others are more optimistic that strong growth can\nreturn.\n8 Francesco Grigoli, Zsóka Kóczán, and Petia Topalova (2018), “Labor Force Participation in Advanced\nEconomies: Drivers and Prospects,” chapter 2 in International Monetary Fund, World Economic Outlook\n(Washington: IMF, April), pp. 1-58,\nhttps://www.imf.org/~/media/Files/Publications/WEO/2018/April/c2.ashx.\n\n- 8 -\nMany have noted that during the current expansion, investment and capital\naccumulation have been lower than in previous expansions, so perhaps we just need to\ninvest more. Unfortunately, it does not seem to be that simple. Standard reasoning holds\nthat capital-per-worker drives productivity. While we have had slower capital\naccumulation of late, we have also had slower growth in labor supply--hours worked.\nThus, capital per worker, according to some analysis, has continued to increase roughly at\nits pre-recession trend. In this view, the productivity problem is not simply one of\ninadequate investment.9\nResearchers have proposed several reasons why, even if the quantity of\ninvestment has kept up, recent investment may be leading to smaller productivity\nadvances than in the past. The more optimistic analysts argue that we may be in a\nproductivity lull while businesses work to realize the full benefit of advances that are\nembedded in recent investment.10 Others suggest that productivity-advancing ideas are\ninherently harder to find and exploit than in the past, implying that slower productivity\ngrowth may be with us for the long haul.11 This debate is unlikely to be resolved anytime\nsoon. In the meantime, we should look for policies that will create an environment in\nwhich productivity can flourish.\n9 See Fernald and others, “Disappointing Recovery,” in note 4.\n10 For example, Brynjolfsson, Mitchell, and Rock (2018) highlight the need to make complimentary\ninvestments in intangibles to take advantage of artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies (see\nErik Brynjolfsson, Tom Mitchell, and Daniel Rock (2018), “What Can Machines Learn and What Does It\nMean for Occupations and the Economy?” AEA Papers and Proceedings, vol. 108 (May), pp. 43-47). And\nMokyr (2014) argues that the vast array of computers and other relatively new tools will usher in a new\nwave of progress just like the invention of barometers and microscopes and other tools propelled the\ntechnology in the 1700s (see Joel Mokyr (2014), “The Next Age of Invention,” City Journal, Winter).\n11 Bloom and others (2017) as well as Thompson and Spanuth (2018) discuss how it has become more\ncostly to make technological advances. See Nicholas Bloom, Charles I. Jones, John Van Reenen, and\nMichael Webb (2017), “Are Ideas Getting Harder to Find?” available at\nhttps://web.stanford.edu/~chadj/papers.html; and Neil Thompson and Svenja Spanuth (2018), “The Decline\nof Computers As a General Purpose Technology: Why Deep Learning and the End of Moore’s Law Are\nFragmenting Computing,” available at https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3287769.\n\n- 9 -\nWe need policies that support innovation and create a favorable environment for\ninvestment in both the skills of workers and the tools they have. Indeed, the recent tax\nreforms were designed in part to boost capital investment and thus productivity. Once\nagain, my goal tonight is to highlight the importance of growth-enhancing policies.\nBecause these policies are not the province of the Fed, I will not advocate for particular\napproaches. Instead, I will just observe that researchers and policy analysts have\nproposed many promising ideas that may be capable of attracting wide support. Policies\nthat succeed in enhancing productivity growth would greatly benefit future generations of\nAmericans.\nConclusion\nTo conclude, the United States is currently in the midst of one of the longest\neconomic expansions in our history. Unemployment is low and inflation is close to our\n2 percent objective. My colleagues and I on the FOMC are focused on using our\nmonetary policy tools to sustain those favorable conditions.\nTonight I have also highlighted some longer-term challenges we face, including\nlow labor force participation by prime-age workers and low productivity growth. By\npromoting macroeconomic stability, the Fed helps create a healthy environment for\ngrowth. But these longer-term issues require policies that are more in the province of\nelected representatives. The nation would benefit greatly from a search for policies with\nbroad appeal that could promote labor force participation and higher productivity, with\nbenefits shared broadly across the nation.\n\nRecent Economic Developments and Longer-Term Challenges\nJerome H.

    "text": "Pre-recorded for release on delivery\n9:15 a.m. EDT\nOctober 20, 2015\nThe Evolving Structure of U.S. Treasury Markets\nRemarks by\nJerome H. Powell\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York\nNew York, N.Y.\nOctober 20, 2015\n1\n\nI am pleased to be here with this distinguished group of market participants,\nacademics, government officials, and many others who are vitally interested in the\nissues before us today.1 I am sure that all of us recognize the importance of the\nU.S. Treasury markets to our economy and our financial system; indeed, to the\nworld economy and the global financial system. As Bill just outlined, for the next\ntwo days, we will collectively address the most important questions facing the\nTreasury markets today.2 Are there significant problems in these markets that are\nnot likely to self-correct? More specifically, is liquidity in broad decline, or more\nprone to sudden disappearance? If so, what are the causes? And what are the costs\nand benefits of potential market-led or regulatory responses? The design of this\nconference is to provide a forum for differing perspectives on these issues.\nIt has been one year since the events of October 15, 2014. Appropriately,\nthe conference will begin with a review of the findings of the recent Joint Staff\nReport issued by the U.S. Department of Treasury, the Board of Governors, the\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and\nthe Commodity Futures Trading Commission.3 The report analyzes in depth the\n1 These remarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve Board or\nthe Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 References to the “Treasury markets” refer to the interdealer cash and futures markets, unless otherwise specified.\n3 Joint Staff Report: The U.S. Treasury Market on October 15, 2014, http://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-\nreleases/Documents/Joint_Staff_Report_Treasury_10-15-2015.pdf\n2\n\nunprecedented events and market conditions that day. It also shows clearly how\ndramatically the structure of Treasury markets has changed in recent years. New\nparticipants and new technologies have taken prominent roles in these markets, and\nlong-time market participants have adopted new business models. Today’s\ndiscussions will reflect this altered landscape, with panels on automated trading,\nmarket making, and the impacts that changes in Treasury markets have had on\nliquidity and on end users.\nMy discussions with market participants and regulatory colleagues suggest a\nrange of opinions about Treasury market liquidity. While most market participants\nperceive some reduction in liquidity, views on the severity of the situation seem to\nbe more mixed. Some measures such as trade size and market depth have\ndeclined, and investors today have to employ increasingly sophisticated strategies\nto execute larger trades at a good price. Some other measures show no decline in\noverall market liquidity. However, we need to consider not just the average level\nof liquidity under normal trading conditions, but also the risk that liquidity may be\nmore prone to disappearing at times when it is most needed, as it seemed to do on\nOctober 15.\nThis concern is an important one. Because U.S. Treasury securities reflect\nthe full faith and credit of our government, they are rightly considered risk-free.\nBut the value of any security, even a U.S. Treasury, will reflect not just its inherent\n3\n\ncredit risk but also investors’ faith in the markets where it is traded. We need\ninvestors to have full faith in the structure and functioning of Treasury markets\nthemselves. Treasury markets need to be as safe as the securities that trade on\nthem. Episodes such as October 15, in which Treasury prices fluctuated wildly\nwith no obvious reason, threaten to erode investor confidence. The growing list of\nsimilar events in equity and other markets underscores this concern.\nConfidence in Treasury markets helps to support demand for Treasury\nsecurities and keep our government’s financing costs low. Households and firms\nand even foreign governments hold Treasury securities as a key form of savings in\nno small part because of their trust in their safety and liquidity.\nFinancial firms have particular reasons to care about these markets. Many\ntypes of financial firms are represented here today, with diverse roles within\nTreasury markets. Since before the financial crisis, one of the driving narratives\nwithin financial markets has been the growing demand for safe assets. Many have\nargued that this demand helped to engender the crisis, as a variety of assets came to\nbe accepted as risk-free when in fact they were anything but that. Treasury bills\nand bonds are about the only freely tradeable dollar-denominated assets that really\ncan be called safe. We have a shared interest in guarding against an outcome\nwhere the Treasury market becomes a source of stress, rather than a safe haven in\ntimes of stress.\n4\n\nAnd if declining market function did undermine confidence in Treasury\nsecurities, we would be putting at risk a key source of credit creation. Our\nfinancial system depends on high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) for collateral that is\nused by banks, dealers, CCPs, money market mutual funds, and countless others.\nIf Treasury prices can fluctuate wildly at any time for no or little reason, then over\ntime investors could require higher haircuts and regulators could see a need for\neven more HQLA.\nHow can we protect and strengthen the structure of these markets? In\ntomorrow’s session, several panels will discuss market structure, including\npotential risks to clearing and settlement infrastructure, and ask how current\nstructures might be adapted to provide greater liquidity and better guard against\nliquidity risk.\nI would point to four important trends that have been driving the changing\nstructure of these markets: first, advances in computerized trading and high-speed\ncommunications and the entry of new players using these technologies; second, the\nintensified prudential regulation and supervision of the systemically important\nbanks that are the largest dealers; third, the banks’ own re-evaluation of risk in the\nwake of the financial crisis; and fourth, the increasing importance of mutual funds\nand other asset managers. While markets will always continue to evolve, there is\n5\n\nno reason to think these trends will suddenly reverse. In all likelihood, they are\nhere to stay.\nAlthough post-crisis regulatory changes have likely increased the costs of\nmarket making, markets were already undergoing dramatic changes well before the\ncrisis. High-frequency and algorithmic trading firms already accounted for a large\nand growing share of transactions in the interdealer market, altering the speed and\nnature of market making. As traditional dealers have lost market share, they have\nsought to remain competitive by internalizing a greater share of their customer\ntrades, finding matches between their own customers and keeping those trades off\nthe public interdealer markets. But internalization does not eliminate the need for\na public market, which is where price discovery mainly occurs. Dealers need to\nplace the orders that they cannot internalize onto that market, and at times of\nmarket stress such as on October 15, they will likely need to put most of their\norders onto the public market.\nThe current structure of the trading platforms in both the cash and futures\nmarkets is based on a central limit order book, which provides for continuous\ntrading but also provides strong incentives to be the fastest. There may be\nadaptations of this market structure that could give greater emphasis to liquidity\nprovision rather than a never-ending competition for more speed. Some of the\npanelists we’ll hear from tomorrow argue that it may be possible to do so, for\n6\n\nexample by considering frequent batch auctions as an alternative to the central\nlimit order book, or by placing minimum time limits on orders. Ideas such as these\nmake me wonder whether it might collectively be possible to come to a\ncompromise in which more trading is done directly on the public market, if at the\nsame time the public market rules were adjusted to emphasize greater liquidity\nprovision, and particularly more stable liquidity provision, over speed. Perhaps\npublic-private forums such as this conference can help in achieving that type of\ncooperative approach. I look forward to hearing views on these ideas tomorrow.\nTreasury repo markets have also been undergoing structural changes. This\nis a good time to look at potential changes to the clearance and settlement\ninfrastructure in these markets, as we will discuss tomorrow afternoon. We should\ntake this opportunity to ask whether current market structures are well-suited to the\nnew environment, or whether we should be aiming for a substantially different\napproach in the longer run. There is a tight link between funding liquidity in repo\nmarkets and market liquidity in cash and futures markets, so a healthy, liquid repo\nmarket is essential to the overall health of the market. However, regulatory\nchanges have made repo activity more expensive.4 There are currently a number of\nprivate proposals to expand the use of central clearing for repo markets that could\n4 Regulatory efforts have also made tri-party repo infrastructure considerably safer by sharply reducing the market’s\nreliance on discretionary extensions of intraday credit by the clearing banks and fostering improvements in market\nparticipants’ liquidity and credit risk-management practices.\n7\n\nhelp to reduce those costs. Since the crisis, reforms have supported greater use of\nclearing for a wide range of products, and I believe that greater clearing in\nTreasury repo markets could be beneficial.\nThe conference will conclude tomorrow with a discussion of regulatory\nrequirements in Treasury markets. Many point to post-crisis regulation as a key\nfactor driving any recent decline in liquidity. Although regulation seems to have\nhad little to do with the events of October 15, I would agree that it is one factor\ndriving recent changes in market making. The same regulations have also greatly\nstrengthened the major banks and made another financial crisis far less likely. In\nmy view, we should be prepared to accept some increase in the cost of market\nmaking in order to improve our overall financial stability. That said, these\nregulations are new, and we should be willing to learn from experience.\nRegulatory requirements for Treasury markets may need to change over time to\nreflect a rapidly evolving market environment.\nMarkets will adapt to new regulation and other developments. We all have a\nresponsibility to make sure that market and regulatory incentives appropriately\nencourage an evolution that will enhance market liquidity and functioning. I’ve\nbeen eagerly looking forward to this conference, in the belief that our discussions\nhere can do just that.\n8\n\n9",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n10:00 a.m. EDT (8:00 a.m. MDT)\nAugust 26, 2022\nMonetary Policy and Price Stability\nRemarks by\nJerome H. Powell\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Reassessing Constraints on the Economy and Policy,” an economic policy symposium\nsponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\nJackson Hole, Wyoming\nAugust 26, 2022\n\nThank you for the opportunity to speak here today.\nAt past Jackson Hole conferences, I have discussed broad topics such as the ever-\nchanging structure of the economy and the challenges of conducting monetary policy\nunder high uncertainty. Today, my remarks will be shorter, my focus narrower, and my\nmessage more direct.\nThe Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) overarching focus right now is\nto bring inflation back down to our 2 percent goal. Price stability is the responsibility of\nthe Federal Reserve and serves as the bedrock of our economy. Without price stability,\nthe economy does not work for anyone. In particular, without price stability, we will not\nachieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. The burdens\nof high inflation fall heaviest on those who are least able to bear them.\nRestoring price stability will take some time and requires using our tools\nforcefully to bring demand and supply into better balance. Reducing inflation is likely to\nrequire a sustained period of below-trend growth. Moreover, there will very likely be\nsome softening of labor market conditions. While higher interest rates, slower growth,\nand softer labor market conditions will bring down inflation, they will also bring some\npain to households and businesses. These are the unfortunate costs of reducing inflation.\nBut a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain.\nThe U.S. economy is clearly slowing from the historically high growth rates of\n2021, which reflected the reopening of the economy following the pandemic recession.\nWhile the latest economic data have been mixed, in my view our economy continues to\nshow strong underlying momentum. The labor market is particularly strong, but it is\nclearly out of balance, with demand for workers substantially exceeding the supply of\n\n- 2 -\navailable workers. Inflation is running well above 2 percent, and high inflation has\ncontinued to spread through the economy. While the lower inflation readings for July are\nwelcome, a single month’s improvement falls far short of what the Committee will need\nto see before we are confident that inflation is moving down.\nWe are moving our policy stance purposefully to a level that will be sufficiently\nrestrictive to return inflation to 2 percent. At our most recent meeting in July, the FOMC\nraised the target range for the federal funds rate to 2.25 to 2.5 percent, which is in the\nSummary of Economic Projection’s (SEP) range of estimates of where the federal funds\nrate is projected to settle in the longer run. In current circumstances, with inflation\nrunning far above 2 percent and the labor market extremely tight, estimates of longer-run\nneutral are not a place to stop or pause.\nJuly’s increase in the target range was the second 75 basis point increase in as\nmany meetings, and I said then that another unusually large increase could be appropriate\nat our next meeting. We are now about halfway through the intermeeting period. Our\ndecision at the September meeting will depend on the totality of the incoming data and\nthe evolving outlook. At some point, as the stance of monetary policy tightens further, it\nlikely will become appropriate to slow the pace of increases.\nRestoring price stability will likely require maintaining a restrictive policy stance\nfor some time. The historical record cautions strongly against prematurely loosening\npolicy. Committee participants’ most recent individual projections from the June SEP\nshowed the median federal funds rate running slightly below 4 percent through the end of\n2023. Participants will update their projections at the September meeting.\n\n- 3 -\nOur monetary policy deliberations and decisions build on what we have learned\nabout inflation dynamics both from the high and volatile inflation of the 1970s and\n1980s, and from the low and stable inflation of the past quarter-century. In particular, we\nare drawing on three important lessons.\nThe first lesson is that central banks can and should take responsibility for\ndelivering low and stable inflation. It may seem strange now that central bankers and\nothers once needed convincing on these two fronts, but as former Chairman Ben\nBernanke has shown, both propositions were widely questioned during the Great Inflation\nperiod.1 Today, we regard these questions as settled. Our responsibility to deliver price\nstability is unconditional. It is true that the current high inflation is a global phenomenon,\nand that many economies around the world face inflation as high or higher than seen here\nin the United States. It is also true, in my view, that the current high inflation in the\nUnited States is the product of strong demand and constrained supply, and that the Fed’s\ntools work principally on aggregate demand. None of this diminishes the Federal\nReserve’s responsibility to carry out our assigned task of achieving price stability. There\nis clearly a job to do in moderating demand to better align with supply. We are\ncommitted to doing that job.\nThe second lesson is that the public’s expectations about future inflation can play\nan important role in setting the path of inflation over time. Today, by many measures,\nlonger-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored. That is broadly true\nof surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, and of market-based measures as\n1 See Ben Bernanke (2004), “The Great Moderation,” speech delivered at the meetings of the Eastern\nEconomic Association, Washington, February 20,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2004/20040220; Ben Bernanke (2022), “Inflation Isn’t\nGoing to Bring Back the 1970s,” New York Times, June 14.\n\n- 4 -\nwell. But that is not grounds for complacency, with inflation having run well above our\ngoal for some time.\nIf the public expects that inflation will remain low and stable over time, then,\nabsent major shocks, it likely will. Unfortunately, the same is true of expectations of\nhigh and volatile inflation. During the 1970s, as inflation climbed, the anticipation of\nhigh inflation became entrenched in the economic decisionmaking of households and\nbusinesses. The more inflation rose, the more people came to expect it to remain high,\nand they built that belief into wage and pricing decisions. As former Chairman Paul\nVolcker put it at the height of the Great Inflation in 1979, “Inflation feeds in part on\nitself, so part of the job of returning to a more stable and more productive economy must\nbe to break the grip of inflationary expectations.”2\nOne useful insight into how actual inflation may affect expectations about its\nfuture path is based in the concept of “rational inattention.”3 When inflation is\npersistently high, households and businesses must pay close attention and incorporate\ninflation into their economic decisions. When inflation is low and stable, they are freer to\nfocus their attention elsewhere. Former Chairman Alan Greenspan put it this way: “For\nall practical purposes, price stability means that expected changes in the average price\nlevel are small enough and gradual enough that they do not materially enter business and\nhousehold financial decisions.”4\n2 See Paul A.

    "text": "For release on delivery\n2:30 p.m. EDT\nJune 21, 2016\nIntroductory Comments\nRemarks by\nJerome H. Powell\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nRoundtable on the Interim Report of the Alternative Reference Rates Committee\nsponsored by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York\nNew York, New York\nJune 21, 2016\n\nI want to thank you all for coming today, and I also want to thank the Alternative\nReference Rates Committee (ARRC) for all its work in developing its interim report. This report\nmarks a new stage in reference rate reform.1 Reference benchmarks are a key part of the\nfinancial infrastructure. About $300 trillion dollars in contracts reference LIBOR alone. But\nbenchmarks were not given much consideration prior to the recent scandals involving attempts to\nmanipulate them. Since then, the official sector has thought seriously about financial\nbenchmarks, conducting a number of investigations into charges of manipulation, publishing the\nInternational Organization of Securities Commission’s (IOSCO) Principles for Financial\nBenchmarks and, through the Financial Stability Board (FSB), sponsoring major reform efforts\nof both interest rate and foreign exchange benchmarks.2 The institutions represented on the\nARRC have also had to think seriously about these issues as they have developed this interim\nreport. Now, we need end users to begin to think more seriously about how they use benchmarks\nand the risks they are taking on by relying so heavily on a reference rate--in this case U.S. dollar\nLIBOR--that is less resilient than it needs to be.\nIn saying this, I want to make it clear that LIBOR has been significantly improved. ICE\nBenchmark Administration is in the process of making important changes to its methodology,\nand submissions to LIBOR are now regulated by the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct\nAuthority. However, the term money market borrowing by banks that underlies U.S. dollar\nLIBOR has experienced a secular decline. As a result, the majority of U.S. dollar LIBOR\nsubmissions must still rely on expert judgement, and even those submissions that are transaction-\n1 See Alternative Reference Rates Committee (2016), Interim Report and Consultation (New York: ARRC, May),\nhttps://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/microsites/arrc/files/2016/arrc-interim-report-and-consultation.pdf?la=en.\n2 For more information on the IOSCO principles, see Board of the International Organization of Securities\nCommissions (2013), Principles for Financial Benchmarks: Final Report (Madrid: IOSCO, July),\nwww.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD415.pdf\n2\n\nbased may be based on relatively few actual trades. This calls into question whether LIBOR can\nultimately satisfy IOSCO Principle 7 regarding data sufficiency, which requires that a\nbenchmark be based on an active market. That Principle is a particularly important one, as it is\ndifficult to ask banks to submit rates at which they believe they could borrow on a daily basis if\nthey do not actually borrow very often.\nThat basic fact poses the risk that LIBOR could eventually be forced to stop publication\nentirely. Ongoing regulatory reforms and changing market structures raise questions about\nwhether the transactions underlying LIBOR will become even scarcer in the future, particularly\nin periods of stress, and banks might feel little incentive to contribute to U.S. dollar LIBOR\npanels if transactions become less frequent. Market participants are not used to thinking about\nthis possibility, but benchmarks sometimes come to a halt. The sudden cessation of a benchmark\nas heavily used as LIBOR would present significant systemic risks. It could entail substantial\nlosses and would create substantial uncertainty, potential legal challenges, and payments\ndisruptions for the market participants that have relied on LIBOR. These disruptions would be\neven greater if there were no viable alternative to U.S. dollar LIBOR that market participants\ncould quickly move to.\nThese concerns led the FSB and Financial Stability Oversight Council to call for the\npromotion of alternatives to LIBOR, and led the Federal Reserve to convene the ARRC in\ncooperation with the U.S. Treasury Department, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission,\nand Office of Financial Research. LIBOR is currently the dominant reference rate in the market\nbecause of its liquidity. We are not under any illusions that moving a significant portion of\ntrading to an alternative rate will be simple or easy. But I believe the ARRC has provided a\n3\n\nworkable and credible plan for creating liquidity in a new rate and beginning the process of\nmoving trading to it.\nWe need input from end users and others to finalize the ARRC’s plans, and I look\nforward to hearing the views of those in attendance. Successful implementation will require a\ncoordinated effort from a broad set of market participants. This effort will certainly entail costs,\nbut continued reliance on U.S. dollar LIBOR on the current scale could entail much higher costs\nif unsecured short-term borrowing declines further and submitting banks choose to leave the\nLIBOR panels, especially if there were no viable alternative rate. Simply put, this effort is\nsomething that needs to happen, and if the ARRC members, the official sector, and end users and\nother market participants all jointly coordinate in finalizing these plans, then a successful\ntransition can be made with the least disruption to the market, leaving everyone in a better place.\n4",

Powell\nChairman\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Price and Wage-Setting in Advanced Economies,”\nan ECB Forum on Central Banking\nSintra, Portugal\nJune 20, 2018\n\nNine years into an expansion that has sometimes proceeded slowly, the U.S.\neconomy is performing very well. Growth is meaningfully above most estimates of its\nlong-term trend--though admittedly, that trend is not as strong as we would like it to be.\nThe labor market is particularly robust, with unemployment at its lowest level since April\n2000. Inflation has moved up close to our 2 percent objective, although we have yet to\nsee it remain near that objective on a sustained basis.\nToday, most Americans who want jobs can find them. High demand for workers\nshould support wage growth and labor force participation--the latter a measure on which\nthe United States now lags most other advanced economies.1 A tight labor market may\nalso lead businesses to invest more in technology and training, which should support\nproductivity growth. And groups such as some racial and ethnic minorities that still have\nhigher unemployment and lower participation rates could see increasing benefits from a\ntight labor market.2 In short, there is a lot to like about low unemployment.\nAchieving our statutory goal of maximum employment in a context of price\nstability and financial stability is both our responsibility and our challenge. Earlier in the\nexpansion, as the economy recovered, the need for highly accommodative monetary\npolicy was clear. But with unemployment low and expected to decline further, inflation\nclose to our objective, and the risks to the outlook roughly balanced, the case for\ncontinued gradual increases in the federal funds rate is strong.\n1 See Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (2018), Economic Survey of the United\nStates 2018 (Paris: OECD), www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-united-states.htm.\n2 These groups tend to both suffer most from labor market downturns and benefit most from improving\nlabor markets.\n\n- 2 -\nCurrent Labor Market Conditions\nAt 3.8 percent, the unemployment rate is below most estimates of its long-run\nlevel, which are now clustered in the mid-4s. Many other labor market indicators also\nsuggest an economy near full employment. To name just a few, these indicators include\nan elevated level of job vacancies. For the first time since the Labor Department began\ncollecting the data in 2000, there are now more job vacancies than there are people\ncounted as unemployed. In addition, the rate at which workers are quitting their jobs is\nelevated, a sign that workers are able to find another job when they seek one. And\nsurveys show that businesses are finding it difficult to fill vacancies, and that households\nperceive jobs as plentiful.\nSome other indicators are less clear. The labor force participation rate of prime-\nage workers has moved up in recent years but remains below pre-crisis levels.3 In\naddition, wage growth has been moderate, consistent with low productivity growth but\nalso an indication that the labor market is not excessively tight.\nLooking ahead, the job market is likely to strengthen further. Real gross domestic\nproduct in the United States is now reported to have risen 2-3/4 percent over the past four\nquarters, well above most estimates of its long-run trend. Expansionary fiscal policy is\nexpected to add to aggregate demand over the next few years. Many forecasters expect\nthe unemployment rate to fall into the mid-3s and to remain there for an extended period.\nIf that comes to pass, it will mean the lowest unemployment in the United States since the\nlate 1960s.\n3 The labor force participation rate is defined as the number of people either with a job or who have actively\nlooked for work within the past four weeks, as a share of the total population. Prime-age refers to\nindividuals from 25 to 54 years old.\n\n- 3 -\nA historical comparison\nBecause we have so little experience with very low unemployment, it is\ninteresting to compare today’s labor market with that earlier period. Unemployment was\nbelow 4 percent from February 1966 through January 1970. During that time, inflation as\nmeasured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures increased from\nbelow 2 percent in 1965 to about 5 percent in 1970. In hindsight, unemployment is now\nwidely thought to have been unsustainably low at that time and to have contributed to\nescalating inflation.\nBut how significant is this precedent for today? The U.S. economy has changed\nin many ways over the past 50 years. By some estimates, the natural rate of\nunemployment is substantially lower now.4 For example, the Congressional Budget\nOffice now estimates that the natural rate was about 5-3/4 percent (and rising) in the late\n1960s, compared with 4-3/4 percent at present.5\nRising education levels do point to a decline in the natural rate since the 1960s,\nbecause more highly educated people are less likely to be unemployed. The share of the\npopulation with a college degree has risen from less than 15 percent in the late 1960s to\nnearly 40 percent now, and the share with less than a high school degree has declined\n4 The natural rate of unemployment is the unemployment rate over the longer term that is consistent with\nlow and stable inflation. It comprises both the “frictional” unemployment of people who are temporarily\nbetween jobs or searching as they have reentered the labor force and the more “structural” unemployment\nof people whose skills or physical location are not a good match for the jobs available. For more\ndiscussion, see Janet L. Yellen (2017), “The Goals of Monetary Policy and How We Pursue Them,” speech\ndelivered at the Commonwealth Club, San Francisco, January 18,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/yellen20170118a.htm.\n5 Contemporaneous estimates of the natural rate (or “full employment”) from the late 1960s were lower\nthan current estimates for that period. For example, the Economic Report of the President from 1968\ndefined potential output as occurring when the unemployment rate is 4 percent. See Executive Office of\nthe President of the United States (1968), Economic Report of the President (Washington: U.S.\nGovernment Printing Office, February), p. 61, http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/economic_reports/1968.pdf.\n\n- 4 -\nfrom 45 percent to about 5 percent.6 Another important difference from the 1960s is that\ninflation has been low and stable for an extended period, which has better anchored\ninflation expectations. Today policymakers have a greater appreciation of the role\nexpectations play in inflation dynamics and a clearer commitment to maintaining low and\nstable inflation.\nUnfortunately, with the passage of a half-century and important changes in the\nstructure of our economy and in central bank practices, in my view the historical\ncomparison does not shed as much light as we might have hoped.\nQuestions prompted by a tight labor market\nThe lack of useful historical precedent leaves us with some uncertainty about the\nanswers to several important and challenging questions. First, estimates of the natural\nrate of unemployment by Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants and\nothers have drifted lower as unemployment has declined without much apparent reaction\nfrom inflation. How reliable are these estimates? Natural rate estimates have always\nbeen uncertain, and may be even more so now as inflation has become less responsive to\nthe unemployment rate.7 The anchoring of expectations is a welcome development and\n6 Other changes in the workforce since the late 1960s seem less likely to have much affected the natural\nrate of unemployment. There are many more women in the workforce now, but while women used to have\nhigher unemployment rates than men, that is no longer the case. And while younger workers tend to have\nless stable employment patterns and higher unemployment rates than older workers, the working\npopulation is, on net, only a little bit older now than it was in the late 1960s. (The average age of people in\nthe workforce declined through the 1970s as more of the baby-boom generation entered their working\nyears, but it increased subsequently.)\n7 For evidence on the changing effects of labor market utilization on inflation, internationally as well as in\nthe United States, see Olivier Blanchard, Eugenio Cerutti, and Lawrence Summers (2015), “Inflation and\nActivity--Two Explorations and Their Monetary Policy Implications,” in Inflation and Unemployment in\nEurope, proceedings of the 2015 ECB Forum on Central Banking (Sintra, Portugal: European Central\nBank), pp. 25-46,\nwww.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/ecbforumoncentralbanking2015en.pdf. Regarding uncertainty about\nestimates of the natural rate, a classic reference is Douglas Staiger, James H. Stock, and Mark W. Watson\n(1997), “How Precise Are Estimates of the Natural Rate of Unemployment?” in Christina D. Romer and\n\n- 5 -\nhas likely played a role in flattening the Phillips curve. But a flatter Phillips curve makes\nit harder to assess whether movements in inflation reflect the cyclical position of the\neconomy or other influences.\nSecond, what would be the consequences for inflation if unemployment were to\nrun well below the natural rate for an extended period? The flat Phillips curve suggests\nthat the implications for inflation might not be large, although a very tight labor market\ncould lead to larger, nonlinear effects. Research on this question is ambiguous, again\nreflecting the limited historical experience.8 We should also remember that where\ninflation expectations are well anchored, it is likely because central banks have kept\ninflation under control. If central banks were instead to try to exploit the\nnonresponsiveness of inflation to low unemployment and push resource utilization\nsignificantly and persistently past sustainable levels, the public might begin to question\nour commitment to low inflation, and expectations could come under upward pressure.\nSo far, we see no signs of this. If anything, some measures of longer-term inflation\nexpectations in the United States have edged lower in recent years.\nThird, can persistently strong economic conditions pose financial stability risks?\nOf course, strong economic conditions are a good thing! Such conditions can make the\nfinancial system better able to absorb shocks through strong balance sheets and investor\nconfidence. But we have often seen confidence become overconfidence and lead to\nexcessive borrowing and risk-taking, leaving the financial system more vulnerable.\nDavid H. Romer, eds., Reducing Inflation: Motivation and Strategy (Chicago: University of Chicago\nPress), pp. 195-246.\n8 For one recent example, see Nathan R. Babb and Alan K. Detmeister (2017), “Nonlinearities in the\nPhillips Curve for the United States: Evidence Using Metropolitan Data,” Finance and Economics\nDiscussion Series 2017-070 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, June),\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2017.070.\n\n- 6 -\nIndeed, the fact that the two most recent U.S. recessions stemmed principally from\nfinancial imbalances, not high inflation, highlights the importance of closely monitoring\nfinancial conditions. Today I see U.S. financial stability vulnerabilities as moderate and\nbroadly in line with their long-run averages. While some asset prices are high by\nhistorical standards, I do not see broad signs of excessive borrowing or leverage. In\naddition, banks have far greater levels of capital and liquidity than before the crisis.\nFourth, while persistently strong economic conditions can pose risks to inflation\nand perhaps financial stability, we can also ask whether there may be lasting benefits. As\nI mentioned, a tight labor market could draw more people into the labor force. In fact, as\nthe labor market has tightened, more workers have been moving back to work and off\ndisability rolls.9 There could also be benefits to productivity and potential growth. All\ntold, though, the persistence of any such “positive hysteresis” benefits is uncertain, since,\nagain, the historical evidence is sparse and inconclusive.\nConclusion\nAs is often the case, in the current environment, significant uncertainty attends the\nprocess of making monetary policy. Today, with the economy strong and risks to the\noutlook balanced, the case for continued gradual increases in the federal funds rate\nremains strong and broadly supported among FOMC participants.\n9 See Ernie Tedeschi (2018), “Will Employment Keep Growing?

Powell\nChairman\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“350 years of Central Banking: The Past, the Present and the Future”\nA Sveriges Riksbank anniversary conference\nsponsored by the Riksbank and the Riksdag\nStockholm, Sweden\nMay 25, 2018\n\nThank you for inviting me here to celebrate this important milestone. Today is a\nspecial day for all of us, since the founding of the Riksbank 350 years ago marked the\nbeginning of central banking.1 As we meet to discuss the challenges and opportunities\nthe future may hold, it is worth pausing to note that the three and a half centuries since\nthe Riksbank’s founding have seen economic growth and dynamism the breadth and\nduration of which have been unprecedented in world history. The Swedish innovation we\ncelebrate today, I believe, is a vital part of the financial foundations that support the\ncontinuation of rising prosperity.\nIn my comments today, I will explore the road ahead for public transparency and\naccountability of central banks in a time of intense scrutiny and declining trust in public\ninstitutions in many places around the world. As you know, the importance of\ntransparency and accountability to monetary policymaking was recognized and became\nfirmly entrenched in practice over the past few decades. The Riksbank has been a leader\nin this transparency revolution. Today I will focus on the less-often emphasized but\ncritically important role transparency and accountability play in regulatory and financial\nstability policies.\nTo preview my conclusions, public transparency and accountability around both\nfinancial stability and monetary policy have become all the more important in light of the\nextraordinary actions taken by central banks in response to the Global Financial Crisis.\nFinancial stability policymaking has evolved from managing individual crises as they\narise to establishing a policy framework that emphasizes prevention. This framework\nnow includes measures to increase the resiliency of the financial system; enhanced\n1 See Bordo (2007).\n\n- 2 -\nmonitoring of financial institutions and of building risks to the system; and measures,\nsuch as resolution planning, that require firms to take steps today to better prepare for\nfuture episodes of stress. These innovations have placed special demands on\ntransparency and accountability, and we have worked hard to explain them to the public.\nThe framework is still evolving, and we will need to be open to making changes and to\nnew ways to enhance transparency and accountability.\nGovernment, Central Banking, and Independence\nThis is a challenging moment for central banking. Opinion polls show that trust\nin government and public institutions is at historic lows.2 In this environment, central\nbanks cannot take our measure of independence for granted.\nFor monetary policy, the case for central bank independence rests on the\ndemonstrated benefits of insulating monetary policy decisions from shorter-term political\nconsiderations. But for a quarter century, inflation has been low and inflation\nexpectations anchored. We must not forget the lessons of the past, when a lack of central\nbank independence led to episodes of runaway inflation and subsequent economic\ncontractions.\nAs for financial stability, the crisis and the severe recession that followed revealed\nserious flaws at many private and public institutions, including shortcomings in\nsupervision and regulation. The crisis and its aftermath led central banks to take\nextraordinary actions, actions that challenged the ingenuity of experts in the field and\nwere understandably difficult to explain and justify to a skeptical public. While these\nactions were authorized by law and on the whole necessary to avert the complete collapse\n2 For example, see Pew Research Center (2017).\n\n- 3 -\nof the financial system’s ability to service households and businesses, they may have also\ncontributed to the erosion of public trust.\nCentral banks are assigned narrow but important mandates. For monetary policy,\nthe Fed’s mandate is to keep inflation low and stable and to achieve maximum\nemployment. For financial sector supervision and regulation, part of our mandate is to\nfoster the safety and soundness of individual institutions. In addition, we have a\nresponsibility, shared with other government agencies, to promote financial stability. I\nview this responsibility as being highly complementary to other aspects of our mission:\nFinancial stability promotes sustainable economic growth, and a stable, well-functioning\nfinancial system is an effective transmission channel for monetary policy. Indeed, there\ncan be no macroeconomic stability without financial stability.\nWithin our narrow mandates, to safeguard against political interference, central\nbanks are afforded instrument independence--that is, we are given considerable freedom\nto choose the means to achieve legislatively-assigned goals. While the focus is often on\nmonetary policy independence, research suggests that a degree of independence in\nregulatory and financial stability matters improves the stability of the banking system and\nleads to better outcomes.3 For this reason, governments in many countries, including the\nUnited States, have granted some institutional and budgetary independence to their\nfinancial regulators.\n3 Technical implementation and oversight are two areas where instrument independence may be especially\nhelpful. See Hogue, Labonte, and Webel (2017) and the references therein. Also, the need for some\nregulatory independence is not exclusive to the central bank; see Bernanke (2017) for a discussion.\n\n- 4 -\nFinancial Stability, Transparency and Accountability\nIn a democratic system, any degree of independence brings with it the obligation\nto provide appropriate transparency. In turn, transparency provides an essential basis for\naccountability and democratic legitimacy by enabling effective legislative oversight and\nkeeping the public informed.4 Of course, central banks also need to stick closely to our\nmandates; the case for independence weakens to the extent that central banks stray into\nissues that the legislature has not assigned to us.5\nThere is also an important policy effectiveness argument in favor of transparency.\nIn the financial stability arena, there is no better example of this than the role that the first\nround of stress tests played during the crisis in restoring confidence in the U.S. banking\nsystem.6 So in the financial stability realm, the case for enhanced transparency is not just\nabout being accountable; it is also about providing credible information that can help\nrestore and sustain public confidence in the financial system.\nThe post-crisis regulatory system recognizes the importance of enhanced\ntransparency, both about financial institutions themselves and about the processes and\nexpectations of regulators and supervisors. Before the crisis, supervision focused on the\nsafety and soundness of individual institutions and was insufficiently attentive to risk in\nthe financial system as a whole. Supervisory judgments about firms were shared with the\npublic only in rare and exceptional circumstances. Financial stability tools were\ndeployed after the fact, to address specific events that emerged to threaten stability. It is\nan understatement to say that this approach proved inadequate in the crisis.\n4 See Kaufmann and Weber (forthcoming).\n5 See Goodhart and Lastra (2017).\n6 See Bernanke (2013).\n\n- 5 -\nThe post-crisis regime has shifted to implementing preventive policies well in\nadvance of any crisis.7 Newly established ex ante policies include building the resilience\nof institutions by requiring more and higher-quality capital and liquidity buffers; a regime\nof stress tests undertaken by supervisors; and resolution planning, which requires firms to\nanalyze their own potential for distress or failure and create a plan to be used in the event\nof bankruptcy. These post-crisis policies have benefitted from public solicitation of\nfeedback and in many cases from consideration in open meetings of the Board of\nGovernors.\nTransparency and incorporation of public feedback in these areas have produced\nmore effective supervision and regulation. For example, transparent and clearly\ncommunicated policies make it easier for regulated entities to know what is expected of\nthem and how best to comply. Of course, as with any large-scale, complex undertaking,\nthe standards adopted over the past decade can undoubtedly be improved. At the Fed, we\nare committed to transparency as we assess the efficacy and efficiency of post-crisis\nreforms.\nIn a sense, stress testing is itself a step forward in transparency. Pre-crisis,\nsupervisors’ views of the risks facing our most systemically important firms--and the\nfirms’ ability to understand and survive these risks--were shrouded in secrecy. Post-\ncrisis, as part of our stress-testing regime, these supervisory views and expectations are\ntransparent. We expect that these firms will have capital, liquidity, and risk-management\ncapabilities that are adequate for the firms not only to survive, but to continue to perform\ntheir key functions even in the event of truly severe stress, akin to the global financial\n7 See Tucker (2017).\n\n- 6 -\ncrisis. We make a great deal of information regarding the stress tests public, including\nthe scenarios we use, portfolio-level projected losses for participating firms, and, of\ncourse, the results. We have also proposed for public comment a range of ways to further\nenhance the transparency of the supervisory stress tests. This detailed disclosure\nprovides the public with a wealth of information on how these institutions would perform\nunder severe stress. And this transparency both enhances public confidence and holds\nbanking regulators accountable for their judgments.\nAt the Federal Reserve we use a variety of additional means to enhance public\nunderstanding of our supervisory and financial stability efforts and judgments. The\nBoard’s Vice Chairman for Supervision testifies before the Congress twice a year. The\nBoard staff’s assessment of financial stability is discussed four times a year at Federal\nOpen Market Committee meetings, and these discussions are summarized in the\nmeeting’s published minutes. And, since 2013, the semiannual Monetary Policy Report\nto the Congress has contained a review of financial stability conditions.\nThe Way Forward\nThe post-crisis framework remains novel and unfamiliar. Some of these new\npolicies, such as stress testing and resolution planning, are inherently complex and\nchallenging for all involved. As a result, transparency and accountability around\nfinancial stability tools present particular challenges. We will continue to strive to find\nbetter ways to enhance transparency around our approach to preserving financial stability.\nEfforts to engage with the public--including consumer groups, academics, and the\nfinancial sector--are likely to lead to improved policies. Moreover, ongoing dialogue will\nwork to enhance public trust, as well as our ability to adapt to new threats as they emerge.\n\n- 7 -\nThere is every reason to expect that technology and communications will continue\nto rapidly evolve, and to affect the financial system and financial stability in ways that we\ncannot fully anticipate. While future innovations may well improve the delivery of\nfinancial services and make the system stronger, they may also contain the seeds of\npotential future systemic vulnerabilities. We will need to keep up with the pace of\ninnovation, which will doubtless require changes to our approach to financial stability.\nAs we consider such changes, it will remain critically important to provide transparency\nand accountability. By doing so, we strengthen the foundation of democratic legitimacy\nthat enables central banks to serve the needs of our citizens, in the long and proud\ntradition of the Riksbank.\n\n- 8 -\nReferences\nBernanke, Ben S.

    "text": "For release on delivery\n12.30 PM EDT\nMarch 21, 2022\nRestoring Price Stability\nRemarks by\nJerome H. Powell\nChair Pro Tempore\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Policy Options for Sustainable and Inclusive Growth”\n38th Annual Economic Policy Conference\nNational Association for Business Economics\nWashington, D.C.\nMarch 21, 2022\n\nThank you for the opportunity to speak with you today.\nLet me first pause to recognize the millions who are suffering the tragic\nconsequences of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\nAt the Federal Reserve, our monetary policy is guided by the dual mandate to\npromote maximum employment and stable prices. From that standpoint, the current\npicture is plain to see: The labor market is very strong, and inflation is much too high.\nMy colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship,\nespecially on those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and\ntransportation. There is an obvious need to move expeditiously to return the stance of\nmonetary policy to a more neutral level, and then to move to more restrictive levels if that\nis what is required to restore price stability. We are committed to restoring price stability\nwhile preserving a strong labor market.\nAt our meeting that concluded last week, we took several steps in pursuit of these\ngoals: We raised our policy interest rate for the first time since the start of the pandemic\nand said that we anticipate that ongoing rate increases will be appropriate to reach our\nobjectives. We also said that we expect to begin reducing the size of our balance sheet at\na coming meeting. In my press conference, I noted that action could come as soon as our\nnext meeting in May, though that is not a decision that we have made. These actions,\nalong with the adjustments we have made since last fall, represent a substantial firming in\nthe stance of policy with the intention of restoring price stability. In my comments today,\nI will first discuss the economic conditions that warrant these actions and then address the\npath ahead for monetary policy.\n\n- 2 -\nThe Labor Market Is Very Strong and Extremely Tight\nTo begin with employment, in the last few years of the historically long expansion\nthat ended with the arrival of the pandemic, we saw the remarkable benefits of an\nextended period of strong labor market conditions. We seek to foster another long\nexpansion in order to realize those benefits again.\nThe labor market has substantial momentum. Employment growth powered\nthrough the difficult Omicron wave, adding 1.75 million jobs over the past three months.\nThe unemployment rate has fallen to 3.8 percent, near historical lows, and has reached\nthis level much faster than anticipated by most forecasters (figure 1). While disparities in\nemployment remain, job growth has been widespread across racial, ethnic, and\ndemographic groups.\nBy many measures, the labor market is extremely tight, significantly tighter than\nthe very strong job market just before the pandemic. There are far more job openings\ngoing unfilled today than before the pandemic, despite today’s unemployment rate being\nhigher. Indeed, there are a record 1.7 posted job openings for each person who is looking\nfor work. Record numbers of people are quitting jobs each month, typically to take\nanother job with higher pay. And nominal wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades,\nwith the gains strongest for those at the lower end of the wage distribution and among\nproduction and nonsupervisory workers (figure 2).\nIt is worth considering why the labor market is so tight, given that the\nunemployment rate is actually higher than it was before the pandemic. One explanation\nis that the natural rate of unemployment may be temporarily elevated, so wage pressure is\ngreater for any given level of unemployment. The sheer volume of hiring may have\n\n- 3 -\ntaxed the capacity of the market to bring workers and jobs together. The Delta and\nOmicron variants complicated hiring, and the strong financial position of households may\nhave allowed some to be more selective in their job search. Over time, we might expect\nthese factors to fade, reducing pressure in the job market.\nA second source of labor market tightness is that the labor force participation rate\ndropped sharply in the pandemic and has only partly recovered. As a result, the labor\nforce remains below its pre-pandemic trend (figure 3). Total demand for labor, measured\nby total employment plus posted job openings, has substantially recovered and far\nexceeds the size of the workforce.\nAbout half of the shortfall in labor force participation is attributable to retirements\nduring the pandemic.1 History suggests that most of those retirees are unlikely to reenter\nthe workforce. But some nonparticipation is due to factors that may fade with time, such\nas caregiving needs and fear of contracting COVID-19. With prime-aged participation\nstill well below its pre-pandemic level, there is room for further progress. A more\ncomplete rebound is, however, likely to take some time. Increases in labor force\nparticipation often substantially lag declines in unemployment.\nOverall, the labor market is strong but showing a clear imbalance of supply and\ndemand. Our monetary policy tools cannot help with labor supply in the near term, but in\na long expansion, the factors holding back supply will likely ease. In the meantime, we\naim to use our tools to moderate demand growth, thereby facilitating continued,\nsustainable increases in employment and wages.\n1 See the discussion of labor force participation in Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\n(2022), Monetary Policy Report (Washington: Board of Governors, February),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/20220225_mprfullreport.pdf.\n\n- 4 -\nThe Inflation Outlook Has Deteriorated Significantly\nTurning to price stability, the inflation outlook had deteriorated significantly this\nyear even before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\nThe rise in inflation has been much greater and more persistent than forecasters\ngenerally expected. For example, at the time of our June 2021 meeting, every Federal\nOpen Market Committee (FOMC) participant and all but one of 35 submissions in the\nSurvey of Professional Forecasters predicted that 2021 inflation would be below 4\npercent. Inflation came in at 5.5 percent.2\nFor a time, moderate inflation forecasts looked plausible—the one-month\nheadline and core inflation rates declined steadily from April through September. But\ninflation moved up sharply in the fall, and, just since our December meeting, the median\nFOMC projection for year-end 2022 jumped from 2.6 percent to 4.3 percent.\nWhy have forecasts been so far off? In my view, an important part of the\nexplanation is that forecasters widely underestimated the severity and persistence of\nsupply-side frictions, which, when combined with strong demand, especially for durable\ngoods, produced surprisingly high inflation.\nThe pandemic and the associated shutdown and reopening of the economy caused\na serious upheaval in many parts of the economy, snarling supply chains, constraining\nlabor supply, and creating a major boom in demand for goods and a bust in services\ndemand. The combination of the surge in goods demand with supply chain bottlenecks\n2 This is headline personal consumption expenditures inflation on a Q4/Q4 basis. The Survey of\nProfessional Forecasters statistic is a count by the authors using the second quarter 2021 survey. The data\nare available on the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s website at\nhttps://www.philadelphiafed.org/surveys-and-data/real-time-data-research/survey-of-professional-\nforecasters.\n\n- 5 -\nled to sharply rising goods prices (figure 4). The most notable example here is motor\nvehicles. Prices soared across the vehicles sector as booming demand was met by a sharp\ndecline in global production during the summer of 2021, owing to shortages of computer\nchips. Production remains below pre-pandemic levels, and an expected sharp decline in\nprices has been repeatedly postponed.\nMany forecasters, including FOMC participants, had been expecting inflation to\ncool in the second half of last year, as the economy started going back to normal after\nvaccines became widely available.3 Expectations were that the supply-side damage\nwould begin to heal. Schools would reopen—freeing parents to return to work—and\nlabor supply would begin bouncing back, kinks in supply chains would begin resolving,\nand consumption would start rotating back to services, all of which could reduce price\npressures. While schools are open, none of the other expectations has been fully met.\nPart of the reason may be that, contrary to expectations, COVID has not gone away with\nthe arrival of vaccines. In fact, we are now headed once again into more COVID-related\nsupply disruptions from China. It continues to seem likely that hoped-for supply-side\nhealing will come over time as the world ultimately settles into some new normal, but the\ntiming and scope of that relief are highly uncertain. In the meantime, as we set policy,\nwe will be looking to actual progress on these issues and not assuming significant near-\nterm supply-side relief.\nThe Policy Response\nAs the magnitude and persistence of the increase in inflation became increasingly\nclear over the second half of last year, and as the job market recovery accelerated beyond\n3 See the minutes of the June 2021 FOMC meeting, which are available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.\n\n- 6 -\nexpectations, the FOMC pivoted to progressively less accommodative monetary policy.\nIn June, the median FOMC participant projected that the federal funds rate would remain\nat its effective lower bound through the end of 2022, and as the news came in, the\nprojected policy paths shifted higher (figure 5). The median projection that accompanied\nlast week’s 25 basis point rate increase shows the federal funds rate at 1.9 percent by the\nend of this year and rising above its estimated longer-run normal value in 2023. The\nlatest FOMC statement also indicates that the Committee expects to begin reducing the\nsize of our balance sheet at a coming meeting. I believe that these policy actions and\nthose to come will help bring inflation down near 2 percent over the next 3 years.\nAs always, our policy projections are not a Committee decision or fixed plan.\nInstead, they are a summary of what the FOMC participants see as the most likely case\ngoing forward. The events of the past four weeks remind us that, in tumultuous times,\nwhat seems like the most likely scenario may change quite quickly: Each Summary of\nEconomic Projections reflects a point in time and can become outdated quickly at times\nlike these, when events are developing rapidly.\nThus, my main message today is that, as the outlook evolves, we will adjust\npolicy as needed in order to ensure a return to price stability with a strong job market.\nLet me now turn to three questions about the likely evolution of policy.\nHow will fallout from the invasion of Ukraine affect the economy and monetary\npolicy? Russia’s invasion of Ukraine may have significant effects on the world economy\nand the U.S. economy. The magnitude and persistence of these effects remain highly\nuncertain and depend on events yet to come.\n\n- 7 -\nRussia is one of the world’s largest producers of commodities, and Ukraine is a\nkey producer of several commodities as well, including wheat and neon, which is used in\nthe production of computer chips. There is no recent experience with significant market\ndisruption across such a broad range of commodities. In addition to the direct effects\nfrom higher global oil and commodity prices, the invasion and related events are likely to\nrestrain economic activity abroad and further disrupt supply chains, which would create\nspillovers to the U.S. economy.\nWe might look to the historical experience with oil price shocks in the 1970s—\nnot a happy story. Fortunately, the United States is now much better situated to weather\noil price shocks.4 We are now the world’s largest producer of oil, and our economy is\nsignificantly less oil intensive than in the 1970s. Today a rise in oil prices has mixed\neffects on the economy, lowering real household incomes and thus demand, but raising\ninvestment in drilling over time and benefiting oil-producing areas more generally. On\nnet, oil shocks tend to weigh on output in the U.S. economy, but by far less than in the\n1970s.\nSecond, how likely is it that monetary policy can lower inflation without causing a\nrecession? Our goal is to restore price stability while fostering another long expansion\nand sustaining a strong labor market. In the FOMC participant projections I just\ndescribed, the economy achieves a soft landing, with inflation coming down and\nunemployment holding steady. Growth slows as the very fast growth from the early\n4 I discussed this topic more fully in Jerome H. Powell (2019), “Data-Dependent Monetary Policy in an\nEvolving Economy,” speech delivered at “Trucks and Terabytes: Integrating the ‘Old’ and ‘New’\nEconomies,” 61st Annual Meeting of the National Association for Business Economics, Denver, Colo.,\nOctober 8, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20191008a.htm.\n\n- 8 -\nstages of reopening fades, the effects of fiscal support wane, and monetary policy\naccommodation is removed.\nSome have argued that history stacks the odds against achieving a soft landing,\nand point to the 1994 episode as the only successful soft landing in the postwar period. I\nbelieve that the historical record provides some grounds for optimism: Soft, or at least\nsoft-ish, landings have been relatively common in U.S. monetary history.5 In three\nepisodes—in 1965, 1984, and 1994—the Fed raised the federal funds rate significantly in\nresponse to perceived overheating without precipitating a recession (figure 6).6 In other\ncases, recessions chronologically followed the conclusion of a tightening cycle, but the\nrecessions were not apparently due to excessive tightening of monetary policy. For\nexample, the tightening from 2015 to 2019 was followed by the pandemic-induced\nrecession.7\nI hasten to add that no one expects that bringing about a soft landing will be\nstraightforward in the current context—very little is straightforward in the current\ncontext. And monetary policy is often said to be a blunt instrument, not capable of\nsurgical precision. My colleagues and I will do our very best to succeed in this\nchallenging task. It is worth noting that today the economy is very strong and is well\npositioned to handle tighter monetary policy.\n5 See Alan Blinder (2022), “Landings Hard and Soft: The Fed, 1965–2020,” slides from a presentation\ndelivered at Markus’ Academy, Bendheim Center for Finance, Princeton University, Princeton, N.J.,\nFebruary 11, https://bcf.princeton.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Combined-Slides.pdf.\n6 I have identified these episodes by a single important year in the tightening cycle, but in each case, the\nperiod of tightening spanned more than one year.\n7 As I argued more fully in a previous speech, while the postwar recessions up through 1981 were arguably\nthe result of stop-and-go policy, none of the recessions since then fit that mold so clearly; see Jerome H.\nPowell (2018), “Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,” speech delivered at “Changing Market\nStructure and Implications for Monetary Policy,” a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of\nKansas City, held in Jackson Hole, Wyo., August 24,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm.\n\n- 9 -\nFinally, what will it take to restore price stability? The ultimate responsibility for\nprice stability rests with the Federal Reserve. Price stability is essential if we are going to\nhave another sustained period of strong labor market conditions. I believe that the policy\napproach that I have laid out is well suited to achieving this outcome. We will take the\nnecessary steps to ensure a return to price stability. In particular, if we conclude that it is\nappropriate to move more aggressively by raising the federal funds rate by more than 25\nbasis points at a meeting or meetings, we will do so. And if we determine that we need to\ntighten beyond common measures of neutral and into a more restrictive stance, we will\ndo that as well.\nOur monetary policy framework, as embodied in our Statement on Longer-Run\nGoals and Monetary Policy Strategy, emphasizes that having longer-term inflation\nexpectations anchored at our longer-run objective of 2 percent helps us achieve both our\ndual-mandate objectives. While we cannot measure longer-term expectations directly,\nwe monitor a variety of survey- and market-based indicators. In the recent period, short-\nterm inflation expectations have, of course, risen with inflation, but longer-run\nexpectations remain well anchored in their historical ranges (figure 7).\nThe added near-term upward pressure from the invasion of Ukraine on inflation\nfrom energy, food, and other commodities comes at a time of already too high inflation.\nIn normal times, when employment and inflation are close to our objectives, monetary\npolicy would look through a brief burst of inflation associated with commodity price\nshocks. However, the risk is rising that an extended period of high inflation could push\nlonger-term expectations uncomfortably higher, which underscores the need for the\nCommittee to move expeditiously as I have described.\n\n- 10 -\nConclusion\nThe past two years have been extraordinarily challenging for many Americans.\nTwo years ago, more than 20 million people were losing their jobs, millions were falling\nill, and lives were being disrupted. We have made enormous strides since then. Today,\nas I have discussed, the labor market is very strong. But, to end where I began, inflation\nis much too high. We have the necessary tools, and we will use them to restore price\nstability.\nNote: On April 7, 2022, the legend for Figure 3 was corrected to \"CPS employment plus\njob openings.\"\n\nFigure 1.

Powell\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nCatholic University of America, Columbus School of Law\nWashington, D.C.\nFebruary 9, 2015\n\nIt is a pleasure and a particularly personal honor for me to speak to you today as a\nguest of this institution.1\nI am proud to say that my grandfather, James J. Hayden, earned his doctorate of\nlaw from Catholic University and later served as dean of the law school. He was an early\nscholar of the regulation prompted by a technological innovation that would change the\nworld--aviation. He was, in that sense, someone who looked to the future and wanted to\nbe a part of it. In his years leading the law school, I hope my grandfather could also\nglimpse the great institution that it would become.\nIt has been a little more than six years since the fall of 2008, when the peak of a\nsevere financial crisis presented the very real threat of a second Great Depression. The\ndamage was extensive, and for some time, the recovery was frustratingly slow. But the\neconomy has improved considerably over the past two years, and I am optimistic that that\nthis improvement will continue. The financial system is also stronger and more resilient\nafter improvements in regulation and oversight by the Federal Reserve and other agencies\nand better management by banks and other financial firms.\nThe Fed acted boldly during and after the financial crisis in the face of great\nuncertainty. The full effects of these policies will become clearer with the passage of\ntime. Indeed, the Federal Reserve’s role in the Great Depression of the 1930s is still\nactively debated. That said, as I will show, the evidence as of today is very strong that\nthe Fed’s actions generally succeeded and are a major reason why the U.S. economy is\nnow outperforming those of other advanced nations. Other central banks are now\nembracing some of the same bold steps undertaken much earlier by the Fed.\n1 The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of other members of the Federal Open\nMarket Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nAgainst that background, I am concerned about several troubling proposals that\nwould subject monetary policy to undue political pressure and place new limits on the\nFed’s ability to respond to future crises. My remarks will address three such proposals.\nThe first goes by the somewhat misleading name of “Audit the Fed,” and would subject\nthe Federal Reserve’s conduct of monetary policy to unlimited congressional policy\naudits (not to be confused with financial audits, which are already conducted regularly.)2\nThe second is a proposal to require the Fed to adopt and follow a specific equation in\nsetting monetary policy and to face immediate congressional hearings and investigation\nby the Government Accountability Office (GAO) whenever it deviates from the policy\ndictated by that equation.3 And, third, there are discussions about imposing new\nlimitations on the Fed’s long-held powers to provide liquidity during a financial crisis.\nI think these proposals are misguided for three reasons.\nFirst, they are motivated by the belief that the Fed’s response during the crisis was\nboth ineffective and outside the bounds of its traditional role and responsibilities. In fact,\nthe Fed’s actions were effective, necessary, appropriate, and very much in keeping with\nthe traditional role of the Fed and other central banks.\nSecond, these proposals are based on the assertion that the Federal Reserve\noperates in secrecy and was not accountable for its actions during the crisis, a perspective\nthat is in violent conflict with the facts. The Fed has been transparent, accountable, and\nsubject to extensive oversight, especially during and since the crisis. We have also taken\nappropriate steps since the crisis to further enhance that transparency.\n2 See Federal Reserve Transparency Act of 2015, H.R. 24, 114 Cong. (2015); and Federal Reserve\nTransparency Act of 2015, S. 264, 114 Cong. (2015).\n3 See Federal Reserve Transparency Act of 2015 in note 2.\n\n- 3 -\nThird, and most importantly, I believe these proposals fail to anticipate the\nsignificant costs and risks of subjecting monetary policy to political pressure and\nconstraining the Fed’s ability to carry out its traditional role of providing liquidity in a\ncrisis.\nAppropriate and Effective\nThere is no dispute that the Fed’s actions after the onset of the financial crisis\nwere unprecedented in scale and scope.\nTo help stabilize the financial system and keep credit flowing to households and\nbusinesses, the Federal Reserve lent to banks through the discount window and to\nfinancial institutions and markets through numerous new broad-based lending facilities it\ncreated using emergency lending authority granted by the Congress during the Great\nDepression.4 In a limited number of cases, the Fed also extended liquidity support to\nindividual institutions whose imminent failure threatened to bring down the global\nfinancial system.\nAt the same time, the Federal Reserve used monetary policy to help stabilize the\neconomy. After cutting our target for the overnight interest rate on loans between banks-\n-our usual monetary policy tool--as low as it could go, the Fed took further action using\nunconventional policy tools. These policies involved communication, providing\n“forward guidance” that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) expected to keep\nrates low for longer than had been expected, and also purchasing large amounts of\nlonger-term Treasury debt and other securities to put downward pressure on long-term\ninterest rates.\n4 See Banking Act of 1935, ch. 614, 49 Stat. 684 (1935).\n\n- 4 -\nWhile these actions were extraordinary and in some respects unprecedented, they\nwere taken because the threats posed by the crisis were also without precedent, even in\nthe events that led to the Great Depression.5 For the first time, cutting the Fed’s policy\nrate to near zero proved insufficient to halt a plummeting economy; so the Fed took\nfurther action. For the first time since the Great Depression, our nation faced a financial\npanic so severe that the Fed’s normal overnight lending to banks was not enough; so the\nFed did more, using congressionally granted powers it had held but not used since the\n1930s that were intended to deal with just such rare emergencies.\nAs the Congress considers proposals that will affect the conduct of monetary\npolicy and the Fed’s ability to respond in a crisis, I believe it is also important to\nrecognize how effective the Fed’s response has been.\nWith respect to monetary policy, the unconventional policies were designed to\nstimulate the economy in the same way as traditional monetary policy, by lowering\ninterest rates. These actions helped deliver highly accommodative policy, which was\nessential given the depth of the recession. Without these steps, the slump in the labor\nmarket and the broader economy surely would have been even deeper and more\nprolonged, and the low wage and price inflation we are still experiencing might have\nturned into outright deflation.\nCritics warned that these policies would unleash uncontrollable inflation, fail to\nstimulate demand, and court other known and unknown risks. After I joined the Federal\n5 See Ben S.

But let’s let the data speak: The evidence so far is clear that the\nbenefits of these policies have been substantial, and that the risks have not materialized.\nInflation has continued to run well below the Committee’s 2 percent objective. Indeed,\nsome argue today that low inflation should cause the Committee to hold off from raising\ninterest rates. As I noted at the outset, due in part to the Fed’s effective response to the\ncrisis, the recovery in the United States has been stronger than that of other advanced\neconomies, with more rapid job creation, lower unemployment, and faster growth. That\nis one reason why a number of central banks around the world have adopted forward\nguidance and asset purchase programs similar to the policies adopted by the Fed.6\nThe Federal Reserve’s lending in the crisis was also successful. There is little\ndispute today that the crisis threatened a global financial collapse and depression, and that\nthese liquidity policies were instrumental in arresting the crisis.\nWarnings about the Fed’s lending also have not been borne out. Critics claimed\nthe Fed had been reckless, throwing money ineffectively at problems and making loans to\nuncreditworthy borrowers. On the contrary, the Fed’s lending was targeted to\n6 On the effectiveness of the Fed’s unconventional monetary policy, see Eric M. Engen, Thomas T.\nLaubach, and David Reifschneider (2015), “The Macroeconomic Effects of the Federal Reserve’s\nUnconventional Monetary Policy Actions,” Finance and Economic Discussion Series 2015-005\n(Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, January),\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2015.005; Joseph Gagnon, Matthew Raskin, Julie Remache, and Brian\nSack (2011), “The Financial Market Effects of the Federal Reserve’s Large-Scale Asset Purchases,”\nInternational Journal of Central Banking, vol. 7 (March), pp. 3-43; Stefania D’Amico and Thomas B.

Loans were\nextended based on the same terms that the Federal Reserve has always applied—the\nborrowers must be solvent, the loans must be secured, and an appropriate interest rate\nmust be charged. As a result, every single loan we made was repaid in full, on time, with\ninterest.7\nTraditional Oversight of the Federal Reserve Was Extensive and Effective\nThe Federal Reserve, like other parts of our democratic system of government,\nmust be accountable to the public and its elected representatives. Given the scale of the\nFed’s actions during the Crisis, it has been not only appropriate but essential that these\nactions be transparent to the public and subject to close and careful scrutiny by the\nCongress. And that is exactly what happened. So it is jarring to hear it asserted that the\nFed carries out its duties in secret and is unaccountable to the public and its elected\nrepresentatives. The Federal Reserve is highly transparent and accountable to the public\nand to the Congress.\nFirst, the Fed does not set its own goals for monetary policy. Congress assigned\nus the goals of price stability and maximum employment--that is, the highest level of\nemployment achievable without threatening price stability. Federal Reserve Board\nmembers are nominated by the President and must be confirmed by the Senate. The\nChair of the Fed appears before both the House and Senate oversight committees twice\n7 On the effectiveness of the Fed’s emergency lending, see Sean D. Campbell, Daniel M. Covitz,\nWilliam R.

The Chair and other Board\nmembers routinely make additional appearances before the Congress and meet frequently\nwith members.\nMore generally, the Fed is open and transparent in its operations, including those\nrelated to monetary policy, accounting for itself in timely postmeeting FOMC statements,\nminutes, broadcast press conferences, and speeches.8 Details about the Fed’s balance\nsheet are on the public record; in fact, every security owned by the Fed is identified\nindividually on the website of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.9 The FOMC’s\nplans to normalize the balance sheet have been the subject of exhaustive discussion--in\nFOMC meetings, in speeches by policymakers, and among the many journalists and\nacademics who analyze and discuss Fed policies. Last September, the FOMC published\nits Normalization Principles, which set forth its plans to reduce the balance sheet to a\nmore normal level over time.10\nThe Fed’s financial statements are also a matter of public record, and are audited\nannually by independent, outside auditors under the watchful eye of the Fed’s\nindependent Inspector General.11 I am well aware of this because I chair the committees\nthat have oversight responsibility for the audits of the Board and the Reserve Banks. I\nworked for many years in the financial markets, and I can tell you that the Federal\n8 For example, see Statistical Release H.6, “Money Stock Measures,” on the Board’s website at\nwww.federalreserve.gov/releases/h6/current.\n9 See the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s webpage “System Open Market Account Holdings”\navailable at www.newyorkfed.org/markets/soma/sysopen_accholdings.html.\n10 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2014), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC\nStatement on Policy Normalization Principles and Plans,” press release, September 17,\nwww.Federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20140917c.htm.\n11 See “Federal Reserve System Audited Annual Financial Statements” on the Board’s website at\nwww.Federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_Fedfinancials.htm#audited.\n\n- 8 -\nReserve’s financial statements, though they contain very large numbers, are relatively\nstraightforward--much simpler than those of a typical regional bank.\nThe Fed’s operations, including its role regulating and supervising banks, are\nsubject to extensive review by the GAO. If you visit the GAO’s website, you’ll find\nmore than 70 reports since the crisis that are wholly or partly dedicated to reviewing the\nFed’s operations, including the emergency lending facilities I mentioned earlier.12 The\nGAO works closely with the Fed’s Office of Inspector General, which is involved in both\nfinancial audits and other oversight of our operations.\nThe extensive oversight I describe intensified--appropriately so--as the Federal\nReserve responded to the financial crisis. Our lending facilities were also the subject of\nreview by the Fed’s Inspector General, the Special Inspector General for the Troubled\nAsset Relief Program, the Congressional Oversight Panel, the Financial Crisis Inquiry\nCommission established by the Congress, and numerous congressional hearings and\nreviews.\nThe Fed’s actions were also fully transparent. As always, monetary policy\ndecisions were debated and voted on by the FOMC and announced immediately, with\ndetailed explanations provided in the minutes of these deliberations. The Fed provided\npublic guidance on its plans to purchase assets and made those purchases in open,\ncompetitive transactions that were disclosed as soon as they occurred.\nThe terms and conditions for every lending facility were publicly disclosed. The\namounts lent under each program were published on the Fed’s weekly balance sheet\n12 The reports are available on the GAO’s website, www.gao.gov.\n\n- 9 -\nreport. The Fed created a website and issued a monthly report to the Congress disclosing\ndetails on all loans, such as the quantity and quality of collateral posted by borrowers.13\nThe Significant Costs of Restrictions on the Fed’s Independence\nAs I said at the outset, I believe these proposals under consideration by the\nCongress fail to anticipate the significant costs and risks of subjecting the Fed’s conduct\nof monetary policy to political pressure and of limiting the ability of the Fed to execute\nits traditional role of keeping credit flowing to American households and businesses in a\nfinancial crisis.\nLet me first address “Audit the Fed,” which would repeal a narrow but critical\nexemption, adopted by the Congress in 1978, to limit GAO policy reviews of the Fed’s\nconduct of monetary policy. The Congress granted this exemption because the costs of\ninvolving the GAO in monetary policy, including the substantial risk of political\ninterference, far outweigh the potential benefits.\nIt is important to note that GAO investigations are not the financial audits that\nmany assume them to be. They extend beyond mere accounting to examine strategy,\njudgments and day-to-day decisionmaking. Indeed, by statute, the GAO is charged with\nmaking recommendations to Congress about the areas they have reviewed. This could\nput the GAO in the position of reviewing the FOMC’s policy decisions and\nrecommending its own course for monetary policy.\nWith these features in mind, the potential benefits of GAO policy audits would be\nsmall, even before considering the potential costs. Unlike the programs that are typically\n13 See “Credit and Liquidity Programs and the Balance Sheet” on the Board’s website at\nwww.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst.htm.\n\n- 10 -\nthe subject of GAO policy audits, such as procurement decisions that may be brought to\nlight only by the GAO’s attention, monetary policy decisions occur with all of the world\nwatching. They are announced immediately, described in an FOMC statement, often\nelaborated on in a press conference, and the subject of endless same-day-analysis and\ndebate.\nWith all of this transparency and analysis, very little would be revealed by GAO\npolicy audits that would help evaluate the effectiveness of monetary policy. The benefits\nof frequent GAO policy audits would also be low because the effects of monetary policy\nare felt with a considerable time lag and are often only clear years later.\nAudit the Fed also risks inserting the Congress directly into monetary policy\ndecisionmaking, reversing decades of deliberate effort by the Congress to insulate the\nFed from political pressure in carrying out its day-to-day duties. Indeed, some advocates\nof the bill have expressed support for complete elimination of the Federal Reserve. Long\nexperience, in the United States and in other advanced economies, has demonstrated that\nmonetary policy is most successful when decisions are rendered independent of influence\nby elected officials. As recent U.S. history has shown, elected officials have often\npushed for easier policies that serve short-term political interests, at the expense of higher\ninflation and damage to the long-term health and stability of the economy.14\n14 The seminal research establishing a link between central bank independence and macroeconomic\nperformance is Alberto Alesina and Lawrence H. Summers (1993), “Central Bank Independence and\nMacroeconomic Performance: Some Comparative Evidence,” Journal of Money, Credit and Banking,\nvol. 25 (May), pp. 151-62. More recent research finds the relationship to be less solid, however, in part\nbecause independent central banks have in several cases been instituted precisely because economic\nperformance has been subpar; for example, see Christopher Crowe and Ellen E. Meade (2007), “The\nEvolution of Central Bank Governance around the World,” Journal of Economic Perspectives, vol. 21 (4),\npp. 69-90; Christopher Crowe and Ellen E. Meade (2008), “Central Bank Independence and Transparency:\nEvolution and Effectiveness,” European Journal of Political Economy, vol. 24 (4), pp. 763-77; and\nN. Nergiz Dincer and Barry Eichengreen (2014), “Central Bank Transparency and Independence: Updates\nand New Measures,” International Journal of Central Banking, vol. 10 (1), pp. 189-259.\n\n- 11 -\nAfter World War II and as recently as the early 1970s, political pressures likely\ninfluenced Federal Reserve decisionmaking in a way which helped cause excessive\ninflation and related bouts of economic weakness. In 1977, as what came to be called the\nGreat Inflation neared its peak, the Congress passed legislation that spelled out the goals\nfor monetary policy--maximum employment and stable prices--but left it to the Fed to\nprecisely define those goals and the means by which they would be achieved.15 To\npreserve the Fed’s independence in implementing policy to reach these goals, the\nCongress exempted monetary policy from the GAO investigations it was then authorizing\nfor other Fed operations.\nThis independence has served the nation well. Over the 20 years or so prior to the\ncrisis, the Federal Reserve was able to maintain low and stable inflation, and recessions\nwere brief and mild.16 That is not to say that the Fed got everything just right during this\nperiod. But it seems to me that any pre-crisis shortcomings were in regulation and\nsupervision by the Fed and other agencies, rather than in monetary policy.\nAnd there are other costs from subjecting monetary policy to GAO investigations.\nFrequent GAO investigations would likely inhibit the debate and flow of information and\nideas at FOMC meetings among staff and policymakers, which would lead to poorer\ndecisions. Market participants would have to wonder whether the FOMC would react to\nGAO criticism, and they could lose confidence in the Fed’s independence, reducing its\ncredibility.\n15 See Robert J. Samuelson (2008), The Great Inflation and Its Aftermath: The Transformation of\nAmerica’s Economy, Politics, and Society (New York: Random House).\n16 See the figure “Annualized 12-Month PCE and Core PCE Inflation” that shows inflation and core\ninflation over time.\n\n- 12 -\nTo those who may doubt that GAO investigations would be used by the Congress\nto try to influence monetary policy, let me briefly describe another proposal which\nenvisions exactly that. This bill would require the FOMC to carry out monetary policy\naccording to a simple equation and require immediate congressional hearings and a GAO\naudit whenever monetary policy deviates from this equation.17 Simple policy rules of this\nnature are used by the FOMC and by central banks around the world as a guide to policy.\nNo central bank applies them in such a mechanical fashion, and there is very little support\namong economists for doing so.18 Based on my own experience in business, in\ngovernment service, and in life, I doubt that important decisions can be reduced\nultimately to such an equation. The most such a rule might do is get you 80 percent of\nthe way there; that last 20 percent makes all the difference.\nFinally, there has been discussion in the Congress of imposing new restrictions on\nthe ability of the Fed to respond as it did with liquidity facilities during the financial\ncrisis. Although I am not aware of a specific bill at this point, the idea is to limit the\nFed’s authority under section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, under which the Fed is\nempowered to lend “in unusual and exigent circumstances” to firms beyond banks for the\npurpose of containing a financial crisis.\n17 See Federal Reserve Transparency Act of 2015 in note 2.\n18 As part of its ongoing Initiative on Global Markets (IGM) poll, the University of Chicago, Booth School\nof Business, asked 44 prominent economists to respond to the following statement: “Legislation introduced\nin Congress would require the Federal Reserve to “submit to the appropriate congressional committees…a\nDirective Policy Rule,” which shall describe “the strategy or rule of the Federal Open Market Committee\nfor the systematic quantitative adjustment of the Policy Instrument Target to respond to a change in the\nIntermediate Policy Inputs.” Should the Fed deviate from the rule, the Fed Chair would have to “testify\nbefore the appropriate congressional committees as to why the [rule]…is not in compliance.” Enacting this\nprovision would improve monetary policy outcomes in the U.S.” None of the participants agreed with the\nstatement, and almost all disagreed or strongly disagreed. The results of the poll are available on the Booth\nSchool’s IGM Forum website at www.igmchicago.org/igm-economic-experts-panel/poll-\nresults?SurveyID=SV_doNZ9FbNq7tDi97.\n\n- 13 -\nThe Fed used this emergency lending authority to provide liquidity in the face of a\nsystemwide panic that threatened the financial system. As the crisis receded, the\nCongress took two related actions. First, it gave the regulators what they had badly\nneeded during the crisis, which was a means of resolving the largest financial institutions\nwithout threatening the financial system. Second, the Congress prohibited emergency\nloans to individual firms but retained the Fed’s ability to establish broadly available\nlending programs during a crisis, with the prior approval of the Secretary of the Treasury\nand timely notification of the Congress.\nThis tradeoff came after extensive consultation between the Congress and the\nFederal Reserve. And I believe that it struck a reasonable balance. I also believe it\nwould be a mistake to go further and impose additional restrictions. One of the lessons of\nthe crisis is that the financial system evolves so quickly that it is difficult to predict where\nthreats will emerge and what actions may be needed in the future to respond. Because we\ncannot anticipate what may be needed in the future, the Congress should preserve the\nability of the Fed to respond flexibly and nimbly to future emergencies. Further\nrestricting or eliminating the Fed’s emergency lending authority will not prevent future\ncrises, but it will hinder the Fed’s ability to limit the harm from those crises for families\nand businesses.\nConclusion\nIn our democratic system, the Federal Reserve owes the public and the Congress a\nhigh degree of transparency and accountability. The Congress has wisely given the Fed\nthe tools it needs to implement monetary policy and respond to future crises as well as\ncrucial independence to do its work free from short-term political influence. I would\n\n- 14 -\nurge caution regarding current proposals that threaten just such political influence and\nplace restrictions on the very tools that so recently proved essential in preventing a new\ndepression. Congressional oversight of the Federal Reserve, including its conduct of\nmonetary policy, is extensive, but no doubt could be improved in ways that do not\nthreaten the Fed’s effectiveness. I would welcome discussions with the Congress about\nways to aid its important oversight of monetary policy. There may be differing views of\nhow Congress can best carry out this responsibility, but there can be no disagreement\nabout the purpose of such oversight, which is to help the Federal Reserve succeed in\npromoting a healthy economy and a strong and stable financial system. Those are the\ngoals Congress assigned the Federal Reserve a century ago, and I am optimistic that\nCongress and the Fed will continue to work together to pursue them on behalf of the\nAmerican people.\n\nAnnualized 12-Month PCE and Core PCE Inflation\nPercent\n12\nTotal PCE\nCore PCE 10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n-2\n1960 1963 1966 1969 1972 1975 1978 1981 1984 1987 1990 1993 1996 1999 2002 2005 2008 2011 2014\nNote: PCE is personal consumption expenditures.\nSource: U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics.",

Powell\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nEconomic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act Outreach Meeting\nDallas, Texas\nFebruary 4, 2015\n\nOn behalf of the Federal Reserve System, I am pleased to be here at the second in a series\nof outreach meetings designed to hear your comments and suggestions about reducing regulatory\nburden on insured depository institutions. Thank you all for taking the time to participate in this\nimportant process, and I’d also like to extend my thanks to the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas\nfor hosting today’s meeting.\nThe Federal Reserve takes seriously its obligations under the Economic Growth and\nRegulatory Paperwork Reduction Act (EGRPRA). The EGRPRA review provides our agencies\nwith the opportunity to consider whether our regulations are necessary and current in keeping up\nwith the financial services and regulatory environments.\nWell-conceived regulations help to ensure the safety and soundness of our banking\nsystem as well as the fair treatment of consumers. But unnecessary, outdated, or unduly\nburdensome regulations can exhaust the resources of insured depository institutions and reduce\nthe important services that those institutions provide to households and businesses.\nCreating balanced regulations that are effective and thoughtfully calibrated to avoid\nundue burden requires input from stakeholders. In-person meetings, like the one we are holding\ntoday, help us gather information that is critical to our understanding of how regulations affect\nnot only the banking industry but also the consumers and communities they serve. They also\nallow stakeholders to learn from one another and provide us with different perspectives on the\ncomplex issues that our regulations address. Outside of these meetings, we also look forward to\nreceiving written comments in which you can elaborate on how to improve our regulations in\nmore detail than we can cover in the time we have today.\nWe understand that the sizes of depository institutions vary, that they operate through\ndifferent business models, and that they manage different risks. This is why one focus of the\n\n- 2 -\nEGRPRA review is considering the potential burden imposed by our regulations on community\nbanks and other small insured depository institutions, so that we may carefully consider whether\nour regulations are appropriately adjusted for smaller institutions. We think it’s important to\ntailor rules whenever possible to clearly distinguish requirements for different portfolios of\ndepository institutions and reduce unnecessary burden on community banks. Of course, tailoring\nregulations may be more challenging in some areas, such as rules that provide transparency and\nfairness in consumer transactions because those are standards that apply throughout the financial\nsystem.\nWe also recognize that, apart from changes in the regulatory and supervisory landscape,\nthe banking industry itself has undergone major changes. For example, improvements in\ntechnology and changes in the financial industry’s composition between depository institutions\nand nondepository companies have altered the types of financial products and services that are\noffered by depository institutions, as well as how those services and products are accessed. We\nwelcome your views on how these types of industry changes have impacted the effectiveness of\nour regulations.\nToday I look forward to hearing your views on our agencies’ regulations, especially in\nthe categories of banking operations, capital, and the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). For\nthe Federal Reserve, these topics include regulations on the availability of funds; the collection\nof checks and other items by the Federal Reserve Banks and fund transfers through Fedwire;\nprompt corrective action procedures; and the disclosure and reporting of CRA-related\nagreements.\nI’d like to conclude by saying that we will consider your comments carefully as the\nagencies coordinate to discuss and consider the appropriate action that is likely to best serve our\n\n- 3 -\nfinancial system and the interests of depository institutions and consumers. And when possible,\nthe agencies will act to implement regulatory burden relief before the end of the EGRPRA\nreview period. For example, in December of last year, Congress passed legislation--which was\nsupported by the Federal Reserve Board--that would increase the consolidated asset limit for\nsmall bank holding companies from $500 million to $1 billion under the Small Bank Holding\nCompany Policy Statement and that extends the same treatment to savings and loan holding\ncompanies of less than $1 billion. Last Thursday, the Federal Reserve issued for public\ncomment both proposed and interim final rules for public comment that would implement that\nlegislation.1 The rules would reduce regulatory burden on small entities by excluding many\nbank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies with total consolidated assets\nof less than $1 billion from the consolidated capital requirements. Of course, regulatory capital\nrequirements will continue to apply to the depository institution level. The rules also would\nreduce the burden of regulatory reporting for these companies. The Federal Reserve currently\nestimates that the proposed revisions to the Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement\nwould impact over 4,200 organizations.\nThe final results of our EGRPRA review will be contained in the agencies’ report to\nCongress that summarizes the issues raised and the agencies’ conclusions about the need for\nregulatory or legislative changes.\nThank you for coming today.\n1 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2015), “Federal Reserve Board invites public comment on\nproposed rules to expand the applicability of Board’s Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement,” press\nrelease, January 29.",

Powell\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Perspectives on Maximum Employment and Price Stability”\na Fed Listens event sponsored by\nthe Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nWashington, D.C.\nOctober 4, 2019\n\nGood afternoon. Welcome to the room where members of the Board of\nGovernors and the presidents of the 12 Reserve Banks meet eight times a year—most\nrecently, two weeks ago—to decide the stance of monetary policy. It’s a magnificent,\nformal—perhaps even imposing—room, with 26-foot ceilings, a monumental marble\nfireplace, and a 1,000-pound brass and glass chandelier. It’s seen a lot of history since\nFranklin Roosevelt dedicated this building in 1937. British and American military\nleaders conferred here during World War II. And, through the decades, our Federal\nReserve predecessors grappled with financial turmoil and the economy’s ups and downs.\nSo when my colleagues and I take our assigned places around this polished mahogany\nand granite table, the setting and its history lends a certain formality—dare I say,\nstuffiness—to the proceedings.\nAs we kick off this 12th of 14 Fed Listens events, Governor Brainard, Governor\nBowman, and I hope that today’s meeting is anything but stuffy. Candid and serious,\nyes. But not stuffy. The Reserve Banks and the Board have been holding Fed Listens\nevents around the country as part of a comprehensive and public review of our monetary\npolicy strategy, tools, and communications practices. Almost all of the Fed Listens\nmeetings, like this one, have been open to the press and live-streamed on the internet.\nBoth the breadth and transparency of the review are unprecedented for us.\nOne reason we are conducting this review is that it is always a good practice for\nany organization to occasionally take a step back and ask if it could be doing its job more\neffectively. But we must pose that question not just to ourselves. Because Congress has\ngranted the Federal Reserve significant protections from short-term political pressures,\nwe have an obligation to clearly explain what we are doing and why. And we have an\n\n- 2 -\nobligation to actively engage the people we serve so that they and their elected\nrepresentatives can hold us accountable.\nWe’ve invited you here because we want to better understand how monetary\npolicy affects the lives of the people your organizations represent—union members, small\nbusiness owners, residents of low- and moderate-income communities, retirees, and\nothers. We want to hear your perspective on maximum employment and price stability—\nthe monetary policy goals Congress has assigned us.\nNow is a good time to conduct the review. Unemployment is near a half-century\nlow, and inflation is running close to, but a bit below, our 2 percent objective. While not\neveryone fully shares economic opportunities and the economy faces some risks, overall\nit is—as I like to say—in a good place. Our job is to keep it there as long as possible.\nWhile we believe our strategy and tools have been and remain effective, the U.S.\neconomy, like other advanced economies around the world, is facing some longer-term\nchallenges—from low growth, low inflation, and low interest rates. While slow growth is\nobviously not good, you may be asking, “What’s wrong with low inflation and low\ninterest rates?” Low can be good, but when inflation—and, consequently, interest\nrates—are too low, the Fed and other central banks have less room to cut rates to support\nthe economy during downturns.\nSo, in this review, we are examining strategies that might better allow us to\nsymmetrically and sustainably achieve 2 percent inflation. Doing so would help prevent\ninflation expectations among consumers, businesses, and investors from slipping too low,\nas they appear to have done in several advanced economies. More-firmly anchored\nexpectations, in a virtuous circle, would help keep actual inflation around our target, thus\n\n- 3 -\npreserving our ability to change interest rates as appropriate to meet our mandate. We are\nalso looking at whether our existing monetary policy tools will be adequate when the next\ndownturn comes. Finally, we are asking whether our communications practices can be\nimproved to better support the effectiveness of our policy.\nAfter today, we have two Fed Listens sessions remaining, both later this month:\none in Kansas City and another in Chicago. At the July meeting of the Federal Open\nMarket Committee, my colleagues and I began discussing what we’ve learned so far\nfrom the Fed Listens events. We continued that discussion at our September meeting and\nhave a lot left to do. We plan to publicly report our conclusions during the first half of\nnext year.\nOne clear takeaway of the sessions so far is the importance of sustaining our\nhistorically strong job market. People from low- and moderate-income communities tell\nus this long recovery, now in its 11th year, is benefiting them and their neighbors to a\ndegree that has not been felt for many years.

Powell\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nMoney Marketeers of New York University\nNew York, New York\nSeptember 4, 2014\n\nThank you for giving me this opportunity to speak this evening. I would like to\ndiscuss ongoing efforts to reform the current structure and uses of the London Interbank\nOffered Rate, commonly referred to as LIBOR. These reforms affect not only the\nfinancial industry, but also a large number of U.S. households and corporations.\nLIBOR is a reference rate. When two parties enter a financial contract in which\ninterest payments are to be exchanged, they frequently choose to base those payments on\nLIBOR. LIBOR is currently referenced in roughly $300 trillion worth of contracts\nglobally, which means that it is part of the global financial system’s critical\ninfrastructure.1 But LIBOR’s credibility was badly undermined by the scandal that\nerupted when some of the banks that help produce the rate attempted to manipulate it by\ncontributing inaccurate estimates of their borrowing costs. These illegal actions helped\ndamage the public’s trust not just in LIBOR, but also in financial markets and institutions\nmore broadly.\nIn response, a number of global efforts to reform reference rates have been\nundertaken. LIBOR is produced and administered in London. As a result of the steps\ntaken by the government of the United Kingdom, LIBOR is now regulated and\nsupervised by the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The International\nOrganization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) developed a broad set of 19 principles\nthat reference rates and other financial benchmarks are now expected to meet.2 Building\non this work, in July, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) released a report outlining a\n1 For more information on the role of LIBOR in the global financial system, see Wheatley Review (2012),\nThe Wheatley Review of LIBOR: Final Report (London: HM Treasury, September),\nwww.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/191762/wheatley_review_libor_fin\nalreport_280912.pdf.\n2 Details on the principles may be found in Board of the International Organization of Securities\nCommissions (2013), Principles for Financial Benchmarks: Final Report (Madrid: Board of IOSCO,\nJuly), www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD415.pdf.\n\n- 2 -\nnumber of further reform proposals.3 Continuing the work of my former Fed colleague\nJeremy Stein, I recently took over as co-chair--along with Martin Wheatley, chief\nexecutive officer of the FCA--of the international group that drafted the report and is now\ncharged with implementing its recommendations.4 Today I will discuss the reasons why\nfurther reforms are necessary and how those reforms should proceed, and I will focus on\nU.S. dollar LIBOR.5 As is made clear in the FSB report, while the goals and principles\nof the official sector participants are uniform, specific plans for reference rate reform will\nvary by currency, depending on differences in markets and institutions.\nI will share my conclusion at the outset. While there have been significant\nreforms, much remains to be done.6 First, U.S. dollar LIBOR needs to be updated to\nreflect current practices in unsecured funding markets and to be better anchored in actual\ntransactions. Second, and equally important, regulators need to work with market\nparticipants to encourage them to develop and adopt alternative reference rates that better\nreflect the current structure of U.S. financial markets, in which borrowing and derivatives\ntransactions are much more likely to be secured with collateral. Going forward, these\nalternative rates could replace LIBOR as the reference rate for new interest rate\nderivatives and some other contracts denominated in U.S. dollars. These dual transitions\nwill need to be managed very carefully to avoid disrupting the financing markets on\nwhich borrowers and lenders depend. But I believe that they are crucial to strengthening\nthe stability of our financial system and to helping restore the public’s faith in its\n3 For the FSB’s reform proposals, see Financial Stability Board (2014), Reforming Major Interest Rate\nBenchmarks (Basel, Switzerland: FSB, July), www.financialstabilityboard.org/publications/r_140722.pdf.\n4 Former Federal Reserve Governor Jeremy C. Stein was the previous co-chair.\n5 The views expressed here are my own and should not be taken to represent those of the FSB’s Official\nSector Steering Group or those of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\n6 LIBOR reform and the work still to be accomplished are discussed in Wheatley Review, The Wheatley\nReview of LIBOR, in note 1.\n\n- 3 -\nintegrity. This problem is not just Wall Street’s concern; every household with a LIBOR-\nlinked mortgage and every corporation with a LIBOR-linked loan has an interest in more\nrobust U.S. dollar reference rates.\nThe Basics\nI will take a few moments to explain the basic mechanics of LIBOR for those who\nhave not spent time on an interest rate swap desk. For almost three decades, LIBOR was\nrun by the British Bankers’ Association. Just a few months ago, a private corporation\ncalled ICE Benchmark Administration (IBA) took over the daily production and\nadministration of the rate subject to the regulation and supervision of the FCA. Today,\n18 banks participate in the panel that contributes to the production of U.S. dollar LIBOR.\nEach morning at 11 a.m. London time, those banks estimate the rate at which they could\nborrow at several different maturities ranging from overnight up to a year, and they send\nthose estimates to IBA. It is often the case that banks have recent transactions at some\nbut not all of these maturities. Where there are no transactions, they submit estimates of\ntheir borrowing costs based on their judgment. In addition to U.S. dollar LIBOR, the rate\nis produced in four other currencies--the euro, the yen, the British pound, and the Swiss\nfranc--although not all banks contribute rates in all currencies. The administrator\nprovides specific instructions to the panel banks regarding their submissions; currently,\nthese instructions direct banks to reflect the perceived rate at which they could borrow\nfrom another bank.7 The administrator collects these submissions and, after dropping the\nhighest and lowest quartiles at each maturity, publishes an average of the remaining\nsubmissions as the U.S. dollar LIBOR rate for that day.\n7 The actual question asks banks only about transactions of “reasonable market size.” This size is not\ndefined and is left to banks’ judgment.\n\n- 4 -\nPervasive and Problematic\nWhen the British Bankers’ Association standardized LIBOR in the 1980s for use\nin interest rate products, I doubt that anyone could have imagined how pervasive it would\neventually become. As I mentioned, there are an estimated $300 trillion in LIBOR\ncontracts, roughly half which reference dollar LIBOR. In the United States, dollar\nLIBOR is the reference rate used in most interest rate swaps and futures contracts, in\nmost floating-rate mortgages, in many commercial loans, and in structured products such\nas mortgage- and asset-backed securities. The list could go on and on, but the key point\nis that LIBOR touches a large number of U.S. households and businesses.\nAlthough LIBOR is currently used for all of these purposes, it is actually not\nideally suited for some of them. LIBOR is designed to measure the costs of bank\nborrowing for a panel of large banks. The rate can be decomposed into a component that\nreflects the general level of risk-free rates and a component that reflects a risk premium\nrelated to the credit risk of the borrowing bank. During the global financial crisis, the\ncredit risk component of LIBOR fluctuated dramatically, which meant that LIBOR\nbehaved quite differently from rates with no credit risk embedded in them, such as risk-\nfree rates.\nLIBOR is a less-than-ideal rate for most derivatives contracts and secured\nborrowing because movements in the credit risk component do not reflect well the\nunderlying risks of those contracts. However, LIBOR’s pervasiveness has become self-\nreinforcing. Firms use LIBOR in contracts, even when it is less than ideal, because they\nknow they can hedge the resulting risk using highly liquid, LIBOR-based interest rate\nswaps or other derivatives contracts. And those derivatives markets are so liquid because\n\n- 5 -\nmost market participants use LIBOR as the reference rate in their financial contracts.\nBecause of the progression of this dynamic over time, and not because of some careful\ndesign, LIBOR has spread well beyond its intended uses and become an important pillar\nof the global financial system--perhaps too important.\nIn recent years, two separate developments have called into question the wisdom\nof that arrangement. I have already mentioned the first one--the emergence of a\npervasive pattern of attempted manipulation of LIBOR dating back many years. This\nmisconduct was designed either to increase the potential profit of the submitting firms or\nto convey a misleading picture of the relative health of such firms. Since 2012, seven\nfinancial institutions have settled related charges with the U.S. Commodity Futures\nTrading Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice, and the cumulative penalties\nand fines paid in the United States now stand at more than $3 billion.8 Global penalties\npaid related to benchmark misconduct exceed $6 billion as investigations into reference\nrate manipulation continue. Although these penalties and fines are themselves\nsubstantial, to my mind the longer-term damage to the public’s trust represents the greater\ncost of this misconduct.\nA second problem is that unsecured interbank borrowing has been in a secular\ndecline that predates the global financial crisis. Changes in bank behavior following the\ncrisis exacerbated the decline and further weakened the foundation of LIBOR. The result\nis a scarcity, or outright absence in longer tenors, of actual transactions that banks can use\nto estimate their daily submission to LIBOR. Ongoing regulatory reforms and the shift\naway from unsecured funding raise the possibility that unsecured interbank borrowing\n8 The seven firms that have settled consist of five banks (Barclays, Lloyds Bank, Rabobank, RBS, and\nUBS) and two brokers (ICAP and RP Martin).\n\n- 6 -\ntransactions may become even more infrequent in the future. While it is also possible\nthat activity in these markets could rebound, the threat that this form of borrowing may\ndecline further, particularly in periods of stress, seems likely to remain.\nSo let me pose a question: Is it wise to rely on a critical benchmark that is built\non a market in decline? Clearly not. The risks to market functioning are simply too\ngreat. For example, market activity could decline to the point where publication of a rate\nbecomes untenable. And many of the panel banks have expressed concerns about the\nongoing legal risks of remaining on the panel. If the publication of LIBOR were to\nbecome untenable or if we were to simply “end LIBOR,” as some have urged, untangling\nthe $150 trillion in outstanding U.S. dollar LIBOR contracts would entail a protracted,\nexpensive, and uncertain process of negotiating amendments to an enormous number of\ncomplex documents--a horrible mess and a feast for the legal profession, to be sure. It\ndoes not help matters that the hundreds of trillions of dollars’ worth of derivatives\ncontracts referencing LIBOR do not, in general, have robust backups in the event that\npublication of a rate ceases.\nThe FSB report identifies ways to improve U.S. dollar LIBOR, and to create\nalternatives to it, while minimizing transition costs, particularly for end users who bear\nno blame for the misconduct. The proposed reforms come down to two simple ideas.\nFirst, U.S. dollar LIBOR needs to be redefined to include a broader range of transaction\ntypes. Doing so will make it more robust and will allow it to reflect actual bank funding\ncosts, which is what the rate was intended to do in the first place. Second, we need to\npromote robust alternatives to U.S. dollar LIBOR that better reflect the secured nature of\nmany of today’s financial market transactions.\n\n- 7 -\nUpdating U.S. Dollar LIBOR\nLet me first address the efforts the Federal Reserve is considering, in cooperation\nwith the LIBOR administrator and U.K. authorities, to update the mechanics of U.S.\ndollar LIBOR. Our aim is to make LIBOR more robust and more representative of\ncurrent bank funding costs. In this regard, we have considered two important attributes\nof LIBOR--its definition and the data used to produce it.\nWhile the current definition of LIBOR is limited to unsecured borrowing between\nbanks, LIBOR is actually intended to represent the overall cost of banks’ unsecured\nborrowing. At the time LIBOR was created, a substantial amount of that unsecured\nborrowing was in the interbank market, but that is no longer the case. Broadening the\ndefinition to include the unsecured borrowing from nonbanks would make the rate more\nrepresentative of current funding practices. Changing the definition of LIBOR, as has\nbeen done in the past, would acknowledge the fact that a reference rate must adapt to\ncontinue to represent what it is meant to measure.9\nUpdating the definition of U.S. dollar LIBOR could also allow other sources of\ntransactions data to be incorporated into it. Potentially, we could even move away from\nthe current panel-based method of calculating U.S. dollar LIBOR to a rate that is fully\ntransactions based. In April, the Federal Reserve began collecting data from banks on a\n9 For a reference to a past change in LIBOR, see the British Bankers’ Association’s website “BBA LIBOR”\nat www.bbalibor.com/disclaimer/explained/historical-perspective. The design of BBA LIBOR has seen\none significant change since its inception. Up until 1998, banks submitted quotes to the BBA LIBOR\nprocess in line with the question “At what rate do you think interbank term deposits will be offered by one\nprime bank to another prime bank for a reasonable market size today at 11 am?” During 1998, this\nquestion changed and has, up until today, been as follows: “At what rate could you borrow funds, were\nyou to do so by asking for and then accepting inter-bank offers in a reasonable market size just prior to\n11 am?” This decision was made after consultation with the markets and was implemented due to a view\nthat a universal definition of a prime bank could no longer be given. It also links the figures submitted by\nbanks to their own market activity rather than a hypothetical entity. For a reference to the usefulness of the\nadaptability of reference rates, see Board of IOSCO, Principles for Financial Benchmarks, p. 12, in note 2.\n\n- 8 -\nvariety of unsecured transactions. These data, along with other available data, will help\nus understand whether there is enough borrowing activity to support a fully transactions-\nbased rate.10 It will take some time to assess these data and, in particular, to analyze the\ndepth of the markets under different conditions and during different times of the year.\nBut preliminary analysis, which is reinforced by research done by the Market Participants\nGroup (MPG) that was assembled by the FSB, suggests that there may be enough\nborrowing activity to create a transactions-based U.S. dollar LIBOR rate.\nBasing U.S. dollar LIBOR more on transactions could modestly increase the\nvolatility of the rate. However, I see nothing wrong with a reference rate that more\naccurately reflects the volatility of the market it represents. We are working closely with\nthe LIBOR administrator, IBA, and with its regulator, FCA, to explore these issues. In\nthis regard, cooperation with IBA is crucial if LIBOR is to be strengthened--U.S. dollar\nLIBOR is produced in the United Kingdom and is not regulated here in the United States.\nThe IOSCO review found that IBA has made progress in implementing most of the\n19 IOSCO principles; the changes I have discussed are designed to continue this\nprogress, and I believe that IBA is well motivated to continue its efforts.11\nAlternatives Needed\nImproving U.S. dollar LIBOR alone cannot eliminate all of the weaknesses in the\ncurrent system. In the FSB’s opinion and that of the MPG, a large portion of the\nderivatives that currently reference U.S. dollar LIBOR would be better served by\n10 For the report form used to collect these data, see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,\nFR 2420, Report of Selected Money Market Rates,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/reportforms/formsreview/FR2420_20140401_f.pdf.\n11 The results of the IOSCO review are reported in Board of the International Organization of Securities\nCommissions (2014), Review of the Implementation of IOSCO’s Principles for Financial Benchmarks by\nAdministrators of Euribor, Libor and Tibor (Madrid: Board of IOSCO, July), available at\nwww.financialstabilityboard.org/publications/r_140722a.htm.\n\n- 9 -\nreferencing a risk-free (or nearly risk-free) rate based on a robust and liquid underlying\nmarket. These transactions are more appropriately linked to a narrower measure of\ninterest rates that does not include a bank credit risk component. Encouraging\nalternatives that better reflect today’s funding markets would also allow for greater\nchoice, increase the resilience of the system, and would potentially make hedging of\nsome risks less costly. In addition, the incentive to manipulate LIBOR would be\nsubstantially reduced if a smaller share of the multi-hundred-trillion-dollar derivatives\nmarket was referencing it.\nSome possible alternatives include rates based on the U.S. Treasury market or\nrates based on the secured funding markets that have replaced much of the borrowing\nbanks used to do in the unsecured interbank market. The Federal Reserve is not seeking\nto dictate the particular rate that financial markets adopt. Instead, we will encourage key\nmarket participants to further the work done by the FSB’s MPG by narrowing down the\nlist of alternatives and developing them into robust reference rates that meet agreed-upon\ninternational standards and best practices.12 There are enough suggestions on the MPG’s\nlist to inspire confidence that we should be able to find common ground. Any alternative\nwould, of course, need to be in accord with the IOSCO principles mentioned earlier, and\nsome potential alternatives would take time to fully develop. But the establishment of\nalternative reference rates for certain products is in our shared interests and would\nsubstantially strengthen the financial system.\n12 For details on the MPG’s work, see Financial Stability Board (2014), Market Participants Group on\nReforming Interest Rate Benchmarks: Final Report (Basel, Switzerland: FSB, March),\nwww.financialstabilityboard.org/publications/r_140722b.pdf.\n\n- 10 -\nWe are strongly committed that at least one such rate be developed and actively\nused as soon as practicable. And we look forward to working with financial institutions\nand other market participants to achieve this end.\nIn the near term, the Federal Reserve, along with other government agencies,\nintends to meet with a wide range of market participants, including end users, to hear\ntheir views as to how change can be effected and to begin the work of developing\nalternatives to LIBOR. Later this year, we will convene a group of the largest global\ndealers to discuss these issues, following a model that was successfully used to promote\nderivatives reform. Searching for potential alternative rates and encouraging their use\nwill be a key point of that discussion. Of course, end users will be affected by these\nchanges as well, and we will also consult closely with key participants outside of the\ndealer community to make sure that reform meets their needs and is not disruptive to\nthem. In particular, end users who want to continue to use LIBOR will certainly be able\nto do so, and we will work toward the goal of ensuring that any changes to LIBOR will\nnot require borrowers or lenders to amend their existing contracts. And the markets that\nreference dollar LIBOR are so enormous that there will surely be more than enough\nliquidity to support both a new risk free rate as well as LIBOR itself.\nOne of the lessons that I take from our study of LIBOR is that these existing\nlegacy contracts are quite important. As I mentioned earlier, many financial contracts,\nincluding derivatives contracts, do not have robust backups in the event that the reference\nrates they use cease to exist. Some derivatives, such as interest rate swaps, can be quite\nlong lasting, and, over a long enough period of time, there is always a risk that any given\nreference rate will cease being published. It is important that financial contracts address\n\n- 11 -\nthe need for a backup plan if a reference rate does cease to function. This issue is\nsomething that we intend to bring up with market participants and end users as we meet\nwith them.\nConclusion\nMy hope is that governments, market participants, and end users can work\ntogether to build a stronger foundation for the reference interest rates that are so critical\nto our financial system. Implementation of these measures is clearly in the interest of\nU.S. financial stability. I also hope and expect that individual financial institutions will\nunderstand that it is also in their private interests. Reference rates are one of the\nfoundations of the financial system, and it is in the interest of everyone, from the\nresidential mortgage holder to the financial institutions that heavily use these rates, that\nthose foundations have integrity and be well constructed and resistant to manipulation.\nAs I said at the beginning, the problems with LIBOR have undermined the public’s trust\nin the financial system. In light of the need to regain that trust, I am certain that our\nreform efforts will meet with the active cooperation of financial institutions in carrying\nforward these reforms.",

I am pleased, though\nnot surprised, to see such great interest in the topic of today’s conference—the integrated\nreview of the capital framework for large banks. I want to thank Vice Chair for\nSupervision Bowman for having the great idea of holding this event at the outset of her\nterm. I would also like to thank Fed staff for their tireless work in putting the conference\ntogether.\nToday we will hear the perspectives of industry veterans, academics, and current\nand former policymakers who are all well-versed in the operations of large banks and the\nmain pillars of the capital framework. A great benefit of this conference is the chance to\nconsider all elements of the capital framework in concert, rather than look at each in\nisolation. We need to ensure that all the different pieces of the capital framework work\ntogether effectively. Doing so will help maintain a safe, sound, and efficient banking\nsystem, for the benefit of the people we serve. The U.S. bank capital framework includes\nrisk-based capital requirements, leverage requirements, the surcharge for the largest and\nmost complex banks, and the stress tests. We will discuss the status of each of those\nelements, and the road ahead, in a comprehensive manner. As this audience will know,\nwe have proposals outstanding or in the works across all four areas.\nOur regulatory capital framework and all banking rules are implemented through\nsupervision, an area where Vice Chair for Supervision Bowman brings deep experience\nas a former banker and state supervisor. As she has noted, we need to make sure that our\nsupervisory practices focus on the critical areas that determine safety and soundness. We\nneed our large banks to be well capitalized and to manage their key risks well. And we\n\n- 2 -\nneed large banks to be free to compete with one another, with nonbank financial firms,\nand with banks in other jurisdictions to provide capital and support economic growth.\nThe Fed is a dynamic institution.

Powell\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe Economic Club of Indiana\nIndianapolis, Indiana\nNovember 29, 2016\n\nThank you for the opportunity to speak here today. My plan is to discuss the U.S.\neconomy from three different perspectives. I will start by taking stock of the current\nexpansion--a business cycle point of view. Then I will shift the focus to some of the\nlonger-term challenges we face in coming years. I will conclude with a discussion of\nmonetary policy. As always, the views I express here today are mine alone.\nThe Current State of the Economy\nAs you know, the Congress has tasked the Federal Reserve with achieving stable\nprices and maximum employment--the dual mandate. Today, we are not far from\nachieving those goals.\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has an objective of 2 percent for\ninflation, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption\nexpenditures. The Committee sees this objective as symmetrical, so that minor\ndeviations above or below 2 percent are treated alike.1 Inflation has consistently run\nbelow 2 percent since 2011, and is now at 1.2 percent over the past 12 months (figure 1).\nThis headline measure of inflation has recently been held down by falling energy and\nfood prices. We also monitor core inflation, which excludes the volatile energy and food\ncomponents because they often send a misleading signal about underlying inflation\npressures. Core inflation is running at 1.7 percent over the past 12 months. Both\nmeasures have gradually moved upward toward 2 percent.\nU.S. inflation trended steadily lower after the Volcker disinflation of 1981 to 1982\nand has been low and reasonably stable for many years. In fact, for the past several years\ninflation has run below policy targets in many parts of the world, including here in the\n1 See the FOMC’s “Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy,” FOMC, January 26,\n2016, www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals_20160126.pdf.\n\n- 2 -\nUnited States. Many of us are old enough to remember when the only challenge was to\nkeep inflation low. But too-low inflation can also be a serious problem. Below-target\ninflation increases the real value of debts owed by households and businesses and reduces\nthe ability of central banks to respond to downturns.\nThe public’s expectations about inflation are thought to be an important driver of\nactual inflation. Many measures of U.S. inflation expectations--both from surveys and\nfrom market-based readings--are still well below their pre-crisis levels, although some\nhave moved up as of late. The only way to ensure that inflation expectations remain\nsafely anchored near the FOMC’s target is to keep inflation close to that target on a\nconsistent basis. So, while the current shortfall may seem small, it is important that\ninflation continue to move up to 2 percent, as I expect it will.\nThe FOMC does not have a numerical goal for maximum employment because\nthe long-run sustainable level of employment changes over time and is determined\nmainly by nonmonetary factors that are outside the Fed’s control, such as evolving labor\nmarket practices, demographics, social change, and fiscal and regulatory policies.\nNonetheless, four times each year FOMC participants write down their estimates of the\nlonger-run normal level of the unemployment rate (the natural rate); at the September\nFOMC meeting the median estimate was 4.8 percent, very close to the current\nunemployment rate of 4.9 percent.\nOther labor market measures are also healthy, including payroll job creation and\nlabor force participation. Employers have been adding roughly 180,000 jobs per month\nso far this year--a pace a little below that of the past several years but significantly higher\nthan underlying growth in the labor force (figure 2). Despite these strong job gains, the\n\n- 3 -\nunemployment rate has flattened out this year after several years of sharp declines, thanks\nto welcome developments in labor force participation (figure 3).\nThe labor force participation rate represents the percentage of adults aged 16 and\nover who are in the labor force, which is defined to include only those who are employed\nor actively looking for work. When people enter or reenter the labor force and begin to\nsearch for a job, that is generally a good thing even though at the margin their entry tends\nto increase the unemployment rate (or prevent it from declining). Beginning in the\n1960s, labor force participation rose steadily as women entered the paid workforce\n(figure 4). That trend ran its course as participation peaked around 2000 and has declined\nsteadily since then as a result of the aging of our population and other longer-run trends,\nnotably the decline in participation by men in the heart of their working-age years. Going\nforward, many analysts expect labor force participation to decline at a trend rate of\nroughly 0.3 percent per year as a result of these factors. However, participation fell much\nmore sharply than that after the financial crisis. Some of those who left the labor force\nwent back to school, but others moved onto disability, took early retirement, or just\nbecame discouraged and stopped seeking work. The sharp drop raised fears that the\ncrisis might leave behind permanent damage to our labor force. Fortunately, since late\n2013, the participation rate has remained about flat and thus has gradually moved back\nclose to its estimated longer-term trend.2 On net, people have been entering and\nremaining in the labor market as job prospects have brightened, offsetting the natural\ndecline from population aging.\n2 The current participation rate is within the range of estimates cited in Stephanie Aaronson, Tomaz Cajner,\nBruce Fallick, Felix Galbis-Reig, Christopher Smith, and William Wascher (2014), “Labor Force\nParticipation: Recent Developments and Future Prospects,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Fall,\npp. 197-275, www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Fall2014BPEA_Aaronson_et_al.pdf.\n\n- 4 -\nSurveys of households and firms also suggest that we are near full employment\n(figure 5). For example, respondents are now more likely to say that jobs are plentiful\nthan that they are hard to get--a response that has generally been seen when the economy\nis near full employment. Job vacancies are running at high levels, and firms report that it\nis getting harder to find employees to fill open positions. Moreover, wages are now\nrising faster than inflation, and faster than output per hour. Taken together, labor market\nindicators show an economy that is on solid footing and close to our mandate of\nmaximum employment.\nIt is interesting to compare this expansion to past U.S. expansions, and also to\nrecoveries of other countries since the end of the Global Financial Crisis. The picture is a\nmixed one. The current recovery has been under way since June 2009--nearly seven and\na half years. It will soon be the third longest of the 20 recoveries since the founding of\nthe Federal Reserve in 1913. GDP, or output, is now 11 percent higher than its pre-crisis\npeak. Employment is now 6.5 million higher than its pre-crisis peak.\nBut this expansion has also had the slowest pace of GDP growth of any postwar\nrecovery (figure 6). Given steady but modest growth, we have seen surprisingly large\ngains in employment and, until this year, a rapid reduction in the unemployment rate.\nEven though GDP growth has been slow, job gains during this recovery have been\nstronger than those during the previous expansion--the so-called jobless recovery of the\nearly 2000s. The combination of weak growth and strong hiring in this expansion\nimplies small increases in output per hour, or productivity. In fact, productivity has been\nincreasing at a dismal pace, compared with virtually any period in the postwar era. I will\nreturn to productivity and growth in a moment.\n\n- 5 -\nMore positively, our current recovery compares fairly well with those of other\nadvanced economies (figure 7). Output has increased faster, and unemployment has\ndeclined faster, in the United States than in other major advanced economies. And the\nFed’s challenges in getting inflation back up to 2 percent are similar to, but not as severe\nas, those faced by some other major monetary authorities.\nTurning to the near-term outlook, after a slow patch in the first half of this year,\ngrowth has clearly strengthened. I expect that the economy will continue on its path of\nthe last few years, with real GDP growth of about 2 percent, strong job gains, a tightening\nlabor market, and inflation moving up toward our 2 percent objective. The main risks I\nsee to that outlook are from abroad. Growth and inflation are low around the world.\nWith interest rates so low, we are not well positioned to respond to negative shocks,\nwhatever the source.\nLonger-Run Challenges\nProductivity and Growth\nLet’s turn to longer-run challenges, and start by asking why growth has been so\nslow, and how fast we are likely to grow going forward. This next slide shows the five-\nyear trailing average annual real GDP growth rate (figure 8). By this measure, growth\naveraged about 3.2 percent annually through the 1970s, the 1980s, and the 1990s. But\ngrowth began to decline after 2000 and then nose-dived with the onset of the Global\nFinancial Crisis in 2007 and the slow expansion that followed. Since the financial crisis\nended in 2009, forecasters have gradually reduced their estimates of long-run trend\n\n- 6 -\ngrowth from about 3 percent to about 2 percent--a seemingly small difference that would\nmake a huge difference in living standards over time.3\nHow much of this decline is just a particularly bad business cycle, and how much\nrepresents a long-run downshift? To get at that question, let’s take a deeper look at the\ngrowth slowdown. We can think of economic growth as coming from two sources: more\nhours worked (labor supply) or higher output per hour (productivity). Hours worked\nmainly depends on growth in the labor force, which has been slowing since the mid-\n2000s as the baby-boom generation ages. As you can see, the labor force is now growing\nat only about 0.5 percent per year (figure 9). Another way to see this is through the\nsustained increase in the ratio of people over 65 to those who are in their prime working\nyears (figure 10). This long-expected demographic fact has now arrived, and it has\nchallenging implications for our potential growth and also for our fiscal policy.4\nThe unexpected part of the growth slowdown reflects weak productivity growth\nrather than lower labor supply. Labor productivity has increased only 1/2 percent per\nyear since 2010--the smallest five-year rate of increase since World War II and about\none-fourth of the average postwar rate (figure 11). The slowdown in productivity has\nbeen worldwide and is evident even in countries that were little affected by the crisis\n(figure 12). Given the global nature of the phenomenon, it is unlikely that U.S.-specific\nfactors are mainly responsible.\n3 See Jerome H. Powell (2016), “Recent Economic Developments, the Productive Potential of the\nEconomy, and Monetary Policy,” speech delivered at the Peterson Institute for International Economics,\nWashington, D.C., May 26, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20160526a.htm.\n4 Congressional Budget Office (2016), The 2016 Long-Term Budget Outlook, (Washington: CBO, July),\nwww.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/114th-congress-2015-2016/reports/51580-LTBO.pdf.\n\n- 7 -\nA portion of the productivity slowdown is undoubtedly due to low levels of\ninvestment by businesses. The financial crisis and the Great Recession left firms with\nexcess capacity, reducing incentives to invest. If businesses expect slower growth to\ncontinue, that will also hold down investment.\nThe other important factor is the decline in what economists call total factor\nproductivity, or TFP, which is the part of productivity that is not explained by capital\ninvestment or increases in the skills of the labor force. TFP is thought to be mainly a\nfunction of technological innovation and efficiency gains.\nThere is no consensus about the future direction of productivity.5 The pessimists\nargue that the big paradigm-changing innovations, such as electrification or the advent of\ncomputers, are behind us. If that is so, then our standard of living will increase more\nslowly going forward. The optimists think that this slowdown is only a passing phase\nand that the age of robots and machine learning will transform our economy in coming\ndecades. Still others argue that we are currently underestimating productivity and output\nbecause of the real difficulties we face in measuring GDP in a modern economy. For\nexample, how do we measure the value-added of free digital services like Facebook or\nTwitter?6\nThe future is, as always, uncertain. But I would sum up the growth discussion as\nfollows. Growth in the labor force has slowed, and we can estimate it with reasonable\n5 On the pessimistic end of the spectrum are analysts such as Robert Gordon, The Rise and Fall of\nAmerican Growth: The U.S. Standard of Living since the Civil War (Princeton University Press, 2016).\nAmong the optimists are Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee, The Second Machine Age: Work,\nProgress, and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies (W. W. Norton & Company, 2014).\n6 See David M. Byrne, John G. Fernald, and Marshall B. Reinsdorf (2016), “Does the United States Have a\nProductivity Slowdown or Measurement Problem?” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, March 4,\nwww.brookings.edu/bpea-articles/does-the-united-states-have-a-productivity-slowdown-or-a-measurement-\nproblem.\n\n- 8 -\nconfidence to be only about 0.5 percent. Growth in productivity is both more important\nand much harder to predict. Productivity varies significantly over time, as figure 11\nshowed. If productivity growth returns to, say, 1.5 percent, then the U.S. economy could\ngrow at about 2.0 percent over the long term. Actual growth may turn out to be weaker\nor stronger, and the choices we make as a society will have something to say about that.\nWhy Are Long-Term Interest Rates So Low?\nLet’s turn to the related question of why long-term interest rates are so\nextraordinarily low in advanced economies around the world. The yield on our own\nbenchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury security has increased lately, but at 2.3 percent it is still\nfar below what was normal before the financial crisis. In fact, this next chart shows that,\nas growth and inflation have fallen, longer term interest rates have fallen as well over the\npast 35 years (figure 13).\nSo why are long-term interest rates so low? Many of you will no doubt be\nthinking, “They are low because you people at the Fed set them low!” While there is an\nelement of truth there, that is not the whole story. The FOMC has considerable control\nover short-term interest rates. We have much less influence over long-term rates, which\nare set in the marketplace. Long-term interest rates represent the price that balances the\nsupply of saving by lenders and demand for funds by borrowers, such as businesses\nneeding to fund their capital expenditures. Lenders expect to receive a real return and to\nbe compensated for inflation and for the risk of nonpayment. Meanwhile, borrowers\nadjust their demand for funds based on their changing assessment of the risks and\nexpected returns of their investment projects. When desired saving rises or investment\n\n- 9 -\ndemand falls, then long-term interest rates will decline. Today’s very low level of long-\nterm rates suggests that both of these factors are at play.\nBoth expectations of slower growth and the aging of our population are having\nsignificant effects on desired saving and investment and are thus important causes of\nlower interest rates. If the economy is expanding more slowly, then the level of\ninvestment needed to meet demand will be lower. The lower path of growth reduces\nfuture income prospects of households, and they will tend to raise their saving. The\npending retirement of baby boomers means higher saving, because people tend to save\nthe most in the years just before their retirement. In addition, the lower rate of return on\ncapital owing to lower productivity growth will lead to less investment and lower interest\nrates.\nAs with productivity, the factors behind the fall in U.S. interest rates include an\nimportant global component, as rates are low around the world. Indeed, although our\nrates are near historical lows, U.S. Treasury rates are among the highest among the major\nadvanced economy sovereigns (figure 14).\nIs This the New Normal?\nWhat can we do to prevent low growth, low inflation, and low interest rates from\nbecoming the new normal? We need to focus on ways to increase our long-term growth\nand spread that prosperity as broadly as possible. I hasten to add that these policies are,\nfor the most part, outside the purview of the Federal Reserve. We need policies that\nsupport productivity growth, business hiring and investment, labor force participation,\nand the development of skills. We need effective fiscal and regulatory policies that\ninspire public confidence. Increased spending on public infrastructure may raise private-\n\n- 10 -\nsector productivity over time, particularly with the growth of the stock of public\ninfrastructure near an all-time low.7 Greater support for public and private research and\ndevelopment, and policies that improve product and labor market dynamism may also be\nfruitful.8 Monetary policy can contribute by supporting a strong and durable expansion\nin a context of price stability.\nMonetary Policy\nThe low interest rate environment presents special challenges for monetary\npolicy. In setting our target for the federal funds rate, a good place to start is to identify\nthe rate that would prevail if the economy were at 2 percent inflation and full\nemployment--the so-called neutral rate. “Neutral” in this context means that the rate is\nneither contractionary nor expansionary. If the fed funds rate is lower than the neutral\nrate, then policy is stimulative or accommodative, which will tend to raise growth and\ninflation. If the fed funds rate is higher than the neutral rate, then policy is tight and will\ntend to slow growth and reduce inflation.\nBut we can only estimate the neutral rate, and those estimates are subject to\nsubstantial uncertainty. Before the crisis, the long-run neutral rate was generally thought\nto be roughly stable at around 4.25 percent. Since the crisis, estimates have steadily\n7 See, for example, Abdul Abiad, Davide Furceri, and Petia Topalova (2014), “IMF Survey: The Time Is\nRight for an Infrastructure Push,” World Economic Outlook (Washington: International Monetary Fund,\nOctober), www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2015/09/28/04/53/sores093014a.\n8 See, for example, International Monetary Fund (2016), “Acting Now, Acting Together,” Fiscal Monitor\n(Washington: IMF, April), www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fm/2016/01/fmindex.htm; Ryan A. Decker, John\nHaltiwanger, Ron S. Jarmin, and Javier Miranda (2016), “Declining Business Dynamism: What We Know\nand the Way Forward,” American Economic Review, vol. 106 (May), pp. 203-07,\nwww.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.p20161050; Steven Davis and John Haltiwanger (2014), “Labor\nMarket Fluidity and Economic Performance,” NBER Working Paper Series 20479 (Cambridge, Mass:\nNational Bureau of Economic Research, September); The Department of the Treasury Office of Economic\nPolicy, the Council of Economic Advisers, and the Department of Labor (2015), “Occupational Licensing:\nA Framework for Policymakers” (Washington: The White House, July),\nwww.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/licensing_report_final_nonembargo.pdf.\n\n- 11 -\ndeclined, and the median estimate by FOMC participants stood at 2.9 percent in\nSeptember. Many analysts believe that the neutral rate is even lower than that today and\nwill only return to its long-run value over time.9 The low level of the neutral interest rate\nhas several important implications. First, today’s low rates are not as stimulative as they\nseem--consider that, despite historically low rates, inflation has run consistently below\ntarget and housing construction remains far below pre-crisis levels. Second, with rates so\nlow, central banks are not well positioned to counteract a renewed bout of weakness.\nThird, persistently low interest rates can raise financial stability concerns. A long period\nof very low interest rates could lead to excessive risk-taking and, over time, to\nunsustainably high asset prices and credit growth. These are risks that we monitor\ncarefully. Higher growth would increase the neutral rate and help address these issues.\nTurning to the outlook for monetary policy, incoming data show an economy that\nis growing at a healthy pace, with solid payroll job gains and inflation gradually moving\nup to 2 percent. In my view, the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has clearly\nstrengthened since our previous meeting earlier this month. Of course, the path of rates\nwill depend on the path of the economy. With inflation below target, relatively slow\ngrowth, and some slack remaining in the economy, the Committee has been patient about\nraising rates. That patience has paid dividends. But moving too slowly could eventually\nmean that the Committee would have to tighten policy abruptly to avoid overshooting our\ngoals.\n9 See, for example, Kathryn Holston, Thomas Laubach, and John Williams (2016), “Measuring the Natural\nRate of Interest: International Trends and Determinants,” Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco Working\nPaper 2016-11 (August), http://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/files/wp2016-11.pdf; Benjamin K.\nJohannsen and Elmar Mertens (2016), “The Expected Real Interest Rate in the Long Run: Time Series\nEvidence with the Effective Lower Bound,” FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System, February 9), http://dx.doi.org/10.17016/2380-7172.1703.\n\n- 12 -\nConclusion\nTo wrap up, since the end of the Great Recession in 2009, our economy has\nrecovered slowly but steadily. Today, we are reasonably close to achieving full\nemployment and our 2 percent inflation objective. But we face real challenges over the\nmedium and longer terms. Our aging population will mean slower growth, all else held\nequal. If living standards are to continue to rise, we need policies that will support\nproductivity and allow our dynamic economy to generate widespread gains in prosperity.\n\nRecent Economic Developments and Longer-Term\nChallenges\nJerome Powell\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nNovember 29, 2016\n\n1.

    "text": "For release on delivery\n1:00 p.m. EST\nFebruary 22, 2017\nThe Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy\nRemarks by\nJerome H. Powell\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nForecasters Club of New York Luncheon\nNew York, New York\nFebruary 22, 2017\n\nThank you for this invitation to speak here today. I will begin by taking stock of\nthe progress of the U.S. economy. I will then discuss longer-term challenges for the\neconomy and wrap up with a discussion of monetary policy. As usual, my comments\nreflect my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (FOMC).\nThe Current State of the Economy\nThe Congress has tasked the Federal Reserve with achieving stable prices and\nmaximum employment--the dual mandate. The FOMC has set a longer-term price\nstability objective of 2 percent annual inflation, as measured by the PCE (personal\nconsumption expenditures) price index.1 This is a symmetric objective, meaning that the\nCommittee would be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or below 2\npercent. Until early last year, inflation was running substantially below our 2 percent\nobjective, largely reflecting declines in energy prices during late 2014 and early 2015.\nHowever, because prices of energy and food commodities are often volatile, a core\nmeasure that excludes these components provides a better indication of where overall\ninflation is headed. While core inflation has also run consistently below 2 percent in\nrecent years, it has been gradually rising, with the most recent 12-month reading at 1.7\npercent, three-tenths higher than a year ago (the black line in figure 1). Market-based\nmeasures of inflation compensation have moved well above their lows of mid-2016 but\nremain below pre-crisis levels, and survey measures have stayed relatively well anchored.\nOverall, inflation seems to be on track to reach the 2 percent objective over the next\n1 See the FOMC’s Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, available in Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System (2017), Monetary Policy Report (Washington: Board of\nGovernors, February), https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/20170214_mprfullreport.pdf.\n\n- 2 -\ncouple of years. Although inflation is currently below our objective, core inflation has\ngenerally been close to 2 percent over the past 20 years. This outcome reflects the\nsuccess of monetary policy in anchoring inflation expectations.\nMany indicators show that we have also made significant progress toward\nmaximum employment. Since 2010, payroll employment has increased by almost 16\nmillion jobs, and the unemployment rate has fallen from 10 percent to 4.8 percent--in line\nwith most estimates of the longer-run normal level (or natural rate) of unemployment and\nwith the median estimate by FOMC participants in the December 2016 Summary of\nEconomic Projections (SEP). Accordingly, the red line in the figure indicates that the\nunemployment rate gap has essentially been closed.2\nA variety of other measures also suggest that we are close to maximum\nemployment. Surveys of household sentiment about the availability of jobs and of\nbusiness sentiment regarding the difficulty of filling jobs have now reached levels seen in\nprior periods of full employment. Moreover, although the pace of wage increases is\nslower than during pre-crisis periods of full employment, wages have been increasing\nfaster than both output per hour (productivity) and inflation, and labor’s share of income\nhas begun to move up after a long decline.\nAll in all, we appear to be close to our employment objective, and are nearing our\ninflation objective. While the pace of progress has at times been frustratingly slow, this\noutcome is a better one than that achieved by most other advanced economies. Even so,\nit is worth remembering that the current and future states of the economy are always\n2 Figure 1 reports the unemployment rate gap using the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates\nbecause they extend further back in time than projections from the SEP. The CBO’s estimate of the natural\nrate for 2017 is 4.7 percent.\n\n- 3 -\nuncertain, and today is no exception. Our discussions of the economy may sometimes\nring in the ears of the public with more certainty than is appropriate. Take the concept of\n“maximum employment,” which requires an estimate of both the natural rate of\nunemployment for those who are in the labor force and the sustainable level of labor\nforce participation.3 The natural rate of unemployment is not directly observed, and the\nrecord suggests that it could be materially lower or higher than current estimates.4 There\nis also uncertainty about the underlying trend level of labor force participation.\nParticipation has been declining since about 2000 because of the aging of our population\nand other secular trends, and analysts generally agree that participation will continue to\ndecline over time for these reasons (figure 2). A canonical paper by a group of Fed\neconomists estimates a trend rate of decline of about 0.3 percentage point per year.5\nAfter declining sharply and dipping well below the prior trend in the years following the\ncrisis, participation has been roughly flat since late 2013. Relative to this estimate of the\ndeclining trend, three years of flat participation implies a cyclical improvement of\nroughly 1 percentage point. But there is a range of views on the underlying trend and\nwhether we can expect a bit more near-term cyclical improvement in participation. The\n3 The labor force is made up of people who have jobs as well as people who are jobless but are looking for\na job and are available to work. See Bureau of Labor Statistics, “Labor Force Participation,” webpage,\nhttps://www.bls.gov/bls/cps_fact_sheets/lfp_mock.htm (accessed February 17, 2017).\n4 Confidence intervals around statistical estimates of the natural rate are routinely estimated to be quite\nwide, reflecting both uncertainty about the correct model specification as well as uncertainty about the\nparameter estimates given the model. The canonical paper by Staiger, Stock, and Watson puts the\n95 percent confidence interval at 1-1/2 percentage points on either side of the point estimate. See Douglas\nStaiger, James H. Stock, and Mark W. Watson (1997), “How Precise Are Estimates of the Natural Rate of\nUnemployment?” in Christina D. Romer and David H. Romer, eds., Reducing Inflation: Motivation and\nStrategy (Chicago: University of Chicago Press).\n5 See Stephanie Aaronson, Tomaz Cajner, Bruce Fallick, Felix Galbis-Reig, Christopher Smith, and\nWilliam Wascher (2014), “Labor Force Participation: Recent Developments and Future Prospects,”\nBrookings Papers on Economic Activity, Fall, pp. 197-275, https://www.brookings.edu/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2016/07/Fall2014BPEA_Aaronson_et_al.pdf.\n\n- 4 -\nCongressional Budget Office estimates that participation is currently 0.7 percentage point\nbelow its trend rate, which suggests remaining upside potential. By contrast, other recent\nwork does not find a strong case for a meaningful further slack.6 The issue has important\nimplications, since changes in participation can have material effects on the\nunemployment rate: Holding the level of employment constant, a 25 basis point change\nin the participation rate would lead roughly to a corresponding 40 basis point change in\nthe unemployment rate.\nLonger-Run Issues\nProductivity and growth\nOur economy is strong and operating near its capacity. But we face important\nchallenges when it comes to the longer-term growth rate of the economy. Long-term\neconomic growth depends mainly on nonmonetary factors such as population growth and\nworkforce participation, the skills and aptitudes of our workforce, the tools at their\ndisposal, and the pace of technological advance. Fiscal and regulatory policies can have\nimportant effects on these factors. The main long-run contribution monetary policy can\nmake is to provide a stable macroeconomic and financial environment. The level of\npotential growth does have important implications for monetary policy.\nOne of the surprising features of this expansion has been that 2 percent growth in\nreal gross domestic product (GDP) has been enough to create solid job gains and\nunexpectedly large declines in unemployment. During much of the recovery, forecasters\n6 See Congressional Budget Office (2017), The Budget and Economic Outlook: 2017 to 2027\n(Washington: CBO, January), https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/115th-congress-2017-\n2018/reports/52370-outlook.pdf; and Alan B. Krueger (2016), “Where Have all the Workers Gone?” paper\npresented at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston’s 60th Economic Conference, held at the Federal Reserve\nBank of Boston, Boston, October 4, https://www.bostonfed.org/-/media/Documents/economic/conf/great-\nrecovery-2016/Alan-B-Krueger.pdf.\n\n- 5 -\nhave been overly optimistic about growth but too pessimistic on job creation and the\ndecline in the unemployment rate. In 2007, the average expectation for long-run GDP\ngrowth from the Blue Chip survey of 50 forecasters was 2.9 percent (figure 3). The\nconsensus estimate has moved down steadily since then and is now at 2.1 percent. Other\nforecasters have also lowered their estimates over time, including those sampled by the\nSurvey of Professional Forecasters and, yes, FOMC participants.7 Yet, as this figure\nshows, unemployment has declined faster than expected.\nMore than the expected number of workers have been required to produce less\nthan the expected amount of output. The implication is that trend productivity and,\nultimately, potential growth are lower than expected. The decline in estimates of\npotential growth has been driven largely by unexpectedly weak productivity growth.\nLabor productivity has increased only 1/2 percent per year, on average, since 2011--the\nworst performance over such a period since World War II (figure 4). As this figure\nshows, productivity growth moves around significantly over time and has averaged about\n2 percent since 1970. One factor behind the decline since the financial crisis is the\nrelatively slow increase in the capital stock per worker, as weak demand and uncertainty\nabout the future have held back business investment. But the more important factor has\nbeen the marked decline in total factor productivity (TFP), which represents the part of\nproductivity that is not explained by capital increases or increases in the skills of the\nlabor force. TFP is thought to be mainly a function of technological innovation and\n7 The history of longer-run forecasts for real GDP growth from the SEP is shown in figure 4 of Jerome H.\nPowell (2016), “A View from the Fed,” speech delivered at the Brookings Institution, Washington,\nNovember 30, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20161130a.htm.\n\n- 6 -\nefficiency gains. The decline in TFP growth has been widespread across advanced\neconomies, suggesting that global trends are at play.8\nThere is no consensus about the future direction of productivity growth.9 Some\nargue that the important paradigm-changing innovations are behind us, while others think\nthat this slowdown is only a passing phase. One thing on which all agree is that the\nfuture prospects for productivity growth and potential GDP are highly uncertain. I hope\nthere is also broad agreement on the need for policies that maximize potential growth and\nspread prosperity as widely as possible. We need policies that encourage labor force\nparticipation and investment in education and training, in infrastructure, and in\nbusinesses. These policies are, of course, mostly outside the authority of the Federal\nReserve.\nLow interest rates\nAnother unanticipated feature of this recovery has been the low level of both\nshort- and longer-term interest rates. At 2.4 percent, the yield on the 10-year Treasury is\nfar below levels typically seen before the financial crisis (figure 5). Of course, Fed\n8 There may also be a role for homegrown factors, such as the decrease in business dynamism. See Jerome\nH. Powell (2016), “Recent Economic Developments, Monetary Policy Considerations, and Longer-Term\nProspects,” speech delivered at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, Chicago, June 28,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20160628a.htm.

Norton &\nCompany).\n\n- 7 -\npolicy is a factor in holding down longer-term yields. But longer-term rates have been\ndeclining for more than 30 years, for several reasons. Much of the decline is due to\nsignificantly lower long-term expectations of inflation, as well as reduced term\npremiums, likely reflecting both lower inflation risk and the fact that, with anchored\ninflation expectations, nominal bonds have become an attractive hedge against market\nrisk. Regulatory changes have raised demand for safe assets. Lower potential growth\nimplies lower returns and therefore lower rates. Changes in savings and investment\ndemand owing to demographics and other factors have put downward pressure on yields\nas well.\nAs a result, the real federal funds rate that is neither contractionary nor\nexpansionary when the economy is operating near its potential--the so-called neutral real\nrate or r*--has declined significantly. We cannot directly observe the neutral rate but can\nonly infer it from the evolution of the economy--it “is seen by its works.”10 The neutral\nrate changes significantly over time, and estimates of its level entail substantial\nuncertainty.11 Before the crisis, the longer-run neutral real rate was generally thought to\nbe roughly stable at around 2.25 percent. Since the crisis, estimates have declined\nsteadily. For example, the median estimate implied by FOMC participants stood at 1.0\npercent in the December 2016 SEP. Many analysts believe that the neutral rate is even\n10 See John H. Williams (1931), “The Monetary Doctrines of J. M.

I expect the economy to continue\nbroadly along its current path, which implies further labor market tightening and inflation\nedging closer to 2 percent. On this path, unemployment would decline modestly below\ncurrent estimates of the natural rate and remain there for some time. I see that as a\ndesirable outcome and do not see data suggesting that we are behind the curve. In recent\nyears, the economy has faced significant downside risks, particularly from weak global\nconditions. The Committee has been quite patient, and I believe that has served us well.\nBut risks now seems to me to be more in balance. Going forward, I see it as appropriate\nto gradually tighten policy as long as the economy continues to behave roughly as\nexpected. As always, the actual path could be faster or slower than expected and will\ndepend on developments in the economy.\nBefore concluding, I would like to turn briefly to a discussion of how policy\ndecisions are made, including the role of simple monetary policy rules. Since the 1990s,\ncentral banks have grown ever more communicative about their monetary policy\n12 See, for example, Kathryn Holston, Thomas Laubach, and John C. Williams (2016), “Measuring the\nNatural Rate of Interest: International Trends and Determinants,” Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nWorking Paper Series 2016-11 (San Francisco: Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, August),\nhttp://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/files/wp2016-11.pdf; Benjamin K.

A central tenet that underlies this increase in transparency is that monetary\npolicy is more effective when the public understands how the central bank will respond to\nchanging conditions, and can calibrate expectations accordingly.13 That means that the\nCommittee must have a clearly communicated, systematic way of responding to changes\nin economic conditions and the outlook. In that spirit, the FOMC takes a forward-\nlooking approach to policymaking, whereby each policy decision the FOMC makes is\ngrounded not just in current assessments of the economy but also in expectations for how\nthe economy will evolve relative to our goals. Individual participants develop their own\nforecasts of the economy’s evolution. The Committee then makes a collective decision,\nembodied in the postmeeting statement, setting monetary policy to achieve those goals.14\nOver time, incoming information and shocks to the economy inevitably alter views of the\nappropriate path for monetary policy. One way of seeing this is through the SEP\nforecasts of individual FOMC participants. These forecasts tend to converge over time to\nthe Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective and to each individual’s interpretation of\nmaximum employment, because each individual explicitly writes down a path for policy\nthat is intended to achieve those outcomes. Accordingly, revisions to the projections tend\n13 See Michael Woodford (2001), “Monetary Policy in the Information Economy,” paper presented at\n“Economic Policy for the Information Economy,” a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of\nKansas City, held in Jackson Hole, Wyo., Aug. 30-Sept. 1, pp. 297-370,\nhttps://www.kansascityfed.org/publicat/sympos/2001/papers/S02wood.pdf; and Alan S.

For example,\neconomists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland regularly update on the Bank’s\nwebsite an analysis of seven different rules and their prescriptions.17\nA good way to see the range of possibilities is through a generalized form of a\nTaylor-type rule (figure 6).18 As you can see, this rule is based on key factors for\nmonetary policy, such as the neutral real rate of interest, or r*, and deviations of inflation\nand output or unemployment from their longer-run values. While these are often called\n“simple” rules, application of a rule requires a significant number of important choices.\nIt is necessary to pick a value or a path for r*. The rule also calls for an estimate of the\noutput or unemployment rate gap. There is particularly high uncertainty about measuring\nthe deviation of output from its potential; our real-time estimates of this gap are often\n15 The SEP is not a “consensus” forecast of the Committee, and the interest rate projections in the SEP are\neach individual participant’s assessment of appropriate monetary policy. Thus, the Committee’s forward-\nlooking approach to policymaking is not the same as the forecast-targeting approach advocated by\nSvensson (2005) and others. See Lars E.O. Svensson (2005), “Monetary Policy with Judgment: Forecast\nTargeting,” International Journal of Central Banking, vol. 1 (June), pp. 1-54.\n16 For another discussion of simple rules and their role in the Committee’s policy process, see Stanley\nFischer (2017), “I’d Rather Have Bob Solow Than an Econometric Model, But . . . ,” speech delivered at\nthe Warwick Economics Summit, Coventry, United Kingdom, February 11,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/fischer20170211a.htm.\n17 See Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland (2017), “Simple Monetary Policy Rules,” webpage, Federal\nReserve Bank of Cleveland, https://www.clevelandfed.org/our-research/indicators-and-data/simple-\nmonetary-policy-rules.aspx.\n18 See John B.

To reduce that uncertainty, we often use the\nunemployment gap rather than the output gap in these rules.19 We also need to pick\nvalues for the coefficients a and b, whether they are the values John Taylor posited in his\nseminal 1993 article or other values from the vast literature that has come since.20\nThere are still other choices to make. Traditional policy rules are backward\nlooking in the sense that they use available data about inflation and output. But monetary\npolicy needs to be forward looking, as I discussed, and there are rules that rely on\nforecasts of inflation and output. Finally, many have advanced the view that, when times\nare particularly uncertain, monetary policy should react cautiously to incoming\ninformation.21 That insight leads to rules that incorporate inertia, thereby slowing down\nthe movement of rates over time. Each of these insights has some validity, and each has\nimportant implications for the prescriptions of a policy rule.\n19 In general, the unemployment rate is more informative of the state of the business cycle than GDP\nbecause of the difficulties in estimating potential output.

If we replace that intercept with\nthe median of the longer-run r* from the December 2016 SEP, which is 1 percent (the\nblue dashed line), we see that the rule prescribes policy interest rates lower than the\nunadjusted rule. However, many observers believe that the neutral real interest rate is\ncurrently well below its longer-run value.

Some estimates put the current value of r* close to\nzero, which leads to the purple dashed-dotted line in figure 8.25\nFigure 9 provides prescriptions from the policy rules shown in figure 7 that vary\nalong dimensions other than the neutral real rate. The first-difference rule shown by the\npurple dashed-dotted line incorporates forecasts by prescribing changes to the federal\nfunds rate based on projected inflation relative to its objective and the projected change in\nthe output gap.26 The insight behind this rule is that it does not require estimates of the\nneutral real rate or the level of the output gap.27 The green dashed line shows the policy\nprescription from an inertial version of the “balanced approach” rule with an intercept of\n1 percent, which includes a lagged value of the nominal interest rate.28 This rule does\nnot go as far as the first-difference rule in eliminating the level of r* from the policy\nprescription, but it does prescribe that policy move only slowly toward its longer-run\nlevel, which places less weight in the short-run on the estimate of r*.

The\nforecast-based version employed here substitutes the change in the unemployment gap for the change in the\noutput gap (using an Okun’s law coefficient of 2) and sets β to 0.5, yielding ΔR = 0.5 (π ̶ π*) ̶ Δu. When\nimplemented using forecasts, inflation is the 4-quarter inflation rate 3 quarters ahead, and Δu is the 4-\nquarter change in the unemployment rate 3 quarters ahead. See Athanasios Orphanides (2003), “Historical\nMonetary Policy Analysis and the Taylor Rule,” Journal of Monetary Economics, vol. 50 (July), pp. 983-\n1022.\n27 While the natural rate of interest may be changing over time and the first-difference rule does not take\nthese changes into account, Orphanides and Williams (2007) argue that rules like the first-difference rule\ncan deliver good economic performance even when there is uncertainty about those changes. See\nAthanasios Orphanides and John C. Williams (2007), “Robust Monetary Policy with Imperfect\nKnowledge,” Journal of Monetary Economics, vol. 54 (July), pp. 1406-35.\n28 Chair Yellen has called this rule the “balanced-approach” rule.

Yellen (2012), “Perspectives\non Monetary Policy,” speech delivered at the Boston Economic Club Dinner, Boston, June 6,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/yellen20120606a.htm. This rule has also been\nconsidered by others. For example, see John B. Taylor (1999), “A Historical Analysis of Monetary Policy\nRules,” in John B. Taylor, ed., Monetary Policy Rules (Chicago: University of Chicago Press), p. 319-341.\n\n- 14 -\nprescription is closer to FOMC participants’ assessments of appropriate monetary policy.\nAlthough many FOMC participants believe that r* has fallen, they also believe that it will\nrise toward a longer-term level of 1 percent over time, and the better fit of the inertial rule\nin part captures this assessment.\nI would offer several takeaways from this overview. There is general agreement\nthat these simple policy rules do provide interesting and useful insights into policy. To\ngain the benefit of those insights, it is helpful to look at a range of rules. But there is no\nconsensus that any one rule is best, let alone that it would be desirable to require the\nFOMC to pick and mechanically follow one rule to the exclusion of others.29\nSimple rules also leave out critical considerations for the path of policy. One\nsuch consideration of great importance is that, with the secular decline in interest rates\nover the past 35 years, policy is now far more likely to hit the ELB than had been\nthought, which may present severe challenges. Research suggests that, as a precautionary\nmatter, policy should be more aggressive in providing accommodation as rates move\ncloser to the ELB.30 But there is no consensus today on whether or how to incorporate\nELB-related risks into a simple policy rule of the type that I have discussed here.\nAnother such consideration is that simple policy rules include no consideration of\nfinancial stability. But monetary policy may sometimes face tradeoffs between\nmacroeconomic objectives and financial stability.

Some have argued for inclusion of\na financial stability term into policy rules, but the issue is far from settled.31\nTo conclude, I think it’s fair to say that simple policy rules are widely thought to\nbe both interesting and useful, but to represent only a small part of the analysis needed to\nassess the appropriate path for policy. I am unable to think of any critical, complex\nhuman activity that could be safely reduced to a simple summary equation. In particular,\nno major central bank uses policy rules in a prescriptive way, and it is hard to predict the\nconsequences of requiring the FOMC to do so, as some have proposed. Policy should be\nsystematic, but not automatic.\n31 See Tobias Adrian and Nellie Liang (2014), “Monetary Policy, Financial Conditions, and Financial\nStability,” Federal Reserve Bank of New York Staff Reports 690 (New York: Federal Reserve Bank of\nNew York, September; revised December 2016),\nhttps://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr690.pdf.\n\nThe Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy\nJerome Powell\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nFebruary 22, 2017\n\n1.

Powell\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Mapping the Financial Frontier: What Does the Next Decade Hold?”\n24th Annual Financial Markets Conference, sponsored by\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nAmelia Island, Florida\nMay 20, 2019\n\nIt is a pleasure to be here at this important annual event sponsored and organized\nby the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s Center for Financial Innovation and Stability.\nThe risks in our financial system are constantly evolving. Fifteen years ago, everyone\nwas talking about whether households were borrowing too much. Today everyone is\ntalking about whether businesses are borrowing too much. This evening, I will focus on\nthe implications of the increase in business debt over the past decade and review the steps\nthe Federal Reserve and other agencies are taking to understand and limit the associated\nrisks.\nIn public discussion of this issue, views seem to range from “This is a rerun of the\nsubprime mortgage crisis” to “Nothing to worry about here.” At the moment, the truth is\nlikely somewhere in the middle. To preview my conclusions, as of now, business debt\ndoes not present the kind of elevated risks to the stability of the financial system that\nwould lead to broad harm to households and businesses should conditions deteriorate. At\nthe same time, the level of debt certainly could stress borrowers if the economy\nweakens. The Federal Reserve continues to assess the potential amplification of such\nstresses on borrowers to the broader economy through possible vulnerabilities in the\nfinancial system, and I currently see such risks as moderate.\nDiscussion\nMany commentators have observed with a sense of déjà vu the buildup of risky\nbusiness debt over the past few years. The acronyms have changed a bit—“CLOs”\n(collateralized loan obligations) instead of “CDOs” (collateralized debt obligations), for\nexample—but once again, we see a category of debt that is growing faster than the\nincome of the borrowers even as lenders loosen underwriting standards. Likewise, much\n\n- 2 -\nof the borrowing is financed opaquely, outside the banking system. Many are asking\nwhether these developments pose a new threat to financial stability.\nAt the Federal Reserve, we take this possibility seriously. The Fed and other\nregulators are using our supervisory tools and closely monitoring risks from the buildup\nof risky business debt. Business debt has clearly reached a level that should give\nbusinesses and investors reason to pause and reflect. If financial and economic\nconditions were to deteriorate, overly indebted firms could well face severe strains.\nHowever, the parallels to the mortgage boom that led to the Global Financial Crisis are\nnot fully convincing. Most importantly, the financial system today appears strong\nenough to handle potential business-sector losses, which was manifestly not the case a\ndecade ago with subprime mortgages. And there are other differences: Increases in\nbusiness borrowing are not outsized for such a long expansion, in contrast to the\nmortgage boom; business credit is not fueled by a dramatic asset price bubble, as\nmortgage debt was; and CLO structures are much sounder than the structures that were in\nuse during the mortgage credit bubble.\nCould the increase in business debt pose greater risks to the financial system than\ncurrently appreciated? My colleagues and I continually ask ourselves that question. We\nare also taking multiple steps to better understand and address the potential risks. In\nconjunction with other U.S. regulatory agencies, both domestically through the Financial\nStability Oversight Council (FSOC) and internationally through the Financial Stability\nBoard (FSB), we are monitoring developments, assessing unknowns, and working to\ndevelop a clearer picture. We are also using our supervisory tools to hold the banks we\n\n- 3 -\nsupervise to strong risk-management standards. And we are using our stress tests to\nensure banks’ resilience even in severely adverse business conditions.\nThe Rise of Business Leverage\nLet’s start with the basic facts. Many measures confirm that the business sector\nhas significantly increased its borrowing as the economy has expanded over the past\ndecade. Business debt relative to the size of the economy is at historic highs. Corporate\ndebt relative to the book value of assets is at the upper end of its range over the past few\ndecades (figure 1). And investment-grade corporate debt has shifted closer to the edge of\nspeculative grade.\nAt the moment, the business sector is quite healthy overall. Business income is\nstrong, reflecting healthy profit margins. And because interest rates are quite low by\nhistorical standards, the costs of servicing today’s higher levels of debt remain low\nrelative to business income (figure 2). Despite crosscurrents, the economy is showing\ncontinued growth, strong job creation, and rising wages, all in a context of muted\ninflation pressures.\nBut if a downturn were to arrive unexpectedly, some firms would face challenges.\nNot only is the volume of debt high, but recent growth has also been concentrated in the\nriskier forms of debt. Among investment-grade bonds, a near-record fraction is at the\nlowest rating—a phenomenon known as the “triple-B cliff.” In a downturn, some of\nthese borrowers could be downgraded into high-yield territory, which would require\nsome investors to sell their holdings, thereby confronting traditional high-yield investors\nwith a sudden influx of bonds.\n\n- 4 -\nThere have also been sizable shifts within the non-investment-grade, or riskier,\ndebt universe. Higher-risk businesses have traditionally funded themselves with a mix of\nhigh-yield bonds and leveraged loans. Over time, the balance between the two has swung\nback and forth because of investor demand, the interest rate environment, and other\nfactors. In the past few years, leveraged loans have grown far more quickly (figure 3). In\nfact, while net new issuance of high-yield bonds in 2018 was close to nil, leveraged loans\noutstanding rose 20 percent and now stand at more than $1 trillion. So far this year,\nissuance of high-yield bonds and leveraged loans has been more balanced. In addition,\nunderwriting standards have weakened. With leveraged loans, covenants intended to\nprotect lenders may be an endangered species; more loans now feature high debt-to-\nearnings ratios; and the use of optimistic projections including “earnings add-backs” is\nbecoming more common.\nThe rise in riskier business borrowing has been funded principally by nonbank\nlenders. Collateralized loan obligations are now the largest lenders, with about\n62 percent of outstanding leveraged loans (figure 4). These lenders are actively managed\nsecuritization vehicles that mostly buy higher-risk assets like leveraged loans. CLOs, in\nturn, are funded by a slice of equity and layers of debt of varying seniority. After CLOs,\nmutual funds are the next-largest vehicle for holding leveraged loans, with about\n20 percent of the market. These funds allow investors to redeem their shares daily,\nalthough the underlying loans take longer to sell. As a result, investors may react to\nfinancial stress by trying to redeem their shares before the funds have sold their most\nliquid assets. Widespread redemptions by investors, in turn, could lead to widespread\n\n- 5 -\nprice pressures, which could affect all holders of loans, including CLOs and those that\nhold CLOs.\nRisks to Financial Stability: Using the Framework Deployed since the Crisis\nAs you can see, there are similarities to the subprime mortgage crisis. As with the\nmortgage boom, the business debt story begins with rapid growth of debt to new highs\nand a surge in lending to risky borrowers made possible by aggressive underwriting using\nsecuritization vehicles.\nBut there are also important differences. One difference is that financial\nauthorities now closely monitor financial stability vulnerabilities on an ongoing basis,\narmed with lessons learned from the crisis. The Board of Governors meets at least four\ntimes a year to assess threats to the financial system and is constantly monitoring\ndevelopments. We use a checklist of potential financial vulnerabilities that we have\ndescribed elsewhere, most recently in the Financial Stability Report we published earlier\nthis month.1 This approach gives us a way to organize and weigh the mass of facts,\nanecdotes, and speculation we confront as we monitor financial stability.\nIn assessing financial stability risks, we constantly consult our four-point\nchecklist: borrowing by businesses and households, valuation pressures, leverage in the\nfinancial system, and funding risk. If households or businesses have borrowed too much,\nthey will be forced to cut back spending and investing or even default if their incomes fall\nor the value of the collateral backing their loans declines. Valuation pressures give us a\nsense of overall risk appetite and, should investors lose that appetite, how far prices could\nfall. If lenders face defaulting borrowers and have too little loss-absorbing capacity, they\n1 See Board of Governors (2019).\n\n- 6 -\nrisk insolvency. At best, they will cut back on lending to other borrowers, dragging the\neconomy down. At worst, they will fail, which can lead to severe economic damage to\nhouseholds and businesses. Finally, when the financial system funds long-maturity assets\nwith short-maturity liabilities, we risk a classic “fast burn” crisis—a bank run, or its\nequivalent involving investors and institutions outside traditional banking.2\nIn our framework, the story of the mid-2000s goes something like this: Amid a\nself-reinforcing cycle of house price gains and mortgage credit expansion, households\nborrowed (and lenders lent) far too much, and property prices rose far too high. Financial\ninstitutions of all shapes and sizes also borrowed too much. And the financial sector was\nhighly susceptible to a run because it funded risky, long-maturity mortgages with\nextended chains of fragile and opaque financing structures that ultimately rested on short-\nmaturity liabilities.\nLet’s compare this story with the current situation using our four-point checklist,\nbeginning with borrowing by businesses and households. Business debt has grown faster\nthan gross domestic product (GDP) for several years and today is high. But the growth in\nthe ratio of business debt to GDP in the past decade is much less than the growth in\nhousehold debt to GDP that we saw in the run-up to the Global Financial Crisis. Back\nthen, household debt grew from 60 percent of GDP to 90 percent, or by half (figure 5).\nAt its recent low, business debt was 65 percent of GDP. Now, even after rapid growth, it\nis still below 75 percent of GDP. Overall, the increase in business debt relative to the\n2 The Board’s Financial Stability Report discusses the analytical framework. For a longer and more\nacademic discussion, see Adrian, Covitz, and Liang (2015). For research on the role of credit, house prices,\nand other factors as indicators for potential financial instability, see Borio and Lowe (2002); Schularick and\nTaylor (2012); Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor (2016); and Kiley (2018). For research on the role of bank\ncapital, see Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (2010); Macroeconomic Assessment Group (2010);\nand Firestone, Lorenc, and Ranish (2017).\n\n- 7 -\nsize of the economy is one-third the increase in household debt seen in the previous\ndecade. Business debt rises in expansions. It is a steady upward plod in borrowing over\nthe long expansion—not a rapid expansion—that has now brought business debt to GDP\nback to historic highs. Seen this way, the current situation looks typical of business\ncycles. The mortgage credit boom was, because of its magnitude and speed, far outside\nhistorical norms.3\nAs for household debt, we see that household debt-to-income ratios have steadily\ndeclined post-crisis. Moreover, a high and rising fraction of this debt is rated prime. All\ntold, household debt burdens appear much more manageable.\nOur second factor—valuation pressures—also points to moderate risks to\nfinancial stability. Valuations are high across several financial markets. Equity prices\nhave recently reached new highs, and corporate bond and loan spreads are narrow. Both\ncommercial and residential property prices have moved above their long-run relationship\nwith rents, although price gains slowed substantially last year. All of these developments\npoint to strong risk appetite—as might be expected given the strong economy. But there\ndoes not appear to be a feedback loop between borrowing and asset prices, as was the\ncase in the run-up to the financial crisis. While borrowing by businesses has been strong,\nit is not fueling excessive prices or investment in a critical sector such as housing, whose\ncollapse would undermine collateral values and lead to outsized losses. Instead, the\nincrease in business borrowing has been broad based across sectors, including\ntechnology, oil and gas production, and manufacturing.\n3 For an analysis of the degree to which housing market developments in the 2000s appeared unrelated to\neconomic fundamentals and references to related research, see Dokko and others (2011).\n\n- 8 -\nRegarding the third factor—leverage in the financial system—today banks at the\ncore of the financial system are fundamentally stronger and more resilient. Our post-\ncrisis regulatory framework is based on robust capital requirements backed by strong\nstress tests, resulting in much higher levels of capital in the banking system (figure 6).\nThese stress tests are a way to estimate the direct and indirect effects of extremely bad\nmacroeconomic and financial developments on our banking system. We publish the\nscenarios that describe the macro and financial developments every year by mid-February\nand release the test results in June. In the pre-crisis environment, supervisors focused\nmore on the most likely outcomes, not on these tail risks. Since we began routine stress-\ntesting in 2011, the scenarios we use have featured severe global recessions characterized\nby major stress in the corporate sector, where large numbers of firms default on their\nloans and bonds. As actual economic conditions have improved, the scenarios have\ngotten tougher. The most recent stress tests indicate that, even after the losses from the\nscenario, capital levels at the largest banks would remain above the levels those banks\nhad before the crisis. Loss-absorbing capacity elsewhere in the financial system is also\nmuch improved. Leverage at broker-dealers is far below levels before the crisis and\nremains low relative to the norms of the past several decades. Insurers also appear well\ncapitalized.\nAs for our fourth factor—funding risk—the susceptibility of the financial system\nto runs also appears low. In part because of the post-crisis regulatory regime, large banks\nhold substantial amounts of highly liquid assets and rely relatively little on short-term\nwholesale funding (figure 7). Money market funds hold much safer assets. And CLOs,\nwhich have facilitated the growth of leveraged loans, have stable funding: Investors\n\n- 9 -\ncommit funds for lengthy periods, so they cannot, through withdrawals, force CLOs to\nsell assets at distressed prices.\nAddressing the Risks: Monitoring and Acting\nOverall, vulnerabilities to financial stability from business debt and other factors\ndo not appear elevated. We take the risks from business debt seriously but think that the\nfinancial system appears strong enough to handle potential losses. We also know that our\ndynamic financial system does not stand still. We can always learn more about financial\nmarkets, and we will always act to address emerging risks. Together with our domestic\nand international counterparts, we are monitoring developments in business debt markets,\nworking to develop and share data on how these markets operate, studying ways to\nfurther strengthen the system, and working to ensure that banks are properly managing\nthe business debt risks they have taken on.\nThrough the FSOC, the banking and market regulators coordinate our monitoring\nof financial conditions. In recent meetings, the FSOC has discussed leveraged lending in\ndepth. We recognize that each regulator directly sees only a part of the larger picture,\nand we are working to stitch these parts together so we can collectively see that larger\npicture and the risks it holds. For example, the Securities and Exchange Commission is\nexamining the potential for liquidity strains at mutual funds, and the Commodity Futures\nTrading Commission is working to understand the use of derivatives to hedge risks\nassociated with leveraged loans.\nWhat else are we watching for? Business debt growth has moderated somewhat\nsince early 2018, but this might be just a pause. Another sharp increase in debt, unless\nsupported by strong fundamentals, could increase vulnerabilities appreciably.\n\n- 10 -\nBusinesses, investors, and lenders need to focus on these vulnerabilities—as will the\nFederal Reserve.\nIn addition, regulators, investors, and market participants around the world would\nbenefit greatly from more information on who is bearing the ultimate risk associated with\nCLOs. We know that the U.S. CLO market spans the globe, involving foreign banks and\nasset managers. But right now, we mainly know where the CLOs are not—only\n$90 billion of the roughly $700 billion in total CLOs are held by the largest U.S. banks.\nThat is certainly good news for domestic banks, but in a downturn institutions anywhere\ncould find themselves under pressure, especially those with inadequate loss-absorbing\ncapacity or runnable short-term financing. The Federal Reserve is participating in\ninternational efforts, under the auspices of the FSB, to improve our knowledge of these\nkey issues. Through the FSB, we are focused on determining the size of the global\nleveraged loan market and the holders of the loans as an important step toward a better\nunderstanding of the underlying risks.\nBeyond monitoring markets and collecting new data, several supervisory efforts\nare also under way. To complement the quantitative analysis in our stress tests, our\nsupervisors have been qualitatively assessing how well banks are managing the risks\nassociated with leveraged lending. Through the Shared National Credit Program, which\nevaluates large syndicated loans, our supervisors are continuing to work with their\ncounterparts at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation to ensure that banks are properly managing the risks of losses they\nface from participating in the leveraged lending market.\n\n- 11 -\nConclusion\nLet me wrap up with three thoughts. First, business debt is near record levels, and\nrecent issuance has been concentrated in the riskiest segments. As a result, some\nbusinesses may come under severe financial strain if the economy deteriorates. A highly\nleveraged business sector could amplify any economic downturn as companies are forced\nto lay off workers and cut back on investments. Investors, financial institutions, and\nregulators need to focus on this risk today, while times are good.\nSecond, today business debt does not appear to present notable risks to financial\nstability. The debt-to-GDP ratio has moved up at a steady pace, in line with previous\nexpansions and neither fueled by nor fueling an asset bubble. Moreover, banks and other\nfinancial institutions have sizable loss-absorbing buffers. The growth in business debt\ndoes not rely on short-term funding, and overall funding risk in the financial system is\nmoderate.\nThird, we cannot be satisfied with our current level of knowledge about these\nmarkets, particularly the vulnerability of financial institutions to potential losses and the\npossible strains on market liquidity and prices should investors exit investment vehicles\nholding leveraged loans. We are committed to better understanding the areas where our\ninformation is incomplete. This commitment includes coordination with other domestic\nand international agencies to understand who is participating in business lending and how\ntheir behavior could potentially amplify stress events.\n\n- 12 -\nReferences\nAdrian, Tobias, Daniel Covitz, and Nellie Liang (2015). “Financial Stability\nMonitoring,” Annual Review of Financial Economics, vol. 7 (December),\npp. 357–95.\nBasel Committee on Banking Supervision (2010).

Powell\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe Evolving Structure of the U.S. Treasury Market: Second Annual Conference\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York\nNew York, N.Y.\nOctober 24, 2016\n\nThis panel will focus on the settlement infrastructure for U.S. government securities -- a\nvital component of the Treasury market and one that is undergoing an important transition. This\nsegment of the industry has been in a period of slow but steady consolidation for several decades\nnow. Thirty years ago, there were six banks providing a full suite of settlement services for U.S.\ngovernment securities. Due to mergers and exits, two firms, Bank of New York Mellon\n(BNYM) and J.P. Morgan Chase (JPMC), have been the two dominant providers of these\nservices since the 1990s. And soon there will be just one, given JPMC’s planned exit.\nGiven the importance of these services, the official sector has had a long involvement as\nthe market structure has evolved. After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the Federal\nReserve convened the private-sector Working Group on Government Securities Clearance and\nSettlement to recommend steps to mitigate risks to the financial system from a disruption to\nthese services. That work led to the “NewBank” proposal.1 Although the proposal was\nultimately put aside, NewBank would have been a dormant financial institution that could spring\ninto action in the event of potential disruptions from an exit from this business by either of the\nclearing banks. Some of today’s panelists were actively involved in that work. Of course, at that\ntime, the business was roughly evenly split between the two providers. Today’s situation is very\ndifferent – BNYM now has over 80 percent market share, due mainly to consolidation among\nend users.\nThe Federal Reserve has been working closely with the Department of the Treasury to\nensure a smooth transition as JPMC prepares to exit. JPMC has said that it recognizes the need\n1 Report to the Federal Reserve Board by the Working Group on NewBank Implementation, December 2005.\nhttps://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0ahUKEwibwreBpOfPAhXM7CY\nKHfGGAt8QFggeMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.federalreserve.gov%2Fboarddocs%2Fpress%2Fother%2F20\n05%2F20051215%2Fattachment.pdf&usg=AFQjCNGWY_qoYfTbX5xXL7mVn2yV3p2yTA&cad=rja\n1\n\nfor, and its own interest in, ensuring that its exit does not disrupt the market. Indeed, JPMC will\nitself need to rely on these services going forward. The timeline set for a gradual transition over\nthe next two years should be sufficient to avoid significant dislocations; however, if unexpected\ncomplications arise, that timeline may need to be adjusted.\nIn the near term, this exit will leave BNYM as the sole provider of U.S. government\nsecurities settlement and triparty repo services for broker-dealers. We have been working\nintensively with BNYM in anticipation of this transition. We have long recognized that any\ndisruptions to these critical market services could have serious consequences for financial\nstability, and have calibrated our supervisory expectations accordingly. To ensure financial\nstability, we expect the provision of U.S. government securities settlement services to be robust\nin nearly all contingencies.\nAs BNYM becomes the sole provider, we will raise our expectations even higher. The\nbank has anticipated and welcomed this higher bar. BNYM is one of 8 U.S.-based systemically\nimportant banks. The bank is therefore subject to heightened capital and liquidity requirements\nand a resolution process that explicitly requires planning to ensure the continuity of critical\nservices even in the event of a default.\nBNYM is unique in that it also plays the dominant – and soon the sole – role in\ngovernment securities settlement and in the triparty repo market. These activities are comparable\nin their importance to those of the financial market utilities that have been designated as\nsystemically important by the FSOC. Thus, BNYM will continue to be held to the high\nstandards to which all U.S. bank SIFIs are held. And it will also be expected to operate in a\nmanner that provides confidence that it is as resilient and robust as a systemically important\nfinancial market utility (FMU). Such FMUs are, of course, held to the Principles for Financial\n2\n\nMarket Infrastructures (PFMIs).2 The PFMIs overlap with our banking regulation in many\nareas; for example, both emphasize the need for sound risk management and the importance of\nresilience and recovery. The PFMIs also emphasize a strong governance role in support of\nfinancial stability and the interests of market functioning, and this has been a focus of our work\nwith Bank of New York Mellon regarding the transition.\nAlthough our current task is to establish appropriate expectations for Bank of New York\nMellon as a sole operator, that focus should not be taken as an indication that the Federal\nReserve or other public authorities have pre-judged what the longer-term landscape for\ngovernment securities settlement should look like. In fact, we do not have a specific market\ndesign end state in mind. Rather, we recognize the systemic importance of these activities and\nthe need to ensure their continued availability in nearly all states of the world, regardless of the\nfirms that offer them or the specific market structure.\nThe industry as a whole should play an important role in shaping the evolution of the\nsettlement infrastructure. Other firms may seek to enter this market. There have also been\ndiscussions over time of a settlement utility, and the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation is\ncurrently considering a new variant of such a model. Our focus is on the quality of the services\noffered -- their safety, resilience, and support of the market -- and not on the particular\nmechanism for offering them. If new proposals come forward that are consistent with our goals\nof a safe and resilient settlement system, then they will receive fair consideration.\n2 See Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems and the International Organization of Securities Commissions\n(2012), Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures, report (Basel, Switzerland: Bank for International\nSettlements, April), www.bis.org/publ/cpss101.htm\n3",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n4:50 a.m. EDT (9:50 a.m. GMT)\nJune 6, 2014\nA Conversation on Central Banking Issues\nRemarks by\nJerome H. Powell\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n2014 Spring Membership Meeting\nInstitute for International Finance\nLondon, England\nJune 6, 2014\n\nThank you for inviting me here today. I should say at the outset that the views\nthat I offer are my own and not necessarily those of any other member of the Federal\nOpen Market Committee (FOMC).\nYou have asked about the effectiveness of forward guidance. My view is that\nforward guidance has generally been effective in providing support for the economy at a\ntime when the federal funds rate has been pinned at its effective lower bound.\nThe FOMC has provided various forms of forward guidance since 2009, both for\nrate policy and for asset purchases. I will focus today mainly on rate policy. There is\nmore than can be said in five minutes, however, so I will leave the rest to our discussion\nafterward.\nIn my view, forward rate guidance has helped reduce medium and longer-term\ninterest rates, and by doing so has provided meaningful support for the economy. First,\nby increasing public understanding and market confidence in the path of rates, guidance\nhas helped reduce term premiums. Second, by communicating that rates would remain\nlower for longer than market participants might otherwise have expected, guidance has\nlowered medium- and longer-term rates through the expectations channel. Finally, even\nwhen guidance has initially been well aligned with market expectations, it has reduced\nthe likelihood that rate expectations will subsequently shift upward in ways that the\nCommittee does not intend. Event studies as well as market-implied quotes and surveys\ncorroborate the view that guidance has reduced medium- and longer-term interest rates\nand has held down volatility as well. To be sure, there have also been times when\nforward guidance and market expectations have diverged, with resulting spikes in\nvolatility. Such situations may be difficult to avoid, given the use of new,\n\n- 2 -\nunconventional policy tools, although we always try to communicate policy as clearly as\npossible.\nOur forward guidance has evolved over time--from qualitative, to date-based, to\nquantitative guidance, and from largely unconditional to state-contingent guidance\nexplaining how the Committee will react to future economic outcomes. In March 2009,\nthe Committee offered the qualitative guidance that it expected to hold the federal funds\nrate near zero “for an extended period.”1 In August 2011, the Committee moved to date-\nbased guidance, saying that it expected to hold the rate near zero at least until mid-2013.2\nIn December 2012, the Committee adopted quantitative thresholds that were explicitly\ntied to future economic conditions. In particular, it stated its intention to hold the policy\nrate near zero “at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent,\ninflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half\npercentage point above the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term\ninflation expectations continue to be well anchored.”3\nMore recently, at the March 2014 FOMC meeting, as the 6-1/2 percent\nunemployment threshold approached, the Committee offered new guidance that\ncontained qualitative and time-based elements but retained the state-contingent nature of\nthe threshold guidance. First, the Committee said that, in determining how long to hold\nthe federal funds rate near zero, it “will assess progress--both realized and expected--\ntoward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation”; it also indicated\n1 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2009), “FOMC Statement,” press release,\nMarch 18, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20090318a.htm, paragraph 3.\n2 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2011), “FOMC Statement,” press release,\nAugust 9, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20110809a.htm.\n3 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2012), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC\nStatement,” press release, December 12,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20121212a.htm, paragraph 5.\n\n- 3 -\nthat, in making this assessment, it would take into account a wide range of information,\n“including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and\ninflation expectations, and readings on financial developments.”4\nSecond, the Committee indicated, “based on its assessment of these factors, that it\nlikely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for\na considerable time after the asset purchase program ends”--a time-based reference, since\nthe Committee has indicated that it expects to wind down its asset purchases by the end\nof this year if the economy continues to evolve as expected.5 Of course, the actual timing\nof liftoff will depend on the performance of the economy.\nThird, the Committee stated that it “anticipates that, even after employment and\ninflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time,\nwarrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal\nin the longer run.”6 Committee members have differing thoughts on why that may be the\ncase. In my view, the reasons would include the lingering effects of the financial crisis,\nincluding lower potential growth for a time.\nTurning briefly to asset purchases, since last December’s FOMC meeting, the\nCommittee has reduced asset purchases in a series of measured steps from a pace of\n$85 billion a month to its current pace of $45 billion per month. If incoming information\ncontinues to broadly support the Committee’s expectation of ongoing improvement in\nlabor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective, these\n4 The thresholds provided a useful guide to policy, but with the unemployment rate approaching its\n6-1/2 percent threshold, the Committee judged that it would need to look at a broader range of information\nin order to determine the appropriate stance of policy. See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem (2014), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement,” press release, March 19,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20140319a.htm, paragraph 5.\n5 See Board of Governors, “FOMC Statement,” March 19, 2014, paragraph 5, in note 4.\n6 See Board of Governors, “FOMC Statement,” March 19, 2014, paragraph 6, in note 4.\n\n- 4 -\nmeasured steps would continue and asset purchases would come to an end in the fourth\nquarter of this year. Market expectations seem to be well aligned with this guidance.\nThank you. I look forward to our discussion.",

    "text": "Opening Remarks:\nMonetary Policy in\nthe Time of COVID\nJerome H. Powell\nSeventeen months have passed since the U.S. economy faced\nthe full force of the COVID-19 pandemic. This shock led to an\nimmediate and unprecedented decline as large parts of the economy\nwere shuttered to contain the spread of the disease.\nThe path of recovery has been a difficult one, and a good place to\nbegin is by thanking those on the front line fighting the pandemic:\nthe essential workers who kept the economy going, those who have\ncared for others in need, and those in medical research, business, and\ngovernment, who came together to discover, produce, and widely\ndistribute effective vaccines in record time. We should also keep in\nour thoughts those who have lost their lives from COVID, as well as\ntheir loved ones.\nStrong policy support has fueled a vigorous but uneven recovery—\none that is, in many respects, historically anomalous. In a reversal of\ntypical patterns in a downturn, aggregate personal income rose rather\nthan fell, and households massively shifted their spending from\nservices to manufactured goods. Booming demand for goods and\nthe strength and speed of the reopening have led to shortages and\nbottlenecks, leaving the COVID-constrained supply side unable to\nkeep up. The result has been elevated inflation in durable goods—a\n1\n\n2 Jerome H. Powell\nsector that has experienced an annual inflation rate well below\nzero over the past quarter century.1 Labor market conditions are\nimproving but turbulent, and the pandemic continues to threaten\nnot only health and life, but also economic activity. Many other\nadvanced economies are experiencing similarly unusual conditions.\nIn my comments today, I will focus on the Fed’s efforts to promote\nour maximum employment and price stability goals amid this\nupheaval, and suggest how lessons from history and a careful focus\non incoming data and the evolving risks offer useful guidance for\ntoday’s unique monetary policy challenges.\nThe Recession and Recovery So Far\nThe pandemic recession—the briefest yet deepest on record—\ndisplaced roughly 30 million workers in the space of two months.2 The\ndecline in output in the second quarter of 2020 was twice the full\ndecline during the Great Recession of 2007-09.3 But the pace of\nthe recovery has exceeded expectations, with output surpassing its\nprevious peak after only four quarters, less than half the time required\nfollowing the Great Recession. As is typically the case, the recovery\nin employment has lagged that in output; nonetheless, employment\ngains have also come faster than expected.4\nThe economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans,\nand those least able to shoulder the burden have been hardest\nhit. In particular, despite progress, joblessness continues to fall\ndisproportionately on lower-wage workers in the service sector and\non African Americans and Hispanics.\nThe unevenness of the recovery can further be seen through\nthe lens of the sectoral shift of spending into goods—particularly\ndurable goods such as appliances, furniture, and cars—and away\nfrom services, particularly in-person services in areas such as travel\nand leisure (Chart 1). As the pandemic struck, restaurant meals fell\n45%, air travel 95%, and dentist visits 65%. Even today, with overall\ngross domestic product and consumption spending more than fully\nrecovered, services spending remains about 7% below trend. Total\nemployment is now 6 million below its February 2020 level, and\n5 million of that shortfall is in the still-depressed service sector.

With demand outstripping pandemic-afflicted supply, rising\ndurables prices are a principal factor lifting inflation well above our\n2% objective.\nGiven the ongoing upheaval in the economy, some strains and\nsurprises are inevitable. The job of monetary policy is to promote\nmaximum employment and price stability as the economy works\nthrough this challenging period. I will turn now to a discussion of\nprogress toward those goals.\nThe Path Ahead: Maximum Employment\nThe outlook for the labor market has brightened considerably in\nrecent months. After faltering last winter, job gains have risen steadily\nover the course of this year and now average 832,000 over the past\nthree months, of which almost 800,000 have been in services (Chart\n2). The pace of total hiring is faster than at any time in the recorded\ndata before the pandemic. The levels of job openings and quits are\n\n4 Jerome H.

The unemployment rate has declined to 5.4%, a\npost-pandemic low, but is still much too high, and the reported\nrate understates the amount of labor market slack.5 Long-term\nunemployment remains elevated, and the recovery in labor force\nparticipation has lagged well behind the rest of the labor market, as\nit has in past recoveries.\nWith vaccinations rising, schools reopening, and enhanced\nunemployment benefits ending, some factors that may be holding\nback job seekers are likely fading.6 While the delta variant presents a\nnear-term risk, the prospects are good for continued progress toward\nmaximum employment.\n\nOpening Remarks 5\nThe Path Ahead: Inflation\nThe rapid reopening of the economy has brought a sharp run-up\nin inflation. Over the 12 months through July, measures of headline\nand core personal consumption expenditures inflation have run\nat 4.2% and 3.6%, respectively—well above our 2% longer-run\nobjective.7 Businesses and consumers widely report upward pressure\non prices and wages. Inflation at these levels is, of course, a cause for\nconcern. But that concern is tempered by a number of factors that\nsuggest that these elevated readings are likely to prove temporary.\nThis assessment is a critical and ongoing one, and we are carefully\nmonitoring incoming data.\nThe dynamics of inflation are complex, and we assess the inflation\noutlook from a number of different perspectives, as I will now discuss.\n1. The absence so far of broad-based inflation pressures\nThe spike in inflation is so far largely the product of a relatively\nnarrow group of goods and services that have been directly affected by\nthe pandemic and the reopening of the economy. Durable goods alone\ncontributed about 1 percentage point to the latest 12-month measures\nof headline and core inflation. Energy prices, which rebounded with\nthe strong recovery, added another 0.8 percentage point to headline\ninflation, and from long experience we expect the inflation effects of\nthese increases to be transitory. In addition, some prices—for example,\nfor hotel rooms and airplane tickets—declined sharply during the\nrecession and have now moved back up close to pre-pandemic levels.\nThe 12-month window we use in computing inflation now captures\nthe rebound in prices but not the initial decline, temporarily elevating\nreported inflation. These effects, which are adding a few tenths to\nmeasured inflation, should wash out over time.\nWe consult a range of measures meant to capture whether price\nincreases for particular items are spilling over into broad-based inflation.\nThese include trimmed mean measures and measures excluding\ndurables and computed from just before the pandemic. These measures\ngenerally show inflation at or close to our 2% longer-run objective\n(Chart 3). We would be concerned at signs that inflationary pressures\nwere spreading more broadly through the economy.\n\n6 Jerome H.

Moderating inflation in higher-inflation items\nWe are also directly monitoring the prices of particular goods and\nservices most affected by the pandemic and the reopening, and are\nbeginning to see a moderation in some cases as shortages ease. Used\ncar prices, for example, appear to have stabilized; indeed, some price\nindicators are beginning to fall. If that continues, as many analysts\npredict, then used car prices will soon be pulling measured inflation\ndown, as they did for much of the past decade.8\nThis same dynamic of upward inflation pressure dissipating and,\nin some cases, reversing seems likely to play out in durables more\ngenerally. Over the 25 years preceding the pandemic, durables prices\nactually declined, with inflation averaging negative 1.9% per year\n(Chart 4).9 As supply problems have begun to resolve, inflation in\ndurable goods other than autos has now slowed and may be starting\nto fall. It seems unlikely that durables inflation will continue to\ncontribute importantly over time to overall inflation. We will be\nlooking for evidence that supports or undercuts that expectation.\n\nOpening Remarks 7\nChart 4\nDurable Goods Inflation Has Run Far below\nThat of Services for 25 Years before the Pandemic\nMonthly 12-month percent change\n8 8\n6 6\n4 Services 4\n2 2\n0 0\n−2 −2\nDurables\n−4 −4\n−6 −6\n1996 2001 2006 2011 2016 2021\nNote: The data are price deflators for personal consumption expenditures and extend through June 2021.\nSource: U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.\n3. Wages\nWe also assess whether wage increases are consistent with 2%\ninflation over time. Wage increases are essential to support a rising\nstandard of living and are generally, of course, a welcome development.\nBut if wage increases were to move materially and persistently above\nthe levels of productivity gains and inflation, businesses would likely\npass those increases on to customers, a process that could become\nthe sort of “wage-price spiral” seen at times in the past.10 Today we\nsee little evidence of wage increases that might threaten excessive\ninflation (Chart 5). Broad-based measures of wages that adjust for\ncompositional changes in the labor force, such as the employment\ncost index and the Atlanta Wage Growth Tracker, show wages moving\nup at a pace that appears consistent with our longer-term inflation\nobjective. We will continue to monitor this carefully.\n4. Longer-term inflation expectations\nPolicymakers and analysts generally believe that, as long as longer-\nterm inflation expectations remain anchored, policy can and should\nlook through temporary swings in inflation. Our monetary policy\n\n8 Jerome H.

The dashed line represents missing data.\nSources: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics; Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Wage Growth Tracker.\nframework emphasizes that anchoring longer-term expectations at\n2% is important for both maximum employment and price stability.\nWe carefully monitor a wide range of indicators of longer-term\ninflation expectations. These measures today are at levels broadly\nconsistent with our 2% objective (Chart 6). Because measures of\ninflation expectations are individually noisy, we also focus on common\npatterns across the measures. One approach to summarizing these\npatterns is the Board staff’s index of common inflation expectations\n(CIE), which combines information from a broad range of survey\nand market-based measures.11 This index captures a general move\ndown in expectations starting around 2014, a time when inflation\nwas running persistently below 2%. More recently, the index shows a\nwelcome reversal of that decline and is now at levels more consistent\nwith our 2% objective.\nLonger-term inflation expectations have moved much less than\nactual inflation or near-term expectations, suggesting that households,\nbusinesses, and market participants also believe that current high\ninflation readings are likely to prove transitory and that, in any case,\nthe Fed will keep inflation close to our 2% objective over time.12\n\nOpening Remarks 9\nChart 6\nLonger-Term Inflation Expectations Have Largely\nReversed Earlier Declines\nA.

The prevalence of global disinflationary forces over the past\nquarter century\nFinally, it is worth noting that, since the 1990s, inflation in many\nadvanced economies has run somewhat below 2% even in good\ntimes (Chart 7). The pattern of low inflation likely reflects sustained\ndisinflationary forces, including technology, globalization and\nperhaps demographic factors, as well as a stronger and more successful\ncommitment by central banks to maintain price stability.13 In the\nUnited States, unemployment ran below 4% for about two years\nbefore the pandemic, while inflation ran at or below 2%. Wages did\nmove up across the income spectrum—a welcome development—\nbut not by enough to lift price inflation consistently to 2%. While\nthe underlying global disinflationary factors are likely to evolve over\ntime, there is little reason to think that they have suddenly reversed\nor abated. It seems more likely that they will continue to weigh on\ninflation as the pandemic passes into history.14\n\n10 Jerome H.

Let me now turn\nto how the baseline outlook and the associated risks and uncertainties\nfigure in our monetary policymaking.\nImplications for Monetary Policy\nThe period from 1950 through the early 1980s provides two\nimportant lessons for managing the risks and uncertainties we face\ntoday. The early days of stabilization policy in the 1950s taught\nmonetary policymakers not to attempt to offset what are likely to\nbe temporary fluctuations in inflation.15 Indeed, responding may do\nmore harm than good, particularly in an era where policy rates are\nmuch closer to the effective lower bound even in good times. The\nmain influence of monetary policy on inflation can come after a lag\nof a year or more. If a central bank tightens policy in response to\n\nOpening Remarks 11\nfactors that turn out to be temporary, the main policy effects are\nlikely to arrive after the need has passed. The ill-timed policy move\nunnecessarily slows hiring and other economic activity and pushes\ninflation lower than desired. Today, with substantial slack remaining\nin the labor market and the pandemic continuing, such a mistake\ncould be particularly harmful. We know that extended periods\nof unemployment can mean lasting harm to workers and to the\nproductive capacity of the economy.16\nHistory also teaches, however, that central banks cannot take for\ngranted that inflation due to transitory factors will fade. The 1970s\nsaw two periods in which there were large increases in energy and\nfood prices, raising headline inflation for a time. But when the direct\neffects on headline inflation eased, core inflation continued to run\npersistently higher than before. One likely contributing factor was\nthat the public had come to generally expect higher inflation—one\nreason why we now monitor inflation expectations so carefully.17\nCentral banks have always faced the problem of distinguishing\ntransitory inflation spikes from more troublesome developments,\nand it is sometimes difficult to do so with confidence in real time.\nAt such times, there is no substitute for a careful focus on incoming\ndata and evolving risks. If sustained higher inflation were to become\na serious concern, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)\nwould certainly respond and use our tools to assure that inflation\nruns at levels that are consistent with our goal.\nIncoming data should provide more evidence that some of the\nsupply–demand imbalances are improving, and more evidence of a\ncontinued moderation in inflation, particularly in goods and services\nprices that have been most affected by the pandemic. We also expect\nto see continued strong job creation. And we will be learning more\nabout the delta variant’s effects. For now, I believe that policy is well\npositioned; as always, we are prepared to adjust policy as appropriate\nto achieve our goals.\nThat brings me to a concluding word on the path ahead for\nmonetary policy. The Committee remains steadfast in our oft-\nexpressed commitment to support the economy for as long as is\n\n12 Jerome H. Powell\nneeded to achieve a full recovery. The changes we made last year to\nour Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy\nare well suited to address today’s challenges.\nWe have said that we would continue our asset purchases at the\ncurrent pace until we see substantial further progress toward our\nmaximum employment and price stability goals, measured since last\nDecember, when we first articulated this guidance. My view is that\nthe “substantial further progress” test has been met for inflation.\nThere has also been clear progress toward maximum employment.\nAt the FOMC’s recent July meeting, I was of the view, as were most\nparticipants, that if the economy evolved broadly as anticipated, it\ncould be appropriate to start reducing the pace of asset purchases\nthis year. The intervening month has brought more progress in the\nform of a strong employment report for July, but also the further\nspread of the delta variant. We will be carefully assessing incoming\ndata and the evolving risks. Even after our asset purchases end, our\nelevated holdings of longer-term securities will continue to support\naccommodative financial conditions.\nThe timing and pace of the coming reduction in asset purchases\nwill not be intended to carry a direct signal regarding the timing\nof interest rate liftoff, for which we have articulated a different and\nsubstantially more stringent test. We have said that we will continue\nto hold the target range for the federal funds rate at its current level\nuntil the economy reaches conditions consistent with maximum\nemployment, and inflation has reached 2% and is on track to\nmoderately exceed 2% for some time. We have much ground to\ncover to reach maximum employment, and time will tell whether we\nhave reached 2% inflation on a sustainable basis.\nThese are challenging times for the public we serve, as the pandemic\nand its unprecedented toll on health and economic activity linger.\nBut I will end on a positive note. Before the pandemic, we all saw\nthe extraordinary benefits that a strong labor market can deliver to\nour society. Despite today’s challenges, the economy is on a path\nto just such a labor market, with high levels of employment and\nparticipation, broadly shared wage gains, and inflation running close\nto our price stability goal.\n\nOpening Remarks 13\nEndnotes\n1 See, for example, Chart 5.\n2This figure includes both the decline in the number reporting themselves as em-\nployed in the Household Survey as well as the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ estimate\nof those who misreported themselves as employed but not at work rather than on\ntemporary layoff.\n3From the peak to the trough quarter, gross domestic product dropped 10% last\nyear, compared with 3.8% in the 2007-09 recession.\n4For example, the consensus forecast reported by Blue Chip Economic Indica-\ntors in April 2020 put the unemployment rate in the second quarter of 2021 at\n7.4%, compared with the actual value of 5.9%.\n5An alternative measure that adjusts for the misclassification of some unem-\nployed workers as employed but not at work (as reported by the Bureau of Labor\nStatistics) and for diminished labor force participation induced by the pandemic\n(as estimated by Federal Reserve Board staff) currently stands at 7.8%, also a post-\npandemic low.\n6Factors holding back job gains are more thoroughly discussed in the July\n2021 Monetary Policy Report, which is available on the Board’s website at https://\nwww.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/20210709_mprfullreport.pdf\n7These values reflect data through July as released on Aug. 27, 2021. All other\nstatements about personal consumption expenditures and associated prices reflect\ndata through June and do not include the Aug. 27, 2021 release covering July.\n8Declines in used car prices would begin holding down 12-month inflation once\nmost of the earlier price increases have fallen out of the 12-month window.\n9The lower inflation in durable goods is probably due to a number factors, includ-\ning faster productivity growth in durable goods than in services and globalization.\n10If wages rise in line with inflation and labor productivity growth, then real unit\nlabor costs (or the labor cost of producing one unit of output) to businesses are\nconstant. Wages may grow slower or faster than inflation plus productivity growth\nfor extended periods because of changing structural factors without being reflected\nin inflation. Ultimately, however, persistently rising real unit labor costs will put\nupward pressure on prices.\n11The way the CIE combines the underlying measures means that it will tend not\nto be affected by underlying movements that are unique to individual measures;\nthe CIE will reflect movements that are more common across underlying measures.\n12On a Q4-over-Q4 basis, the Aug. 13, 2021, Survey of Professional Forecasters\nreports a consensus forecast for total personal consumption expenditures infla-\ntion of 4.1%, 2.2%, and 2.3% for 2021 to 2023, respectively. The corresponding\n\n14 Jerome H. Powell\nnumbers for core inflation are 3.7%, 2.2% and 2.1%, respectively. The Aug. 10,\n2021, Blue Chip Economic Indicators Forecast presents similar consensus forecasts\nfor 2021 and 2022.\n13For views on this, see Canon, Kudlyak, and Reed (2015), Forbes (2019),\nGoodhart and Pradhan (2020), Obstfeld (2020).\n14For an opposing view, see Goodhart and Pradhan (2020), who argue that the\nglobalization and demographic factors that had been fueling global disinflationary\nforces are now reversing and could give rise to an inflationary period. Even if we\nare near an inflection point, as Goodhart and Pradhan argue, demographic forces\nmove slowly relative to the near-term policy horizon I am discussing here today.\n15As I discussed here two years ago, Milton Friedman first made this argument\nreferring to the stop-and-go policies in the 1950s. See Powell (2019) and Friedman\n(1958, p. 241). Bodenstein, Erceg, and Guerrieri (2008) and Mishkin (2007) il-\nlustrate the problems that reacting to transitory sources of inflation can cause using\ntwo of the Board staff’s models.\n16See, for example, Davis and von Wachter (2011).\n17See, for example, Orphanides and Williams (2013) on the role of de-anchored\ninflation expectations.

Powell\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nLarge Bank Directors Conference\nChicago, IL\nAugust 30, 2017\n\nGood morning. Thank you to President Evans for inviting me to speak here today about\nthe role of boards of directors of large banking firms.1 Ten years ago this month, the world\nwitnessed the first tremors of what we now think of as the Global Financial Crisis and the\nsubsequent Great Recession. For the United States and many other countries, this would turn out\nto be the most painful economic period since the Great Depression.\nIn the wake of the crisis, governments around the world instituted a wide range of\nreforms that were designed to reduce the likelihood and severity of a recurrence. In the United\nStates, the core elements of those reforms included significantly higher capital standards; new\nliquidity requirements; forward-looking stress tests; and resolution planning. Our largest\nbanking firms are without question much stronger than before the crisis. We are nearing\ncompletion of the major parts of this reform program, and are undertaking a thorough review to\nhelp assure that the reforms we put in place are both effective and efficient.2\nDuring the crisis, some large banking firms incurred massive losses. Some of these losses\nwere from products – such as super-senior collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) or structured\ninvestment vehicles (SIVs) – whose risks were not even on the radar screen of the firm’s board\nof directors. After the crisis, the Federal Reserve significantly raised our expectations for the\nboards of directors of large banking firms. Taking risk in service of clients is an essential part of\nthe business of banking, including credit risk, interest rate risk, and various forms of operational\nrisk. Our reforms were designed to assure that boards of directors understand and approve the\n1 The views I express here are my own and not necessarily those of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem.\n2 Jerome H. Powell, “Relationship Between Regulation and Economic Growth,” (testimony before the Committee\non Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, June 22, 2017),\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/powell20170622a.htm.\n\n- 2 -\nstrategy of the company and the risks inherent in that strategy, and that the institution has the\ncapital, liquidity, and risk management capabilities necessary to manage those risks.\nToday, the role of a director of a large banking firm is more expansive, more challenging,\nand more important than ever. Boards now oversee management’s participation in highly\nchallenging annual exercises, such as stress testing, capital planning, and resolution planning,\nthat have fundamentally changed the business of our largest institutions. Boards now more\ncarefully evaluate the compensation practices of these large institutions to assure that they\nreinforce positive incentives and discourage unwanted risk taking. Across a range of\nresponsibilities, we simply expect much more of boards of directors than ever before. There is\nno reason to expect that to change.\nWe do take seriously our obligation to assess whether our reforms are achieving their\ndesired effects, without imposing unnecessary burden. In 2014, we began a review of these\nhigher expectations for directors. We found that many boards have significantly improved their\npractices. We also found some ways to make our reforms both more effective and more\nefficient. For example, while directors generally say that they understand and embrace their\nmore challenging responsibilities, we consistently hear that directors feel buried in hundreds or\neven thousands of pages of highly granular information, to the point where more important\nstrategic issues are crowded out of board deliberations. Some of this granular information was\nlikely driven by our supervisory guidance, which included specific expectations not only for the\nmanagement of the institution, but also for the board of directors. Over time, this guidance has\nincreased the number of specific directives aimed at boards well into the hundreds, which may\nhave fostered a “check-the-box” approach by boards.\n\n- 3 -\nThere is also a widespread feeling that our supervision seems to have downplayed the\ndifference in roles between boards and management. Our current ratings system for bank\nholding companies, which for large banking firms would be replaced by the currently proposed\nLFI ratings system, refers to the “board and senior management” as a subcomponent rating of\nrisk management.3 We have also combined the roles of the board and senior management in\nmany of our supervisory feedback letters.\nAfter careful consideration, last month we proposed a new framework for our oversight\nof boards.4 In formulating this proposal, we had discussions with academics, consultants, legal\npractitioners, and directors of banking firms.\nLet me start by saying what the new approach will not do. We do not intend that these\nreforms will lower the bar for boards or lighten the loads of directors. The new approach\ndistinguishes the board from senior management so that we can spotlight our expectations of\neffective boards. The intent is to enable directors to spend less board time on routine matters and\nmore on core board responsibilities: overseeing management as they devise a clear and coherent\ndirection for the firm, holding management accountable for the execution of that strategy, and\nensuring the independence and stature of the risk management and internal audit functions.\nThese were all areas that were found wanting in the financial crisis, and it is essential that boards\nget these fundamentals right.\nOur new proposal will move to a principles-based approach. We have identified five\ncommon attributes that effective boards should exhibit, and for which we will have high\nexpectations. This principles-based approach recognizes that large firms have a broad range of\n3 See SR letter 04–18, ‘‘Bank Holding Company Rating System,’’ 69 FR 70444 (December 6, 2004), at\nwww.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/srletters/2004/sr0418.htm.\n4 See www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20170803a.htm.\n\n- 4 -\nbusiness models, structures, and practices. While we want to be clear about our expectations,\nwe also want to give directors the flexibility to meet them in a manner that works for their\nparticular boards.\nFirst, an effective board should guide the development of a clear and coherent strategy\nfor the firm and set the types and levels of risks it is willing to take. Alignment of business\nstrategy and risk appetite should minimize the firm’s exposure to large and unexpected losses. In\naddition, the firm’s risk management capabilities need to be commensurate with the risks it\nexpects to take.\nSecond, an effective board should actively manage its information flow and deliberations,\nso that the board can make sound, well-informed decisions that take into account risks and\nopportunities.\nThird, an effective board should hold senior management accountable for implementing\nthe firm’s strategy and risk appetite and maintaining the firm’s risk management and control\nframework.\nFourth, an effective board should ensure the independence and stature of the independent\nrisk management and internal audit functions. It is difficult to overstate the importance of this.\nRisk management systems and controls may discourage or limit certain revenue-generating\nopportunities. Failure to ensure the independence of these functions from the revenue generators\nand risk takers has been shown to be dangerous, and this is something for which the board is\naccountable.\nFinally, an effective board should have a composition, governance structure, and set of\nestablished practices that are appropriate in light of the firm’s size, complexity, scope of\noperations, and risk profile. Boards need to be aware of their own strengths and weaknesses, and\n\n- 5 -\nto ensure that directors bring an appropriately diverse range of skills, knowledge, experience, and\nperspective. Significant events, such as an unexpected loss or compliance failure, should cause\nboards to reflect and reassess their structure, composition, and processes. An effective board\ntakes a preventative approach and engages in probing self-assessments regularly and\nsystematically.\nBefore I conclude, let me say a few words about an aspect of the proposal that has\nattracted some attention, which is the reversal of a relatively recent practice of directing all\nexamination and inspection findings--what we call “matters requiring attention” (MRAs) and\n“matters requiring immediate attention” (MRIAs)--to the board as well as to management.5 The\npractice resulted in boards of directors reviewing and signing off on management’s compliance\nwith every MRA and MRIA. When we began that practice in 2013, our intention was to ensure\nthat directors were in a position to hold management accountable in addressing risk management\nshortcomings. By 2014, we realized that the practice was “almost surely distracting from\nstrategic and risk-related analyses and oversight by boards”.6 For perspective, a large banking\nfirm may have one hundred or more MRAs outstanding at a given time, many of which are at a\n5 MRIAs are matters of significant importance and urgency that the Federal Reserve requires banking organizations\nto address immediately and include, for example, matters that have the potential to pose significant risk to the safety\nand soundness of the banking organization, matters that represent significant noncompliance with applicable laws or\nregulations and repeat criticisms that have escalated in importance due to insufficient attention or inaction by the\nbanking organization. MRAs, on the other hand, are matters that are important and that the Federal Reserve is\nexpecting a banking organization to address over a reasonable period of time, but when the timing need not be\n“immediate.” See Supervision and Regulation (SR) letter 13-13/Consumer Affairs letter 13-10, “Supervisory\nConsiderations for the Communication of Supervisory Findings,” at\nwww.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/srletters/sr1313.htm.\n6 See “Corporate Governance and Prudential Regulation,” remarks by Governor Daniel J. Tarullo at Association of\nAmerican Law Schools Midyear Meeting, June 9, 2014. (“We should probably be somewhat more selective in\ncreating the regulatory checklist for board compliance and regular consideration. One example, drawn from Federal\nReserve practice, is the recent supervisory guidance requiring that every notice of a “Matter Requiring Attention”\n(MRA) issued by supervisors must be reviewed, and compliance signed off, by the board of directors. There are\nsome MRAs that clearly should come to the board’s attention, but the failure to discriminate among them is almost\nsurely distracting from strategic and risk-related analyses and oversight by boards.”)\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/tarullo20140609a.pdf\n\n- 6 -\nlevel of granularity that is more appropriate for management to remediate, with board oversight.\nThe new proposed framework is designed to make boards more effective in holding management\naccountable in these efforts. While we have proposed that most MRAs and MRIAs be addressed\nin the first instance to management and not to the board, the board would continue to receive\nMRAs where board practices are at issue or where management has failed to promptly and\nadequately take the required actions. The board would also continue to receive copies of\nexamination and inspection reports, including formal communications with the institution. In the\nparlance of the proposed guidance I just outlined, we fully expect the board to actively manage\nthe information flow related to MRAs and to hold management accountable for remediating\nthem. In doing so, a board may choose to track progress and closure of MRAs through an\nappropriate board committee, rather than getting into the granular detail on every individual\nMRA.\nConclusion\nWe need financial institutions that are strong enough to support economic growth by\nlending through the economic cycle. To achieve that goal, we need strong and effective boards\nof directors at firms of all sizes. A strong and effective board provides strategic leadership and\noversight, which is much more challenging and important than checking off lists of assigned\ntasks. I look forward to our continuing dialogue on this subject today and in the months to come,\nand reviewing carefully the comments received on the proposal.",

Powell\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Community Banking in the 21st Century”\nFourth Annual Community Banking Research and Policy Conference, sponsored by\nthe Federal Reserve System and the Conference of State Bank Supervisors\nSt. Louis, Missouri\nSeptember 29, 2016\n\nWelcome to Day 2 of the conference. I am grateful to the organizing committee\nfor inviting me to be part of this important event once again. This is the third time that I\nhave had the privilege of addressing this unique audience, which brings together bankers,\nbank supervisors, and banking researchers to share their thoughts regarding the current\nand future state of community banking. The interactions that occur at these annual\ngatherings are incredibly valuable and stimulate innovative thinking on the part of all\nthree groups of participants.\nAs usual, the organizers have put together a highly relevant agenda. I was\nparticularly struck by the way in which this year’s program spans generations, from last\nnight’s keynote speaker, Gene Rainbolt, who began his career in banking more than\n50 years ago, to the winners of the case study competition, who are just preparing to\nembark on their careers. I hope that these impressive and accomplished young men and\nwomen will enjoy long and successful careers in banking that they will be able to reflect\nback on during the 54th annual community banking conference in 2066. I have already\npenciled in the date on my calendar, and I look forward to hearing what they will have to\nsay.\nWhile the keynote addresses, case study competition, and networking\nopportunities all contribute to the appeal of this event, it is the research sessions that form\nthe core of the conference. In the first research session yesterday, we heard about the\nimportance of community banks to the Missouri economy, the viability of the traditional\nbanking model, what is special about community banks, and the changing characteristics\nof the communities served by minority depository institutions. In the second session, we\nheard about the relationship between bank size and performance from three quite\n\n- 2 -\ndifferent perspectives. Both of these sessions provided cause for optimism about the\nfuture relevance and importance of community banks while simultaneously raising\nconcerns about the viability of the very smallest banking organizations.\nIn my remarks today, I would like to explore this mixed message a bit further and\nask what the observed trends in the data imply for today’s community bankers and the\ncommunities they serve. In doing so, I will look at changes in the community banking\nsector at a national level and will also look at geographic patterns of community bank\ngrowth and decline. For purposes of these remarks, I will define community banks as\nthose with less than $10 billion in assets, although my conclusions would be the same if I\nused a lower cutoff, such as $1 billion in assets, or a more detailed definition of\ncommunity banks, such as that developed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\n(FDIC) a few years ago.1 As always, the views I express here today are my own.\nI will start by discussing figures showing the number of community banks\noperating in the United States over the past 20 years. Figure 1 shows the number of\ncommunity banks for each year from 1995 to 2015. It shows a steady decline in the\nnumber of such banks over time. The rate of decline is considerably steeper in the late\n1990s than in the period from 2000 to 2010. In the past five years, the rate of decrease\nhas accelerated somewhat but remains slower than that experienced in the late 1990s.\nBreaking the universe of community banks down into subgroups based on size,\nwe can see that the decline in community bank numbers is far from uniform.2 The\nnumber of banks with between $1 billion and $10 billion in assets has doubled since 1995\n1 The FDIC definition of community banks can be found at\nhttps://www.fdic.gov/regulations/resources/cbi/report/CBSI-1.pdf\n2 All asset sizes are converted to 2005 dollars, so the changes in size distribution cannot be attributed to\ninflation.\n\n- 3 -\n(figure 2), although such banks still make up a small percentage of all community banks.\nI should note that the growth in this “large community bank” category is greater than that\namong banks with more than $10 billion in assets, in terms of both the number of banks\nadded to the category and the percentage growth rate. Banks ranging in size from\n$300 million to $1 billion have also roughly doubled in number over these past 20 years\n(figure 3). And the number of banks in the size range from $100 million to $300 million\nin assets has declined by only a very modest percentage since 1995 (figure 4).\nHowever, the picture for banks with less than $100 million in assets is very\ndifferent from the picture for larger banks. As can be seen in figure 5, the number of\nsuch banking organizations has declined by more than two-thirds since 1995. As with the\npattern for all community banks, the decline in the number of these small community\nbanks was steeper in the late 1990s than in later years.\nWe can identify four factors that help to account for the decrease in the number of\nbanks with under $100 million in assets. Some of this decline reflects the growth of\nsmall banks (often de novo banks) out of the smallest size range into larger size\ncategories due to either organic growth or acquisition of another bank. Indeed,\n90 percent of the large drop-off in the number of banks in this size range in 2014 and\n2015 is due to banks moving up into a larger size category. A number of the smallest\nbanking organizations also disappeared as a result of being merged with or acquired by\nother banking organizations. Some of the decline reflects the failures experienced in the\nGreat Recession. And, finally, there have been few new bank formations in recent years.\nAs noted in a 2014 article by McCord and Prescott, a key difference between the\npast few years and the late 1990s is that the recent acceleration in the rate of decrease in\n\n- 4 -\nthe number of community banks is due in large part to a decline in new bank charters\nrather than an increase in the annual number of exits.3 This fact can be seen in figure 6,\nwhich shows the number of new charters each year (in blue, with squares to mark yearly\nvalues), the actual annual change in the number of community banks (in green, with\ntriangles), and what the annual change in the number of banks would have been in the\nabsence of new entry (in red, with circles), over the past 20 years. It is clear from this\nfigure that in the absence of new entry, the annual decline in the number of community\nbanks between 2000 and 2010 would have been quite similar to what it has been since\n2010. Or, viewed from a different perspective, if entry had remained at more “normal”\nlevels during the past 5 years, the rate of decline in the number of community banks\nwould not have accelerated. And, since almost all new entrants have less than $100\nmillion in assets, the decline in the number of banks in this smallest size category would\nhave been much less steep during the past 5 years.\nResearch by Adams and Gramlich that was presented at the 2014 community\nbanking conference and subsequently published in the Review of Industrial Organization\nconsiders the underlying causes of the virtual absence of new bank formation since\n2009.4 This research suggests that slow economic growth and low interest rates in the\npost-crisis environment can explain about 75 percent of the decline in new bank charters.\nThe authors were not able to isolate the effect of regulatory changes on the rate of new\nbank formation, but note that regulation may also play a role.\n3 See Roisin McCord and Edward Simpson Prescott (2014), “The Financial Crisis, the Collapse of Bank\nEntry, and Changes in the Size Distribution of Banks,” Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Economic\nQuarterly, vol. 100 (First Quarter), pp. 23-50, available at\nhttps://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/economic_quarterly/2014/q1/prescott.\n4 Robert M. Adams and Jacob Gramlich (2016), “Where Are All the New Banks? The Role of Regulatory\nBurden in New Bank Formation,” Review of Industrial Organization, vol. 48 (March), pp. 181-208.\n\n- 5 -\nThe sharp difference in trends for the number of banks with less than $100 million\nin assets compared with larger community banks naturally leads to the question of\nwhether this difference is reflected in basic bank performance measures. I will begin\nwith return on assets (ROA). Breaking down all community banks into the same size\ncategories I used earlier, with the addition of a category for all banks larger than $10\nbillion in assets, we find striking differences in the patterns of bank profitability over\ntime (figure 7). The largest community banks--those with $1 billion to $10 billion in\nassets (in green, with diamonds to mark yearly values)--followed a pattern similar to that\nof our largest banks (in black, with crosses), but with slightly worse results throughout\nthe past 20 years. These large community banks had lower average levels of profitability\nthan our largest banks prior to the recent recession, suffered worse losses in 2009, and\nhave enjoyed lower levels of earnings since the crisis.\nBanks in the size range from $300 million to $1 billion in assets (in blue, with\ntriangles) have been the most consistently profitable group among community banks,\nalthough their profit levels still lag those for the largest banks. These midsize community\nbanks performed as well as banks with $1 billion to $10 billion in assets before the recent\nrecession and remained profitable, on average, even in 2009.\nThe story is much the same for banks in the size class from $100 million to\n$300 million in assets (in red, with squares). Their profit levels were slightly lower than\nthose for larger community banks prior to the crisis, but they performed similarly until\n2015, when banks of this size showed a decline in profits not experienced by any other\nsize grouping of community banks. Time will tell whether this is an anomaly or the\nbeginning of a pattern.\n\n- 6 -\nLooking at the smallest community banks, those with less than $100 million in\nassets, gives some hints for why their numbers have declined. The average ROA for the\nsmallest banks (in purple, with circles) has been consistently lower than that for the next-\nsmallest class of banks since 1995. The already lower level of profits for the smallest\nbanks began to decline further in 2006. Since 2009, profits for the smallest banks have\nincreased slightly but remain below their levels of profitability prior to the recession and\nbelow the ROA levels for larger banks.5\nData on nonperforming loans (NPLs) show a mixed picture.6 A breakdown of\ncommunity banks by size indicates that the ratio of NPLs to total loans peaked for every\nsize category in 2010 (figure 8). Prior to 2007, the smallest community banks\nconsistently had a higher ratio of NPLs than did larger community banks; but from 2007\nuntil 2013, their NPL rate was below that of larger community banks. In the past two\nyears, NPLs on the balance sheets of the smallest banks have declined more slowly than\nfor larger banks so that banks with less than $100 million in assets once again have the\nhighest NPL ratio.\nLet me turn now to consider changes in the number of community banks over the\npast 20 years at a more local level. For purposes of this discussion, I define local banking\nmarkets as counties in rural areas and as Metropolitan Statistical Areas in urban areas.\n5 The patterns for return on equity (ROE) are similar to those for ROA, although community banks as a\nwhole had negative ROE in both 2009 and 2010. The largest community banks, with $1 billion to\n$10 billion in assets, suffered much greater negative returns on equity in these years than did smaller\ncommunity banks. Midsize community banks, with $300 million to $1 billion in assets, fared better than\ntheir larger and smaller counterparts.\nThe smallest community banks showed an unusual pattern in their ROEs. (It should be noted that, for\nbanks of this size, ROE can be a questionable measure of profitability because such banks tend to be either\nprivately held or very thinly traded.) These banks were in the only size category that did not show a\nnegative ROE in 2009, but it was also the only class to show a negative ROE in 2013, and the ROE for\nthese banks has been consistently below that for larger banks since the recession.\n6 NPLs are defined as nonaccrual loans plus loans that are 90-plus days past due and still accruing.\n\n- 7 -\nFigure 9 shows those local banking markets in which the number of community banks\ndecreased over the 20 years from 1995 to 2015 (in white) and those markets in which the\nnumber of community banks increased or stayed constant (in blue). As you can see, there\nare markets in every state where the number of community banks has declined.\nHowever, there also are markets in every state where community banks have maintained\nor increased their presence. In fact, the number of local markets that saw their population\nof community banks hold constant or increase between 1995 and 2015 was more than\ndouble the number of local markets that experienced a decline in the number of\ncommunity banks over this period. And, perhaps surprisingly, the share of rural markets\nexperiencing a decrease in the number of community banks (about 32 percent) was\nslightly lower than the share of urban markets facing such a decline (about 35 percent).\nAs we saw, the vast majority of the decline in the number of community banks\ninvolved banks with less than $100 million in assets. This next figure (figure 10) shows\nchanges in the number of banks in this smallest size category together with changes in the\nnumber of all community banks. The local markets that are shaded in dark blue are those\nwhere both the number of banks with less than $100 million in assets and the number of\nall community banks declined between 1995 and 2015. The light-blue markets are those\nwhere the total number of community banks remained constant or increased despite a\ndecline in the number of banks in the smallest size category. There are just over twice as\nmany markets shaded in light blue as there are shaded in dark blue, indicating that in two-\nthirds of the markets where the number of very small community banks declined, the\nnumber of community banks overall did not decline. Markets in white are those where\n\n- 8 -\nthe number of banks in the smallest category increased or remained unchanged over the\npast 20 years.\nThis examination of the geographic patterns of changes in the population of\ncommunity banks has shown that most markets in the United States have maintained or\nincreased their numbers of community banks over the past 20 years. Those local markets\nthat have lost community banks have not been concentrated in any particular section of\nthe country, and urban markets have been slightly more likely to lose community banks\nover the past 20 years than rural areas.\nOne might ask, what factors have led some markets to lose community banks\nwhile others gained community banks or saw no change? Because of the importance of\ncommunity banks as a source of small business lending and other retail services, we have\nexplored this question but do not yet have any definitive answers. We considered the\npossibility that underlying demographic characteristics were driving the observed\nchanges in the number of banks in a local market area. Perhaps the size of the labor force\nor the population density, the racial and ethnic mix of the population, or changes in any\nof these factors might explain the outcome. We also considered whether economic\nconditions such as the unemployment rate, the median household income, the number of\nbusiness establishments, or changes in any of these measures might be useful in\npredicting which markets would lose community banks over time. Taking into account\nall of these variables in a regression framework did not yield much explanatory power.\nThis analysis has not led us to a clear story regarding the determinants of changes\nin the number of community banks serving a local market area, but we intend to continue\nour research efforts and hope that they will ultimately yield some valuable insights. We\n\n- 9 -\ncan take some comfort from the fact that the number of local markets that either\nmaintained or increased the number of community banks serving their residents and small\nbusinesses is much larger than the number of markets that saw a decline in the number of\ncommunity banks. That said, we recognize that the loss of community banks may have\ncaused some communities to suffer adverse economic consequences.\nSo, what do we take away from this review of bank numbers and performance?\nFirst, the decline in the number of community banks is not a recent phenomenon--it has\nbeen a constant theme over at least the past 20 years. Second, it has occurred almost\nexclusively among the smallest community banks--those with less than $100 million in\nassets. However, I want to emphasize that the long-trending decline in the number of\nvery small community banks does not mean that these banks do not play an important\nrole in our financial system. Almost all newly chartered banks fall into this category, and\nmany of these banks thrive and, ultimately, outgrow the smallest size category. Thus,\nbanks with less than $100 million in assets should be viewed as a key source of\ndynamism and competition within the banking sector. Third, although the rate of decline\nhas accelerated a bit during the past 5 years, that acceleration is largely due to a lack of\nentry rather than an increased rate of exit. Fourth, although the lack of entry may be due\nin part to increased regulatory burden, much of it can be explained by very low interest\nrates and a post-crisis expansion that has been slower than usual. Fifth, at a local level,\nabout one-third of markets have seen a decline in the number of community banks over\nthe past 20 years, but about two-thirds have seen no change or an increase in the number\nof community banks. It is unclear what factors explain observed changes in the number\nof community banks at a local market level. More research is needed on this question.\n\n- 10 -\nI think the key question for policymakers is whether the recent acceleration in the\nrate of decline in the number of small banks is primarily a structural change attributable\nto increasing economies of scale--or, perhaps more accurately, diseconomies of very\nsmall scale--or whether recent efforts by the FDIC and others to encourage more\nchartering of new banks, combined with a return to higher interest rates and stronger\neconomic growth, will mitigate the decline in numbers. At this point, I think it is too\nsoon to say.\nThe Federal Reserve and the Conference of State Bank Supervisors began this\nconference three years ago in order to stimulate research on community banks, with the\ngoal of improving our understanding of their condition and their important contributions\nto economic growth and prosperity. We plan to continue our own research efforts across\nthe Federal Reserve System, as well as our efforts, through initiatives such as this\nconference, to encourage academics to focus their attention on community banks.\nOf course, the Federal Reserve’s support for community banks goes well beyond\nresearch. One of the clearest lessons from our most recent recession is that, when it\ncomes to bank regulation and supervision, one size does not fit all. As we seek to\npromote safety and soundness and ensure consumer compliance, we increasingly tailor\nrules and supervisory approaches to the differing risks posed by institutions of different\nsize and complexity. This way, we can achieve our aims without creating undue\nregulatory burden. The Federal Reserve is committed to this approach to community\nbank oversight and to ensuring that new and existing regulations are not unduly\nburdensome for community banks. In addition to fulfilling this commitment, the Federal\nReserve and other federal banking agencies have launched a review to identify banking\n\n- 11 -\nregulations that are outdated, unnecessary, or unduly burdensome, as required by the\nEconomic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act.\nThe Federal Reserve has taken some concrete steps to provide burden relief by\npublishing a streamlined Call Report for non-complex community banks, extending the\nexamination cycle for banks with $1 billion or less in total assets, increasing the threshold\nfor the Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement to $1 billion and expanding the\nscope to include savings and loan holding companies. In addition, we have efforts\nunderway to reduce burden associated with our real estate appraisal requirements, to\nsimplify the regulatory capital requirement for community banks, to encourage resource\nsharing among community banks to help manage their BSA and AML obligations, and to\nuse Call Report data and forward-looking risk analytics to identify high-risk community\nbanks, which would allow us to focus our supervisory response on the areas of highest\nrisk and reduce the regulatory burden on low-risk community banks. We will continue to\nwork with bankers and the other banking regulators to ensure that we reduce burden and\ncomplexity in our regulations and guidance.\nAnother way that we further our understanding is by talking to the bankers\nthemselves. The entire Board of Governors meets twice a year with the Community\nDepository Institutions Advisory Council, which includes representatives of community\nbanks, thrifts, and credit unions in each of the 12 Federal Reserve Districts. Individual\nGovernors also take advantage of opportunities to meet with community bankers from\ntime to time. I speak regularly to bank executives, including those who run smaller\ninstitutions. I find these types of conversations--with people who live and work in the\nworld outside the Capital Beltway and far from Wall Street--to be particularly\n\n- 12 -\nenlightening. In addition, I hope that some of the conversations here today among\nresearchers, bankers, and bank regulators will continue, leading to benefits to all in the\nform of more informative research, better design and implementation of regulatory\npolicy, and enhanced community bank performance.\n\nTrends in Community Bank\nPerformance over the Past 20 Years\nJerome H.

Powell\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nWebinar on Community Banking\nWashington, D.C.\n\nThank you for the opportunity to speak with you today about some of the key issues\nfacing community banks. As the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board’s community and\nregional bank subcommittee, I try to meet with groups of community bankers whenever I can to\nbetter understand what is on community bankers’ minds. While today’s webinar is no substitute\nfor face-to-face meetings with bankers, it is a special treat to be able to leverage technology to\nspeak to and hear from so many community bankers across the country at the same time.\nAs all of you surely know, community banks play a vital role in the U.S. financial\nsystem. Community banks have strong links to the people and businesses in their communities,\nas well as direct knowledge of local economic conditions. These close ties give community\nbankers a clear advantage in understanding local needs and tailoring their products and services\nto meet those needs.\nMy colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board and I are committed to making sure that we\nunderstand the issues that are most important to community banks as you strive to serve the\nfinancial needs of your communities. One way that we further our understanding is by talking to\nthe bankers themselves in a variety of venues, such as this webinar and a community banking\nresearch conference that I attended last month in St. Louis, which was co-sponsored by the\nFederal Reserve System and the Conference of State Bank Supervisors.\nAnd there is another opportunity to communicate with the Federal Reserve and our\nfellow regulators that I want to make sure you are aware of. The Economic Growth and\nRegulatory Paperwork Reduction Act (EGRPRA) of 1996 tasked financial regulators with\nreviewing regulations issued by the agencies at least every 10 years to identify outdated,\nunnecessary, or unduly burdensome regulations. The agencies kicked off that process earlier this\nyear, and in addition to collecting comments in writing, we are beginning a series of meetings\n\n- 2 -\nwith the public in December. One of the themes that we hear in our interactions with community\nbankers is concern that the regulatory environment could be tailored more effectively for\ncommunity banks, and the EGRPRA process gives all interested parties a voice in identifying\nareas where regulatory requirements may be disproportionate to risk. I therefore encourage you\nto participate in this important process and hope you will raise any concerns and ideas you have.\nThe Federal Reserve is committed to tailoring its supervisory practices as appropriate for\ncommunity banks to reduce unnecessary burden, while still ensuring that community banks\ncontinue to operate in a safe and sound manner.\nI am looking forward to our conversation today and, in particular, am interested in\nhearing about topics that are of importance to you as you work to serve your customers, meet the\ncredit needs of your communities, and thrive.",

Powell\nChairman\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nInaugural Janet L. Yellen Award for Excellence in Community Development\nWashington, D.C.\nDecember 3, 2018\n\nThank you, Anna. It’s an honor to be part of this important occasion. Tonight is an\nopportunity to recognize the vital contributions of the Federal Reserve’s community\ndevelopment staff, and an opportunity to honor Chair Yellen, who did so much to advance the\nFed’s community development mission.\nBriefly, I would like to focus on the importance of promoting a strong economy that\nextends opportunity to all and on the role our community development staff plays to advance that\ngoal.\nThe Federal Reserve’s mission is to promote a strong economy and sound financial\nsystem; I am glad to say we have made a great deal of progress toward those goals.\nUnemployment is 3.7 percent, the lowest in nearly half a century. Over 17 million jobs have\nbeen created during this expansion, with an additional 250,000 created in October.\nBeyond the labor market, there are other signs of economic strength. The steady decline\nin the unemployment rate is mirrored by the decline in financial hardship reported by\nrespondents to the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking over\nthe past five years.1 Wage gains, increased household wealth, and elevated consumer confidence\nare supporting robust consumer spending. Since the crisis, we have also taken numerous steps to\nmake the financial system safer and stronger, leaving it better equipped to support the financial\nneeds of consumers and communities through good times and bad.2\n1 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Report on the Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households in\n2017 (Washington: Board of Governors, May 2018), www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/2017-report-\neconomic-well-being-us-households-201805.pdf.\n2 Jerome H.

The aggregate statistics tend to mask important disparities by income,\nrace, and geography.\nMoreover, the economy faces a number of longer-term challenges.3 While there have\nbeen gains in the pace of wage growth recently, wages for lower-income workers have grown\nquite slowly over the past few decades. Productivity has picked up in recent months after several\nyears of very slow growth, but it is not clear whether this is a trend that will be sustained. An\naging population is limiting growth in labor supply, which in turn limits potential growth. And a\ndecades-long decline in economic mobility in the United States reflects the difficulty faced by\nlower-income Americans in moving up the economic ladder.4\nThe Fed’s community development function plays a key role in helping us carry out our\nbroad responsibilities. Information gathered by the community development staff ensures that\nthe perspectives of individuals and communities inform the Fed’s research, policy, and actions.\nSoliciting diverse views on issues affecting the economy and financial markets improves the\nquality of our research, the fairness of our policies, and the transparency of our actions. Raising\nawareness of emerging economic trends and risks makes regulation and supervision more\nresponsive to evolving consumer financial services markets and technologies.

These efforts strengthen the capacity\nof both financial institutions and community organizations to meet the needs of the communities\nthey serve.\nIn addition to providing us with a richer, more nuanced understanding of current\neconomic and financial conditions, the Federal Reserve’s community development staff is deeply\nengaged in helping lower-income and underserved communities overcome their challenges and\ncapitalize on their assets. One thing that was apparent during the recession and the uneven\nrecovery that followed was that people and the places they live are linked. When one struggles,\nboth struggle. Successful community development invests in and builds up both the physical\ninfrastructure and human capital in underserved areas. The Federal Reserve is uniquely\npositioned to bring together diverse stakeholders to disseminate information, exchange ideas, and\nidentify shared interests that foster local partnerships and comprehensive solutions.\nThis event is an opportunity to recognize your efforts to advance solutions that build\nresilient and more prosperous communities. I want to thank Ariel Cisneros--our distinguished\ninaugural recipient of the Yellen Award for Excellence in Community Development--as well as\neach of you for your individual and collective service to this effort.\nAnd speaking of service: It is fitting that this award for excellence in community\ndevelopment will today and thenceforth be given in honor of Janet Yellen. During your tenure\nas Chair, Janet, you elevated the importance of economic and financial inclusion and the Fed’s\nrole in community development. You reminded us that an inclusive economy is a vibrant\neconomy.

    "text": "For release on delivery\n5:00 p.m. EST\nFebruary 18, 2015\nFinancial Institutions, Financial Markets, and Financial Stability\nRemarks by\nJerome H. Powell\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nStern School of Business\nNew York University\nNew York, New York\nFebruary 18, 2015\n\nIt has now been over six years since the most acute phase of the financial crisis.\nOver the intervening years, market structures have evolved, and financial firms have\nchanged their business models in important respects. Authorities around the world are\nimplementing reforms that address the painful lessons of the crisis, while at the same\ntime keeping the evolution of markets and firms in mind.1\nToday, I will briefly summarize this sweeping reform program as it relates to\nlarge, global systemically important banks (G-SIBs), critical financial market\ninfrastructure, and money markets. In my view, the basic agendas in these areas are, to\ndifferent degrees, well developed, although a great deal of implementation remains. In\ncontrast, I will argue that thinking about financial stability in the context of credit\nmarkets is less advanced and presents difficult challenges for supervisors. I will consider\na range of factors that may address those challenges, illustrated with a discussion of\nrecent developments in the syndicated leveraged loan market. And I will argue that the\nstandard for regulatory intervention in the credit markets should be higher than for the\nother three areas.\nFinancial Institutions: Even before the financial crisis ended, it was clear that\nreforms to strengthen the most systemically important firms and their regulation and\nsupervision needed to be the first order of business. I will mention four critical elements\nof that program. First, these institutions are required to hold, and now do hold, much\nhigher levels of higher-quality capital, as measured by both risk-based ratios and a much\nmore comprehensive leverage ratio. Under the “enhanced prudential standards” of the\nDodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank), the fully\n1 The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\n- 2 -\nphased-in capital requirements will be meaningfully higher for these institutions because\nof the greater threat their failure would pose to the financial system and to the broader\neconomy. Second, these institutions are for the first time becoming subject to rule-based\nliquidity regulation, including the Liquidity Coverage Ratio, the Net Stable Funding\nRatio, and liquidity stress testing.2 These innovations are in part designed to address the\nfirms’ vulnerabilities to damaging runs on their short-term financing, runs that occurred\nrepeatedly during the crisis and clearly increased its severity. Third, we now have\nrigorous, forward-looking capital stress testing that recognizes the dynamic nature of the\nfinancial system and guards against the excessive optimism that can build during a credit\nboom.\nThese three reforms are well advanced and, in my view, have left the G-SIBs far\nstronger than they were before the crisis. Together, they significantly reduce the\nprobability of a large bank failure. But they would leave us short of meeting the\noverriding objective of eliminating the too-big-to-fail conundrum without a fourth\nreform--a viable resolution mechanism that could handle the failure of these institutions\nwithout severe damage to the economy. Until recently, no nation has had a way of\nhandling such failures without that degree of damage.\nAuthorities around the world have been working to develop an approach to\nresolving large financial firms that credibly imposes losses on shareholders and debt\nholders consistent with the basic tenets of our capitalist system, but does so in a way that\nprotects the rest of the financial system and the real economy from severe damage. The\n2 For more information, see Daniel K. Tarullo (2014), “Liquidity Regulation,” speech delivered at the\nClearing House 2014 Annual Conference, New York, November 20,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/tarullo20141120a%20.htm.\n\n- 3 -\nsingle-point-of-entry approach developed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\n(FDIC) in conjunction with other U.S. supervisors is a promising innovation, especially\nin combination with the recent proposal of the Financial Stability Board to increase the\n“total loss absorbency capacity” of systemically important firms in terms of their total\nlevels of equity and long-term debt. When fully worked out, these new regulatory\nregimes should permit a large, consolidated entity that owns banks or broker-dealers to\ncontinue to function even if the ultimate holding company ceases to be viable and must\nbe recapitalized or wound down.\nAs I said at the outset, these reforms directed at the G-SIBs are well advanced.\nBut much implementation remains, including, most notably, addressing cross-border\nissues associated with the failure of complex global firms. It will take time and continued\ninternational cooperation to complete this task.3\nInfrastructure: The crisis exposed a number of important weaknesses in the\ninfrastructure of the financial markets--what might be more plainly called the plumbing.\nReforms aimed at addressing these weaknesses receive less public attention than those\nfocused on the G-SIBs, and are in some respects less advanced in their conception and\nexecution. But they are, in my view, of great importance.\nI will mention two important sets of reforms in the U.S. context, one well\nadvanced and the other still under development. The first concerns the triparty\nrepurchase agreement (repo) market, which is a principal source of overnight financing\n3 For a more complete treatment of these issues, see Daniel K.

Before the crisis, the functioning of this market was\ncritically dependent on the extension of large volumes of discretionary intraday credit by\ntwo clearing banks. When confidence in Bear Stearns collapsed in March 2008, the\nvulnerability of this market and its settlement procedures in particular became very clear.\nToday, almost seven years later, in no small measure thanks to the leadership and\npersistence of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the triparty repo settlement\nprocess has been substantially reengineered, with reliance on discretionary intraday credit\nessentially eliminated.4 In addition, a smaller fraction of the market now involves the\nfinancing of lower-quality collateral, and far less of the overall funding is provided\novernight and thus subject to daily rollover risk. 5 Dealers in general manage their short-\nterm funding risk far more conservatively than before the crisis, including by carrying\nsubstantially higher levels of liquidity, in part because of the introduction of prudential\nliquidity standards that I mentioned earlier.\nSecond, as I have discussed at some length in other venues, in the run-up to the\ncrisis, the highly opaque and fast-growing market for over-the-counter derivatives gave\nrise to an underappreciated and largely invisible buildup of risk, which proved a major\nsource of instability when the crisis broke.6 In light of this experience, authorities around\n4 For more on this topic, see William C. Dudley (2014), “Welcoming Remarks at Workshop on the Risks\nof Wholesale Funding,” speech delivered at “Workshop on the Risks of Wholesale Funding,” sponsored\nby the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, New York, August 13,\nwww.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2014/dud140813.html.\n5 There have also been reforms to the money market funds that provide most of the funding in this market,\nas discussed later.\n6 See Jerome H. Powell (2013), “OTC Market Infrastructure Reform: Opportunities and Challenges,”\nspeech delivered at the Clearing House 2013 Annual Meeting, New York, November 21,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20131121a.htm; and Jerome H.

But this reform program will only succeed if\nCCPs, in which counterparty credit risks are concentrated, are strong enough to withstand\nsevere but plausible stress scenarios, including, for example, the failure of multiple\nclearing members. Achieving this degree of resiliency will require robust liquidity risk-\nmanagement practices, including the maintenance of substantial buffers of liquid\nresources that can quickly be tapped. In addition, adequate loss absorption capacity is\nessential, including through substantial initial margin requirements and default funds. A\nframework for such requirements has been agreed upon at the international level through\nthe Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures.7 Vigorous implementation at the\nnational level is essential. There is also a need for greater transparency for clearing\nmembers and the public regarding the risk-management practices of CCPs, for\nheightened stress testing, for consideration of “skin-in-the-game” requirements, and for\ncredible recovery and resolution plans. A great deal of work remains to be done to\nfinalize and implement these additional reforms in all of the important CCPs around the\nworld.\n7 See Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems and Technical Committee of the International\nOrganization of Securities Commissions (2012), Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (Basel,\nSwitzerland: Bank for International Settlements and International Organization of Securities Commissions,\nApril), www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d101a.pdf.\n\n- 6 -\nMoney Markets: Money markets involve money-like investments such as\ncommercial paper and repo. Investors in these markets include money market funds,\ncorporations and other large holders of excess cash seeking a safe return in the short term,\nfrequently no longer than overnight. Borrowers in money markets include banks,\nsecurities dealers and other financial companies, nonfinancial corporations, and\ngovernments. By linking investors seeking a safe return with borrowers needing short-\nterm credit, money markets do what commercial banks have always done, but without\ndeposit insurance and other aspects of the safety net provided for regulated depository\ninstitutions. After Lehman failed and the Reserve Fund “broke the buck,” money market\nfund investors realized that their investments were not as safe and liquid as “money” after\nall. There were widespread runs in these markets, and it took a U.S. Treasury guarantee,\naugmented by a number of unprecedented liquidity facilities established by the Federal\nReserve, to stabilize the money market fund industry and, more importantly, stave off a\nsudden stoppage of the flow of credit to households and businesses.\nThis experience tells us clearly that disruptions in the money markets can threaten\nthe broader financial system. Regulation to increase the resilience of the money markets\nneeds to reflect their systemic importance. Some important steps have been taken to\naddress the most immediate risks--for example, through the liquidity standards for large\ninstitutions I mentioned earlier. But the risks associated with dislocations in the money\nmarkets go far beyond the large banks.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has taken some important steps\nto address the money market fund issue, notably through its 2014 rule amendments.8 To\n8 The 2014 SEC rule amendments are available at www.sec.gov/rules/final/2014/33-9616.pdf.\n\n- 7 -\naddress so-called repo runs, the Financial Stability Board is in the final phases of\ndeveloping a framework of margin rules designed to be applied uniformly across nations\nfor securities financing transactions involving nongovernmental securities. These\nminimum standards should increase the resiliency of those markets and mitigate the\npressures on terms that inevitably emerge during benign periods. We expect to propose\nregulations implementing these rules in the United States in due course.\nCredit Markets: That brings me to the credit markets, where households,\nbusinesses and governments engage in borrowing to fund their purchases and operations.\nThese markets figured importantly in the crisis, most notoriously through securities\ncollateralized by subprime mortgages. The story is by now well known. Lenders offered\nthese loans to retail borrowers, often with negligible or simply fraudulent underwriting.\nMany of our largest financial institutions packaged the loans into marginally capitalized\nsecuritization structures that were rated highly by the credit rating agencies and thus\ngenerally viewed as suitable for purchase by a range of investors--including the most risk\naverse. As conditions in the housing market deteriorated, the threat of significant\nmortgage defaults emerged in 2007. The panic began in earnest when it became apparent\nthat exposure to subprime mortgages was ubiquitous, from the balance sheets of key\nfinancial intermediaries and their supposedly “off balance sheet” vehicles to the\ninvestment portfolios of other institutional investors around the world. Although the total\nlosses were initially thought to be not so large as to threaten the system, some of these\ntoxic mortgage-backed securities (MBS) were financed with the types of short-term,\nconfidence-sensitive funding mechanisms I have just described, which amplified the\n\n- 8 -\ndislocations once the run in funding markets began and caused great harm to the broader\neconomy.\nAs the crisis has receded, supervisors--not to mention market participants,\ncommentators, and the general public--have eyed financial markets with a heightened\nsensitivity to anything that resembles the buildup of risks that occurred in the run-up to\nthe crisis--a natural and useful exercise in pattern recognition. In that spirit, the Fed, the\nOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and the FDIC have focused significant\nattention on the origination activities of depository institutions in the syndicated\nleveraged loan market, where some of the troubling patterns that were evident in\nsubprime MBS have been observed.\nThese conditions prompted policymakers first to ask questions and then to act.\nFed officials raised concerns publicly as early as 2011.9 The Fed, the OCC, and the\nFDIC issued supervisory guidance emphasizing these concerns in 2013.10 In 2014, the\nagencies clarified the guidance through published FAQs and began to exercise intensive\nsupervision at the largest regulated banks emphasizing the need to improve underwriting\nstandards and credit risk management on safety and soundness grounds.11\n9 See, for example, Janet L. Yellen (2011), “Assessing Potential Financial Imbalances in an Era of\nAccommodative Monetary Policy,” speech delivered at “Real and Financial Linkage and Monetary\nPolicy,” an international conference sponsored by the Bank of Japan, June 1,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/yellen20110601a.htm.\n10 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and\nOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency (2013), “Interagency Guidance on Leveraged Lending,”\nMarch 13, www.federalreserve.gov/bankinforeg/srletters/sr1303a1.pdf.\n11 Along with the Shared National Credit results, the Fed, along with the OCC and the FDIC, released on\nNovember 7, 2014, an FAQ document regarding the guidance\n(www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/bcreg20141107a3.pdf). Also see Board of Governors of\nthe Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and Office of the Comptroller of the\nCurrency (2014), “Credit Risk in the Shared National Credit Portfolio Is High; Leveraged Lending\nRemains a Concern,” joint press release, November 7,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20141107a.htm.\nThe guidance covers a wide range of risk-management issues and generally aims tighter scrutiny at\ndeals with leverage over six times pre-tax cash flow, or with forecast debt paydown of less than 50 percent\n\n- 9 -\nThe case of the leveraged loan market is an interesting one, because it sits at the\nintersection between core financial institutions and credit markets and illustrates the\nchallenges supervisors face in thinking about intervention in credit markets. I will turn to\nthat market now in some detail.\nThe term portions of leveraged loans are typically not held in the arranging banks’\nportfolios, but rather sold to a wide range of institutional investors--collateralized loan\nobligations (CLOs), retail loan funds, pension funds, insurance companies, hedge funds,\nand others (figures 1 and 2). This “originate-to-distribute” model is now dominant across\na range of markets and reflects the movement over several decades of credit\nintermediation from portfolio lending (from the firm’s perspective, the “storage\nbusiness”) to the capital markets (the “moving business”). This practice transfers and\ndisperses credit and liquidity risks from the core of the financial sector to capital market\ninvestors that are willing to bear such risks for what they deem appropriate compensation.\nWhile the risks do not disappear, the system can, in principle, be safer if the ultimate\ninstitutional investors pose lower risk to the system than banks. For example, movement\nof credit exposure to speculative grade firms from a bank’s balance sheet to a vehicle that\nis stably funded by sophisticated, deep-pocket institutional investors could be a net gain\nto financial stability. Movement of such loans to a highly leveraged, runnable vehicle\nbeyond the regulatory perimeter could have the opposite effect.\nPre-crisis conditions in leveraged finance markets were, with the benefit of\nhindsight, clearly in bubble territory. Deal leverage was at historically high levels (figure\n3), and spreads were at historic lows (figure 4). Interest coverage ratios were quite low\nover a five-to-seven-year period; differences across industries and companies are also to be taken into\nconsideration.\n\n- 10 -\n(figure 5). Unusually large leveraged buyouts were common. Banks entered into very\nlarge, long duration commitments to fund deals that faced significant regulatory and other\nrequirements before they could close. Estimates vary, but when the crisis emerged and\nliquidity in these markets evaporated, large dealers were left holding roughly $350 billion\nin loans and commitments in their pipelines that they could not sell, and these positions\nremained on banks’ balance sheets for a time. As loan values declined an unprecedented\n40 percent (figure 6), there were significant mark-to-market losses on these assets, which\nmay have contributed to doubts about the condition of institutions at the core of the\nsystem. Subsequent default rates were not outsized by historical standards, and recovery\nrates were in line with past averages (figure 7). Of course, the Fed’s monetary policy\neased financial conditions across the economy and enabled the refinancing of many of\nthese loans at lower rates and with issuer-friendly terms.\nBecause leveraged loans were generally not held in investment structures that\nused short-term, confidence-sensitive funding, these investments were not a principal\nfocal point of runs such as those that plagued MBS funding structures. CLOs were the\nlargest institutional investors in leveraged loans, holding over 50 percent of loans\noutstanding. These structures are funded with stable capital, with both equity and debt\ntranches committed for several years--a longer duration than that of the underlying loans.\nThis picture of the pre-crisis leveraged lending market is one of a sharp decline in\nunderwriting standards and a breakdown of risk management, resulting in a large risk\nbuildup involving many of the G-SIBs--something the Fed and other regulators want to\navoid. Leveraged loans may not have been a material cause of the crisis, and leveraged\nlending alone would likely not have threatened the overall health of the large institutions.\n\n- 11 -\nBut caution on the part of supervisors is certainly understandable here. It is worth\nremembering that the destructive potential of the subprime mortgage market was not\nobvious in advance and not fully reflected in real-time measures of balance sheet\nexposure. In light of that demonstrated uncertainty, since the crisis, supervisors have\nopted to react earlier and more aggressively to the buildup of risk.\nLet’s now turn to post-crisis market conditions, which exhibit both similarities\nand differences compared with the pre-crisis period. Borrowing through leveraged loans\nby speculative-grade companies has been brisk since 2010, with about $800 billion of\ninstitutional loans now outstanding (figure 8). Over much of the post-crisis low interest\nrate period, demand for higher-yielding assets has been very strong, often outstripping\nsupply. Price and nonprice terms in the syndicated leveraged loan market have been\nhighly favorable to borrowers, as credit spreads declined, albeit not to particularly low\nlevels (figure 4), and leverage multiples increased (figure 3). The share of loan\nagreements that lack traditional maintenance covenants increased to historic highs\n(figures 9 and 10). 12\nCLOs and other stably funded investors continue to be the primary owners of\nleveraged loans. But in recent years, mutual funds that invest in fixed income assets have\nseen large inflows and have become more significant investors in this market. Some of\nthese funds, including those holding syndicated leveraged loans and high-yield bonds,\nprovide investors with what is called “liquidity transformation”--providing daily liquidity\n12 Highly accommodative monetary policy, while far from the only cause of ebullient credit market\nconditions, is designed to support economic activity by creating incentives to take credit and duration risk.\nSee Ben S. Bernanke (2013), “Semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress,” statement before the\nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, February 26,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/bernanke20130226a.htm.\n\n- 12 -\neven when the underlying assets are relatively illiquid. The risk is that, in the event of a\nshock or a panic, investors will demand all of their money back at the exact time when\nthe liquidity of the already illiquid underlying assets deteriorates even further. Investors\nmay not anticipate or recognize this problem until it is too late--the so-called liquidity\nillusion.\nBank loan funds, which attract retail investors and offer daily liquidity, now total\nabout $150 billion, or 20 percent of institutional leveraged loans outstanding (figure 11).\nThe liquidity transformation provided by these funds has not created problems so far\ndespite recent outflows from bank loan funds, but supervisors and market participants\nhave raised valid concerns that stressful times could well bring large-scale redemptions\nand threaten runs (figure 12). Chair Mary Jo White has made liquidity concerns\nregarding open-ended mutual funds a priority for the SEC.13\nWhile it is possible to observe the characteristics of cash market investments, it is\nfar more challenging to assess comparable positions in the derivatives and secured\nlending markets. Investors may take highly leveraged positions in leveraged loans\nthrough total return swaps and secured funding transactions, and a substantial buildup of\nthese positions could present run and fire-sale risks if asset values started to fall. Today,\nthe evidence suggests that such positions are fairly limited, but challenges in\nmeasurement and data make it hard to get a clear picture.\nWhile some of these conditions evoke the pre-crisis bubble period and thus raise\nred flags, there are important differences as well. The large institutions that arrange these\n13 See Mary Jo White (2014), “Enhancing Risk Monitoring and Regulatory Safeguards for the Asset\nManagement Industry,” speech at the New York Times DealBook Opportunities for Tomorrow\nConference, New York, December 11,\nwww.sec.gov/News/Speech/Detail/Speech/1370543677722#.VN0WontBfT4.\n\n- 13 -\nloans have significantly reduced both the size and duration of their leveraged loan\ncommitments (figure 13). Thus, they are not exposed to the large “pipeline risk” they\nfaced as the crisis broke. In addition, banks now routinely limit their risk by including\n“flex” provisions that, among other things, enable them to increase the interest rate on a\nloan offered for sale by 150 basis points or more, at the borrower’s expense. So far, we\nhave not seen the very large transactions of the pre-crisis period. In these and other\nrespects, the leveraged finance markets have evolved, probably because of supervision as\nwell as lessons learned by the banks themselves. Given these changes, banks at the core\nof our financial system seem less likely to experience stress should conditions in\nleveraged lending deteriorate. Of course, the guidance now stands in the way of a return\nto pre-crisis conditions.\nLet’s now step back from the leveraged loan market to ask the broader question of\nhow supervisors should address a clear deterioration of credit market conditions. I will\nconsider three factors that are often discussed in considering the broader question of\nwhen and how to intervene in the credit markets to promote financial stability through\ninstitution-specific supervisory policy.14\nFirst, do conditions present a threat to the safety and soundness of financial\ninstitutions at the core of the system?\n14 This approach is consistent with the financial stability framework in Adrian, Covitz, and Liang (2013),\nand emphasizes the importance of leverage, maturity transformation, and common risks and behaviors in\nthe financial system that can amplify credit losses and harm the real economy. See Tobias Adrian, Daniel\nCovitz, and Nellie Liang (2013), “Financial Stability Monitoring,” Finance and Economics Discussion\nSeries 2013-21 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System),\nwww.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2013/201321/201321abs.html.\n\n- 14 -\nIt hardly needs saying that we must to be alert to the buildup of risks in the credit\nmarkets that could undermine the safety, soundness, or solvency of the G-SIBs or the\nbroader system. If deterioration in one or more of the key credit markets would credibly\nraise such threats, the Fed and the other supervisors should react preemptively. An object\nlesson in this regard is the damage done by the accumulation of excessive exposures to\nhigh-risk MBS and other mortgage-related assets in the years leading up to the\ncrisis. The originate-to-distribute model of mortgage lending on its face promised a\nsocial-welfare-enhancing distribution of mortgage credit risk away from banks and\ntoward stable capital market investors. But the banks remained profoundly exposed\nthrough contractual putback rights, mortgage and MBS litigation, residual balance sheet\nholdings, and implicit support to sponsored investment vehicles.\nSince the crisis, there have been significant and eminently justified legislative and\nregulatory actions to assure that mortgage originators follow minimum underwriting\nstandards and that banks are better protected from exposure to high-risk\nmortgages. These efforts include the Dodd-Frank risk retention rules and ability-to-pay\nstandards, much higher capital and liquidity requirements, stricter accounting rules that\nlimit off-balance-sheet treatment for sponsored vehicles, and a much greater supervisory\nfocus on litigation and reputational risk.\nSecond, is there use of run-prone financing by other investors that can lead to\ndamaging fire sales?\nSupervisors should be highly alert to the reemergence in the markets--that is, not\non the balance sheets of the large banks--of structures that are prone to runs and\ndamaging fire sales triggered by sharp declines in asset values. As I mentioned earlier,\n\n- 15 -\ntwo different features can create vulnerability to runs and fire-sale risk. The first\ninvolves funding of volatile assets with high leverage that includes short-term, confidence\nsensitive debt. These structures were widely used before the crisis in the funding of\nMBS. The second involves “liquidity transformation,” in which the investment structure\nprovides investors daily liquidity, but the underlying assets are far less liquid and prone\nto becoming quite illiquid in times of stress. Either or both of these features can be\nreplicated in the derivatives or securities lending markets, which provide less visibility to\nmarket participants and supervisors. Financial markets evolve constantly in response to\nmarket conditions, financial engineering, and regulation. It will be important to keep up\nwith trends in these markets that may give rise to this threat.\nThird, if left unaddressed, is it likely that conditions will risk meaningful damage to\nthe real economy when the credit cycle turns?\nA positive answer on either of the first two questions should raise red flags for\nsupervisors. Let’s say, for the sake of argument, that the answers to these questions were\nnegative. One might still try to make the case for supervisory intervention into the credit\nmarkets to avoid the risk of meaningful damage to the economy down the road. History\nshows that excesses that occur at the height of a credit boom can result in substantial\nlosses not just to financial firms and market investors, but also to households and\nbusinesses, when that boom turns to bust.15\n15 See, for example, Moritz Schularick and Alan M. Taylor (2012), “Credit Booms Gone Bust: Monetary\nPolicy, Leverage Cycles, and Financial Crises, 1870-2008,” American Economic Review, vol. 102 (2),\npp. 1029-61.\n\n- 16 -\nThe question of whether to “lean against” the credit cycle through supervisory\npolicy--and when, and with what tools--is a difficult one.16 An important threshold\nquestion is whether supervisors will be able to correctly and in a timely manner identify\n“dangerous” conditions in credit markets, without too many false positives and without\nunnecessarily limiting credit availability by interfering with market forces. Interesting\nrecent research seeks to identify observable variables that could be used to monitor credit\nconditions and detect trends that could threaten the performance of the real economy in\nthe future.17 This research is promising, and it could be used by supervisors to inform\ntheir thinking as it develops further. In the meantime, unless there is a plausible threat to\nthe core of the system or potential for damaging fire sales, I would set a high bar for\nsupervisory interventions to lean against the credit cycle. Such interventions would\nalmost surely interfere with the traditional function of capital markets in allocating capital\nto productive uses and dispersing risk to the investors who willingly choose to bear it.\nFinally, another issue to consider when contemplating such intervention is that,\nparticularly in the United States, activity is free to migrate outside the commercial\nbanking system into less regulated entities. As supervisory scrutiny has increased in\nrecent years, a growing number of nonbanks have become involved in the distribution of\nleveraged loans. Migration of this activity could be either a net positive or a net negative\nfor financial stability, depending on whether it actually transfers risk irrevocably from the\n16 The U.S. banking agencies, following the lead of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, created a\ncountercyclical capital buffer that could be activated during periods of excess aggregate credit growth. The\nBasel proposal can both “lean against the cycle” and create a capital cushion to absorb losses from the\nlikely increase in defaults.\n17 See Robin Greenwood and Samuel G. Hanson (2013), “Issuer Quality and Corporate Bond Returns,”\nReview of Financial Studies, vol. 26 (June), pp. 1483-525; and David López-Salido, Jeremy C. Stein, and\nEgon Zakrajšek (2014), “Credit-Market Sentiment and the Business Cycle,” slide presentation,\nhttp://economics.mit.edu/files/10240.\n\n- 17 -\ncore of the financial system, and whether the institutions to which activity migrates rely\non funding that is stable and robust to fire sale dynamics.\nConclusion\nTo wrap up, I believe that sustaining financial stability requires supervisors to\nconsider financial markets, in addition to financial institutions and infrastructure. That is\nmost obviously so when conditions threaten the safety and soundness of the financial\nsystem through leverage, liquidity transformation, or deterioration of credit underwriting\nor other risk-management standards. At the same time, financial stability need not seek\nto eliminate all risks. We need to learn, but not overlearn, the lessons of the crisis. I\nbelieve there should be a high bar for “leaning against the credit cycle” in the absence of\ncredible threats to the core or the reemergence of run-prone funding structures. In my\nview, the Fed and other prudential and market regulators should resist interfering with the\nrole of markets in allocating capital to issuers and risk to investors unless the case for\ndoing so is strong and the available tools can achieve the objective in a targeted manner\nand with a high degree of confidence.\n\nFinancial Institutions, Financial Markets, and Financial Stability\nFigure 1.

Powell\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nChicago Council on Global Affairs\nChicago, Illinois\nJune 28, 2016\n\nThank you for this opportunity to speak here today. The Chicago Council on\nGlobal Affairs has been a thought leader for nearly a century, encouraging public\ndiscourse, education, and research on important global issues. The Council’s global\nfocus is particularly important for understanding the challenges facing the U.S. economy\ntoday, as shown by last week’s referendum on the United Kingdom’s status in the\nEuropean Union. In my remarks, I will review recent economic developments and the\noutlook for the economy. I will also discuss the economy’s longer-term productive\npotential. As always, the view I express here today are my own.\nThe Dual Mandate and State of the Economy\nAs you know, the Federal Reserve, through the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC), is charged by the Congress with achieving maximum employment and stable\nprices--the dual mandate. For price stability, the FOMC has adopted a goal of 2 percent\nfor inflation, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal\nconsumption expenditures. Many other central banks in developed economies have\nadopted inflation goals centered around 2 percent.\nThe FOMC has not set a numerical goal for maximum employment, because the\nlong-run sustainable level of employment is determined mainly by non-monetary factors\nthat are outside the Fed’s control, such as demographics, social change, and fiscal and\nregulatory policies. Nonetheless, four times a year, FOMC participants write down their\nestimates of the longer-run sustainable level of the unemployment rate (which many\ninterpret as the “natural rate”); at the recent June FOMC meeting the median estimate of\nthat rate was 4.8 percent.\n\n- 2 -\nHow should we evaluate our current performance against the dual mandate? I\nwould say that we have made substantial progress toward maximum employment,\nalthough there is still some room for improvement. We have more work to do to assure\nthat inflation moves back up to our 2 percent goal.\nLet’s start with the employment mandate. After several years of strong job\ngrowth, employment is now over 5 million higher than the pre-crisis peak in 2007. The\nunemployment rate has fallen from 10 percent in 2009 to 4.7 percent in May, essentially\nat the level that many observers identify as the natural rate. This rate is very far from a\nbright line--it cannot be observed directly, and estimates of its level are subject to great\nuncertainty.1 So we look to a wide range of labor market indicators to assess the overall\nhealth of the labor market. Many of those indicators suggest that the labor market is\nstrong. To mention a few of these, job openings are at an all-time high by some\nmeasures. The “quits” rate--the rate at which employees voluntarily leave their jobs--is\nabout at pre-crisis levels. Surveys of individuals and businesses suggest that the ease of\nfinding and filling jobs is similar to that experienced in the mid-2000s.\nEven though we are near the natural rate of unemployment, there is still room for\nimprovement on several margins. Important among these is the labor force participation\nrate. If someone leaves the labor force for any reason, even temporarily, that person is\nnot counted as unemployed. So the labor force participation rate is also a key\ndeterminant of the unemployment rate. Labor force participation is influenced by many\n1 Confidence intervals around statistical estimates of the natural rate are routinely estimated to be quite\nwide, reflecting both uncertainty about the correct model specification as well as uncertainty about the\nparameter estimates given the model. The canonical paper by Douglas Staiger, James H. Stock and Mark\nW. Watson (1997), “How Precise are Estimates of the Natural Rate of Unemployment?,” in Christina D.\nRomer and David H. Romer, eds., Reducing Inflation: Motivation and Strategy (Chicago: University of\nChicago Press) puts the 95 percent confidence interval at 1½ percentage points on either side of the point\nestimate.\n\n- 3 -\nfactors, including the age structure of the population and individuals’ perceptions of the\navailability of jobs.\nParticipation rose steadily from the 1970s through the 1990s as increasing\nnumbers of women entered the formal workforce. That process ran its course, and,\naround the year 2000, participation began a gradual decline because of population aging\nand the continuation of other long-term trends, particularly the decline in participation\namong prime age males. From 2008 through 2013, participation dropped sharply by 3\npercentage points, but has remained about flat, on net, since late 2013 in a context of\nstrong job growth and declining unemployment. Economists estimate that, as the\npopulation ages, participation will naturally tend to decline at a trend rate of about 0.2\npercentage point per year, so this period of flat participation actually represents an\nimprovement against the post-crisis cyclical drop. Today, participation is near its longer-\nrun trend as estimated by a group of Fed economists whose work is widely cited on these\nissues.2 Some other estimates suggest that there is still a shortfall in participation, and, of\ncourse, estimates of the trend participation rate are surrounded by fairly wide bands of\nuncertainty. I am inclined to believe that there are potential workers at the margins of the\nlabor market who will return as the recovery continues, the labor market tightens further\nand wages increase. The U.S. participation rate for workers in the 25-54 age group is\nnow below those of most other advanced economies, including the U.K., France and\nGermany, for example.\n2 See Stephanie Aaronson, Tomaz Cajner, Bruce Fallick, Felix Galbis-Reig, Christopher Smith, and\nWilliam Wascher (2014), “Labor Force Participation: Recent Developments and Future Prospects,”\nBrookings Papers on Economic Activity, Fall, pp. 197-275.\nwww.brookings.edu/~/media/Projects/BPEA/Fall-2014/Fall2014BPEA_Aaronson_et_al.pdf?la=en.\n\n- 4 -\nThe number of part-time workers who want full time work remains above pre-\ncrisis levels, which suggests that there may be some remaining slack there as well. In\naddition, we should expect to see stronger wage increases as the labor market tightens.\nThere are welcome signs of a firming in wages, seen most clearly in the data on average\nhourly earnings, which are rising faster than the sum of inflation and productivity growth.\nAfter several years of improving labor market conditions, recent data have been\nsending mixed signals on the level of momentum in the economy. Business investment\nhas weakened, even outside the energy sector. Growth in gross domestic product (GDP)\nis estimated to have slowed to a rate of only 1-1/4 percent on an annualized basis over the\nfourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year. Incoming data do point to a\nrebound. For example, the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow model, which bases its projection on\na range of incoming monthly data, estimates growth of 2.6 percent in the second quarter.\nIn contrast, the labor market data, especially the monthly increase in payroll jobs, after\ndisplaying considerable strength for several years right through the first quarter of 2016,\nweakened significantly in April and May. While I would not want to make too much of\ntwo monthly observations, the strength of the labor market has been a key feature of the\nrecovery, allowing us to look through quarterly fluctuations in GDP growth. So the\npossible loss of momentum in job growth is worrisome.\nTurning to the inflation part of the mandate, the Fed’s preferred measure of\ninflation has consistently run below our 2 percent objective since the end of the financial\ncrisis, with the exception of the “Arab Spring” period in 2011, when oil prices\ntemporarily spiked. For the 12 months ending in April, total inflation was only 1 percent,\nwhile core inflation (excluding food and energy prices) was 1-1/2 percent. Core inflation\n\n- 5 -\nhas been held down by falling import prices, owing in large part to the rise in the dollar,\nas well as the indirect effects of lower oil prices. If the dollar and oil prices remain\nbroadly stable going forward, inflation should move up over time to our 2 percent\nobjective.\nWhen I was first exposed to macroeconomics in college, more than four decades\nago, the view was that inflation was strongly influenced by the amount of slack in the\neconomy. But the relationship between slack and inflation has weakened substantially\nover the years. In addition, inflation depends importantly on the inflation expectations of\nworkers and firms. A widely shared view among economists today is that, unlike during\nthe 1970s, expectations are no longer heavily influenced by fluctuations in inflation, but\nare fairly constant, or anchored. For both these reasons, inflation has become less\nresponsive to cyclical changes in the economy. We measure inflation expectations\nthrough surveys of forecasters and the general public, and also through market readings\non inflation swaps and “breakevens,” which represent inflation compensation as\nmeasured by the difference between the return offered by nominal Treasury securities and\nthat offered by TIPS. Since mid-2014, these market-based measures have declined\nsignificantly to historically low levels. Some of this decline probably represents lower\nrisk of high inflation, or an elevated liquidity preference for much more heavily traded\nnominal Treasury securities, rather than expectations of lower inflation. Some survey\nmeasures of inflation expectations have also trended down. Given the importance of\nexpectations for determining inflation, these developments deserve, and receive, careful\nattention. While inflation expectations seem to me to remain reasonably well anchored, it\n\n- 6 -\nis essential that they remain so. The only way to assure that anchoring is to achieve\nactual inflation of 2 percent, and I am strongly committed to that objective.\nLooking Ahead\nMy baseline expectation has been that our economy is likely to continue on its\npath of growth at around 2 percent. I have also expected the ongoing healing in labor\nmarkets to continue, with healthy wage increases and job creation. As the economy\ntightens, I have expected that inflation will move up over time to the Committee’s 2\npercent objective.\nFor some time, the principal risks to that outlook have been from abroad. Global\neconomic and financial conditions are particularly important for the U.S. economy at the\nmoment. Weakness in economic activity around the world and related bouts of financial\nvolatility have weighed on the performance of our economy. Given the stronger\nperformance of the U.S. economy, the trade-weighted value of the dollar has risen\nroughly 20 percent since 2014. Such a large appreciation of the dollar means that we will\n“export” some of our strength to our trading partners and “import” some of their\nweakness.\nGrowth and inflation remain stubbornly low for most of our major trading\npartners. European and Japanese authorities have limited scope to respond, with daunting\nlonger-run fiscal challenges and policy rates already set below zero. In China, stimulus\nmeasures should support growth in the near term, but may also slow China’s necessary\ntransition away from its export- and investment-led business model. Emerging market\nnations such as Brazil, Russia and Venezuela face challenging conditions.\nThese global risks have now shifted even further to the downside, with last\nweek’s referendum on the United Kingdom’s status in the European Union. The Brexit\nvote has the potential to create new headwinds for economies around the world, including\n\n- 7 -\nour own. The risks to the global outlook were somewhat elevated even prior to the\nreferendum, and the vote has introduced new uncertainties. We have said that the Federal\nReserve is carefully monitoring developments in global financial markets, in cooperation\nwith other central banks. We are prepared to provide dollar liquidity through our existing\nswap lines with central banks, as necessary, to address pressures in global funding\nmarkets, which could have adverse implications for our economy. Although financial\nconditions have tightened since the vote, markets have been functioning in an orderly\nmanner. And the U.S. financial sector is strong and resilient. As our recent stress tests\nshow, our largest financial institutions continue to build their capital and strengthen their\nbalance sheets.\nIt is far too early to judge the effects of the Brexit vote. As the global outlook\nevolves, it will be important to assess the implications for the U.S. economy, and for the\nstance of policy appropriate to foster continued progress toward our objectives of\nmaximum employment and price stability.\nI am often asked why rates remain so low now that we are near full employment.\nA big part of the answer is that, at least for the time being, the appropriate level of rates is\nsimply lower than it was before the crisis. As a result, policy is not as stimulative as it\nmight appear to be. Estimates of the real interest rate needed to keep the economy on an\neven keel if it were operating at 2 percent inflation and full employment--the “neutral\nrate” of interest--are currently around zero. Today, the real short term interest rate is\nabout negative 1-1/4 percent, so policy is actually only moderately stimulative. I\nanticipate that the neutral rate will move up over time, as some of the headwinds that\nhave weighed on economic growth ease.\n\n- 8 -\nLonger-term Considerations: Potential output, productivity, labor market fluidity,\nand business dynamism\nI would like to take a step back from the current context and explore an issue that\nought to receive more attention--the longer-run potential growth rate of our economy.\nOne reason for the low neutral rate of interest is that potential growth appears to have\nslowed. Since the crisis ended, forecasters have broadly reduced their estimates of longer\nrun growth by a full percentage point--from about 3 percent to about 2 percent.3 This\nseemingly modest reduction implies dramatically smaller increases in living standards\nover time. A growing body of research shows that deep recessions accompanied by\nsevere financial crises often leave behind permanent damage.4 One recent analysis\nsuggests that in about one-third of such cases there is no permanent damage; one-third of\nthe time there is a permanent reduction in the level of potential output but not its\nsubsequent growth rate; and one third of the time there is a reduction in both the level of\npotential output and in the growth rate.5 Unfortunately, many economies are currently in\ndanger of falling into the third category, including the U.S. economy.\nOutput growth can be broken down into increases in hours worked and changes in\noutput per hour, or productivity. Most of the decline in estimated potential U.S. growth\nappears to be from lower productivity. Labor productivity growth began to slow around\n2005--before the crisis--and been only 1/2 percent annually since 2011--the slowest five\n3 The long-range consensus U.S. economic projections for real GDP growth reported by Blue Chip\nEconomic Indicators moved down from 2.9 percent in March 2007 to 2.1 percent in March 2016.\n4 See Robert F. Martin, Teyanna Munyan, and Beth Anne Wilson (2014), “Potential Output and\nRecessions: Are We Fooling Ourselves?” IFDP Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System, November 12), www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/notes/ifdp-notes/2014/potential-\noutput-and-recessions-are-we-fooling-ourselves-20141112.html.\n5 See Olivier Blanchard, Eugenio Cerutti and Lawrence Summers (2015), “Inflation and Activity –Two\nExplorations and Their Monetary Policy Implications,” IMF Working Paper WP/15/230, 2015\n(Washington: International Monetary Fund).\n\n- 9 -\nyear period since World War II. The productivity slowdown has been worldwide, and\nhas been seen in countries that were not as strongly affected by the crisis, so U.S. specific\nfactors are probably not the main cause.6\nIncreasing productivity is necessary if living standards are to continue to rise over\ngenerations. So two important questions arise: Why has productivity growth been so\nslow? And what does the future look like?\nWe have tentative answers to the first question. Labor productivity is a function\nof three things. The first two are the skills of the labor force, and the tools they have,\nparticularly equipment, software and the like. These are inputs to production and are\ndriven by private and public investment. The third determinant is called “total factor\nproductivity,” or TFP, which refers to the ability of firms to produce more efficiently\ngiven the first two inputs. For example, as businesses learned how to incorporate\nadvances in information technology into their production processes, there was a surge of\nproductivity growth from roughly 1995 to 2005.\nThe weak performance of productivity since the crisis appears to stem mainly\nfrom weak business investment and low TFP growth. Weak business investment has\nresulted from weak demand and uncertainty about the pace of the recovery. TFP is\nequally important and has generally accounted for most of the variation in productivity\nover time, but is less well understood and so more difficult to forecast.\nThe second question--what will happen with productivity going forward--is the\nsubject of intense debate. The range of forecasts is wide, and the historical record\n6 See, for example, “New OECD indicators trace productivity growth slowdown pre- and post-crisis,”\nhttp://www.oecd.org/economy/newoecdindicatorstraceproductivitygrowthslowdownpre-andpost-crisis.htm\n\n- 10 -\nprovides ample ground for humility. This summer, many will be carrying Robert\nGordon’s massive The Rise and Fall of American Growth to the beach (or perhaps to the\nlake, here in the Midwest), which argues the pessimistic view. 7 For balance, maybe\nbring along Brynjolfsson and McAfee’s The Second Machine Age, which take a more\noptimistic view and is a great deal shorter.8\nOne factor that may contribute to low productivity growth is the notable decline\nin recent decades in measures of the dynamism of our economy. Entrepreneurs start new\nfirms; most of them fail, but a few of them succeed, grow very rapidly, and account for\nsignificant amounts of job formation. Older firms shrink or go out of business if they fail\nto keep up with innovation and advances in productivity. Workers change jobs and move\naround the country (or the world) as their careers evolve and as companies grow and\nshrink. These processes can be painful and messy for both workers and firms, but they\nare essential to the allocation of resources to their highest, most productive uses. The\nhigh levels of innovation and fluidity of our economy have long been thought to be\namong the principal reasons for our high and rising living standards.\nThe slowdown in essentially all of these processes is seen in declining rates of\ncreation and destruction of both firms and jobs.\nStart-ups: Start-ups are a key driver of productivity growth. Although it may feel\nthat we are living in an age of disruption, the birthrate of startups has actually been in\ndecline since the 1970s.9 New firms can be loosely grouped into two categories: those\n7 See Robert J. Gordon (2016), The Rise and Fall of American Growth: The U.S. Standard of Living since\nthe Civil War (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press).\n8 See Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee (2014), The Second Machine Age: Work, Progress, and\nProsperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies (New York: W.W. Norton).\n9 See Ryan A. Decker, John Haltiwanger, Ron S. Jarmin and Javier Miranda (2016), “Declining Business\nDynamism: What We Know and the Way Forward,” Amercian Economic Review, vol. 106 (May), pp 203-\n07; Ryan Decker, John C. Haltiwanger, Ron Jarmin, and Javier Miranda (forthcoming), “Where Has all the\n\n- 11 -\nstarted by “lifestyle entrepreneurs” who want to be their own boss, but who have little\nprospect or desire for high growth; and those founded by transformational entrepreneurs\nwho start businesses that aspire to grow dramatically and change their industry. Before\n2000, the decline in new firm entry was mainly in the first sort; since 2000, it is also\nfound among the so-called transformational firms. While the drop in the formation of\nlifestyle-type firms could be neutral or even a positive for productivity, as in the case of\nthe U.S. retail sector, the reduction in the creation of high-performance new firms\nsuggests that lower dynamism could be associated with slower productivity growth.10\nLabor Market Dynamism: While changing jobs can be painful, job changes in the\naggregate are associated with higher compensation, implying higher productivity. But\nthe rewards to job change may have declined. Fewer start-ups has meant lower “job\nflows,” as measured by job creation and destruction, and fewer opportunities for workers\nto find better jobs. And labor market dynamism across many dimensions has declined by\nmore than can be explained by the reduction in startups. Workers have become less\nlikely to leave their jobs, change jobs, or move geographically to take new jobs.11\nSkewness Gone?

J. Krizan (2001) “Aggregate Productivity Growth: Lessons\nfrom Microeconomic Evidence” in New Developments in Productivity Analysis, Charles Hulten, Ediwn\nDean and Michael Harper, eds. (Cambridge, Mass: National Bureau of Economic Research, March).\n11 See Steven Davis and John Haltiwanger (2014) “Labor Market Fluidity and Economic Performance,”\nNBER Working Paper Series 20479, (Cambridge, Mass: National Bureau of Economic Research,\nSeptember); Raven Malloy, Christopher Smith, Riccardo Trezzi and Abigail Wozniak (2016),\n“Understanding Declining Fluidity in the Labor Market,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity,\nMarch 3, www.brookings.edu/about/projects/bpea/papers/2016/molloy-et-al-declining-fluidity; and Henry\nHyatt and James Spletzer (2013) “The Recent Decline in Employment Dynamics,” IZA Journal of Labor\nEconomics, http://izajole.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/2193-8997-2-5.\n\n- 12 -\nDynamism is a relatively new field of inquiry, and there is no consensus yet on\nthe reasons for, or implications of, these developments. Some plausible sources of these\nchanges are benign, while others are more negative and suggest that the reduction in\ndynamism may be a factor behind the slower increases in productivity. For example,\nhistorically there has been a robust correlation at the firm level between productivity and\ngrowth, with high productivity levels being correlated with faster growth and low\nproductivity levels being associated with contraction or exit. This relationship has\nweakened since 2000, particularly in the high-tech sector.12 High productivity firms are\nnot growing as quickly, and low productivity firms are shrinking or exiting at a slower\npace.\nIt may be that some government policies, while well intended, have contributed to\nthese trends. One example that may explain a small portion of the reduction in dynamism\nis the substantial increase in occupational licensing.13 By some estimates, the fraction of\nworkers who are required to hold a government issued license or certification to perform\ntheir jobs has risen from 5 percent in the 1950s to close to 40 percent.14 Like many\npolicies, licensing has benefits and costs. Among the costs are that it tends to reduce job\nswitching and employment opportunities for excluded workers, and may restrict\ncompetition and thus increase prices faced by consumers. Among the benefits may be\nhigher quality products and services and improved health and safety standards. Some\nresearchers have advanced the view that licensing requirements have become overly\n12 See Decker and others, “Declining Business Dynamism,” in note 5.\n13 Licensing restrictions increase the costs of switching occupations and potentially reduces interstate\nmobility. The evidence linking licensing to labor market fluidity is inconclusive, with some researchers\nfinding a linkage and others not.\n14 Davis and Haltiwanger (2014).\n\n- 13 -\nburdensome and may have contributed to the secular decline in job and worker\nreallocation.15\nDynamism is a fast-developing field of research, and it will be important that\npublic policy react appropriately as this work continues. It goes without saying that\neconomic policymakers should use all available information and tools to create a\nsupportive environment for growth. We need policies that support labor force\nparticipation and the development of skills, business hiring and investment, and\nproductivity growth. For the most part, these policies are outside the remit of the Federal\nReserve, but monetary policy can contribute by supporting a strong and durable\nexpansion, in a context of price stability.\nConclusion\nHow should we think about the performance of our economy since the Crisis?\nThe picture is mixed, and that question will no doubt be debated in the decades ahead.\nBut here are some facts. Since 2011, job growth has been stronger and unemployment\nhas declined faster than most forecasts. On the other hand, economic growth has been\nconsistently lower than almost all private- and public-sector forecasts, including those of\nFOMC participants. Growth has been slower in this recovery than in many previous\nrecoveries; a growing body of research shows that weak recoveries are the norm after\ndeep recessions and those associated with severe financial crises. Finally, our recovery\nhas also been stronger than those of many other advanced economies following this\ncrisis.\n15 See, for example, The Department of the Treasury Office of Economic Policy, the Council of Economic\nAdvisers, and the Department of Labor (2015), “Occupational Licensing: A Framework for Policymakers,”\n(Washington: The White House, July),\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/licensing_report_final_nonembargo.pdf.\n\n- 14 -\nI expect our economy to continue to make progress. Monetary policy will need to\nremain supportive of growth, as we work through the challenging global environment.\nAs always, it will be important to carefully monitor economic developments in order to\nassess the stance of policy appropriate to foster continued progress toward our objectives\nof maximum employment and price stability.",

Powell\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nGeorgetown University\nvia prerecorded video\nWashington, D.C.\nMay 19, 2024\n\nThank you, Dean Treanor, for the invitation to speak here today. I am very sorry\nthat circumstances prevent me from joining you in person.\nI will start by acknowledging the parents, spouses, partners, other family members\nand mentors who are here. Without your support, sacrifice, and encouragement, we\nwould not have so much to celebrate today.\nAnd to the class of 2024—congratulations on earning your law degree. You are\nthe most selective class in Georgetown history, chosen from 14,000 applicants, and the\nmost well qualified as well. Among you are Fulbright scholars, military veterans, Peace\nCorps, AmeriCorps and Teach for America alumni, student athletes, accomplished\nmusicians and even a medical doctor. An impressive group. This is also the most diverse\nclass in the 154-year history of the school.\nI am especially proud today to say that there is a lot of Georgetown in my family\ntree. My father graduated from the College in 1943 before serving in the U.S. Army in\nWorld War II. After the war, he received his law degree here and practiced law in\nWashington, D.C. I am fortunate to have two wonderful daughters; one graduated from\nthe College in 2012; the other is a member of the Class of 2026 at the Law Center.\nIt seems like yesterday that I was in your shoes, receiving my degree, looking\nforward with optimism and excitement, and wondering what lay ahead.\nI cannot help but think fondly of my time here. For many years, friends from law\nschool have gathered annually for a weekend to refresh our ties and laugh about times\ngone by. These gatherings are referred to as “Big Chill,” a reference to a 1983 movie that\nrevolved around a mid-life reunion of college friends. I made lifelong friendships here\nthat I keep to this day, and I hope it will be the same for you.\n\n- 2 -\nAlong with all the hard work, I also remember the fun. A favorite tradition was to\nattend Saturday midnight showings of The Rocky Horror Picture Show at the Key\nTheater on Wisconsin Avenue in Georgetown.\nNow, if you have led a culturally deprived life and are tragically unfamiliar with\nthe movie, it is a raucous musical starring a young Tim Curry. Everyone in the theater\nwould sing along, shout out the lines, and throw popcorn at the screen; many would dress\nup like the characters. Now, I didn’t dress up—sorry to disappoint you—but no party\nwas complete until all of us danced “The Time Warp” to the movie’s famous song.\nAs it happens, I still remember the steps, and I had intended to demonstrate the\nTime Warp for you, but that will not be possible today.\nInstead, I will offer a few thoughts that I might have benefited from hearing when\nI was sitting in your chairs a mere 45 years ago.\nEmbracing Change\nThe years since my graduation have brought waves of fundamental change to the\nworkplace and to society at large, much of it driven by technology. Imagine a world with\nno internet, no email or texting, no personal computers or cell phones, no social media.\nSome of you parents are no doubt thinking: I would be fine with that world!\nThe pace of change will likely continue to be very fast. Be alert to the ways your\nworking life may change. Think about how you can be prepared for those changes and to\nturn them to your advantage, and to society’s advantage. The practice of law has been\ntransformed over the years; if you do choose the path of a practicing lawyer, I would\nthink about what practicing law could look like in 10 or 20 years.\n\n- 3 -\nIn a world that will continue to evolve quickly and in unexpected ways, you will\nneed to be agile. Embracing change and taking risks can be an important part of your\ndevelopment as a professional and as a person. Your formal education may end today,\nbut you are not done learning. Many of the important things you will need to know can\nonly be learned through experience. And experience can be a hard but irreplaceable\nteacher.\nAs an example, near the end of my second year here, it was time to select the next\neditor in chief of the Georgetown Law Journal. I thought that there were plenty of\ncolleagues who were better qualified, but who simply did not want the job. So, with\nmuch trepidation, I put my name in. I was secretly, but utterly, terrified that I might be\nchosen. And amazingly enough, I was. What now?\nIt turned out that, as I feared, I was not well prepared for that responsibility. I had\nto keep people interested and motivated enough to work on the Journal when many\nthings competed for their attention. I had to have a plan for the organization and not just\nfor myself. I had to do this while exhibiting confidence that I did not feel. My main\nmemory of that time is thinking, “This is harder and far different from what I had\nexpected!”\nWhat I now know is that almost no one is ready for their first leadership roles.\nWhen you step into a leadership role, it is very common to doubt yourself. If I could tell\nmy younger self something, it would be to believe in yourself and put yourself in\nsituations in which you will be seriously challenged to do new things. Assume that you\nwill make mistakes. Learn from those mistakes; do not dwell excessively upon them in\nregret. You will fall down. Get up. Repeat cycle.\n\n- 4 -\nThe more you do that, the more you will learn and the faster you will develop as a\nperson and as a leader. Know also that, in my experience, there is no single model of a\nsuccessful leader. Each of you has it in you to lead successfully.\nNo One Path\nOne of the great things about your legal education is it sets you up for success on\na wide variety of potential paths. I left the practice of law a few years after I left this\nschool. But my legal education has benefited me all along the way. Studying law\nteaches you to think clearly, analyze thoroughly, and understand all sides of an argument.\nThe possibilities that lie ahead of you are extremely broad. You may work for a single\nlaw firm for your entire career. Or you may leave the law fairly soon, as I did, and never\nlook back. You will always benefit from what you learned here.\nThe fact is, I do keep a copy of the Federal Reserve Act that I consult often.\nLike many of you, I imagine, I knew that I wanted to do public service. As I left\nlaw school, I remember thinking about people like George Shultz and Cyrus Vance,\nprominent figures of the day who had successful private-sector careers and served\nperiodically in government.\nThe head of the investment bank in New York where I worked as a young man\nwas Nicholas F. Brady, who had an extraordinary career in investment banking and had\nserved as a U.S. senator from New Jersey as well. I was the most junior of employees,\nbut I wanted to introduce myself and tell him about my own aspirations. But approaching\nhim was daunting. Maybe he would decline to meet with me. Maybe he would think I\nwas not committed to the firm if I told him I was interested in public service.\n\n- 5 -\nI finally summoned the courage to present myself at his office. I told him that I\ngrew up in Washington, had been a federal law clerk and a congressional staffer, and\nwanted to do public service along the way. I said that if you need someone to staff you\non anything you do in Washington, I’m your guy. He said something along the lines of,\n“Great, thanks.” I then crept back down the stairs to my broom closet of an office\nwondering whether that was going to matter.\nA few months later, I got a call from his secretary. I can still hear her gravelly\nvoice. “Can you come up and see Mr. Brady?” When I got there, he said, “I need you to\nhelp me out with this thing.” This thing was defending an oil company from a hostile\ntakeover attempt by a colorful corporate raider of that era named T. Boone Pickens. I\nended up spending months going back and forth from New York to Washington with\nNick. A few years later, Nick Brady became the Treasury Secretary. Nick asked me to\njoin him at Treasury, which opened the door for me to higher levels of public service.\nThe point is this: if I had not forced myself to get up from my desk, taken the stairs up to\nthe 15th floor, and presented myself to his office that day, the rest of my life would have\nbeen very different, and I would not be standing here today.\nMustering that little bit of initiative changed my life. A little initiative can make\nall the difference in anyone’s career.\nConclusion\nI will conclude by encouraging you to think beyond yourselves. Each of you has\nthe capability to achieve success in any field you choose; it is important that you also\nconsider how to give back and use your gifts to make a difference. Reflect on the motto\nof this school: “law is but the means; justice is the end.” Many of you have served at\n\n- 6 -\nlaw clinics where you stood up for underrepresented individuals and organizations. And\nmany of you will play important roles in the military, at nonprofits, and in governments\naround the world.\nEach generation has an obligation to move us closer to the ideal, as embodied by\nthe famous image of blindfolded Lady Justice holding the scales. You should count\nyourselves among the luckiest in all our society to graduate from this institution, to have\nthe support of loved ones through three grueling years, and the health and other good\nfortune not to get tripped up along the way. Several years ago, one of my predecessors,\nBen Bernanke, said, “Those who are the luckiest . . . also have the greatest responsibility\nto work hard, to contribute to the betterment of the world, and to share their luck with\nothers.” I cannot improve upon that.\nI thank you for having me. Georgetown will always hold a special place in my\nheart. Thank you again to Dean Treanor and all the faculty, and the hardiest of\ncongratulations to the Class of 2024.",

Powell\nChairman\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe Economic Club of Chicago\nChicago, Illinois\nApril 6, 2018\n\nFor more than 90 years, the Economic Club of Chicago has provided a valued\nforum for current and future leaders to discuss issues of vital interest to this city and our\nnation. I am honored to have the opportunity to speak to you here today.\nAt the Federal Reserve, we seek to foster a strong economy for the benefit of\nindividuals, families, and businesses throughout our country. In pursuit of that\noverarching objective, the Congress has assigned us the goals of achieving maximum\nemployment and stable prices, known as the dual mandate. Today I will review recent\neconomic developments, focusing on the labor market and inflation, and then touch\nbriefly on longer-term growth prospects. I will finish with a discussion of monetary\npolicy.\nRecent Developments and the State of the Economy\nAfter what at times has been a slow recovery from the financial crisis and the\nGreat Recession, growth has picked up. Unemployment has fallen from 10 percent at its\npeak in October 2009 to 4.1 percent, the lowest level in nearly two decades (figure 1).\nSeventeen million jobs have been created in this expansion, and the monthly pace of job\ngrowth remains more than sufficient to employ new entrants to the labor force (figure 2).\nThe labor market has been strong, and my colleagues and I on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC) expect it to remain strong. Inflation has continued to run below the\nFOMC’s 2 percent objective but we expect it to move up in coming months and to\nstabilize around 2 percent over the medium term.\nBeyond the labor market, there are other signs of economic strength. Steady\nincome gains, rising household wealth, and elevated consumer confidence continue to\nsupport consumer spending, which accounts for about two thirds of economic output.\n\n- 2 -\nBusiness investment improved markedly last year following two subpar years, and both\nbusiness surveys and profit expectations point to further gains ahead. Fiscal stimulus and\ncontinued accommodative financial conditions are supporting both household spending\nand business investment, while strong global growth has boosted U.S. exports.\nAs many of you know, each quarter FOMC participants--the members of the\nBoard of Governors and the presidents of the Reserve Banks--submit their individual\nprojections for growth, unemployment, and inflation, as well as their forecasts of the\nappropriate path of the federal funds rate, which the Committee uses as the primary tool\nof monetary policy. These individual projections are compiled and published in the\nSummary of Economic Projections, or SEP. FOMC participants submitted their most\nrecent forecasts three weeks ago, and those forecasts show a strengthening in the\nmedium-term economic outlook (table 1). As you can see, participants generally raised\ntheir forecasts for growth in inflation-adjusted gross domestic product (GDP) and\nlowered their forecasts for unemployment. In addition, many participants expressed\nincreased confidence that inflation would move up toward our 2 percent target. The\nFOMC sees the risks to the economic outlook as roughly balanced.\nThe State of the Labor Market\nAs I mentioned, the headline unemployment rate has declined to levels not seen\nsince 2000. The median projection in the March SEP calls for unemployment to fall well\nbelow 4 percent for a sustained period, something that has not happened since the late\n1960s. This strong labor market forecast has important implications for the fulfillment of\nboth sides of the dual mandate, and thus for the path of monetary policy. So I will spend\na few minutes exploring the state of the job market in some detail.\n\n- 3 -\nA good place to begin is with the term “maximum employment,” which the\nCommittee takes to mean the highest utilization of labor resources that is sustainable over\ntime. In the long run, the level of maximum employment is not determined by monetary\npolicy, but rather by factors affecting the structure and dynamics of the labor market.1\nAlso, the level of maximum employment is not directly measureable, and it changes over\ntime. Real-time estimates of maximum employment are highly uncertain.2 Recognizing\nthis uncertainty, the FOMC does not set a fixed goal for maximum employment. Instead,\nwe look at a wide range of indicators to assess how close the economy is to maximum\nemployment.\nThe headline unemployment rate is arguably the best single indicator of labor\nmarket conditions. In addition, it is widely known and updated each month. As I noted,\nthe unemployment rate is currently at 4.1 percent, which is a bit below the FOMC’s\nmedian estimate of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment. However, the\nunemployment rate does not paint a complete picture. For example, to be counted in the\nofficial measure as unemployed, a person must have actively looked for a job in the past\nfour weeks.3 People who have not looked for work as recently are counted not as\nunemployed, but as out of the labor force, even though some of them actually want a job\n1 See the FOMC’s Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, amended effective\nJanuary 30, 2018, available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals.pdf.\n2 This fundamental uncertainty has been extensively studied, particularly with respect to the most\ncommonly used measure of full employment--the so-called natural rate of unemployment. The authors of\none well-regarded study concluded that even when using sophisticated statistical techniques, the natural\nrate of unemployment could be as much as 1-1/2 percentage points above or below their point estimate.\nSee Douglas Staiger, James H. Stock, and Mark W. Watson (1997), “How Precise Are Estimates of the\nNatural Rate of Unemployment?” chapter 5 in Christina D. Romer and David H. Romer, eds., Reducing\nInflation: Motivation and Strategy (Chicago: University of Chicago Press), pp. 195-246,\nwww.nber.org/chapters/c8885.pdf.\n3 Individuals expecting to be recalled from a temporary layoff are also counted as unemployed whether or\nnot they are actively looking for work.\n\n- 4 -\nand are available to work. Others working part time may want a full-time job. And still\nothers who say that they do not want a job right now might be pulled into the job market\nif the right opportunity came along. So, in judging tightness in the labor market, we also\nlook at a range of other statistics, including alternative measures of unemployment, as\nwell as measures of vacancies and job flows, surveys of households’ and businesses’\nperceptions of the job market, and, of course, data on wages and prices.\nFigure 3 shows the headline unemployment rate and two broader measures of\nunemployment, known as U-5 and U-6.4 U-5 includes the unemployed plus people who\nsay they want a job and have looked for one in the past year (though not in the past four\nweeks). U-6 includes all those counted in U-5 plus people who are working part time but\nwould like full-time work. Like the headline unemployment rate, both U-5 and U-6 have\ndeclined significantly in recent years. They are now at levels seen before the financial\ncrisis, though not quite as low as they were in 1999 to 2000, a period of very tight job\nmarket conditions.\nThe left panel of the next chart shows that employers are having about as much\ndifficulty now attracting qualified workers as they did 20 years ago (figure 4). Likewise,\nthe job vacancy rate, shown on the right, is close to its all-time high, as is the average\nnumber of weeks it takes to fill a job opening.5 Households also are increasingly\nreporting that jobs are plentiful (figure 5), which is consistent with the high level of job\npostings reported by firms. In addition, the proportion of workers quitting their jobs is\nhigh, suggesting that workers are being hired away from their current employers and that\n4 The official unemployment rate is known as U-3.\n5 These data are from the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS,\nand start in 2000.\n\n- 5 -\nothers are confident enough about their prospects to leave jobs voluntarily--even before\nthey have landed their next job.\nWhile the data I have discussed thus far do point to a tight labor market, other\ndata are less definitive. The labor force participation rate, which measures the percentage\nof working age individuals who are either working or actively looking for a job, has\nremained steady for about four years (figure 6). This flat performance is actually a sign\nof improvement, since increased retirements as our population ages have been putting\ndownward pressure on participation and will continue to do so. However, the\nparticipation rate of prime-age workers (those between the ages of 25 and 54) has not\nrecovered fully to its pre-recession level, suggesting that there might still be room to pull\nmore people into the labor force (figure 7). Indeed, the strong job market does appear to\nbe drawing back some people who have been out of the labor force for a significant time.\nFor example, the percentage of adults returning to the labor force after previously\nreporting that they were not working because of a disability has increased over the past\ncouple of years, and anecdotal reports indicate that employers are increasingly willing to\ntake on and train workers they would not have considered in the past.6\nWage growth has also remained moderate, though it has picked up compared with\nits pace in the early part of this recovery (figure 8). Weak productivity growth is an\nimportant reason why we have not seen larger wage gains in recent years. At the same\ntime, the absence of a sharper acceleration in wages suggests that the labor market is not\nexcessively tight. I will be looking for an additional pickup in wage growth as the labor\nmarket strengthens further.\n6 For disability transition rates, see Ernie Tedeschi (2018), “Will Employment Keep Growing? Disabled\nWorkers Offer a Clue,” The Upshot, New York Times, March 15.\n\n- 6 -\nTaking all of these measures of labor utilization on board, what can we say about\nthe state of the labor market relative to our statutory goal of maximum employment?\nWhile uncertainty around the long run level of these indicators is substantial, many of\nthem suggest a labor market that is in the neighborhood of maximum employment. A\nfew other measures continue to suggest some remaining slack. Assessments of the\nmaximum level of employment are uncertain, however, and subject to revision. As we\nseek the highest sustainable utilization of labor resources, the Committee will be guided\nby incoming data across all of these measures.\nInflation\nThat brings me to inflation--the other leg of our dual mandate. The substantial\nimprovement in the labor market has been accompanied by low inflation. Indeed,\ninflation has continued to run below our 2 percent longer-run objective (figure 9).\nConsumer prices, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures,\nincreased 1.8 percent over the 12 months ending in February. The core price index,\nwhich excludes the prices of energy and food and is typically a better indicator of future\ninflation, rose 1.6 percent over the same period. In fact, both of these indexes have been\nbelow 2 percent consistently for the past half-dozen years. This persistent shortfall in\ninflation from our target has led some to question the traditional relationship between\ninflation and the unemployment rate, also known as the Phillips curve. Given how low\nthe unemployment rate is, why aren’t we seeing higher inflation now?\nAs those of you who carefully read the minutes of each FOMC meeting are\naware--and I know there are some of you out there--we had a thorough discussion of\ninflation dynamics at our January meeting. Almost all of the participants in that\n\n- 7 -\ndiscussion thought that the Phillips curve remained a useful basis for understanding\ninflation. They also acknowledged, however, that the link between labor market\ntightness and changes in inflation has become weaker and more difficult to estimate,\nreflecting in part the extended period of low and stable inflation in the United States and\nin other advanced economies. Participants also noted that other factors, including\ninflation expectations and transitory changes in energy and import prices, can affect\ninflation.\nMy view is that the data continue to show a relationship between the overall state\nof the labor market and the change in inflation over time. That connection has weakened\nover the past couple of decades, but it still persists, and I believe it continues to be\nmeaningful for monetary policy. Much of the shortfall in inflation in recent years is well\nexplained by high unemployment during the early years of the recovery and by falling\nenergy prices and the rise in the dollar in 2015 and 2016. But the decline in inflation last\nyear, as labor market conditions improved significantly, was a bit of a surprise. The 2017\nshortfall from our 2 percent goal appears to reflect, at least partly, some unusual price\ndeclines, such as for mobile phone plans, that occurred nearly a year ago. In fact,\nmonthly inflation readings have been firmer over the past several months, and the 12-\nmonth change should move up notably this spring as last spring’s soft readings drop out\nof the 12-month calculation. Consistent with this view, the median of FOMC\nparticipants’ projections in our March survey shows inflation moving up to 1.9 percent\nthis year and to 2 percent in 2019.\nLonger-Run Challenges\n\n- 8 -\nAlthough job creation is strong and unemployment is low, the U.S. economy\ncontinues to face some important longer-run challenges. GDP growth has averaged just\nover 2 percent per year in the current economic expansion, much slower than in previous\nexpansions. Even the higher growth seen in recent quarters remains below the trend\nbefore the crisis. Nonetheless, the unemployment rate has come down 6 percentage\npoints during the current expansion, suggesting that the trend growth necessary to keep\nthe unemployment rate unchanged has shifted down materially. The median of FOMC\nparticipants’ projections of this longer-run trend growth rate is 1.8 percent. The latest\nestimate from the Blue-Chip consensus of private forecasters is about 2 percent.7\nTo unpack this discussion a little further, we can think of output growth as\ncomposed of increases in hours worked and in output per hour, also known as\nproductivity growth. Here, a comparison with the 2001-to-2007 expansion is\ninformative. Output growth in that earlier expansion averaged nearly 3 percent per year,\nwell above the pace in the current expansion. Despite the faster output growth, however,\naverage job growth in the early 2000s was 1/2 percentage point per year weaker than in\nthe current expansion. The difference, of course, is productivity, which grew at more\nthan twice the pace in the early 2000s than it has in recent years.\nTaking a longer view, the average pace of labor productivity growth since 2010 is\nthe slowest since World War II and about one-fourth of the average postwar rate (figure\n10). Moreover, the productivity growth slowdown seems to be global and is evident even\nin countries that were little affected by the financial crisis (figure 11). This observation\nsuggests that factors specific to the United States are probably not the main drivers.\n7 Wolters Kluwer (2018), Blue Chip Economic Indicators, vol. 43, no. 3 (March 10).\n\n- 9 -\nAs shown in figure 12, labor productivity growth can be broken down into the\ncontributions from business investment (or capital deepening), changes in the skills and\nwork experience of the workforce, and a residual component that is attributed to other\nfactors such as technological change and efficiency gains (usually lumped together under\nthe term total factor or multifactor productivity).\nIn the United States and in many other countries, some of the slowdown in labor\nproductivity growth can be traced to weak investment after the crisis. Investment has\npicked up recently in the United States, however, which suggests that capital deepening\nmay pick up as well. The other big contributor to the slowdown has been in total factor\nproductivity growth. The outlook for this dimension of productivity is considerably more\nuncertain. Total factor productivity growth is notoriously difficult to predict, and there\nare sharply different views on where it might be heading. Some argue that the\nproductivity gains from the information technology revolution are largely behind us, and\nthat more-recent technological innovations have less potential to boost productivity.8\nOthers argue that a well-documented decline in measures of business dynamism--such as\nthe number of start-ups, the closure of less-productive businesses, and the rates at which\nworkers quit their jobs and move around the country to take a new job--has held back\nproductivity growth, in part by slowing the movement of capital and labor toward their\nmost productive uses.9\n8 See, for example, Robert J. Gordon (2016), The Rise and Fall of American Growth: The U.S. Standard of\nLiving since the Civil War (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press).\n9 See, for example, Ryan A. Decker, John Haltiwanger, Ron S. Jarmin, and Javier Miranda (2016),\n“Declining Business Dynamism: What We Know and the Way Forward,” American Economic Review,\nvol. 106 (May), pp. 203-07.\n\n- 10 -\nNew technological breakthroughs in many areas--robotics, biotech, and artificial\nintelligence to name just a few--have led others to take a more optimistic view.10 They\npoint to substantial productivity gains from innovation in areas such as energy production\nand e-commerce. In addition, the optimists point out that advances in technology often\ntake decades to work their way into the economy before their ultimate effects on\nproductivity are felt. That delay has been observed even for game-changing innovations\nlike the steam engine and electrification, which ultimately produced broad increases in\nproductivity and living standards. In this view, we just need to be patient for new\ntechnologies to diffuse through the economy. Only time will tell who has the better\nview--the record provides little basis to believe that we can accurately forecast the rate of\nincrease in productivity.\nThe other principal contributor to output growth is hours worked. Hours growth,\nin turn, is largely determined by growth in the labor force, which has averaged just 1/2\npercent per year since 2010, well below the average in previous decades (figure 13). One\nreason for slower growth of the labor force is that baby boomers are aging and retiring,\nand that trend will continue. But another reason is that labor force participation of people\nbetween the ages of 25 and 54--prime-age individuals--declined from 2010 to 2015 and\nremains low. Indeed, the participation rate for prime-age men has been falling for more\nthan 50 years, while women’s participation in this age group rose through the 1990s but\nthen turned downward, and it has fallen for the past 20 years.\n10 See, for example, Erik Brynjolfsson, Daniel Rock, and Chad Syverson (2017), “Artificial Intelligence\nand the Modern Productivity Paradox: A Clash of Expectations and Statistics,” NBER Working Paper\nSeries 24001 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic Research, November),\nwww.nber.org/papers/w24001.\n\n- 11 -\nThese trends in participation have been more pronounced in the United States\nthan in other advanced economies. In 1990, the United States had relatively high\nparticipation rates for prime-age women relative to other countries and was in the\nmidrange of advanced economies for prime-age men. However, we now stand at the low\nend of participation for both men and women in this age group--just above Italy, but well\nbelow Germany, France, and Spain (figure 14).\nThere is no consensus about the reasons for the long-term decline in prime-age\nparticipation rates, and a variety of factors could have played a role. 11 For example,\nwhile automation and globalization have contributed positively to overall domestic\nproduction and growth, adjustment to these developments has resulted in dislocations of\nmany workers without college degrees and those employed in manufacturing. In\naddition, factors such as the increase in disability rolls in recent decades and the opioid\ncrisis may have reduced the supply of prime-age workers. Given that the declines have\nbeen larger here than in other countries, it seems likely that factors specific to the United\nStates have played an important role. As I noted earlier, the strong economy may\ncontinue to pull some prime-age individuals back into the labor force and encourage\nothers not to drop out. Research suggests that structurally-oriented measures--for\nexample, improving education or fighting the opioid crisis--also will help raise labor\nforce participation in this age group.12\n11 See, for example, Katharine G. Abraham and Melissa S. Kearney (2018), “Explaining the Decline in the\nU.S. Employment-to-Population Ratio: A Review of the Evidence,” NBER Working Paper Series 24333\n(Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic Research, February), www.nber.org/papers/w24333.\n12 See Alan B. Krueger (2017), “Where Have All the Workers Gone? An Inquiry into the Decline of the\nU.S. Labor Force Participation Rate,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Fall, pp. 1-87,\nhttps://www.brookings.edu/bpea-articles/where-have-all-the-workers-gone-an-inquiry-into-the-decline-of-\nthe-u-s-labor-force-participation-rate.\n\n- 12 -\nTo summarize this discussion, some of the factors weighing on longer-term\ngrowth are likely to be persistent, particularly the slowing in growth of the workforce.\nOthers are hard to predict, such as productivity. But as a nation, we are not bystanders.\nWe can put policies in place that will support labor force participation and give us the\nbest chance to achieve broad and sustained increases in productivity, and thus in living\nstandards. These policies are mostly outside the toolkit of the Federal Reserve, such as\nthose that support investment in education and workers’ skills, business investment and\nresearch and development, and investment in infrastructure.\nMonetary Policy\nLet me turn now to monetary policy. In the aftermath of the financial crisis, the\nFOMC went to extraordinary lengths to promote the recovery, support job growth, and\nprevent inflation from falling too low. As the recovery advanced, it became appropriate\nto begin reducing monetary policy support. Since monetary policy affects the economy\nwith a lag, waiting until inflation and employment hit our goals before reducing policy\nsupport could have led to a rise in inflation to unwelcome levels. In such circumstances,\nmonetary policy might need to tighten abruptly, which could disrupt the economy or even\ntrigger a recession.\nAs a result, to sustain the expansion, the FOMC adopted a gradual approach to\nreducing monetary policy support. We began in December 2015 by raising our target for\nthe federal funds rate for the first time in nearly a decade. Since then, with the economy\nimproving but inflation still below target and some slack remaining, the Committee has\ncontinued to gradually raise interest rates. This patient approach also reduced the risk\nthat an unforeseen blow to the economy might push the federal funds rate back near\n\n- 13 -\nzero--its effective lower bound--thus limiting our ability to provide appropriate monetary\naccommodation.\nIn addition, after careful planning and public communication, last October the\nFOMC began to gradually and predictably reduce the size of the Fed’s balance sheet.\nReducing our securities holdings is another way to move the stance of monetary policy\ntoward neutral. The balance sheet reduction process is going smoothly and is expected to\ncontribute over time to a gradual tightening of financial conditions. Over the next few\nyears, the size of our balance sheet is expected to shrink significantly.\nAt our meeting last month, the FOMC raised the target range for the federal funds\nrate by 1/4 percentage point, bringing it to 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent. This decision marked\nanother step in the ongoing process of gradually scaling back monetary policy\naccommodation. The FOMC’s patient approach has paid dividends and contributed to\nthe strong economy we have today.\nOver the next few years, we will continue to aim for 2 percent inflation and for a\nsustained economic expansion with a strong labor market. As I mentioned, my FOMC\ncolleagues and I believe that, as long as the economy continues broadly on its current\npath, further gradual increases in the federal funds rate will best promote these goals. It\nremains the case that raising rates too slowly would make it necessary for monetary\npolicy to tighten abruptly down the road, which could jeopardize the economic\nexpansion. But raising rates too quickly would increase the risk that inflation would\nremain persistently below our 2 percent objective. Our path of gradual rate increases is\nintended to balance these two risks.\n\n- 14 -\nOf course, our views about appropriate monetary policy in the months and years\nahead will be informed by incoming economic data and the evolving outlook. If the\noutlook changes, so too will monetary policy.

Powell\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Building a Resilient Workforce,” a video conference\nsponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nYoungstown, Ohio\nJune 19, 2020\n\nThank you, President Mester and Treye Johnson, and thanks to everyone for\njoining us. My job today is to listen, so I will keep my remarks short. But I do want to\nsay that these conversations are incredibly valuable. They give context to reams of data\nand definition to a huge and complex economic picture. They also help solve problems\non a practical level. Feedback from our Investing in America’s Workforce initiative\nfound a pronounced need for workforce and economic development programs to more\nclosely align, for instance. And employers’ input has influenced work across the Fed\nSystem, including the Cleveland Fed, as they look at how skills on the lower end of the\npay scale can transfer to higher-earning jobs. So from me, and on behalf of my\ncolleagues: Thank you for your time today and for your ongoing insight.\nIt is not lost on me that we are meeting on Juneteenth amid a renewed reckoning\nof racial injustice. The pandemic has again exposed a range of troubling inequalities,\nmost of them of long standing. As the national discussion continues, it is critical to\nremember that equity includes access to education, work, and economic opportunity. I\nam reminded that Dr. King delivered his “I Have a Dream” speech, just a few short\nblocks from the Federal Reserve, at a rally whose full title was the March on Washington\nfor Jobs and Freedom.\nWe meet today amid the immense hardship and suffering the coronavirus has\ncaused. Lives and livelihoods have been lost, and uncertainty looms large. We are all\ngrateful to our frontline health-care workers who put themselves in harm’s way every day\nand to the essential workers helping us meet our needs. While we are all affected, the\nburden has fallen disproportionately on those least able to bear it.\n\n- 2 -\nBefore the virus swept across the globe, the American economy was in a good\nplace. We were experiencing the longest expansion on record, and unemployment had\nreached historic lows. However, that is a national average that can gloss over stark\nrealities. That economic good fortune had eluded pockets across the country, including\nYoungstown. A particular cruelty of the pandemic has been its disproportionate effects\non many areas that were already suffering.\nWe will make our way back from this, but it will take time and work. Some of\nthe most valuable information we get from these discussions is how people are working\nto create growth. Your feedback can be an invaluable example for other communities\nwith similar challenges. The Lordstown closure served as a reminder of how\ninterconnected local economies can be, and other areas have experienced similar losses.\nYour work on diversifying the economy, on skills development, on small business\nsupport programs, and in so many other areas can all serve as models for others to\nreplicate.\nThe path ahead is likely to be challenging. But given the opportunity, I’ll always\nbet on the American people and on the kind of community resolve and dedication we’re\nhearing about today. I’m looking forward to your insight and to hearing more about how\nyou’ve been working to revitalize Youngstown’s economy.\nThank you.",

Powell\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Macroeconomic Policy in an Uneven Economy,” an economic policy\nsymposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\nJackson Hole, Wyoming\n(via webcast)\nAugust 27, 2021\n\nSeventeen months have passed since the U.S. economy faced the full force of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. This shock led to an immediate and unprecedented decline as\nlarge parts of the economy were shuttered to contain the spread of the disease.\nThe path of recovery has been a difficult one, and a good place to begin is by\nthanking those on the front line fighting the pandemic: the essential workers who kept\nthe economy going, those who have cared for others in need, and those in medical\nresearch, business, and government, who came together to discover, produce, and widely\ndistribute effective vaccines in record time. We should also keep in our thoughts those\nwho have lost their lives from COVID, as well as their loved ones.\nStrong policy support has fueled a vigorous but uneven recovery—one that is, in\nmany respects, historically anomalous. In a reversal of typical patterns in a downturn,\naggregate personal income rose rather than fell, and households massively shifted their\nspending from services to manufactured goods. Booming demand for goods and the\nstrength and speed of the reopening have led to shortages and bottlenecks, leaving the\nCOVID-constrained supply side unable to keep up. The result has been elevated inflation\nin durable goods—a sector that has experienced an annual inflation rate well below zero\nover the past quarter century.1 Labor market conditions are improving but turbulent, and\nthe pandemic continues to threaten not only health and life, but also economic activity.\nMany other advanced economies are experiencing similarly unusual conditions.\nIn my comments today, I will focus on the Fed’s efforts to promote our maximum\nemployment and price stability goals amid this upheaval, and suggest how lessons from\n1 See, for example, figure 5.\n\n- 2 -\nhistory and a careful focus on incoming data and the evolving risks offer useful guidance\nfor today’s unique monetary policy challenges.\nThe Recession and Recovery So Far\nThe pandemic recession—the briefest yet deepest on record—displaced roughly\n30 million workers in the space of two months.2 The decline in output in the second\nquarter of 2020 was twice the full decline during the Great Recession of 2007–09.3 But\nthe pace of the recovery has exceeded expectations, with output surpassing its previous\npeak after only four quarters, less than half the time required following the Great\nRecession. As is typically the case, the recovery in employment has lagged that in\noutput; nonetheless, employment gains have also come faster than expected.4\nThe economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least\nable to shoulder the burden have been hardest hit. In particular, despite progress,\njoblessness continues to fall disproportionately on lower-wage workers in the service\nsector and on African Americans and Hispanics.\nThe unevenness of the recovery can further be seen through the lens of the\nsectoral shift of spending into goods—particularly durable goods such as appliances,\nfurniture, and cars—and away from services, particularly in-person services in areas such\nas travel and leisure (figure 1). As the pandemic struck, restaurant meals fell 45 percent,\nair travel 95 percent, and dentist visits 65 percent. Even today, with overall gross\n2 This figure includes both the decline in the number reporting themselves as employed in the Household\nSurvey as well as the BLS’ estimate of those who misreported themselves as employed but not at work\nrather than on temporary layoff.\n3 From the peak to the trough quarter, gross domestic product dropped 10 percent last year, compared with\n3.8 percent in the 2007–09 recession.\n4 For example, the consensus forecast reported by Blue Chip Economic Indicators in April 2020 put the\nunemployment rate in the second quarter of 2021 at 7.4 percent, compared with the actual value of\n5.9 percent.\n\n- 3 -\ndomestic product and consumption spending more than fully recovered, services\nspending remains about 7 percent below trend. Total employment is now 6 million\nbelow its February 2020 level, and 5 million of that shortfall is in the still-depressed\nservice sector. In contrast, spending on durable goods has boomed since the start of the\nrecovery and is now running about 20 percent above the pre-pandemic level. With\ndemand outstripping pandemic-afflicted supply, rising durables prices are a principal\nfactor lifting inflation well above our 2 percent objective.\nGiven the ongoing upheaval in the economy, some strains and surprises are\ninevitable. The job of monetary policy is to promote maximum employment and price\nstability as the economy works through this challenging period. I will turn now to a\ndiscussion of progress toward those goals.\nThe Path Ahead: Maximum Employment\nThe outlook for the labor market has brightened considerably in recent months.\nAfter faltering last winter, job gains have risen steadily over the course of this year and\nnow average 832,000 over the past three months, of which almost 800,000 have been in\nservices (figure 2). The pace of total hiring is faster than at any time in the recorded data\nbefore the pandemic. The levels of job openings and quits are at record highs, and\nemployers report that they cannot fill jobs fast enough to meet returning demand.\nThese favorable conditions for job seekers should help the economy cover the\nconsiderable remaining ground to reach maximum employment. The unemployment rate\nhas declined to 5.4 percent, a post-pandemic low, but is still much too high, and the\nreported rate understates the amount of labor market slack.5 Long-term unemployment\n5 An alternative measure that adjusts for the misclassification of some unemployed workers as employed\nbut not at work (as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics) and for diminished labor force participation\n\n- 4 -\nremains elevated, and the recovery in labor force participation has lagged well behind the\nrest of the labor market, as it has in past recoveries.\nWith vaccinations rising, schools reopening, and enhanced unemployment\nbenefits ending, some factors that may be holding back job seekers are likely fading.6\nWhile the Delta variant presents a near-term risk, the prospects are good for continued\nprogress toward maximum employment.\nThe Path Ahead: Inflation\nThe rapid reopening of the economy has brought a sharp run-up in inflation. Over\nthe 12 months through July, measures of headline and core personal consumption\nexpenditures inflation have run at 4.2 percent and 3.6 percent, respectively—well above\nour 2 percent longer-run objective.7 Businesses and consumers widely report upward\npressure on prices and wages. Inflation at these levels is, of course, a cause for concern.\nBut that concern is tempered by a number of factors that suggest that these elevated\nreadings are likely to prove temporary. This assessment is a critical and ongoing one,\nand we are carefully monitoring incoming data.\nThe dynamics of inflation are complex, and we assess the inflation outlook from a\nnumber of different perspectives, as I will now discuss.\ninduced by the pandemic (as estimated by Federal Reserve Board staff) currently stands at 7.8 percent, also\na post-pandemic low.\n6 Factors holding back job gains are more thoroughly discussed in the July 2021 Monetary Policy Report,\nwhich is available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/20210709_mprfullreport.pdf.\n7 These values reflect data through July as released on August 27, 2020. All other statements about\npersonal consumption expenditures and associated prices reflect data through June and do not include the\nAugust 27, 2021 release covering July.\n\n- 5 -\n1. The absence so far of broad-based inflation pressures\nThe spike in inflation is so far largely the product of a relatively narrow group of\ngoods and services that have been directly affected by the pandemic and the reopening of\nthe economy. Durable goods alone contributed about 1 percentage point to the latest\n12-month measures of headline and core inflation. Energy prices, which rebounded with\nthe strong recovery, added another 0.8 percentage point to headline inflation, and from\nlong experience we expect the inflation effects of these increases to be transitory. In\naddition, some prices—for example, for hotel rooms and airplane tickets—declined\nsharply during the recession and have now moved back up close to pre-pandemic levels.\nThe 12-month window we use in computing inflation now captures the rebound in prices\nbut not the initial decline, temporarily elevating reported inflation. These effects, which\nare adding a few tenths to measured inflation, should wash out over time.\nWe consult a range of measures meant to capture whether price increases for\nparticular items are spilling over into broad-based inflation. These include trimmed mean\nmeasures and measures excluding durables and computed from just before the pandemic.\nThese measures generally show inflation at or close to our 2 percent longer-run objective\n(figure 3). We would be concerned at signs that inflationary pressures were spreading\nmore broadly through the economy.\n2. Moderating inflation in higher-inflation items\nWe are also directly monitoring the prices of particular goods and services most\naffected by the pandemic and the reopening, and are beginning to see a moderation in\nsome cases as shortages ease. Used car prices, for example, appear to have stabilized;\nindeed, some price indicators are beginning to fall. If that continues, as many analysts\n\n- 6 -\npredict, then used car prices will soon be pulling measured inflation down, as they did for\nmuch of the past decade.8\nThis same dynamic of upward inflation pressure dissipating and, in some cases,\nreversing seems likely to play out in durables more generally. Over the 25 years\npreceding the pandemic, durables prices actually declined, with inflation averaging\nnegative 1.9 percent per year (figure 5).9 As supply problems have begun to resolve,\ninflation in durable goods other than autos has now slowed and may be starting to fall. It\nseems unlikely that durables inflation will continue to contribute importantly over time to\noverall inflation. We will be looking for evidence that supports or undercuts that\nexpectation.\n3. Wages\nWe also assess whether wage increases are consistent with 2 percent inflation\nover time. Wage increases are essential to support a rising standard of living and are\ngenerally, of course, a welcome development. But if wage increases were to move\nmaterially and persistently above the levels of productivity gains and inflation, businesses\nwould likely pass those increases on to customers, a process that could become the sort of\n“wage–price spiral” seen at times in the past.10 Today we see little evidence of wage\nincreases that might threaten excessive inflation (figure 6). Broad-based measures of\nwages that adjust for compositional changes in the labor force, such as the employment\n8 Declines in used car prices would begin holding down 12-month inflation once most of the earlier price\nincreases have fallen out of the 12-month window.\n9 The lower inflation in durable goods is probably due to a number factors, including faster productivity\ngrowth in durable goods than in services and globalization.\n10 If wages rise in line with inflation and labor productivity growth, then real unit labor costs (or the labor\ncost of producing one unit of output) to businesses are constant. Wages may grow slower or faster than\ninflation plus productivity growth for extended periods because of changing structural factors without being\nreflected in inflation. Ultimately, however, persistently rising real unit labor costs will put upward pressure\non prices.\n\n- 7 -\ncost index and the Atlanta Wage Growth Tracker, show wages moving up at a pace that\nappears consistent with our longer-term inflation objective. We will continue to monitor\nthis carefully.\n4. Longer-term inflation expectations\nPolicymakers and analysts generally believe that, as long as longer-term inflation\nexpectations remain anchored, policy can and should look through temporary swings in\ninflation. Our monetary policy framework emphasizes that anchoring longer-term\nexpectations at 2 percent is important for both maximum employment and price stability.\nWe carefully monitor a wide range of indicators of longer-term inflation\nexpectations. These measures today are at levels broadly consistent with our 2 percent\nobjective (figure 4). Because measures of inflation expectations are individually noisy,\nwe also focus on common patterns across the measures. One approach to summarizing\nthese patterns is the Board staff’s index of common inflation expectations (CIE), which\ncombines information from a broad range of survey and market-based measures.11 This\nindex captures a general move down in expectations starting around 2014, a time when\ninflation was running persistently below 2 percent. More recently, the index shows a\nwelcome reversal of that decline and is now at levels more consistent with our 2 percent\nobjective.\nLonger-term inflation expectations have moved much less than actual inflation or\nnear-term expectations, suggesting that households, businesses, and market participants\n11 The way the CIE combines the underlying measures means that it will tend not to be affected by\nunderlying movements that are unique to individual measures; the CIE will reflect movements that are\nmore common across underlying measures.\n\n- 8 -\nalso believe that current high inflation readings are likely to prove transitory and that, in\nany case, the Fed will keep inflation close to our 2 percent objective over time.12\n5. The prevalence of global disinflationary forces over the past quarter century\nFinally, it is worth noting that, since the 1990s, inflation in many advanced\neconomies has run somewhat below 2 percent even in good times (figure 7). The pattern\nof low inflation likely reflects sustained disinflationary forces, including technology,\nglobalization and perhaps demographic factors, as well as a stronger and more successful\ncommitment by central banks to maintain price stability.13 In the United States,\nunemployment ran below 4 percent for about two years before the pandemic, while\ninflation ran at or below 2 percent. Wages did move up across the income spectrum—a\nwelcome development—but not by enough to lift price inflation consistently to 2 percent.\nWhile the underlying global disinflationary factors are likely to evolve over time, there is\nlittle reason to think that they have suddenly reversed or abated. It seems more likely that\nthey will continue to weigh on inflation as the pandemic passes into history.14\nWe will continue to monitor incoming inflation data against each of these\nassessments.\nTo sum up, the baseline outlook is for continued progress toward maximum\nemployment, with inflation returning to levels consistent with our goal of inflation\n12 On a Q4-over-Q4 basis, the August 13, 2021, Survey of Professional Forecasters reports a consensus\nforecast for total personal consumption expenditures inflation of 4.1 percent, 2.2 percent, and 2.3 percent\nfor 2021 to 2023, respectively. The corresponding numbers for core inflation are 3.7 percent, 2.2 percent,\nand 2.1 percent, respectively. The August 10, 2021, Blue Chip Economic Indicators Forecast presents\nsimilar consensus forecasts for 2021 and 2022.\n13 For views on this, see Canon, Kudlyak, and Reed (2015), Forbes (2019), Goodhart and Pradhan (2020),\nObstfeld (2020).\n14 For an opposing view, see Goodhart and Pradhan (2020), who argue that the globalization and\ndemographic factors that had been fueling global disinflationary forces are now reversing and could give\nrise to an inflationary period. Even if we are near an inflection point, as Goodhart and Pradhan argue,\ndemographic forces move slowly relative to the near-term policy horizon I am discussing here today.\n\n- 9 -\naveraging 2 percent over time. Let me now turn to how the baseline outlook and the\nassociated risks and uncertainties figure in our monetary policymaking.\nImplications for Monetary Policy\nThe period from 1950 through the early 1980s provides two important lessons for\nmanaging the risks and uncertainties we face today. The early days of stabilization\npolicy in the 1950s taught monetary policymakers not to attempt to offset what are likely\nto be temporary fluctuations in inflation.15 Indeed, responding may do more harm than\ngood, particularly in an era where policy rates are much closer to the effective lower\nbound even in good times. The main influence of monetary policy on inflation can come\nafter a lag of a year or more. If a central bank tightens policy in response to factors that\nturn out to be temporary, the main policy effects are likely to arrive after the need has\npassed. The ill-timed policy move unnecessarily slows hiring and other economic\nactivity and pushes inflation lower than desired. Today, with substantial slack remaining\nin the labor market and the pandemic continuing, such a mistake could be particularly\nharmful. We know that extended periods of unemployment can mean lasting harm to\nworkers and to the productive capacity of the economy.16\nHistory also teaches, however, that central banks cannot take for granted that\ninflation due to transitory factors will fade. The 1970s saw two periods in which there\nwere large increases in energy and food prices, raising headline inflation for a time. But\nwhen the direct effects on headline inflation eased, core inflation continued to run\n15 As I discussed here two years ago, Milton Friedman first made this argument referring to the stop-and-go\npolicies in the 1950s. See Powell (2019) and Friedman (1958, p. 241). Bodenstein, Erceg, and Guerrieri\n(2008) and Mishkin (2007) illustrate the problems that reacting to transitory sources of inflation can cause\nusing two of the Board staff’s models.\n16 See, for example, Davis and von Wachter (2011).\n\n- 10 -\npersistently higher than before. One likely contributing factor was that the public had\ncome to generally expect higher inflation—one reason why we now monitor inflation\nexpectations so carefully.17\nCentral banks have always faced the problem of distinguishing transitory inflation\nspikes from more troublesome developments, and it is sometimes difficult to do so with\nconfidence in real time. At such times, there is no substitute for a careful focus on\nincoming data and evolving risks. If sustained higher inflation were to become a serious\nconcern, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) would certainly respond and use\nour tools to assure that inflation runs at levels that are consistent with our goal.\nIncoming data should provide more evidence that some of the supply–demand\nimbalances are improving, and more evidence of a continued moderation in inflation,\nparticularly in goods and services prices that have been most affected by the pandemic.\nWe also expect to see continued strong job creation. And we will be learning more about\nthe Delta variant’s effects. For now, I believe that policy is well positioned; as always,\nwe are prepared to adjust policy as appropriate to achieve our goals.\nThat brings me to a concluding word on the path ahead for monetary policy. The\nCommittee remains steadfast in our oft-expressed commitment to support the economy\nfor as long as is needed to achieve a full recovery. The changes we made last year to our\nStatement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy are well suited to address\ntoday’s challenges.\nWe have said that we would continue our asset purchases at the current pace until\nwe see substantial further progress toward our maximum employment and price stability\n17 See, for example, Orphanides and Williams (2013) on the role of de-anchored inflation expectations.\nThis paper is in Bordo and Orphanides (2013), which discusses a wide range of related issues.\n\n- 11 -\ngoals, measured since last December, when we first articulated this guidance. My view is\nthat the “substantial further progress” test has been met for inflation. There has also been\nclear progress toward maximum employment. At the FOMC’s recent July meeting, I was\nof the view, as were most participants, that if the economy evolved broadly as\nanticipated, it could be appropriate to start reducing the pace of asset purchases this year.\nThe intervening month has brought more progress in the form of a strong employment\nreport for July, but also the further spread of the Delta variant. We will be carefully\nassessing incoming data and the evolving risks. Even after our asset purchases end, our\nelevated holdings of longer-term securities will continue to support accommodative\nfinancial conditions.\nThe timing and pace of the coming reduction in asset purchases will not be\nintended to carry a direct signal regarding the timing of interest rate liftoff, for which we\nhave articulated a different and substantially more stringent test. We have said that we\nwill continue to hold the target range for the federal funds rate at its current level until the\neconomy reaches conditions consistent with maximum employment, and inflation has\nreached 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. We have\nmuch ground to cover to reach maximum employment, and time will tell whether we\nhave reached 2 percent inflation on a sustainable basis.\nThese are challenging times for the public we serve, as the pandemic and its\nunprecedented toll on health and economic activity linger. But I will end on a positive\nnote. Before the pandemic, we all saw the extraordinary benefits that a strong labor\nmarket can deliver to our society. Despite today’s challenges, the economy is on a path\n\n- 12 -\nto just such a labor market, with high levels of employment and participation, broadly\nshared wage gains, and inflation running close to our price stability goal.\nThank you very much.\n\n- 13 -\nReferences\nBodenstein, Martin, Christopher J.

Powell\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nGreater Providence Chamber of Commerce\n2025 Economic Outlook Luncheon\nWarwick, Rhode Island\nSeptember 23, 2025\n\nThank you. It is a pleasure to be back here in Rhode Island. The last time I had\nthe opportunity to speak to the Greater Providence Chamber of Commerce was in the fall\nof 2019. I noted then that, “if the outlook changes materially, policy will change as\nwell.”1\nLittle did any of us know! Just a couple of months later, the COVID-19 pandemic\narrived. Both the economy and our policy evolved dramatically in ways no one could\nhave predicted. Along with actions by Congress, the Administration, and the private\nsector, the Fed’s aggressive response helped stave off historically severe downside risks\nto the economy.\nThe COVID pandemic came on the heels of the painfully slow decade-long\nrecovery from the Global Financial Crisis. These two back-to-back world historical\ncrises have left behind scars that will be with us for a long time. In democracies around\nthe world, public trust in economic and political institutions has been challenged. Those\nof us who are in public service at this time need to focus tightly on carrying out our\ncritical missions to the best of our ability in the midst of stormy seas and powerful\ncrosswinds.\nThroughout this turbulent period, central banks like the Fed have had to develop\ninnovative new policies that were designed to deliver on our statutory goals during times\nof crisis, rather than for everyday use. Despite these two unique, extremely large shocks,\nthe U.S. economy has performed as well or better than other large, advanced economies\naround the world. As always, it is essential that we continue to look back and learn the\n1 See Jerome H. Powell (2019), “Building on the Gains from the Long Expansion,” speech delivered at the\nAnnual Meeting of the Greater Providence Chamber of Commerce, Providence, Rhode Island,\nNovember 25, paragraph 21, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20191125a.htm.\n\n- 2 -\nright lessons from these difficult years, and that process has been ongoing for more than a\ndecade.\nTurning to the present day, the U.S. economy is showing resilience in the midst of\nsubstantial changes in trade and immigration policies, as well as in fiscal, regulatory and\ngeopolitical arenas. These policies are still emerging, and their longer-term implications\nwill take some time to be seen.\nEconomic Outlook\nRecent data show that the pace of economic growth has moderated. The\nunemployment rate is low but has edged up. Job gains have slowed, and the downside\nrisks to employment have risen. At the same time, inflation has risen recently and\nremains somewhat elevated. In recent months, it has become clear that the balance of\nrisks has shifted, prompting us to move our policy stance closer to neutral at our meeting\nlast week.\nGDP rose at a pace of around one and a half percent in the first half of the year,\ndown from 2.5 percent growth last year. The moderation in growth largely reflects a\nslowdown in consumer spending. Activity in the housing sector remains weak, but\nbusiness investment in equipment and intangibles has picked up from last year’s pace.\nAs noted in the September Beige Book, a report that gathers qualitative information from\nacross the Fed System, businesses continue to say that uncertainty is weighing on their\noutlook. Measures of consumer and business sentiment declined sharply in the spring;\nthey have since moved up but remain low relative to the start of the year.\nIn the labor market, there has been a marked slowing in both the supply of and\ndemand for workers—an unusual and challenging development. In this less dynamic and\n\n- 3 -\nsomewhat softer labor market, the downside risks to employment have risen. The\nunemployment rate edged up to 4.3 percent in August but has remained relatively stable\nat a low level over the past year. Payroll job gains slowed sharply over the summer\nmonths, as employers added an average of just 29,000 per month over the past three\nmonths. The recent pace of job creation appears to be running below the “breakeven”\nrate needed to hold the unemployment rate constant. But a number of other labor market\nindicators remain broadly stable. For example, the ratio of job openings to\nunemployment remains near 1. And multiple measures of job openings have been\nmoving roughly sideways, as have initial claims for unemployment insurance.\nInflation has eased significantly from its highs of 2022 but remains somewhat\nelevated relative to our 2 percent longer-run goal. The latest available data indicate that\ntotal PCE prices rose 2.7 percent over the 12 months ending in August, up from 2.3\npercent in August 2024. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE\nprices rose 2.9 percent last month, also higher than the year-ago level. Goods prices,\nafter falling last year, are driving the pickup in inflation. Incoming data and surveys\nsuggest that those price increases largely reflect higher tariffs rather than broader price\npressures. Disinflation for services continues, including for housing. Near-term\nmeasures of inflation expectations have moved up, on balance, over the course of this\nyear on news about tariffs. Beyond the next year or so, however, most measures of\nlonger-term expectations remain consistent with our 2 percent inflation goal.\nThe overall economic effects of the significant changes in trade, immigration,\nfiscal and regulatory policy remain to be seen. A reasonable base case is that the tariff-\nrelated effects on inflation will be relatively short lived—a one-time shift in the price\n\n- 4 -\nlevel. A “one-time” increase does not mean “all at once.” Tariff increases will likely\ntake some time to work their way through supply chains. As a result, this one-time\nincrease in the price level will likely be spread over several quarters and show up as\nsomewhat higher inflation during that period.\nBut uncertainty around the path of inflation remains high. We will carefully\nassess and manage the risk of higher and more persistent inflation. We will make sure\nthat this one-time increase in prices does not become an ongoing inflation problem.\nMonetary Policy\nNear-term risks to inflation are tilted to the upside and risks to employment to the\ndownside—a challenging situation. Two-sided risks mean that there is no risk-free path.\nIf we ease too aggressively, we could leave the inflation job unfinished and need to\nreverse course later to fully restore 2 percent inflation. If we maintain restrictive policy\ntoo long, the labor market could soften unnecessarily. When our goals are in tension like\nthis, our framework calls for us to balance both sides of our dual mandate.\nThe increased downside risks to employment have shifted the balance of risks to\nachieving our goals. We therefore judged it appropriate at our last meeting to take\nanother step toward a more neutral policy stance, lowering the target range for the federal\nfunds rate by 25 basis points to 4 to 4¼ percent. This policy stance, which I see as still\nmodestly restrictive, leaves us well positioned to respond to potential economic\ndevelopments.\nOur policy is not on a preset course. We will continue to determine the\nappropriate stance based on the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of\nrisks. We remain committed to supporting maximum employment and bringing inflation\n\n- 5 -\nsustainably to our 2 percent goal. Our success in delivering on these goals matters to all\nAmericans. We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses\nacross the country.\nThank you again for having me here. I look forward to our discussion.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n10:45 a.m. EDT\nSeptember 30, 2014\nRemarks on the Paper\n“Government Debt Management at the Zero Lower Bound,”\nby Robin Greenwood, Samuel G. Hanson, Joshua S. Rudolph,\nand Lawrence Summers\nRemarks by\nJerome H. Powell\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nPanel Discussion:\n“Debt Management in an Era of Quantitative Easing:\nWhat Should the Treasury and the Fed Do?”\nBrookings Institution\nWashington, D.C.\nSeptember 30, 2014\n\nThank you for the opportunity to be here today. Given my role at the Federal\nReserve, I am not in a position to comment on debt management policy.1\nI would like to begin by complimenting the authors of this highly interesting\npaper for their systematic approach to thinking about a wide-ranging and difficult set\nof issues.\nAfter a period during which the Treasury’s debt management needs dominated\nFederal Reserve policies, the Fed began to regain its independence with the Treasury-Fed\nAccord of 1951. Since the 1970s, there has been little or no coordination between the\ntwo institutions over debt management. This paper argues that the extraordinary\nresponse to the global financial crisis brought about a conflict between debt management\nand monetary policy that should have been avoided through collaboration. The paper\nproposes a regime in which the Treasury and the Fed would cooperate around debt\nmanagement at all times and would fully collaborate in the case in which the monetary\npolicy rate is pinned at the zero lower bound.\nAs a policymaker, I bring a degree of skepticism to a proposal to make major\nchanges to institutional arrangements that seem to me to have served the public well. I\nwill mention three areas where I have significant concerns. First, the literature on\nfinancial stability and monetary policy is still in its infancy. There is no consensus that\nmonetary policy (or debt management policy) should assume the kinds of roles assigned\nby the authors. In particular, policymakers are addressing the problem of private money\ncreation through an array of regulatory initiatives.\n1 The views offered are mine alone and not necessarily those of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve.\n\n- 2 -\nSecond, in describing the costs of the existing arrangements, the paper estimates\nthat the Treasury’s post-2008 extension of the weighted average maturity (or duration) of\nthe Federal debt offset--in a purely mechanical sense--about 35 percent of the effect of\nthe Federal Reserve’s large-scale asset purchase (LSAP) programs on the level of 10-year\nTreasury yields.2 I would challenge this ex post framing of the issue. Maturity extension\nmerely continued a policy begun by the Treasury well before the crisis and was also\nbroadly consistent with the Treasury’s past behavior at times of substantial increases in\nborrowing. My starting point would be that the Federal Open Market Committee did\nwhat it thought was appropriate ex ante to return the economy to full employment and\nstable prices, taking Treasury decisions concerning debt management as exogenous.\nAs the authors acknowledge, there are good reasons to think that any term\npremium effect of the maturity extension must have been much smaller than the\n“35 percent” figure implies. The paper’s estimate is based solely on what is sometimes\nreferred to as the “duration removal” channel. There are other channels that would not be\noffset by maturity extension--in particular, a channel by which the Federal Reserve\nsignals the strength of its commitment to achieving the dual mandate. My view is that it\nis quite difficult to explain the observed effects of LSAPs on asset prices without\nreference to these other channels. In addition, according to the authors’ estimates, the\n“announcement effects” of the Treasury’s maturity extension policy seem to be only half\nthe size of the effects of comparable Fed announcements.\nThe LSAPs tripled the Federal Reserve’s share of outstanding 10-year duration,\nfrom 12 percent to 36 percent, and had quite significant effects on the prices of financial\n2 The term “LSAPs” is used here to include QE1 (that is, the first round of quantitative easing by the Fed),\nQE2 (the second round), the maturity extension program, and QE3 (the third round).\n\n- 3 -\nassets. By most estimates, the 10-year Treasury term premium was deeply negative from\nmid-2011 through mid-2013; it remains near zero today, far below normal pre-crisis\nlevels. Given the very low level of rates over this period, it is not clear to me that a\nslightly more negative term premium would have produced materially different real\neconomy results.\nThird, the authors’ proposals seem to me to be fraught with risk for the Federal\nReserve. I believe that the existing institutional arrangements have served the public\nwell. The independence of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy is highly valuable to\nsociety. There is considerable evidence that monetary policy independence leads to\nbetter macroeconomic outcomes. Any active collaboration between debt management\nand monetary policy, even in a crisis, would risk calling into question that independence.\nThat is a risk I would be very reluctant to take.\nThe period after the Second World War during which debt management imposed\nrequirements upon monetary policy was marked by strains between the Treasury and the\nFed and less than full independence for monetary policy. While current institutional\narrangements may be imperfect, history suggests a need for caution before allowing these\ntwo policies to become entangled once again.\nThanks again, and I look forward to our conversation.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n6:00 a.m. EDT (12 noon local time)\nJune 26, 2017\nRemarks by\nJerome H. Powell\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nSalzburg Global Seminar\nSalzburg, Austria\nJune 26, 2017\n\n- 2 -\nI appreciate the opportunity to speak at the Salzburg Global Seminar. Today I will\ndiscuss our current regulatory regime, and areas where we may be able to make adjustments. As\nalways, the views I express here are my own.1\nWe need a resilient, well-capitalized, well-regulated financial system that is strong\nenough to withstand even severe shocks and support economic growth by lending through the\neconomic cycle. The Federal Reserve has approached the post-crisis regulatory and supervisory\nreforms with that outcome in mind.\nThere is little doubt that the U.S. financial system is stronger today than it was a decade\nago. Loss-absorbing capacity among banks is substantially higher as a result of both regulatory\nrequirements and stress testing exercises. The banking industry, and the largest banking firms in\nparticular, face far less liquidity risk than before the crisis. And progress in resolution planning\nby the largest firms has reduced the threat that their failure would pose. These efforts have made\nU.S. banking firms both more robust and more resolvable.\nEvidence overwhelmingly shows that financial crises can cause severe and lasting\ndamage to the economy’s productive capacity and growth potential. Post-crisis reforms to\nfinancial sector regulation and supervision have been designed to significantly reduce the\nlikelihood and severity of future financial crises. We have sought to accomplish this goal in\nsignificant part by reducing both the probability of failure of a large banking firm and the\nconsequences of such a failure were it to occur.\nAs I mentioned, we have substantially increased the capital, liquidity, and other\nprudential requirements for large banking firms. These measures are not free. Higher capital\nrequirements increase bank costs, and at least some of those costs will be passed along to bank\n1 These remarks are substantially similar to the testimony delivered at the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing,\n& Urban Affairs hearing titled “Fostering Economic Growth: Regulator Perspective” on June 22, 2017.\n\n- 3 -\ncustomers and shareholders. But in the longer term, stronger prudential requirements for large\nbanking firms will produce more sustainable credit availability and economic growth.\nOur objective should be to set capital and other prudential requirements for large banking\nfirms at a level that protects financial stability and maximizes long-term, through-the-cycle credit\navailability and economic growth. To accomplish that goal, it is essential that we protect the\ncore elements of these reforms for our most systemic firms in capital and liquidity, stress testing\nand resolution.\nWith that in mind, I will highlight five key areas of focus for regulatory reform. The first\nis simplification and recalibation of regulation of small and medium-sized banks. We are\nworking to build on the relief we have provided in the areas of call reports and exam cycles, by\ndeveloping a proposal to simplify the generally applicable capital framework that applies to\ncommunity banking organizations.\nThe second area is resolution plans. The Fed and the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation believe that it is worthwhile to consider extending the cycle for living will\nsubmissions from annual to once every two years, and focusing every other of these filings on\nkey topics of interest and material changes from the prior full plan submission. We are also\nconsidering other changes, as I discussed last week when testifying to Congress.\nThird, the Federal Reserve is reassessing whether the Volcker rule implementing\nregulation most efficiently achieves its policy objectives, and we look forward to working with\nthe other four Volcker rule agencies to find ways to improve that regulation. In our view, there\nis room for eliminating or relaxing aspects of the implementing regulation in ways that do not\nundermine the Volcker rule’s main policy goals.\n\n- 4 -\nFourth, we will continue to enhance the transparency of stress testing and the\nComprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR). We will soon seek public feedback\nconcerning possible forms of enhanced disclosure, including a range of indicative loss rates\npredicted by the Federal Reserve’s models for various loan and securities portfolios, and\ninformation about risk characteristics that contribute to the loss-estimate ranges. We will also\nprovide more detail on the qualitative aspects of stress testing in next week’s CCAR disclosure.\nFinally, the Federal Reserve is taking a fresh look at the enhanced supplementary\nleverage ratio. We believe that the leverage ratio is an important backstop to the risk-based\ncapital framework, but that it is important to get the relative calibrations of the leverage ratio and\nthe risk-based capital requirements right.\nU.S. banks today are as strong as any in the world. As we consider the progress that has\nbeen achieved in improving the resiliency and resolvability of our banking industry, it is\nimportant for us to look for ways to reduce unnecessary burden. We must also be vigilant\nagainst new risks that may develop. In all of our efforts, our goal is to establish a regulatory\nframework that helps ensure the resiliency of our financial system, the availability of credit,\neconomic growth, and financial market efficiency. We look forward to working with our fellow\nregulatory agencies and with Congress to achieve these important goals.\nAnd finally, I would also like to note that work continues to address the risks identified\nwith existing reference rates. Just last week, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee\n(ARRC) selected a new rate suitable for use with new derivative contracts. I am confident the\nbroad Treasuries repo rate, which the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has proposed\npublishing in cooperation with the Office of Financial Research, is based on a deep and actively\n\n- 5 -\ntraded market and will be highly robust. With this choice, the ARRC has taken another step in\naddressing the risks involved with the LIBOR.",

Powell\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\n2019 Federal Reserve System Community Development Research Conference:\n“Renewing the Promise of the Middle Class”\nWashington, D.C.\nMay 9, 2019\n\nIt is my pleasure to welcome all of you to the Federal Reserve System’s\n11th Community Development Research Conference, cosponsored by the community\ndevelopment offices of all 12 Federal Reserve Banks and the Board of Governors.\nThese biennial conferences are one manifestation of the Federal Reserve’s deep\ncommitment to supporting research that helps policymakers, community development\npractitioners, and researchers improve the economic well-being of families and\ncommunities. These gatherings also inform the Federal Reserve System’s work in\npromoting consumer protection and community development, and I would like to thank\nall of you for your contributions to this conference.\nThis year our conference focuses on pathways to the middle class. While there\nare many definitions of “middle class,” I think we can agree that achieving a basic level\nof economic security is fundamental. Surveys suggest that many Americans believe\nbeing middle class means having a secure job and the ability to save.1 In recent decades,\nincome growth for middle-income households has lagged behind that for high-income\nhouseholds.2 In addition, economic resources differ markedly by race, education,\noccupation, geography, and other factors. Those circumstances underscore a two-fold\nchallenge for our country: fostering the conditions that will help lower-income families\nreach the middle class, while ensuring that middle-class status still provides the basic\neconomic security that it has traditionally offered.\n1 See Pew Research Center (2016), “What Americans Say It Takes to Be Middle Class,” Fact Tank\n(Washington: PRC, May 6), https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/02/04/what-americans-say-it-\ntakes-to-be-middle-class.\n2 See Congressional Budget Office (2018), The Distribution of National Income, 2015 (Washington: CBO,\nNovember), https://www.cbo.gov/system/files?file=2018-11/54646-\nDistribution_of_Household_Income_2015_0.pdf.\n\n- 2 -\nThe conference organizers have sorted through the many research questions that\nwill be addressed today and tomorrow and have taken away three key observations that\nare fundamental to addressing the challenges related to the middle class.\nThe first observation is to note the long-term decline in relative income growth\nand upward economic mobility for those in the middle. According to a number of\nmeasures, income has grown more slowly for middle-class households since the 1970s\nthan for those with higher incomes, resulting in wider income inequality. The kind of\ngenerational improvements in living standards that were long the hallmark of the\nAmerican middle class have steadily diminished. In the 1950s, better than 80 percent of\nchildren born in middle-class households grew up to out-earn their parents, but more\nrecently only around half do. One factor in this decline is the increase in income\ninequality I just noted, and another is slower productivity growth. This conference will\ntouch on other possible reasons for this decline in upward mobility and relative income,\nsuch as changes in the prospects for career advancement that vary by occupation and\nlocation.\nThe second observation is the widening gap in economic status and prospects\nbetween those with a college degree and those without one. In the 1960s, well over\n90 percent of working-age men held a job, and there was very little difference in\nemployment between those with or without a college degree. While the share of college-\neducated working-age men with a job has fallen from more than 95 percent in 1967 to\naround 90 percent in 2017, it has plunged for others. Ninety-five percent of male high\nschool graduates were working in 1967, but only about 80 percent of them were working\nas of 2017. Among working-age men without a high school diploma, about 90 percent\n\n- 3 -\nhad a job in 1967 versus a bit more than 70 percent in 2017. For women of working age,\nthe trends are less clear, but those without a college degree are also less likely to work\ntoday. Research presented this morning will discuss some possible explanations for the\ndivergence in employment, income, and other economic prospects between college grads\nand others.\nThe third observation is that the prospect of moving up the economic ladder\ndepends on factors beyond effort and talent, including your family, the neighborhood you\ngrow up in, and the quality of the primary and secondary schools you attend. Your\nchances for attending college are much better if you are raised in a higher-income\nhousehold, and that advantage has increased substantially since the 1980s. Another\nfactor is geography. Some research indicates that economic prospects are better for those\nwho grow up in neighborhoods with less income inequality, less concentrated poverty,\nand better performing schools. Finally, across so many dimensions, we continue to see\ndisparities in economic outcomes by race and ethnicity.\nThese issues are crucial. Sound public policies can support families and\nbusinesses and help more Americans reach and remain in the middle class. I look\nforward to hearing about your discussions over the next two days, and thank you, again,\nfor your contributions.",

Powell\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nWest Virginia University College of Business and Economics\nDistinguished Speaker Series\nMorgantown, West Virginia\nMarch 28, 2017\n\nI am delighted to have this opportunity to speak at West Virginia University.\nThanks to Brian Cushing for inviting me here today.1\nGathered in this part of West Virginia, we are located in the Fifth Federal Reserve\nDistrict, which stretches down from here to South Carolina and east to the Atlantic Ocean\n(figure 1). More than 100 years ago, the organizers of the Federal Reserve System\ndivided the country into 12 of these Districts, each with its own Federal Reserve Bank.\nTogether, the Board of Governors in Washington and the 12 Reserve Banks are the key\nelements of the Federal Reserve System.\nToday I will discuss how the Federal Reserve came to have this unique structure.\nThe Fed’s organization reflects a long-standing desire in American history to ensure that\npower over our nation’s monetary policy and financial system is not concentrated in a\nfew hands, whether in Washington or in high finance or in any single group or\nconstituency. Rather, Americans have long desired that decisions about these matters be\ninfluenced by a diverse set of voices from all parts of the country and the economy. The\nstructure of the Federal Reserve was designed to achieve this broad representation and\npromote a stronger financial system to build resiliency against the sort of periodic\nfinancial crises that had repeatedly damaged the country in the 19th and early 20th\ncenturies. This structure was forged from compromise; the result of that compromise was\na vitally needed central bank whose decisions take into account a broad range of\nperspectives.\n1 My remarks today reflect my own views and not necessarily those of the Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nBefore the Federal Reserve\nThe question of how to structure our nation’s financial system arose in the early\nyears of the republic. In 1791, Congress created an institution known as the Bank of the\nUnited States, often considered a forerunner of the Federal Reserve. The Bank was\ncreated in part to assist the federal government in its financial transactions, a typical\nresponsibility of central banks at that time. It was also designed to help America’s\nfinancial system meet the needs of a growing economy--the same purpose behind the\nfounding of the Federal Reserve more than 100 years later. The most famous proponent\nof the Bank was Alexander Hamilton, who has recently achieved the central banker’s\ndream of being the subject of a hit Broadway musical (figure 2).\nCongress gave the Bank of the United States unique powers--its notes were\naccepted for making payments to the federal government and it was the only bank able to\nbranch across state lines (figure 3). The Bank could affect the ebb and flow of credit\naround the country.2 People in different regions of the country came to have distinct\nviews about the Bank. Borrowers in the western areas--in those times, the West meant\nplaces like Ohio--desired cheap and abundant loans but were also wary of lenders. These\nborrowers grew opposed to the power of the Bank in the credit market. Northern\nbusiness interests favored the Bank’s contribution to the country’s industrial\ndevelopment, but at times disagreed with actions taken by the Bank to constrain credit.\nSouthern agriculturalists viewed the Bank with suspicion but supported its occasional\n2 The Bank of the United States became a net creditor to state banks by holding the notes issued by those\nbanks. When it presented those notes for redemption, it could affect the funding position of state banks and\neffectively constrain credit in this manner.\n\n- 3 -\nactions to constrain credit to non-agricultural businesses.3 The Bank’s private ownership,\nintended to give it independence from government control, was a source of unpopularity.\nUltimately, these disagreements undermined the Bank’s political support. After 20 years,\nCongress chose not to renew the Bank’s charter. A second Bank of the United States met\na similar fate in 1836 when President Andrew Jackson vetoed a bill to extend its life\n(figure 4).\nThese two short-lived experiments illustrate a theme in American history--of\nAmericans from different regions holding distinct views about the structure and\ndevelopment of the financial system. People in the newer western parts of the country\nsaw themselves as starved of access to credit and viewed higher interest rates in their\nareas as reflecting the scarcity of funds. Regional interest rate differentials persisted until\naround the time of World War I and helped shape the attitudes of Americans living in\nwestern areas toward the nation’s financial system.4\nThese regional differences gave rise to a major political movement in the latter\npart of the 19th century, as western farm borrowers increasingly demanded a reform of\nthe U.S. monetary system. Their chief complaints included the high interest rates they\nfaced as well as the burdens placed on them by deflation that increased the real value of\ntheir debts. Indeed, the economy experienced 1 to 2 percent deflation annually in the\nyears leading up to the 1890s. The country’s currency was linked to gold, and deflation\nreflected the growing scarcity of gold relative to the amount of economic activity. The\n3 See John H. Wood (2005), A History of Central Banking in Great Britain and the United States (New\nYork: Cambridge University Press).\n4 See Lance E. Davis (1965), “The Investment Market, 1870-1914: The Evolution of a National Market,”\nJournal of Economic History, vol. 25 (September), pp. 355-93. Economic historians have debated the\nextent to which interest rate differentials reflected market segmentation and supply versus demand in each\nmarket. Other factors include higher risk premiums, reflecting higher expected default rates in some areas\nof the country, and varying levels of monopoly power.\n\n- 4 -\n“free silver” movement grew in response to these economic forces. Its most famous\nadvocate, William Jennings Bryan, the Democratic presidential nominee in 1896, sought\nan increase in the money supply--by the coining of silver in addition to gold--as a\nsolution to reversing this deflation (figure 5).5\nThe Founding of the Fed\nBy the beginning of the 20th century, the debate about monetary policy and the\nnation’s financial system had been going on for over a century. Increasingly, the\nshortcomings of the existing system were causing too much harm to ignore. Like a\ndrumbeat, the country experienced one serious financial crisis after another, with major\ncrises in 1839, 1857, 1873, 1893, and finally in 1907.6 These panics paralyzed the\nfinancial system and led to deep and extended contractions in the economy.\nThese episodes exposed the weakness of our 19th century financial system, which\nrepeatedly failed to supply the money and credit needed to meet the economy’s demands.\nThe financial system came under severe stress when the demand for liquidity surged.7 A\n5 For a sense of the regionalism of this debate, believe it or not, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz has been\ninterpreted as an allegory for 19th century regional monetary problems, though there is little evidence about\nthe intentions of its author, L. Frank Baum, in conveying this allegory. Dorothy was from Kansas, a farm\nstate, but after a cyclone, she found herself in a world dominated by gold, with a yellow brick road and the\nLand of Oz--the abbreviation for an ounce. The story has four witches--from the West, East, North, and\nSouth. Remember that the Wicked Witch of the West ultimately met her demise when she melted on\ncontact with water, a symbol for the end of a drought that contributed to the economic hardships of western\nfarmers. But the most powerful change was brought about by Dorothy’s shoes, which were originally\nowned by the Wicked Witch of the East. Importantly, these shoes were silver in the original book, not red\nas in the movie, symbolizing the power of bimetallism as a solution to western problems. See Hugh\nRockoff (1990), “The ‘Wizard of Oz’ as a Monetary Allegory,” Journal of Political Economy, vol. 98\n(August), pp. 739-60.\n6 See Andrew J. Jalil (2015), “A New History of Banking Panics in the United States, 1825-1929:\nConstruction and Implications,” American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics, vol. 7 (July), pp. 295-\n330.\n7 Contemporaries blamed these crises on the seasonality in demand for currency and credit related to\nplanting and harvesting of crops in the spring and fall. Modern scholars place more weight on other\nsources of financial tightness. Some point to poor harvests that depressed net exports, particularly failed\ncotton harvests. Net exports were an important source of increases in the money supply in this period. In\nthe context of the gold standard, poor money supply growth in the United States triggered certain\nexpectations by international capital market participants that interest rates in the United States would rise\n\n- 5 -\nfinancial system strained in such a manner is like dry kindling in danger of being exposed\nto a spark. That spark could come from losses at a well-known bank, from a\ndisappointing harvest, or from mere rumors. In response, depositors or other investors\nwould seek the return of their funds, which would force financial institutions to sell assets\nquickly to generate the necessary cash (figure 6). That liquidation could lead banks to cut\ncredit and force borrowers to repay debt sooner than expected.\nSimply put, the monetary system did not meet the country’s needs. It was a\nsystem in crisis, boiling over repeatedly, harming the country.\nCentral banks are designed in part to help the financial system meet occasional\nliquidity strains. When demands for liquidity rise, central banks can respond by\nincreasing the supply of money and thus adding liquidity to the system. Central banks\nhave a particularly important role in avoiding or mitigating extreme demands for liquidity\nduring financial crises. They do this by making loans to solvent financial institutions so\nthey can meet their liquidity demands and avoid forced sales of their assets. These ideas\nabout central banks’ lending role were developed over the course of the 19th century but\nnot yet implemented in the United States, which at the time remained without a central\nbank.8 By the beginning of the 20th century, the United States was behind the game.\nrelative to the rest of the world. As a result, interest rates on American commercial paper (a key rate\naffected by international financial conditions) rose following poor harvests, stock and bond prices fell, and\ndeposits flowed out of the New York banking system. Industrial production decreased as well, with a lag.\nThis set of effects created tight financial conditions of the sort that could lead to financial crises. (See\nChristopher Hanes and Paul W. Rhode (2013), “Harvests and Financial Crises in Gold Standard America,”\nJournal of Economic History, vol. 73 (March), pp. 201-46.) Other scholars focus on business cycle\ndownturns as creating conditions favorable to financial crises, as depositors viewed the downturns as\naffecting the solvency prospects of their banks, leading to withdrawals and panics. (See Gary Gorton\n(1988), “Banking Panics and Business Cycles,” Oxford Economic Papers, vol. 40 (December), pp. 751-81.)\n8 See Walter Bagehot ([1873] 1897), Lombard Street: A Description of the Money Market (New York:\nCharles Scribner’s Sons).\n\n- 6 -\nThe final catalyst leading to the creation of the Federal Reserve was the severe\nPanic of 1907, which caused inflation-adjusted gross national product to decline by 12\npercent, more than two times the decline recorded during the Great Recession of 2007 to\n2009.9 After the panic ended, there was a broad sense that reform was needed, although\nconsensus on the exact nature of that reform was elusive. Some called for an institution\nsimilar in structure to the Bank of England at the time, with centralized power, owned\nand operated by the banking system. Some wanted control to be lodged with the federal\ngovernment in Washington instead. Others proposed that power be distributed to\nregional bodies with no central or coordinating board. Still others resisted any sort of\ncentral bank.10 This debate reflected the many and diverse interests in the United States--\nfarmers, laborers, businessmen, small-town bankers, big-city bankers, technocrats,\npopulists, and more--that experienced different conditions across a large geographic\nexpanse.\nThe resulting institution was a compromise, created by the Federal Reserve Act in\n1913. The Federal Reserve was not structured to be entirely private in its ownership and\noperation. It was also not structured to have a single headquarters in Washington or New\nYork with branches across the country, a structure that was proposed but failed to attract\nenough political support. Instead, a more federated system was created, establishing the\nFederal Reserve Board in Washington and the 12 Reserve Banks located around the\ncountry.\n9 See Nathan S. Balke and Robert J. Gordon (1989), “Appendix B: Historical Data,” in Robert J. Gordon,\ned., The American Business Cycle: Continuity and Change (Chicago: University of Chicago Press), pp.\n781-850. See also Jon R.

Tallman (2015), “The Panic of 1907,” Federal Reserve\nHistory, www.federalreservehistory.org/Events/DetailView/97.\n10 See Roger Lowenstein (2015), America’s Bank: The Epic Struggle to Create the Federal Reserve (New\nYork: Penguin Press); and Allan H. Meltzer (2003), A History of the Federal Reserve, Volume 1: 1913-\n1951 (Chicago: University of Chicago Press).\n\n- 7 -\nThe Board was the part of the System intended to be most directly accountable to\nthe public (figure 7). The Board is an independent agency within the federal government,\nand members of the Board--now called Governors--are appointed by the President and\nconfirmed by the Senate.11 Governors serve 14 year terms that expire at 2-year intervals\nand are not linked to election cycles. The Federal Reserve Board is charged with general\noversight of the Reserve Banks.\nThe Reserve Banks combine both public and private elements in their makeup and\norganization (figure 8). Like the Board of Governors, the Reserve Banks operate with the\npublic interest in mind. Commercial banks that are members of the Federal Reserve\nSystem are required to purchase stock in their District’s Reserve Bank.12 These shares\nare nontransferable and yield only limited powers and benefits. Dividends are set by\nfederal law. The commercial bank shareholders elect two-thirds of the directors that\noversee the Reserve Banks; the Board in Washington appoints the remaining one-third.\nOnly three bankers can serve on a Reserve Bank’s board of directors, and only one of\nthose can be from a large commercial bank in the District. The remaining six directors\nrepresent the interests of the public. The Federal Reserve System benefits enormously\nfrom the insights and support of the boards of directors of the Reserve Banks and their\n11 As originally enacted, Section 10 of the Federal Reserve Act required that the President, in nominating\nBoard members, “have due regard to a fair representation of the different commercial, industrial and\ngeographical divisions of the country” (see Federal Reserve Act, ch. 6, § 10, 38 Stat. 260 (1913), p. 12,\nwww.federalreservehistory.org/Media/Material/Event/10-58). In 1922, this representational requirement\nwas expanded to its current form, which provides, in Section 10(1), that the President “have due regard to a\nfair representation of the financial, agricultural, industrial, and commercial interests, and geographical\ndivisions of the country” (see Federal Reserve Act, 12 U.S.C. § 241 as amended by an act of June 3, 1922\n(42 Stat. 620), paragraph on appointment and qualification of members,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/section%2010.htm). In addition, Section 10(1) provides that\nno two members of the Board may be from the same Reserve Bank District.\n12 All national banks chartered by the Comptroller of the Currency are required to be members of the\nFederal Reserve System, and state-chartered banks may choose to become members.\n\n- 8 -\nBranches. Directors include prominent private-sector leaders who represent a wide and\ngrowing diversity of backgrounds and views about the economy.13\nThe federated structure of the Federal Reserve System earned the endorsement of\neven the populist hero of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, William Jennings Bryan.\nThe compromise created an institution that could address the shortcomings of the\nAmerican financial system while assuring that control of the Federal Reserve would be\nshared widely.14 The structure was different from those of the first and second Banks of\nthe United States, and from those of foreign central banks at the time. Congressman\nCarter Glass, who worked to win passage of the Federal Reserve Act in Congress, called\nthe Federal Reserve’s uniquely American design “an adventure in constructive finance”\n(figure 9).15\nThe Modern Federal Reserve\nIn the System’s early years, the decentralized structure gave the Reserve Banks\nconsiderable scope to make independent decisions that applied to their own Districts,\nwhich made it difficult to effect policy. For example, one Bank’s purchases of securities\ncould be offset by another Bank’s sale, given that the market for securities was national\n13 Directors are chosen, according to Sections 4(11) and 4(12) of the Federal Reserve Act, “with due but not\nexclusive consideration to the interests of agriculture, commerce, industry, services, labor and consumers”\n(see Federal Reserve Act, 12 U.S.C. § 302 as amended by an act of Nov. 16, 1977 (91 Stat. 1388),\nparagraphs on class B and class C directors, https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/section4.htm).\n14 Authors Jeremy Atack and Peter Passell write, “Throughout much of American history there has been a\ndeep and abiding mistrust of bankers and a widespread fear of a ‘money monopoly’--a fear that those\nneeding to borrow would be taken advantage of by those able to lend. Such questions had figured\nprominently in the debates over the fates of the First Bank and Second Bank of the United States, and they\nplayed a role in the popular support of free banking legislation. They had also led to the almost universal\nadoption of usury ceilings on interest rates (typically 6 percent) that were more honored in name than\nreality. These concerns were the subject of congressional inquiries, the most famous of which were the\nPujo hearings into the Money Trust in the wake of the 1907 panic.” See Jeremy Atack and Peter Passell\n(1994), A New Economic View of American History: From Colonial Times to 1940, 2nd ed. (New York:\nNorton), p. 510. See also Milton Friedman and Anna Jacobson Schwartz (1963), A Monetary History of the\nUnited States, 1867-1960 (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press), p. 48.\n15 See Carter Glass (1927), An Adventure in Constructive Finance (Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday, Page).\n\n- 9 -\nin scope. As a result, the Reserve Banks created a committee to coordinate these “open\nmarket operations.” But in these years, the Reserve Banks were not bound by that\ncommittee’s decisions and could derail any attempt at coordinated action.\nThis decentralization was thought by some to have undermined the Federal\nReserve’s response to the Great Depression.16 With that experience in mind, the 1935\nBanking Act modified the distribution of power within the Federal Reserve System,\ngiving the Board of Governors 7 of the 12 seats on the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC) (figure 10).17 The other 5 seats are held by the Reserve Banks. The Federal\nReserve Bank of New York has a permanent seat, and the other Reserve Banks share the\nremaining 4 seats on a rotating basis.18 While FOMC members are free to dissent from\nthe majority decision about open market operations, the Reserve Banks are nevertheless\nrequired to adhere to that decision in conducting open market operations.\nThe structure set out in 1935 has been essentially unchanged to this day and has\nserved the country well. As intended by the framers, the federal nature of the system has\nensured a diversity of views and promotes a healthy debate over policy. My strong view\nis that this institutionalized diversity of thinking is a strength of our System. In my\nexperience, the best outcomes are reached when opposing viewpoints are clearly and\nstrongly presented before decisions are made.\n16 For a discussion of these issues, see David C. Wheelock (2000), “National Monetary Policy by Regional\nDesign: The Evolving Role of the Federal Reserve Banks in Federal Reserve System Policy,” in Jürgen\nvon Hagen and Christopher J. Waller, eds., Regional Aspects of Monetary Policy in Europe (Boston:\nKluwer Academic), pp. 241-74.\n17 The FOMC was created by the Banking Act of 1933 but was restructured in 1935 to include members of\nthe Board of Governors.\n18 The Federal Reserve Bank of New York was made a permanent member of the FOMC in 1942. From\n1935 to 1942, it alternated annually with the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston as a member.\n\n- 10 -\nMembers of the Board of Governors and Presidents of the Reserve Banks arrive at\ntheir own independent viewpoints about the economy and the appropriate path for\nmonetary policy. Congress has assigned the FOMC the task of achieving stable prices\nand maximum employment; however, policymakers may disagree on the best way to\nachieve those goals.19 The System’s structure encourages exploration of a diverse range\nof views and promotes a healthy policy debate.20 In the modern Federal Reserve System,\neach Reserve Bank has an independent research department, with its own external\npublications. In addition, while the members of the Board tend to focus on developments\nin the nation as a whole, the Reserve Bank Presidents bring specialized information about\ntheir regional economies to the FOMC discussion. Before each FOMC meeting, Reserve\nBank Presidents consult with their staff of economists as well as their boards of directors,\nbusiness contacts in their Districts, and market experts to develop their independent\nviews of appropriate monetary policy.\nThe FOMC works to achieve a consensus policy by blending inputs from the\nmembers of the Board of Governors and from the Reserve Bank Presidents under the\nleadership of its Chair. By tradition, the Chair of the Board has been chosen as the Chair\nof the FOMC and has had a central role in setting the agenda for the FOMC and\ndeveloping consensus among the Committee’s members. In addition, the Chair is the\nmost visible public face of the Federal Reserve System.\n19 For a discussion of the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate, see the FOMC’s Statement on Longer-Run\nGoals and Monetary Policy Strategy, which the Committee first issued in January 2012 and reaffirms\nannually, in note 26. In addition, for a discussion of how the FOMC prepares for its meetings, see\nElizabeth A. Duke (2010), “Come with Me to the FOMC,” speech delivered at the Money Marketeers of\nNew York University, New York, October 19,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/duke20101019a.htm.\n20 For a discussion of these issues, see Marvin Goodfriend (1999), “The Role of a Regional Bank in a\nSystem of Central Banks,” Carnegie-Rochester Conference Series on Public Policy, vol. 51 (December),\npp. 51-71.\n\n- 11 -\nThe Fed is accountable to Congress and the public for its activities and decisions.\nHistorically, the activities of central banks were shrouded in mystery. Montagu Norman,\nthe famously secretive Governor of the Bank of England from 1920 to 1944, reportedly\ntook as his personal motto, “Never explain, never excuse” (figure 11).21\nIn the modern era, all that has changed, as central banks have come to see\ntransparency both as a requirement of democratic accountability and as a way of\nsupporting the efficacy of their policies. Over recent decades the Fed has significantly\naugmented its public communications, as have other major central banks. The Chair\ntestifies before Congress twice each year about the U.S. economy and the FOMC’s\nmonetary policy in pursuit of its statutory goals of stable prices and maximum\nemployment (figure 12).22 The Federal Reserve Board prepares a Monetary Policy\nReport to accompany that testimony.23 The Chair also holds press conferences after four\nFOMC meetings each year. The FOMC releases statements after its meetings that\nexplain the economic outlook and the rationale for its policy decision. Detailed minutes\nof the Committee’s meetings are published three weeks later.24 Since 2007, FOMC\nparticipants have submitted quarterly macroeconomic projections that are published in\nthe Summary of Economic Projections.25 In 2012, the FOMC issued a Statement on\n21 Ben Bernanke, former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, referenced the motto in a 2007 speech.\nSee Ben S. Bernanke (2007), “Federal Reserve Communications,” speech delivered at the Cato Institute\n25th Annual Monetary Conference, Washington, November 14,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20071114a.htm.\n22 The statutory mandate was added in the Federal Reserve Reform Act of 1977.\n23 The Monetary Policy Report is available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/mpr_default.htm.\n24 FOMC statements and the minutes of FOMC meetings are available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.\n25 Since 2012, the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) has included each individual FOMC\nparticipant’s assessment of appropriate monetary policy in the form of an interest rate “dot plot.” The SEP\nis available on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.\n\n- 12 -\nLonger-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, which is reaffirmed every January.\nThis statement discusses the Committee’s interpretation of its statutory goals of\nmaximum employment and price stability; it indicates that the Committee judges\ninflation of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal\nconsumption expenditures, to be most consistent over the longer run with the Federal\nReserve’s statutory mandate.26 Transcripts of FOMC meetings are released to the public\nafter a delay of about five years.\nFederal Reserve Board Governors and Reserve Bank Presidents contribute to the\nFederal Reserve’s transparency with frequent public speeches and other communications.\nI believe that support for the Federal Reserve as a public institution is sustained by the\npublic expression of our diverse views.27\nThese communications with Congress and the public are critical parts of the\nFederal Reserve’s institutional accountability and transparency, and are essential\ncomplements to its independence. It is important that Federal Reserve officials regularly\ndemonstrate that the Fed has been appropriately pursuing its mandated goals.\nTransparency can also make monetary policy more effective by helping to guide the\npublic’s expectations and clarify the Committee’s policy intentions.\n26 The most recent statement is available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomc_longerrungoals.pdf.\n27 See Jon Faust (1996), “Whom Can We Trust to Run the Fed? Theoretical Support for the Founders’\nViews,” Journal of Monetary Economics, vol. 37 (April), pp. 267-83; Jon Faust (2016), “Oh, What a\nTangled Web We Weave: Monetary Policy Transparency in Divisive Times,” Hutchins Center Working\nPaper 25 (Washington: Brookings Institution, November), https://www.brookings.edu/research/oh-what-a-\ntangled-web-we-weave-monetary-policy-transparency-in-divisive-times; and Jerome H.

The 2010 Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act\nprovided that directors representing financial institutions--the class A directors, of which\nthere are three on each Reserve Bank board--may not participate in the appointment of\nReserve Bank presidents and first vice presidents. The Federal Reserve Board has long\nhad policies preventing Reserve Bank directors from participating in supervisory matters\nor in determining the appointment of any Reserve Bank officer whose primary duties\ninvolve supervisory matters. These directors continue to provide highly valuable\ninformation about developments in their markets, and take part fully in other roles with\nthe other six directors.\nAnother aspect of governance involves the better representation of women and\nminorities in the Federal Reserve System. Indeed, while I have focused my remarks on\nthe history of geographical diversity in the Federal Reserve System, we also strive to\nhave diversity in gender and race both at the Board and at the Reserve Banks. In recent\nyears, the Reserve Banks’ boards of directors have made significant progress along these\nlines. Women now account for 34 percent of the directors, up from 24 percent five years\nago. In addition, minorities now account for 29 percent of directors, up from 19 percent\nfive years ago.\nConclusion\nThe long history of political discourse in the United States helps explain the\nFederal Reserve’s unique structure, in which the Board of Governors in Washington and\nthe 12 regional Reserve Banks share power over monetary policy (as shown in figure 1).\n\n- 14 -\nThroughout our history, Americans have questioned the structure and even, at times, the\nneed for a central bank. Current discussions of Fed reforms echo these past debates. But\nit is important to understand that history in both advanced and emerging economies\nacross the world has consistently demonstrated the need for a central bank, and both the\nexistence and the structure of the Federal Reserve are products of that historical\nexperience. Our structure is fundamentally a compromise, shaped by American history\nstretching back to the first Bank of the United States and, later, by the lessons of the\nGreat Depression. It is designed to deliver the United States a vitally needed central bank\nin a country that has had a long-standing aversion to centralized power over monetary\nand financial affairs. It preserves diverse regional voices while ensuring that policy can\nbe implemented through a cooperative consensus. The balance between national and\nregional interests is critical to the spirit of the original compromise that created the\nFederal Reserve, and to its democratic legitimacy. The structure achieves a practical\nbalance that should not be changed lightly, as it continues to serve the country well.\n\nAmerica’s Central Bank: The History and\nStructure of the Federal Reserve\nJerome H.

    "text": "For release on delivery\n2:15 p.m. EDT\nJune 23, 2017\nCentral Clearing and Liquidity\nRemarks by\nJerome H. Powell\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago Symposium on Central Clearing\nChicago, Illinois\nJune 23, 2017\n\nThank you for inviting me to speak today.1 The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and\nDarrell Duffie have provided a valuable public service in hosting this annual symposium on\ncentral clearing. I will start my remarks by taking stock of the progress made in strengthening\ncentral counterparties (or CCPs), and then offer some thoughts on central clearing and liquidity\nrisks.\nThe huge losses suffered by the American International Group (AIG) on its over-the-\ncounter derivatives positions contributed to the financial crisis and highlighted the risks in\nderivatives markets. In response, the Group of Twenty nations committed in 2009 to moving\nstandardized derivatives to central clearing. Central clearing serves to address many of the\nweaknesses exposed during the crisis by fostering a reduction in risk exposures through\nmultilateral netting and daily margin requirements as well as greater transparency through\nenhanced reporting requirements. Central clearing also enables a reduction in the potential cost\nof counterparty default by facilitating the orderly liquidation of a defaulting member's positions,\nand the sharing of risk among members of the CCP through some mutualization of the costs of\nsuch a default.\nBut central clearing will only make the financial system safer if CCPs themselves are run\nsafely. Efforts to set heightened expectations for CCPs and other financial market infrastructures\nhave been ongoing for years, with the regulatory community working collectively to clarify and\nsignificantly raise expectations. These efforts resulted in the Principles for Financial Market\nInfrastructures (or PFMI), which was published in 2012 by the Committee on Payments and\nMarket Infrastructures (CPMI) and the International Organization of Securities Commissions\n1 The views I express here are my own and not necessarily those of others at the Federal Reserve.\n1\n\n(IOSCO). The PFMI lays out comprehensive expectations for CCPs and other financial market\ninfrastructures.\nRecent Accomplishments\nExtensive work has been done to implement the PFMI.2 The joint CCP work plan agreed\nto in 2015 by the Financial Stability Board (or FSB), CPMI, IOSCO, and the Basel Committee\non Banking Supervision (or BCBS) laid out an ambitious program to provide further guidance on\nthe PFMI and better understand interdependencies between CCPs and their members.3\nCPMI and IOSCO will soon publish more granular guidance on CCP resilience, focusing\non governance, stress testing credit and liquidity risk, margin, and recovery planning. While this\nguidance will not establish new standards beyond those set out in the PFMI, I believe that it will\nencourage CCPs and their regulators to engage in thoughtful dialogue on how they could further\nenhance their practices.\nThe FSB has led the work on resolution planning for CCPs, publishing draft guidance\nthis past February. The guidance covers a range of topics, including the powers that resolution\n2 In 2013, CPMI-IOSCO launched a multi-level, multi-year monitoring program to evaluate how the principles and\nresponsibilities in the PFMI are being implemented around the world. Several different assessments have been\ncompleted to date and the findings have provided important insight on both the progress and methods by which\nauthorities and CCPs have sought to implement the PFMI. In 2014, CPMI-IOSCO published supplemental\nguidance and a menu of recovery tools to help financial market infrastructures, including CCPs, meet the\nexpectations in the PFMI that all financial market infrastructures have a comprehensive and effective recovery plan.\n3 While the work done in the context of the joint work plan represents significant regulatory efforts related to CCPs,\nprogress is also being made on a parallel path. In particular, it is important to highlight the adoption and\nimplementation of the SEC’s Covered Clearing Agency Standards, which further strengthens the risk management\nstandards that clearing agencies registered with the SEC must meet. In addition, the SEC and the industry have been\nworking jointly to shorten the settlement cycle to two days for many securities products, culminating in the SEC’s\nadoption of amendments to Rule 15c6-1(a) earlier this year.\n2\n\nauthorities need in order to effectively resolve a CCP, the potential incentives related to using\nvarious loss-allocation tools in resolution, the application of the “no creditor worse off”\nsafeguard, and the formation of crisis management groups--a key step in facilitating cross-border\nregulatory coordination in the event of a failure of a systemically important CCP.\nEnsuring the safety of the system also requires an understanding of the interdependencies\nbetween CCPs and their clearing members. Work on this is ongoing. Preliminary analysis\nconfirms that there are large interdependencies between banks and CCPs, including common\nexposures related to financial resources held to cover market and credit risk, as well as common\nlending and funding arrangements.\nHaving pushed for the move to greater central clearing, global authorities have a\nresponsibility to ensure that CCPs do not themselves become a point of failure for the system.\nThe progress I have just described is helping to meet this responsibility by making central\nclearing safer and more robust. Global authorities also have a responsibility to ensure that bank\ncapital standards and other policies do not unnecessarily discourage central clearing. In my\nview, the calibration of the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) for the U.S. global\nsystemically important banks (G-SIBs) should be reconsidered from this perspective. A risk-\ninsensitive leverage ratio can be a useful backstop to risk-based capital requirements. But such a\nratio can have perverse incentives if it is the binding capital requirement because it treats\nrelatively safe activities, such as central clearing, as equivalent to the most risky activities. There\nare several potential approaches to addressing this issue. For example, the BCBS is currently\nconsidering a proposal that would set a G-SIB’s SLR surcharge at a level that is proportional to\nthe G-SIB’s risk-based capital surcharge. Taking this approach in the U.S. context could help to\nreduce the cost that the largest banks face in offering clearing services to their customers.\n3\n\nThe Federal Reserve is also considering other steps. First, we are developing an\ninterpretation of our rules in connection with the movement of some centrally cleared derivatives\nto a “settled-to-market” approach. Under this approach, daily variation margin is treated as a\nsettlement payment rather than as posting collateral. Under our capital rules, this approach\nreduces the need for a bank to hold capital against these exposures under risk-based and\nsupplementary leverage ratios. Second, we are also working to move from the “current exposure\nmethod” of assessing counterparty credit risk on derivative exposures to the standardized\napproach for counterparty credit risk (SA-CCR). The current exposure method generally treats\npotential future credit exposures on derivatives as a fixed percentage of the notional amount,\nwhich ignores whether a derivative is margined and undervalues netting benefits. SA-CCR is a\nmore risk-sensitive measurement of exposure, which would appropriately recognize the\ncounterparty risks on derivatives, including the lower risks on most centrally cleared derivatives.\nCentral Clearing and Liquidity\nCCPs are different from most other financial intermediaries in the sense that the CCP\nstands between two parties to a cleared transaction whose payment obligations exactly offset\neach other. A CCP faces market or credit risk only in the event that one of its members defaults\nand its required initial margin or other pre-funded financial resources are insufficient to cover\nany adverse price swings that occur during the period between the time of default and the time\nthat the CCP is able to liquidate the defaulting party’s positions.\nHowever, like most other financial intermediaries, CCPs do face liquidity risks. Their\nbusiness model is based on timely payments and the ability to quickly convert either the\n4\n\nunderlying assets being cleared or non-cash collateral into cash. For this reason, CCPs should\ncarefully consider liquidity when launching new products and only offer clearing of products that\ncan be sold quickly, even in times of stress. Liquidity problems can occur in central clearing\neven if all counterparties have the financial resources to meet their obligations, if they are unable\nto convert those resources into cash quickly enough. The amount of liquidity risk that CCPs face\ncan sometimes dwarf the amount of credit or market risk they face. This is particularly true for\nthe clearing of cash securities such as Treasuries. In that case, the securities being cleared are\nextremely safe and likely to rise in value in times of stress. But in contrast to most cleared\nderivatives, the cash payments involved are very large because counterparties exchange cash for\nthe delivery of the security on a gross basis.\nI will look at these risks from two perspectives, first in terms of the payments that CCPs\nmust make, and then in terms of the payments they expect to receive.\nPayment Flows from CCPs\nIn the case of a member’s default, a CCP must be equipped to make the cash payments\nowed to non-defaulting counterparties when due. This requirement can be met as long as there is\nsufficient margin, mutualized resources such as the guarantee fund, or the CCP’s own resources\nheld in cash and in the required currency. But if those funds are held in securities, then the CCP\nwill need to convert them to cash, either by entering into a repurchase agreement, or using them\nas collateral to draw on a line of credit. And if the CCP holds either cash or securities\ndenominated in a currency different from the one in which payment must be made, it will need to\neither engage in a spot FX transaction or in an FX swap.\n5\n\nPrinciple seven of the PFMI addresses these liquidity risks, calling for all CCPs to meet a\n“Cover 1 standard”--that is, to hold enough liquid resources in all relevant currencies to make\npayments on time in the event of the default of the clearing member that would generate the\nlargest payment obligation under a wide range of potential stress scenarios. More complex CCPs\nand those with a systemic presence in multiple jurisdictions are encouraged to meet a “Cover 2\nstandard.” The PFMI also provide guidance on the resources that qualify in meeting these\nrequirements: cash held at a central bank or a creditworthy commercial bank, committed lines of\ncredit, committed repurchase agreements, committed FX swap agreements, or highly marketable\ncollateral that can be converted into cash under prearranged and highly reliable funding\narrangements.\nThere are two sets of risks involved here. First, where should CCPs put their cash? As\ncentral clearing has expanded, CCPs have had to deal with increasingly large amounts of cash\nmargin. CCPs can deposit some of these funds with commercial banks. But regulatory changes\nhave made it more expensive for banks to take large deposits from other financial firms, and in\nsome cases banks may be unwilling to accept more cash from a CCP. And many of the largest\nbanks are also clearing members, which introduces a certain amount of wrong-way risk. A\nclearing-member default could be especially fraught if the defaulting bank also held large cash\nbalances for the CCP. For this reason, CCPs may prudently place limits on the amount deposited\nat a given institution. In order to diversify their holdings, many also place cash in the repo\nmarket. If it is available, the ability to deposit cash at a central bank allows for another safe,\nflexible, and potentially attractive option--a subject I will return to later.\nSecond, how can CCPs be assured that they will be able to convert securities into cash or\ndraw on other resources in times of stress? The PFMI uses the words “committed” and “pre-\n6\n\narranged” in describing qualifying liquid resources. Indeed, the PFMI does not view spot\ntransactions on the open market as reliable sources of liquidity during times of stress. The\nFederal Reserve has strongly supported this approach. Liquidity plans should not take for\ngranted that, at a time of stress involving a member default, lines of credit, repurchase\nagreements, or FX swaps could be arranged on the spot. Committed sources of liquidity are\nmore likely to be available. They also allow market participants and regulators to make sure that\nplans are mutually consistent. If a CCP has arranged for a committed liquidity source, then the\nprovider should account for it in its own plans and demonstrate that it can meet its commitment.\nOf course, this liquidity is not free, nor should it be. Regulatory changes have forced\nbanks to closely examine their liquidity planning and to internalize the costs of liquidity\nprovision. The costs of committed liquidity facilities will be passed on to clearing members.\nThese costs are perhaps highest in clearing Treasury securities, where liquidity needs can be\nespecially large. To meet its estimated needs, DTCC’s Fixed Income Clearing Corporation\n(FICC) is planning to institute a committed repo arrangement with its clearing members. Despite\ninitial concerns, the industry seems prepared to absorb these costs, but they will not be trivial for\nmany members.4\nPayment Flows to CCPs\nWhile initial and variation margin help mitigate credit risk in central clearing, they can\nalso create liquidity risk. Clearing members and their clients are required to make margin\npayments to CCPs on a daily basis, and in times of market volatility these payments may rise\n4 “Treasury repos may hit 20bp under DTCC liquidity plan,” Risk.net, November 25, 2015,\nwww.risk.net/derivatives/2435384/treasury-repos-may-hit-20bp-under-dtcc-liquidity-plan.\n7\n\ndramatically. This source of liquidity risk can occur even in the absence of a default. For\nexample, after the UK referendum on Brexit, the resulting price swings triggered many CCPs to\nmake substantial intraday and end-of-day margin calls. Fortunately, members had prepared and\nwere able to make the needed payments, but the sums involved caught many off guard and the\nexperience served as a useful warning.\nAccording to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the top\nfive CCPs requested $27 billion in additional margin over the two days following the\nreferendum, about five times the average amount.5 In most cases, clearing members have an\nhour to meet intraday margin calls. Clearing members have no choice but to hold enough liquid\nresources to meet the range of possible margin calls, as the consequences of missing a margin\ncall are considerable.\nBrexit was only the most recent example in which margin calls were unexpectedly large.\nMargin calls were also quite large after the stock market crash of October 1987. That episode\nhelps to demonstrate how complicated payments flows can be and why liquidity risk also needs\nto be viewed from a macroprudential perspective, considering potential risks to flows across the\nsystem. After falling about 9 percent the week before, on October 19, 1987, the S&P 500 stock\nmarket index fell about 20 percent. Margin calls were about 10 times their normal size, and\ncaused a very complicated set of payment flows across multiple exchanges, CCPs, and banks.6\n5 “Derivatives traders forced to provide $27bn collateral post-Brexit,” Financial Times, November 16, 2016,\nwww.ft.com/content/6afdfd26-ac57-11e6-9cb3-bb8207902122.\n6 Cash equities were traded in New York on the New York Stock Exchange, equity futures were traded and cleared\nin Chicago by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while stock options were traded on the Chicago Board Options\nExchange and cleared by the Options Clearing Corporation.\n8\n\nThe next slide helps to represent the ensuing payment flows.7 Calls requesting payment\nare on the left in red. When making a margin call, a CCP requests payment from its clearing\nmembers. Clearing members in turn request margin payments from the customers for whom\nthey are clearing, and those customers must then direct their bank to make the payment. If\neverything works as it should, payments (in green, on the right) will ensue. The customer’s bank\nwill deliver the requested payment to the clearing member’s bank (or payment bank). The\npayment bank will then deliver the funds to a settlement bank used by the CCP, and the\nsettlement bank will then credit the funds to the CCP. In theory, each of these payments would\nhave to happen sequentially, but often parties offer intraday credit (represented by the dashed\norange lines) to help smooth these flows. For example, the settlement bank may provide\nintraday credit to the clearing member, sending funds to the CCP before the member has\ndelivered funds to the payment bank or before those funds have been transferred to the\nsettlement bank. Clearing members or the customer’s bank may also provide intraday credit to\ntheir customers, again making payments before funds have been received in order to help speed\nthe payments chain.\nOver the course of October 19, 1987, the system worked largely as I have just described.\nBut on October 20, every single link in these payments and credit chains was interrupted. This is\nrepresented graphically in the next slide. By that morning, many settlement banks and clearing\nmembers had yet to receive offsetting payments for credit that had been extended the previous\nday. Goldman Sachs and Kidder, Peabody had together extended $1.5 billion in credit that had\nnot yet been paid.8 As a result, some firms pulled back on providing further credit, which then\n7 This figure is an adaptation from one presented in Andrew Brimmer (1989), “Central Banking and Systemic Risks\nin Capital Markets,” Journal of Economic Perspectives, Spring, 3–16.\n8 “The Day the Nation’s Cash Pipeline Almost Ran Dry,” The New York Times, October 2, 1988,\nwww.nytimes.com/1988/10/02/business/the-day-the-nation-s-cash-pipeline-almost-ran-dry.html.\n9\n\nforced each link of the payments chain to operate sequentially. Payments slowed, with the\nunintended consequence that uncovered positions grew larger and stayed open for even longer.\nWithout credit, some customers were unable to meet their margin calls and were forced to\nliquidate their positions. This gridlock sparked fears that a clearing member or even a CCP\nwould be forced to default. The Federal Reserve reacted to this threat by encouraging banks to\ncontinue to extend credit and by injecting funds into the system to help ensure that credit was\navailable. The 1987 stock market crash did not leave much lasting impact on the economy, but if\nthese liquidity problems had been allowed to cause the default of a major clearing member or\neven a CCP then it could have had a much more serious impact. While this might seem like\nsimply an interesting bit of history, the payments chains involved in central clearing are still very\nsimilar today. To guard against the same sorts of liquidity risk today, we need to make sure that\nevery link in these chains will work as it is intended to under stress.\nWhile neither Brexit nor the October 1987 crash involved a clearing member default,\nthese incidents do point to the potential complications of such a default. I have already discussed\nthe steps that a CCP might need to take in the event of a default to meet its liquidity needs.\nSome of those needs, such as committed lines of credit or repo agreements, could involve\ntapping financial resources at the same banks that are clearing members. Thus, clearing\nmembers may need to juggle several different liquidity exposures simultaneously in the event of\na default. They may face draws on committed sources of liquidity, and if there are market\nstresses around the default, which seems a near certainty, they may at the same time face a\n10\n\nsudden increase in intraday margin calls and their own internal demands for more liquid\nresources.9 These are risks that we should seek to understand better.\nPolicy Implications\nThe Federal Reserve is the primary supervisory authority for two designated financial\nmarket utilities (or DFMUs), and plays a secondary role relative to the six other DFMUs. As a\ncentral bank, we are particularly concerned with liquidity issues.10 I will address four policy\nissues that need careful consideration as the public sector and market participants continue to\naddress liquidity risks in central clearing.\nStress Testing\nThe 1987 stock market crash showed that we need to look at liquidity risks from a\nsystemwide perspective. That event involved multiple CCPs and also involved multiple links in\nthe payments chains between banks and CCPs. Conducting supervisory stress tests on CCPs that\ntake liquidity risks into account would help authorities better assess the resilience of the financial\nsystem. A stress test focused on cross-CCP liquidity risks could help to identify assumptions\n9 Regulatory changes since the financial crisis have encouraged banks to hold much greater amounts of high-quality\nliquid assets, which would help them in meeting such liquidity demands.\n10 Section 804 of the Dodd-Frank Act requires the Financial Stability Oversight Council to designate those financial\nmarket utilities that the council determines are, or are likely to become, systemically important. Eight utilities have\nbeen designated: The Clearing House Payments Company, L.L.C.; CLS Bank International; Chicago Mercantile\nExchange, Inc.; The Depository Trust Company; Fixed Income Clearing Corporation; ICE Clear Credit L.L.C.;\nNational Securities Clearing Corporation; and The Options Clearing Corporation.\n11\n\nthat are not mutually consistent; for example, if each CCP’s plans involve liquidating Treasuries,\nis it realistic to believe that every CCP could do so simultaneously?\nAuthorities in both the United States and Europe have made progress in conducting\nsupervisory stress tests of CCPs. In the United States, the CFTC conducted a useful set of tests\nof five major CCPs last year.11 The tests analyzed each individual institution’s ability to\nwithstand the credit risks emanating from the default of one or more clearing members. This\nwas innovative and necessary work. It would be useful to build on it by adding tests that focus\non liquidity risks across CCPs and their largest common clearing members. Such an exercise\ncould focus on the robustness of the system as a whole rather than individual CCPs. The\nEuropean Securities and Markets Authority is already expanding its supervisory stress testing\nexercise to incorporate liquidity risk. A similar exercise here in the United States should be\nseriously considered.\nEnsuring Efficiency\nThe industry collectively needs to ensure that the liquidity flows involved in central\nclearing are handled efficiently and in a way that minimizes potential disruption. As I noted,\nthere was some concern about the size of margin calls following Brexit, and certain CCPs have\ntaken measures to address this. For example, LCH has subsequently made changes to its\nintraday margining procedures in an effort to reduce liquidity pressures on its clearing members,\nallowing them to offset losses on their client accounts with gains on the house account.12\n11 “Supervisory Stress Test of Clearinghouses,” Commodity Futures Trading Commission, November 2016,\nwww.cftc.gov/idc/groups/public/@newsroom/documents/file/cftcstresstest111516.pdf.\n12 LCH has also moved forward by one hour the timing of the last intraday margin call and made procedural changes\nthat will speed up the processing of the call, which should also help with payment flows.\n12\n\nOther CCPs are also actively engaged in efforts to increase their efficiency. FICC is\nlooking at potential solutions using distributed ledger technology to clear both legs of overnight\nrepo trades, which could allow for greater netting opportunities and thereby reduce potential\nliquidity needs.13 Several CCPs are also looking at ways to expand central clearing to directly\ninclude more buy-side firms, which could also offer greater netting opportunities. Doing so\ncould also offer new sources of liquidity if the new entrants are able to take part in the CCP’s\ncommitted liquidity arrangements. Diversification of sources of liquidity would offer tangible\nbenefits--CCPs would avoid relying on the same limited set of clearing members for all of their\nliquidity needs. As one example, the Options Clearing Corporation established an innovative\npre-funded, committed repurchase facility with a leading pension fund.\nAs regulators, we should encourage innovations that increase clearing efficiency and\nreduce liquidity risks where they meet the PFMI and our supervisory expectations.\nCentral Bank Accounts\nAs I discussed earlier, CCPs have a complicated set of decisions on how and where to\nhold their cash balances. Title VIII of the Dodd-Frank Act authorized the Federal Reserve to\nestablish accounts for DFMUs, and we now have accounts with each of the eight institutions that\nthe Financial Stability Oversight Council has so designated. These accounts permit DFMUs to\nhold funds at the Federal Reserve, but not to borrow from it.14 Allowing DFMUs to deposit\n13 “DTCC & Digital Asset Move to Next Phase after Successful Proof-Of-Concept for Repo Transactions Using\nDistributed Ledger Technology,” DTCC, February 2017, www.dtcc.com/news/2017/february/27/dtcc-and-digital-\nasset-move-to-next-phase.\n14 According to title VIII of the Dodd-Frank Act, a designated financial market utility may only borrow from the\ndiscount window only in unusual and exigent circumstances and only upon a majority vote of the Board of\nGovernors following consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury.\n13\n\nbalances at the Federal Reserve helps them avoid some of the risk involved in holding balances\nwith their clearing members. Doing so also provides CCPs with a flexible way to hold balances\non days when margin payments unexpectedly spike and it is difficult to find banks that are\nwilling to accept an unexpected influx in deposits. In such a case, it may also be too late in the\nday to rely on the repo market. The availability of Fed accounts could help avoid potential\nmarket disruptions in those types of circumstances.\nCross-Border Cooperation\nThe lessons from Brexit also point to the need for cross-border cooperation. Brexit\ntriggered payments flows to CCPs across many jurisdictions. As far as liquidity risks are\nconcerned, it is immaterial whether a CCP is based in the United States or abroad so long as it\nclears U.S. dollar denominated assets and must make and receive U.S. dollar payments. There\nare different possible approaches to such cross-border issues. Efforts to address these liquidity\nrisks should carefully take into consideration the effect that they would have on the broader\nfinancial system. For example, splintering central clearing by currency area would fragment\nliquidity and reduce netting opportunities, which in the case of events like Brexit could actually\ntrigger even greater liquidity risk. In my opinion, we should be searching for cooperative\nsolutions to these issues.\nConclusion\nIn the years following the financial crisis, one of the primary lessons for market\nparticipants and their regulators was the criticality of liquidity risk management. Financial firms\n14\n\nsuch as Lehman Brothers and AIG struggled to obtain sufficient liquidity to meet their\nobligations. Liquidity is also a crucial concern in central clearing, and while regulatory reforms\nhave done much to strengthen both CCPs and their clearing members, we should continue to\nmake progress in creating a more robust and efficient system.\n15\n\nTypical Payments Chains Between CCP and Clearing Customers\nCCP\nSettlementBank may provide\nintraday credit to Clearing Member\nSettlement Bank\nPaymentBank\nClearing Membermay provide\ncredit to Customer\nClearing Member\nCustomer\nCustomer's Bank may provide\ncredit to Customer\nCustomer's Bank\n\nPayments Chains on October 20, 1987\nCCP\nSettlementBank may provide\nintraday credit to Clearing Member Settlement Banks\nceased providing credit\nand slowed payments\nSettlement Bank\nPayment Banks\nslowed payments\nPaymentBank\nClearing Members\nClearing Membermay provide\ncredit to Customer ceased providing credit\nand slowed payments\nClearing Member\nCustomer's Banks\nceased providing credit\nCustomer\nand slowed payments\nCustomer's Bank may provide\ncredit to Customer\nCustomer's Bank",

    "text": "As prepared for delivery at 10:15 a.m. EDT\nJune 22, 2017\nStatement by\nJerome H. Powell\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nbefore the\nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs\nU.S. Senate\nJune 22, 2017\n\nChairman Crapo, Ranking Member Brown, and members of the committee, I appreciate\nthe opportunity to testify at today’s hearing on the relationship between regulation and economic\ngrowth. We need a resilient, well-capitalized, well-regulated financial system that is strong\nenough to withstand even severe shocks and support economic growth by lending through the\neconomic cycle. The Federal Reserve has approached the post-crisis regulatory and supervisory\nreforms with that outcome in mind.\nAs a result of an improving economy and actions taken by both the federal regulators and\nthe industry, the U.S. financial system is substantially stronger and more stable than it was before\nthe financial crisis erupted nearly a decade ago. In this testimony, I will highlight the\nconsiderable gains made since the crisis and reflect on the principles that should guide us in the\nnext phase. I will also discuss some specific actions that align with these principles that we have\nrecently taken or expect to take that are designed to reduce regulatory burden without\ncompromising safety and soundness and financial stability.\nPost-Crisis Regulatory and Supervisory Reform\nThere is little doubt that the U.S. financial system is stronger today than it was a decade\nago. As I will discuss, loss-absorbing capacity among banks is substantially higher. The\nbanking industry, and the largest banking firms in particular, face far less liquidity risk than\nbefore the crisis. And progress in resolution planning by the largest firms has reduced the threat\nthat their failure would pose. These efforts have made U.S. banking firms both more robust and\nmore resolvable. And history shows that when U.S. banking firms are financially strong, they\nare able to better serve their customers.\n\n- 2 -\nToday I will highlight developments in the four key regulatory areas designed to\nimprove and maintain the resiliency of the banking industry: capital, stress testing, liquidity, and\nresolution planning.\nRegulatory capital reforms\nThe U.S. banking agencies have substantially strengthened regulatory capital\nrequirements for large banking firms, improving the quality and increasing the amount of capital\nin the banking system. High-quality common equity tier 1 capital (CET1) is important because it\nis available under all circumstances to absorb losses.\nSince the financial crisis, U.S. banks have been required to meet new minimum\nrequirements for CET1 to ensure a base of protection against losses. U.S. banks also have been\nrequired to meet capital conservation buffers that incentivize banking firms to keep their capital\nlevels well above the minimums in order to maintain full flexibility to allocate profits to\nshareholders and employees. For the U.S. global systemically important banks (G-SIBs), we\nhave also imposed an additional capital surcharge designed to reduce the threat that a failure of\nany of these firms would pose to financial stability.\nStress testing\nThe Federal Reserve also conducts the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review\n(CCAR), a stress test that assesses whether large banking firms have enough capital to withstand\nseverely adverse macroeconomic and financial market stress. We also use this process to assess\nthe quality of the capital planning processes of large banking firms. The U.S. bank holding\ncompanies (BHCs) subject to CCAR have more than doubled the dollar amount of their CET1\nfrom around $500 billion in 2009 to $1.2 trillion in the first quarter of 2017, and have more than\ndoubled their CET1 risk-based capital ratios from 5.5 percent to 12.4 percent over that period.\n\n- 3 -\nLiquidity regulation reforms\nThe banking agencies have also required large banking firms to substantially reduce their\nliquidity risk. Our key reforms in this area include a liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) that requires\nlarge banking firms to keep enough high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) to meet net stressed cash\noutflows over a 30-day period. The Federal Reserve has also adopted the Comprehensive\nLiquidity Analysis and Review (CLAR) supervisory program for evaluating the liquidity of the\nmost systemic banking firms. In addition, the banking agencies have proposed a net stable\nfunding ratio (NSFR) regulation that would help ensure that large banking firms maintain a\nstable funding profile over a one-year horizon.\nLiquidity positions within the U.S. banking system have improved substantially since the\nfinancial crisis. The U.S. G-SIBs increased their holdings of HQLA from about $1.5 trillion to\nabout $2.3 trillion between 2011 and the first quarter of 2017. The same institutions have also\nreduced their reliance on short-term wholesale funding from approximately 35 percent of assets\nin 2006 to about 15 percent of assets today.\nLarge bank resolvability reforms\nAs required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-\nFrank Act), the Federal Reserve has been working with the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation (FDIC) to improve resolution planning by banks. Through thoughtful resolution\nplanning, firms can reduce the risk that their failure would have disruptive effects on the\nfinancial system and the economy. The resolution planning process has caused the largest U.S.\nbanking firms to substantially improve their internal structures, governance, information\ncollection systems, and allocation of capital and liquidity in ways that both promote\nresolvability. The Federal Reserve also has helped improve the resolvability of the largest\n\n- 4 -\nbanking firms by requiring U.S. G-SIBs and the U.S. intermediate holding companies of foreign\nG-SIBs to meet long-term debt and total loss absorbing capacity (TLAC) requirements.\nEffect of regulation on U.S. banks\nEvidence overwhelmingly shows that financial crises can cause severe and lasting\ndamage to the economy’s productive capacity and growth potential.1 Post-crisis reforms to\nfinancial sector regulation and supervision have been designed to significantly reduce the\nlikelihood and severity of future financial crises. We have sought to accomplish this goal in\nsignificant part by reducing both the probability of failure of a large banking firm and the\nconsequences of such a failure were it to occur. We have substantially increased the capital,\nliquidity, and other prudential requirements for large banking firms, and these increases are not\nfree. Stronger capital requirements increase bank costs, and at least some of those costs are\npassed along to bank customers. But in the longer term, stronger prudential requirements for\nlarge banking firms will produce more sustainable credit availability and economic growth. Our\nobjective should be to set capital and other prudential requirements for large banking firms at a\nlevel that protects financial stability and maximizes long-term, through-the-cycle credit\navailability and economic growth.\nGuiding Principles to Simplify and Reduce Regulatory Burden\nAs we near completion of the major post-crisis regulatory reforms, this is a good time to\nassess the effectiveness and efficiency of these reforms. Several principles are guiding us in this\neffort. First, we should protect the core elements of the reforms for our largest banking firms in\n1 See, for example, Robert F. Martin, Teyanna Munyan, and Beth Anne Wilson (2014), “Potential Output and\nRecessions: Are We Fooling Ourselves?” IFDP Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem, November 12), www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/notes/ifdp-notes/2014/potential-output-and-recessions-\nare-we-fooling-ourselves-20141112.html; and Olivier Blanchard, Eugenio Cerutti, and Lawrence Summers (2015),\n“Inflation and Activity--Two Explorations and Their Monetary Policy Implications,” IMF Working Paper\nWP/15/230 (Washington: International Monetary Fund, November),\nhttps://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2015/wp15230.pdf.\n\n- 5 -\ncapital regulation, stress testing, liquidity regulation, and resolvability. Second, we should\ncontinue to tailor our requirements to the size, risk, and complexity of the firms subject to those\nrequirements. In particular, we should always be aware that community banks face higher costs\nto meet complex requirements. Third, we should assess whether we can adjust regulation in\ncommon-sense ways that will simplify rules and reduce unnecessary regulatory burden without\ncompromising safety and soundness. And finally, we should strive to provide appropriate\ntransparency to supervised firms and the public regarding our expectations.\nAreas of Focus for Recalibration and Simplification\nSmall and medium bank regulatory simplification\nOver the course of the last year, the Federal Reserve and the other U.S. banking agencies\nfinalized significant burden-reducing measures for smaller banks. The banking agencies\nsignificantly streamlined Call Report requirements for banks with less than $1 billion in total\nassets. This streamlined Call Report resulted in 24 fewer pages than the previous total of 85, and\nreduced data items required to be reported by small banks by 40 percent. The banking agencies\nalso increased the number of institutions eligible for 18-month, rather than 12-month, cycles for\nsafety and soundness and Bank Secrecy Act exams. And the Federal Reserve implemented a\ndesirable statutory change to raise the threshold of its Small Bank Holding Company Policy\nStatement from $500 million to $1 billion in assets.\nIn addition, earlier this year, the U.S. banking agencies issued a report under the\nEconomic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act (EGRPRA) that outlined additional\nmeasures that the agencies committed to completing to reduce regulatory burden. Perhaps most\nnotably, the agencies committed to developing a proposal to simplify the generally applicable\ncapital framework that applies to community banking organizations. Among other things, this\n\n- 6 -\nproposal is being designed to simplify the current regulatory capital treatment of commercial real\nestate exposures, mortgage-servicing assets, and deferred tax assets. The agencies would seek\nindustry comment on the proposal through the normal notice and comment process. The\nagencies also expect to further reduce burden on small banks by additional streamlining of Call\nReports.\nThe Federal Reserve has also supported increases in various statutory thresholds in the\nDodd-Frank Act to more narrowly focus financial stability reforms on larger banking firms. For\nexample, we believe that small banking organizations could be exempted from the Volcker rule\nand from the incentive compensation requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. We also would\nsupport an increase in the $10 billion Dodd-Frank Act asset threshold for company-run stress\ntests and risk committee requirements, and in the $50 billion threshold for enhanced prudential\nstandards under section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act.\nResolution plans\nThe U.S. G-SIBs have made substantial progress in improving their resolvability and\nhave taken concrete steps to implement important organizational, governance, and operational\nmeasures developed in the course of their resolution planning exercises. These firms will be\nfiling new plans on July 1 that should incorporate agency feedback and guidance. The Federal\nReserve and FDIC will engage in a full review of these plans.\nWe are exploring with the FDIC ways to improve the resolution planning process. We\nbelieve it is worthwhile to consider extending the cycle for living will submissions from annual\nto once every two years, and focusing every other of these filings on key topics of interest and\nmaterial changes from the prior full plan submission. In addition, there may be opportunities to\ngreatly reduce the submission requirements for a large number of firms due to their relatively\n\n- 7 -\nsmall, simple, and domestically focused activities. Such an approach could limit full plan filing\nrequirements to firms that are large, complex, or have systemically critical operations.\nVolcker rule\nThe Federal Reserve is reassessing whether the Volcker rule implementing regulation\nmost efficiently achieves its policy objectives, and we look forward to working with the other\nfour Volcker rule agencies to find ways to improve the regulation. In our view, there is room for\neliminating or relaxing aspects of the implementing regulation that do not directly bear on the\nVolcker rule’s main policy goals. We also believe it would be constructive for Congress to\nconsider focusing the Volcker rule on entities with significant trading books and eliminating the\nrequirement that smaller firms be subject to the rule. In the meantime, we believe that it is\nworthwhile for the agencies to consider further tailoring of the implementing rule as it applies to\nsmaller firms and firms with small trading books, and to consider ways to streamline or reduce\nthe paperwork and reporting burden associated with the rule.\nEnhancements to stress testing and CCAR\nThe Federal Reserve is committed to increasing the transparency of the stress testing and\nCCAR processes. We will soon seek public feedback concerning possible forms of enhanced\ndisclosure. One such disclosure would be a range of indicative loss rates predicted by the\nFederal Reserve’s models for various loan and securities portfolios. We would also disclose\nmore information about risk characteristics that contribute to the loss-estimate ranges.\nWhen we release CCAR results next week, we will disclose more detailed information on\nCCAR’s qualitative assessment. We will also publish a document later this year summarizing\nthe performance of the industry on qualitative matters. Many of our largest banking firms have\nmade substantial progress toward meeting supervisory expectations for capital planning. If that\n\n- 8 -\nprogress continues, I believe it will be appropriate to consider removing the qualitative objection\nfrom CCAR for those firms that achieve and sustain high-quality capital planning capabilities.\nWe would continue to assess the capital planning practices of these firms as part of our ongoing\nsupervisory processes. I would also see it as appropriate to adjust CCAR’s assumptions\nregarding the balance sheet and capital distributions. These adjustments would take place in\nconjunction with the integration of the stress test into a firm’s regulatory capital requirements.\nLeverage ratio\nIn light of the substantial progress in the build-out of our overall regulatory capital and\nstress testing frameworks over the past few years, the Federal Reserve is taking a fresh look at\nthe enhanced supplementary leverage ratio. We believe that the leverage ratio is an important\nbackstop to the risk-based capital framework, but that it is important to get the relative\ncalibrations of the leverage ratio and the risk-based capital requirements right. Doing so is\ncritical to mitigating any perverse incentives and preventing distortions in money markets and\nother safe asset markets. Changes along these lines also could address concerns of custody\nbanks that their business model is disproportionately affected by the leverage ratio.\nConclusion\nU.S. banks today are as strong as any in the world, as shown by their solid profitability\nand healthy lending over recent years. As we consider the progress that has been achieved in\nimproving the resiliency and resolvability of our banking industry, it is important for us to look\nfor ways to reduce unnecessary burden. We must also be vigilant against new risks that may\ndevelop. In all of our efforts, our goal is to establish a regulatory framework that helps ensure\nthe resiliency of our financial system, the availability of credit, economic growth, and financial\n\n- 9 -\nmarket efficiency. We look forward to working with our fellow regulatory agencies and with\nCongress to achieve these important goals.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n10:30 a.m. EDT\nOctober 12, 2017\nProspects for Emerging Market Economies in a Normalizing Global Economy\nRemarks by\nJerome H. Powell\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\n2017 Annual Membership Meeting of the Institute of International Finance\nWashington, D.C.\nOctober 12, 2017\n\nThank you for inviting me to speak here at the Institute of International Finance\nAnnual Membership meeting. I am pleased to note that there have been signs lately that\na sustainable global recovery may finally be materializing. This is certainly good news,\nalthough significant risks and uncertainties remain. One important question is how the\nemerging market economies (EMEs) will fare as global monetary conditions normalize.\nIn our intertwined world, prospects for these economies are a significant driver of\nprospects for the United States and other advanced economies. In my remarks today I\nwill argue that, despite the risks and uncertainties, EMEs are likely to manage that\nnormalization reasonably well.\nAs many observers have noted, EME economic prospects are strongly linked to\nthe evolution of capital flows.1 Accordingly, I will first review the recent rebound in\nEME capital inflows and analyze the drivers of this rebound. Against this backdrop, I\nwill then discuss how the prospects for EMEs depend on three factors: Vulnerabilities in\nthe EMEs themselves; the evolution of advanced-economy monetary conditions,\nincluding those in the United States; and market responses to that evolution. As always,\nmy comments here represent my own views.\nThe Rebound in Economic Growth and Capital Flows in Emerging Markets\nAfter real GDP growth plummeted in many EMEs during the Global Financial\nCrisis (GFC), economic activity rebounded sharply (slide 1). But that recovery proved to\nbe short lived and was followed by a notable, widespread fall in EME growth as\nadvanced economies remained sluggish, economic imbalances in China mounted, and\ncommodity prices plunged. Lately, however, the streak of weak growth in the EMEs\n1 For more on this linkage, see Powell (2013).\n\n- 2 -\nappears to have been broken: The downward trend in Chinese growth has flattened,\ngrowth in other EMEs has picked up some, and Brazil seems to be moving into recovery\nmode. The factors that underlie the pickup in EMEs to a large extent represent a reversal\nof developments that led to the slowing. The improvement in the performance of the\nadvanced economies has become more widespread. Chinese authorities have bolstered\ntheir economy by providing more credit stimulus. And commodity prices have bounced\nback from their lows in early 2016, bolstering activity and allaying financial stability\nconcerns in commodity-exporting economies. These developments have also contributed\nto a modest reversal of the slowdown in global trade seen in recent years.2\nA rebound in capital flows has come along with the pickup in economic\nperformance in the EMEs. Slide 2 shows net private capital flows to EMEs--the\ndifference between gross private inflows and gross private outflows. These private net\ninflows are quite volatile, as the experience of the past 10 years shows. Strong pre-GFC\nnet inflows to major emerging markets (the black line)--hovering in the neighborhood\nof 3 to 4 percent of EME gross domestic product (GDP)--were interrupted by a collapse\nduring the crisis, but inflows quickly recovered and stayed strong through 2010. After\nthat, net inflows trended down for several years and turned negative by 2015. Part of this\nretrenchment reflected Chinese net inflows turning into net outflows due to what might\nbe considered special circumstances—notably, changes in expectations of Chinese\nexchange rate policy. But even taking China out of the picture, as shown by the dashed\nblue line, there was a clear downward trend in net inflows.\n2 For more on the global trade slowdown, see Powell (2016).\n\n- 3 -\nOver the past couple of years, however, net inflows have recovered and have\naveraged, if China is excluded, 0.7 percent of GDP in 2016 and about 1-1/2 percent of\nGDP in early 2017. As shown in slide 3, other measures of capital flows, such as flows\ninto EME investment funds, show an even sharper rebound.\nThe recent recovery of investor appetite for EME exposure has shown up in asset\nprices as well. Emerging-market credit spreads have declined, and equity prices have\nrisen (slide 4). These developments are not occurring in isolation, but in the context of a\ngeneral improvement in the global outlook and in investor risk sentiment. The\nimprovement in economic fundamentals raises the following question: To what extent\ncan the recent recovery in EME capital flows be explained by these better economic\nfundamentals?\nOne way to shed light on this question is to compare the recent behavior of EME\ncapital flows with what we might expect from a model of these flows based on historical\ndata. In a recent study, Federal Reserve staff regressed net private capital inflows into\nseveral key EMEs on measures of investment opportunities in these economies, monetary\npolicy variables, and risk sentiment variables.3 As can be seen in slide 5, by comparing\nthe solid and dashed lines, the model does a fairly good job overall of fitting the data.\nIt is instructive to look at what the model tells us about the slowing of flows\nbetween 2010 and 2015. Note that the falloff in commodity prices (the red portion of the\n3 The specific variables in the regression include the GDP growth differential between EMEs and advanced\neconomies, commodity prices, EME interest rate differentials with advanced economies, measures of the\nFederal Reserve’s quantitative easing, the VIX (which is the one-month-ahead option-implied volatility of\nthe S&P 500 index), and country-specific emerging market credit spreads (see Clark and others, 2016).\nNote that, because of special factors driving its flows over the past few years, China is not included in this\nanalysis. Other studies that have also examined determinants of EME capital flows include International\nMonetary Fund (2016b), Koepke (2015), Ahmed and Zlate (2014), Fratzscher (2012), and Ghosh and\nothers (2012). Generally, these papers find that many factors, including both “pull” and “push,” affect\nEME capital flows.\n\n- 4 -\nbars) was the largest contributor to the slowdown in flows. The decline in economic\ngrowth differentials between the EMEs and advanced economies (the yellow portions)\nwas also a major contributor. In fact, growth differentials became a slightly negative\ncontributor in 2015 after being substantially positive in 2010.4 Monetary policies (the\nblue portions) also became less of a factor in 2015 in driving flows to EMEs.\nAs for the recent rebound in flows, over the past year the model’s predicted net\ninflows (the dashed line) have actually been significantly above actual net inflows (the\nsolid line), suggesting that there is some room for flows to increase further without\nraising concerns. The model attributes the recovery of flows primarily to the turnaround\nin commodity prices and, to a substantially lesser extent, to improvements in risk\nsentiment (as seen by some waning of the negative contribution from the slashed green\nbars). The growth differential is not playing a major role because the rise in EME growth\nhas been accompanied by a rise in advanced-economy growth.5\nAll in all, this evidence suggests that the recent pickup of capital flows to EMEs\nhas not outrun its fundamental determinants, which provides some encouragement that\nthese flows will not reverse themselves and endanger EME prospects, a situation that is\nalso encouraging for U.S. prospects.\n4 This negative contribution reflects that the average growth differential between the selected group of\nEMEs, which does not include China, and the advanced economies itself became negative.\n5 Variants of the model applied to gross capital inflows, rather than net capital inflows, give qualitatively\nsimilar results. In particular, the model of gross flows also finds that the pickup in these flows has been\nless strong than predicted by the model. However, the relative contribution of the risk variables to the\npickup in EME flows relative to the turnaround in commodity prices is somewhat larger with the gross\nflows model than the net inflows model. The consequences of net versus gross flows for the recipient\neconomies can potentially differ as, for example, Cavallo and others (2015) have argued.\n\n- 5 -\nRisks to Emerging Market Economy Prospects from the Future Course of Monetary\nPolicy\nSome observers have noted that the risk of a reversal of EME capital flows may\nbecome more pronounced as U.S. and global interest rates return to more normal levels.\nThese developments could encourage capital to return to the advanced economies and, by\nraising domestic interest rates and putting downward pressures on emerging market\ncurrencies, could also enlarge EME debt burdens. In assessing this risk, as I mentioned\nearlier, three elements are important: first, the vulnerabilities in the EMEs themselves;\nsecond, the evolution of advanced-economy monetary policies; and, third, how markets\nmight respond to that evolution. Let me discuss each of these elements in turn.\nEmerging Market Economy Vulnerabilities\nThere is clear empirical evidence that the response of EME financial markets to\ndifferent shocks, including changes in U.S. interest rates, depends importantly on the\nstate of economic fundamentals in the EMEs themselves. For example, Bowman and\ncoauthors document in their study that a deterioration in a country’s economic conditions\nsignificantly increases its vulnerability to adverse effects from changes in U.S. interest\nrates.6 A case in point is the so-called taper tantrum in 2013, when rises in sovereign\nbond spreads were significantly greater in those EMEs with greater relative\nvulnerabilities.\nThere is little doubt that over the past couple of decades, EME macroeconomic\nfundamentals and policy frameworks have improved substantially. One way you can see\n6 See Bowman, Londono, and Sapriza (2015). Other papers that have looked at the effects of U.S.\nmonetary policies on EME asset prices and the channels through which these effects are transmitted include\nBruno and Shin (2015); Chen, Mancini-Griffoli, and Sahay (2014); Fratzscher, Lo Duca, and Straub\n(2013); Tepper and others (2013); and Hausman and Wongswan (2011).\n\n- 6 -\nthis improvement is through an index of aggregate EME vulnerability (the black line in\nslide 6), which is based economic data on a variety of variables from 13 major\neconomies.7 According to this index, EME vulnerabilities today stand well below those\nin the 1990s--a period during which financial crises in EMEs were much more prevalent.\nThat said, the vulnerability index has been trending up since 2008. Part of this\nincrease in the vulnerability index can be attributed to a run-up in bank credit to the\nprivate sector, which brings me to a key risk for EME prospects: the position of EME\ncorporates. Observers have been expressing concerns about the mounting levels of\ncorporate debt and the risk that a normalization of global conditions could exacerbate\ndebt service burdens of EME corporations--particularly those with elevated levels of\ndollar-denominated debt--by raising global interest rates, boosting the value of the dollar,\nand perhaps damping economic activity. Given the prominence of this risk, I will discuss\nEME corporates in a bit more detail.\nSince 2008, the debt of EME nonfinancial corporations has tripled in dollar value,\nreaching roughly $27 trillion in the first quarter of 2017. As a share of GDP, as shown by\nthe black line in slide 7, it has nearly doubled, to over 100 percent of GDP. China’s\nsituation is distinct from many other EMEs. On the one hand, as can be seen by the red\nline, its corporate debt, at 170 percent of GDP now, is much higher than most other\nEMEs and substantially above the level we saw in East Asia before the Asian crisis. On\nthe other hand, Chinese corporates are much less exposed to changes in exchange rates\nand global interest rates.\n7 Variables used in creating the index include external debt, the current account position, foreign reserves,\npublic debt, control of inflation, and bank credit to the private sector.\n\n- 7 -\nBut the rising amount of debt by itself does not tell us whether this debt is\nexcessive and how vulnerable EME corporates are to global monetary and market shocks.\nFor that assessment we need to drill down deeper into the health of the corporate sector.\nIn a recent study, Beltran and coauthors undertake such an analysis using a common\nmetric of debt service capacity--the interest coverage ratio, or ICR, which is the ratio of\nearnings to interest expense.8 All else being equal, this ratio is lower for firms that are\nless profitable, more leveraged, and have a higher cost of borrowing. Using firm-level\ndata, the authors classify the debt of those firms with an ICR of less than 2 as “debt-at-\nrisk.”9 They find, as shown by the black line in slide 8, that this measure of risky EME\ncorporate debt has almost tripled since 2011 to about 30 percent of GDP. But this share\nis still considerably lower than the 46 percent of GDP debt-at-risk in East Asia on the eve\nof the Asian crisis (the horizontal dashed black line in the chart). For China, though, the\ndebt-at-risk now exceeds what we saw in East Asia before the Asian crisis. Outside of\nChina (the dashed blue line), EME debt-at-risk, at about 10 percent of GDP, seems much\nmore manageable. However, as can be seen by the blue portions of the bars in slide 9,\ndebt-at-risk in a number of EMEs, including South Korea, India, Turkey, and Brazil\nexceeds that average level.\nHow will EME corporate debt fare going forward as global normalization\nproceeds? The results of the study I just discussed imply that a 1 percentage point\nincrease in EME corporate borrowing costs by itself would not be so problematic, at least\n8 See Beltran, Garud, and Rosenblum (2017). Other studies that have recently investigated EME corporate\nvulnerabilities include Alfaro, Chari and Panizza (2017); International Monetary Fund (2014, 2016a); and\nChow (2015).\n9 An ICR of 2 or less is often associated with increased likelihood of distress. For example, just before the\nAsian financial crisis, firms in Indonesia, South Korea, and Thailand had an average ICR of 2 (see\nPomerleano, 1998).\n\n- 8 -\noutside of China.10 What this shock would do to debt-at-risk is shown by the red\ncross-hatched portions of the bars in the chart. But it would be a bigger deal if the rise in\nborrowing costs was accompanied by a more generalized adverse turn of events in EMEs,\nmodeled here as a 20 percent earnings reduction and a 20 percent hit to the value of EME\ncurrencies against the dollar. The estimated effects of these additional shocks on debt-at-\nrisk are shown by the slashed red portions of the bars.11 In this case, aggregate EME\ndebt-at-risk rises from about 30 percent of GDP to around the level seen prior to the\nAsian financial crisis.12 Notably, the increase comes mainly from China, where\ndebt-at-risk jumps to about 85 percent of GDP. Outside of China, risky debt also rises\nsubstantially but seemingly not to levels that would be considered unmanageable.\nOverall, based on this analysis, I would conclude that corporate debt represents a\nmoderate degree of vulnerability for EME prospects. The situation is not alarming, but\nrisks are significant and bear close watching, especially in China.\nThe Evolution of Federal Reserve Policy\nWhat of the evolution of monetary conditions in the advanced economies? I will\nconfine myself here to Fed policy. One factor that favors easier adjustment in EMEs is\n10 A 1 percentage point positive shock to the borrowing costs of EME corporates undoes about half of the\ndecline in average borrowing costs from 2009 to 2016. Although on the face of it, this shock does not seem\ntoo large, as discussed in Beltran and others (2017), it is applied to the average interest rate on the entire\nexisting debt, not just on new debt. Given that the average interest rate for EME firms is about\n4-3/4 percent, a 1 percentage point rise increases the interest expense by about a fifth.\n11 The calibration of the shocks is the same as in Beltran and others (2017). A 20 percent earnings shock\ncorresponds to about half of the decline in EME corporate earnings experienced after the global financial\ncrisis. It is difficult to say how much emerging market currencies might depreciate under stress, but\n20 percent currency depreciation seems well within the plausible range. While the calibration of the shocks\nis the same as the above-mentioned study, the effects have been updated to reflect a larger sample of firms\nthat is now available. Qualitatively, the results and conclusions do not change from this update.\n12 In computing the new debt-at-risk after exchange rate shocks, we need the share of debt that is foreign\ncurrency-denominated, which is taken from Ayala, Nedelijkovic, and Saborowski (2015).\n\n- 9 -\nthat U.S. monetary policy normalization has been and should continue to be gradual, as\nlong as the U.S. economy evolves roughly as expected.\nSince the start of normalization in December 2015, the federal funds rate has risen\nto about 1-1/4 percent from its effective lower bound (slide 10). The median projections\nof Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants (the blue dots) have it rising to\n2.9 percent by the end of 2020, fairly close to what is regarded by the median participant\nas its long-run value and significantly below its average value in the years prior to the\nGFC. As reflected in the FOMC’s recent communications, the shrinkage of the Fed’s\nbalance sheet is also expected to proceed quite gradually, with slowly phased-in increases\nin caps on the monthly reductions in the Federal Reserve’s security holdings.\nThe expectation of gradual policy normalization should reduce the likelihood of\noutsized movements in interest rates. Indeed, even if we add, say, a 50 basis point term\npremium to the expected long-run federal funds rate, this value would still leave long-\nterm U.S. interest rates (shown in slide 11) well below their pre-GFC averages. As long\nas global financial conditions normalize in an orderly fashion, EMEs should have\nsufficient time to adjust. And, as we saw earlier, interest rate changes of this magnitude\nshould not lead to generalized corporate distress in EMEs, although undoubtedly some\ncorporates are more exposed and could experience difficulties.\nMarket Response\nAll that said, market movements can be noisy, which brings me to what I believe\nis the most uncertain element--the potentially volatile behavior of markets even in an\nenvironment of relatively contained EME vulnerabilities and of gradual and clearly\ncommunicated advanced-economy monetary policies.\n\n- 10 -\nSo far, markets have behaved in a manner consistent with a relatively benign\nscenario for EMEs: Risk sentiment is holding up, credit spreads in emerging markets\nhave been declining, equities are up, long-term yields have hardly budged, and the dollar\nhas been declining. Markets, however, can turn on a dime, and reactions can be outsized.\nThis concern may be especially relevant at present, given the low level of volatility and\nelevated asset prices in global markets, which may increase the likelihood and severity of\nan adjustment.\nMost of the time bouts of market turbulence lead to relatively quick corrections\nthat leave markets more resilient without substantially depressing global growth. The\ntaper tantrum of 2013 that I mentioned earlier is a good example. Ultimately, the policy\nadjustments made by some of the most affected economies, along with the more realistic\nappraisal of risks by global investors, likely left the global economy in a somewhat better\nposition than before the episode. That said, however, market tantrums pose complex\neconomic and financial challenges, and such episodes carry a significant risk of\nsnowballing into something bigger that more substantially threatens the economic\nexpansion.\nConclusion\nTo conclude, I have suggested that the most likely outcome is that the challenges\nposed to EMEs by the normalization of global financial conditions will be manageable.13\nSo far, capital flows have been moving in line with market fundamentals. Although,\nEME vulnerabilities have been rising, they are still well below the levels of the crisis-\n13 The IMF’s most recent Global Financial Stability Report, released October 11, (IMF, 2017), also\nconcludes that EMEs should be able to handle any reduction in flows from global monetary policy\nnormalization “in a relatively smooth manner, given their enhanced resilience and stronger growth\noutlook.”\n\n- 11 -\nprone years of the 1980s and 1990s. Global monetary conditions are expected to\nnormalize only gradually, as the Federal Reserve and other advanced-economy central\nbanks continue to stress clear communication and transparency. And the reaction of\nEME financial markets so far has been benign. But significant risks of more adverse\nscenarios remain. The corporate debt situation in EMEs has been worsening, particularly\nin China, and market reactions to even small surprises can be unpredictable and outsized.\nEven with these risks, however, the best thing the Federal Reserve can do--not\njust for the United States, but for the global economy at large--is to keep our house in\norder through the continued pursuit of our dual mandate. Finally, it bears remembering\nthat Fed policy normalization is occurring not in isolation, but in the context of a solid\nU.S. economic recovery, which should benefit all economies around the world.\n\n- 12 -\nReferences\nAhmed, Shaghil, and Andrei Zlate (2014). “Capital Flows to Emerging Market\nEconomies: A Brave New World?” Journal of International Money and Finance,\nvol. 48 (November), pp. 221-48.\nAlfaro, Laura, Gonzalo Asis, Anusha Chari, and Ugo Panizza (2017). “Lessons\nUnlearned?

Powell\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Navigating the Decade Ahead: Implications for Monetary Policy,” an economic policy\nsymposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\nJackson Hole, Wyoming\n(via webcast)\nAugust 27, 2020\n\nThank you, Esther, for that introduction, and good morning. The Kansas City\nFed’s Economic Policy Symposiums have consistently served as a vital platform for\ndiscussing the most challenging economic issues of the day. Judging by the agenda and\nthe papers, this year will be no exception.\nFor the past year and a half, my colleagues and I on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC) have been conducting the first-ever public review of our monetary\npolicy framework.1 Earlier today we released a revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals\nand Monetary Policy Strategy, a document that lays out our goals, articulates our\nframework for monetary policy, and serves as the foundation for our policy actions.2\nToday I will discuss our review, the changes in the economy that motivated us to\nundertake it, and our revised statement, which encapsulates the main conclusions of the\nreview.\nEvolution of the Fed’s Monetary Policy Framework\nWe began this public review in early 2019 to assess the monetary policy strategy,\ntools, and communications that would best foster achievement of our congressionally\nassigned goals of maximum employment and price stability over the years ahead in\nservice to the American people. Because the economy is always evolving, the FOMC’s\nstrategy for achieving its goals—our policy framework—must adapt to meet the new\nchallenges that arise. Forty years ago, the biggest problem our economy faced was high\nand rising inflation.3 The Great Inflation demanded a clear focus on restoring the\n1 See Board of Governors (2018) and Clarida (2019).\n2 The revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy is available on the Board’s\nwebsite at https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200827a.htm.\n3 Consumer price inflation, which was running below 2 percent in the early 1960s, had risen into the double\ndigits by the late 1970s and was slightly above 12 percent when the Committee gathered for an\nunscheduled meeting in the Eccles Building in Washington, D.C., on a Saturday in October 1979—before\n\n- 2 -\ncredibility of the FOMC’s commitment to price stability. Chair Paul Volcker brought\nthat focus to bear, and the “Volcker disinflation,” with the continuing stewardship of\nAlan Greenspan, led to the stabilization of inflation and inflation expectations in the\n1990s at around 2 percent. The monetary policies of the Volcker era laid the foundation\nfor the long period of economic stability known as the Great Moderation. This new era\nbrought new challenges to the conduct of monetary policy. Before the Great Moderation,\nexpansions typically ended in overheating and rising inflation. Since then, prior to the\ncurrent pandemic-induced downturn, a series of historically long expansions had been\nmore likely to end with episodes of financial instability, prompting essential efforts to\nsubstantially increase the strength and resilience of the financial system.4\nBy the early 2000s, many central banks around the world had adopted a monetary\npolicy framework known as inflation targeting.5 Although the precise features of\ninflation targeting differed from country to country, the core framework always\narticulated an inflation goal as a primary objective of monetary policy. Inflation targeting\nwas also associated with increased communication and transparency designed to clarify\nthe central bank’s policy intentions. This emphasis on transparency reflected what was\nthen a new appreciation that policy is most effective when it is clearly understood by the\npublic. Inflation-targeting central banks generally do not focus solely on inflation:\nThose with “flexible” inflation targets take into account economic stabilization in\naddition to their inflation objective.\nthe days when transparency was the hallmark of institutional accountability—and decided to change the\nconduct of monetary policy. See Volcker and Gyohten (1992); also see Volcker (2008), pp. 73–74.\n4 See Powell (2019).\n5 For a readable explanation of inflation targeting, see Bernanke and Mishkin (1997); also see Bernanke\nand others (1999).\n\n- 3 -\nUnder Ben Bernanke’s leadership, the Federal Reserve adopted many of the\nfeatures associated with flexible inflation targeting.6 We made great advances in\ntransparency and communications, with the initiation of quarterly press conferences and\nthe Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), which comprises the individual economic\nforecasts of FOMC participants. During that time, then–Board Vice Chair Janet Yellen\nled an effort on behalf of the FOMC to codify the Committee’s approach to monetary\npolicy. In January 2012, the Committee issued its first Statement on Longer-Run Goals\nand Monetary Policy Strategy, which we often refer to as the consensus statement. A\ncentral part of this statement was the articulation of a longer-run inflation goal of\n2 percent.7 Because the structure of the labor market is strongly influenced by\nnonmonetary factors that can change over time, the Committee did not set a numerical\nobjective for maximum employment. However, the statement affirmed the Committee’s\ncommitment to fulfilling both of its congressionally mandated goals. The 2012 statement\nwas a significant milestone, reflecting lessons learned from fighting high inflation as well\nas from experience around the world with flexible inflation targeting. The statement\nlargely articulated the policy framework the Committee had been following for some\ntime.8\nMotivation for the Review\nThe completion of the original consensus statement in January 2012 occurred\nearly on in the recovery from the Global Financial Crisis, when notions of what the “new\nnormal” might bring were quite uncertain. Since then, our understanding of the economy\n6 For the formalization and development of the concept of flexible inflation targeting, see Svensson (1999)\nand, more recently, Svensson (2020).\n7 As measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures.\n8 See Board of Governors (2012), p. 43.\n\n- 4 -\nhas evolved in ways that are central to monetary policy. Of course, the conduct of\nmonetary policy has also evolved. A key purpose of our review has been to take stock of\nthe lessons learned over this period and identify any further changes in our monetary\npolicy framework that could enhance our ability to achieve our maximum-employment\nand price-stability objectives in the years ahead.9\nOur evolving understanding of four key economic developments motivated our\nreview. First, assessments of the potential, or longer-run, growth rate of the economy\nhave declined. For example, since January 2012, the median estimate of potential growth\nfrom FOMC participants has fallen from 2.5 percent to 1.8 percent (see figure 1). Some\nslowing in growth relative to earlier decades was to be expected, reflecting slowing\npopulation growth and the aging of the population. More troubling has been the decline\nin productivity growth, which is the primary driver of improving living standards\nover time.10\nSecond, the general level of interest rates has fallen both here in the United States\nand around the world. Estimates of the neutral federal funds rate, which is the rate\nconsistent with the economy operating at full strength and with stable inflation, have\nfallen substantially, in large part reflecting a fall in the equilibrium real interest rate, or\n“r-star.” This rate is not affected by monetary policy but instead is driven by\nfundamental factors in the economy, including demographics and productivity growth—\nthe same factors that drive potential economic growth.11 The median estimate from\n9 On the benefits of holding a review, see Fuhrer and others (2018).\n10 Between 1995 and 2003, business-sector output per hour increased at an annual rate of 3.4 percent, and it\nhas risen only 1.4 percent since then. Fernald (2015) suggests 2003 as a break point for the beginning of\nthe productivity slowdown. See also Fernald (2018), Gordon (2017), and Powell (2018).\n11 Estimates of r-star have fallen between 2 and 3 percentage points over the past two decades. For\nevidence on the secular decline in interest rates in the United States and abroad see, for instance, Holston,\n\n- 5 -\nFOMC participants of the neutral federal funds rate has fallen by nearly half since early\n2012, from 4.25 percent to 2.5 percent (see figure 2).\nThis decline in assessments of the neutral federal funds rate has profound\nimplications for monetary policy. With interest rates generally running closer to their\neffective lower bound even in good times, the Fed has less scope to support the economy\nduring an economic downturn by simply cutting the federal funds rate.12 The result can\nbe worse economic outcomes in terms of both employment and price stability, with the\ncosts of such outcomes likely falling hardest on those least able to bear them.\nThird, and on a happier note, the record-long expansion that ended earlier this\nyear led to the best labor market we had seen in some time. The unemployment rate\nhovered near 50-year lows for roughly 2 years, well below most estimates of its\nsustainable level. And the unemployment rate captures only part of the story. Having\ndeclined significantly in the five years following the crisis, the labor force participation\nrate flattened out and began rising even though the aging of the population suggested that\nit should keep falling.13 For individuals in their prime working years, the participation\nrate fully retraced its post-crisis decline, defying earlier assessments that the Global\nFinancial Crisis might cause permanent structural damage to the labor market.\nLaubach, and Williams (2017) and Lunsford and West (2019). See also the recent evidence in Lopez-\nSalido and others (2020).\n12 Both the experience following the Global Financial Crisis and the current situation drive this point home.\nAfter the Global Financial Crisis, the Fed held the federal funds rate at the lower bound for seven years.\nThereafter, as the economy strengthened, the federal funds rate reached a peak just above 2 percent. By\ncomparison, the federal funds rate averaged a little more than 5 percent in the 1990s. And, at the onset of\nthe COVID pandemic, we quickly cut rates to the effective lower bound. But since the federal funds rate\nwas only about 1-1/2 percent before the pandemic—because that is what the economy required at that\ntime—our scope to reduce the federal funds rate was far less than in earlier recessions.\n13 The labor force participation rate for prime-age individuals (those between 25 and 54 years old), which is\nmuch less sensitive to the effects of population aging, has been rising over the past few years and continued\nto increase in 2019. For a longer-run perspective, see the analysis presented in Aaronson and others\n(2014).\n\n- 6 -\nMoreover, as the long expansion continued, the gains began to be shared more\nwidely across society. The Black and Hispanic unemployment rates reached record lows,\nand the differentials between these rates and the white unemployment rate narrowed to\ntheir lowest levels on record.14 As we heard repeatedly in our Fed Listens events, the\nrobust job market was delivering life-changing gains for many individuals, families, and\ncommunities, particularly at the lower end of the income spectrum.15 In addition, many\nwho had been left behind for too long were finding jobs, benefiting their families and\ncommunities, and increasing the productive capacity of our economy. Before the\npandemic, there was every reason to expect that these gains would continue. It is hard to\noverstate the benefits of sustaining a strong labor market, a key national goal that will\nrequire a range of policies in addition to supportive monetary policy.\nFourth, the historically strong labor market did not trigger a significant rise in\ninflation. Over the years, forecasts from FOMC participants and private-sector analysts\nroutinely showed a return to 2 percent inflation, but these forecasts were never realized\non a sustained basis (see figure 3). Inflation forecasts are typically predicated on\nestimates of the natural rate of unemployment, or “u-star,” and of how much upward\npressure on inflation arises when the unemployment rate falls relative to u-star.16 As the\nunemployment rate moved lower and inflation remained muted, estimates of u-star were\nrevised down. For example, the median estimate from FOMC participants declined from\n14 The decline in the unemployment rate for African Americans has been particularly sizable, and its\naverage rate in the second half of October 2019 was the lowest recorded since the data began to be reported\nin 1972; see Board of Governors (2020a). See also Daly (2020) and Aaronson and others (2019).\n15 Information on the Fed Listens events is available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review-of-monetary-policy-strategy-tools-and-\ncommunications-fed-listens-events.htm.\n16 A discussion of various concepts of unemployment rate benchmarks that are frequently used by\npolicymakers for assessing the current state of the economy is presented in Crump and others (2020).\n\n- 7 -\n5.5 percent in 2012 to 4.1 percent at present (see figure 4). The muted responsiveness of\ninflation to labor market tightness, which we refer to as the flattening of the Phillips\ncurve, also contributed to low inflation outcomes.17 In addition, longer-term inflation\nexpectations, which we have long seen as an important driver of actual inflation, and\nglobal disinflationary pressures may have been holding down inflation more than was\ngenerally anticipated. Other advanced economies have also struggled to achieve their\ninflation goals in recent decades.\nThe persistent undershoot of inflation from our 2 percent longer-run objective is a\ncause for concern. Many find it counterintuitive that the Fed would want to push up\ninflation. After all, low and stable inflation is essential for a well-functioning economy.\nAnd we are certainly mindful that higher prices for essential items, such as food,\ngasoline, and shelter, add to the burdens faced by many families, especially those\nstruggling with lost jobs and incomes. However, inflation that is persistently too low can\npose serious risks to the economy. Inflation that runs below its desired level can lead to\nan unwelcome fall in longer-term inflation expectations, which, in turn, can pull actual\ninflation even lower, resulting in an adverse cycle of ever-lower inflation and inflation\nexpectations.\nThis dynamic is a problem because expected inflation feeds directly into the\ngeneral level of interest rates. Well-anchored inflation expectations are critical for giving\nthe Fed the latitude to support employment when necessary without destabilizing\ninflation.18 But if inflation expectations fall below our 2 percent objective, interest rates\n17 See, for instance, Blanchard, Cerutti, and Summers (2015).\n18 The success of monetary policy in taming high and variable inflation in the 1980s and 1990s was\ninstrumental in anchoring inflation expectations at low levels. See, for instance, Goodfriend (2007).\n\n- 8 -\nwould decline in tandem. In turn, we would have less scope to cut interest rates to boost\nemployment during an economic downturn, further diminishing our capacity to stabilize\nthe economy through cutting interest rates. We have seen this adverse dynamic play out\nin other major economies around the world and have learned that once it sets in, it can be\nvery difficult to overcome. We want to do what we can to prevent such a dynamic from\nhappening here.\nElements of the Review\nWe began our review with these changes in the economy in mind. The review\nhad three pillars: a series of Fed Listens events held around the country, a flagship\nresearch conference, and a series of Committee discussions supported by rigorous staff\nanalysis. As is appropriate in our democratic society, we have sought extensive\nengagement with the public throughout the review.\nThe Fed Listens events built on a long-standing practice around the Federal\nReserve System of engaging with community groups. The 15 events involved a wide\nrange of participants—workforce development groups, union members, small business\nowners, residents of low- and moderate-income communities, retirees, and others—to\nhear about how our policies affect peoples’ daily lives and livelihoods.19 The stories we\nheard at Fed Listens events became a potent vehicle for us to connect with the people and\ncommunities that our policies are intended to benefit. One of the clear messages we\nheard was that the strong labor market that prevailed before the pandemic was generating\n19 See the report Fed Listens: Perspectives from the Public (Board of Governors, 2020b), which\nsummarizes the 14 Fed Listens events hosted by the Board and the Federal Reserve Banks during 2019, as\nwell as an additional event in May 2020 to follow up with participants about the effects of the COVID-19\npandemic on their communities. Information on the individual Fed Listens events is available on the\nBoard’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review-of-monetary-policy-strategy-\ntools-and-communications-fed-listens-events.htm.\n\n- 9 -\nemployment opportunities for many Americans who in the past had not found jobs\nreadily available. A clear takeaway from these events was the importance of achieving\nand sustaining a strong job market, particularly for people from low- and moderate-\nincome communities.\nThe research conference brought together some of the world’s leading academic\nexperts to address topics central to our review, and the presentations and robust\ndiscussion we engaged in were an important input to our review process.20\nFinally, the Committee explored the range of issues that were brought to light\nduring the course of the review in five consecutive meetings beginning in July 2019.\nAnalytical staff work put together by teams across the Federal Reserve System provided\nessential background for each of the Committee’s discussions.21\nOur plans to conclude the review earlier this year were, like so many things,\ndelayed by the arrival of the pandemic. When we resumed our discussions last month,\nwe turned our attention to distilling the most important lessons of the review in a revised\nStatement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.\nNew Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy\nThe federated structure of the Federal Reserve, reflected in the FOMC, ensures\nthat we always have a diverse range of perspectives on monetary policy, and that is\ncertainly the case today. Nonetheless, I am pleased to say that the revised consensus\nstatement was adopted today with the unanimous support of Committee participants. Our\n20 The Federal Reserve System’s “Conference on Monetary Policy Strategy, Tools, and Communication\nPractices (A Fed Listens Event)” was hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago in June 2019. See\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/conferences/conference-monetary-policy-strategy-tools-communications-\n20190605.htm for the conference program, links to the conference papers and presentations, and links to\nsession videos. A special issue of the International Journal of Central Banking (February 2020) included\nfive of the seven papers presented at the conference (see https://www.ijcb.org/journal/ijcb2002.htm).\n21 See the overview presented in Altig and others (2020).\n\n- 10 -\nnew consensus statement, like its predecessor, explains how we interpret the mandate\nCongress has given us and describes the broad framework that we believe will best\npromote our maximum-employment and price-stability goals. Before addressing the key\nchanges in our statement, let me highlight some areas of continuity. We continue to\nbelieve that specifying a numerical goal for employment is unwise, because the\nmaximum level of employment is not directly measurable and changes over time for\nreasons unrelated to monetary policy. The significant shifts in estimates of the natural\nrate of unemployment over the past decade reinforce this point. In addition, we have not\nchanged our view that a longer-run inflation rate of 2 percent is most consistent with our\nmandate to promote both maximum employment and price stability. Finally, we continue\nto believe that monetary policy must be forward looking, taking into account the\nexpectations of households and businesses and the lags in monetary policy’s effect on the\neconomy. Thus, our policy actions continue to depend on the economic outlook as well\nas the risks to the outlook, including potential risks to the financial system that could\nimpede the attainment of our goals.\nThe key innovations in our new consensus statement reflect the changes in the\neconomy I described. Our new statement explicitly acknowledges the challenges posed\nby the proximity of interest rates to the effective lower bound. By reducing our scope to\nsupport the economy by cutting interest rates, the lower bound increases downward risks\nto employment and inflation.22 To counter these risks, we are prepared to use our full\nrange of tools to support the economy.\n22 See Caldara and others (2020).\n\n- 11 -\nWith regard to the employment side of our mandate, our revised statement\nemphasizes that maximum employment is a broad-based and inclusive goal. This change\nreflects our appreciation for the benefits of a strong labor market, particularly for many in\nlow- and moderate-income communities.23 In addition, our revised statement says that\nour policy decision will be informed by our “assessments of the shortfalls of employment\nfrom its maximum level” rather than by “deviations from its maximum level” as in our\nprevious statement.24 This change may appear subtle, but it reflects our view that a\nrobust job market can be sustained without causing an outbreak of inflation.\nIn earlier decades when the Phillips curve was steeper, inflation tended to rise\nnoticeably in response to a strengthening labor market. It was sometimes appropriate for\nthe Fed to tighten monetary policy as employment rose toward its estimated maximum\nlevel in order to stave off an unwelcome rise in inflation. The change to “shortfalls”\nclarifies that, going forward, employment can run at or above real-time estimates of its\nmaximum level without causing concern, unless accompanied by signs of unwanted\nincreases in inflation or the emergence of other risks that could impede the attainment of\nour goals.25 Of course, when employment is below its maximum level, as is clearly the\n23 The analysis of how alternative strategies that succeed in reducing the frequency and/or severity of ELB\nrecessions can induce longer run beneficial effects on economic inequality is presented in Feiveson and\nothers (2020).\n24 Italics added for emphasis. The 2012 statement noted that the Committee would mitigate “deviations” of\nemployment from the Committee’s assessments of its maximum level, suggesting that the Committee\nwould actively seek to lower employment if it assessed that employment was above the Committee’s\nestimate of its maximum level. In practice, the Committee has not conducted policy in this way, but rather\nhas supported continued gains in the labor market.\n25 In addition, because real-time estimates are highly uncertain, we no longer refer to estimates of the\nnatural rate of unemployment from the SEP in our consensus statement. Another reason for dropping this\nreference is that the unemployment rate does not adequately capture the full range of experience in the\nlabor market. The SEP will continue to report FOMC participants’ estimates of the longer-run level of the\nunemployment rate, as such information remains a useful, albeit highly incomplete, input into our policy\ndeliberations.\n\n- 12 -\ncase now, we will actively seek to minimize that shortfall by using our tools to support\neconomic growth and job creation.\nWe have also made important changes with regard to the price-stability side of\nour mandate. Our longer-run goal continues to be an inflation rate of 2 percent. Our\nstatement emphasizes that our actions to achieve both sides of our dual mandate will be\nmost effective if longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent.\nHowever, if inflation runs below 2 percent following economic downturns but never\nmoves above 2 percent even when the economy is strong, then, over time, inflation will\naverage less than 2 percent. Households and businesses will come to expect this result,\nmeaning that inflation expectations would tend to move below our inflation goal and pull\nrealized inflation down. To prevent this outcome and the adverse dynamics that could\nensue, our new statement indicates that we will seek to achieve inflation that averages\n2 percent over time. Therefore, following periods when inflation has been running below\n2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately\nabove 2 percent for some time.\nIn seeking to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time, we are\nnot tying ourselves to a particular mathematical formula that defines the average. Thus,\nour approach could be viewed as a flexible form of average inflation targeting.26 Our\ndecisions about appropriate monetary policy will continue to reflect a broad array of\nconsiderations and will not be dictated by any formula. Of course, if excessive\n26 This strategy embodies some key lessons from the general class of makeup strategies that have been\nanalyzed extensively in the economics literature. The literature has emphasized that the proximity of\ninterest rates to the effective lower bound poses an asymmetric challenge for monetary policy, increasing\nthe likelihood that inflation and employment will tend to be too low. An extensive discussion about how\nthese issues affect the design of monetary policy, as well as the relevant related literature, can be found in\nDuarte and others (2020), Arias and others (2020), and Hebden and others (2020).\n\n- 13 -\ninflationary pressures were to build or inflation expectations were to ratchet above levels\nconsistent with our goal, we would not hesitate to act.\nThe revisions to our statement add up to a robust updating of our monetary policy\nframework. To an extent, these revisions reflect the way we have been conducting policy\nin recent years. At the same time, however, there are some important new features.\nOverall, our new Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy conveys\nour continued strong commitment to achieving our goals, given the difficult challenges\npresented by the proximity of interest rates to the effective lower bound. In conducting\nmonetary policy, we will remain highly focused on fostering as strong a labor market as\npossible for the benefit of all Americans. And we will steadfastly seek to achieve a\n2 percent inflation rate over time.\nLooking Ahead\nOur review has provided a platform for productive discussion and engagement\nwith the public we serve. The Fed Listens events helped us connect with our core\nconstituency, the American people, and hear directly how their everyday lives are\naffected by our policies. We believe that conducting a review at regular intervals is a\ngood institutional practice, providing valuable feedback and enhancing transparency and\naccountability. And with the ever-changing economy, future reviews will allow us to\ntake a step back, reflect on what we have learned, and adapt our practices as we strive to\nachieve our dual-mandate goals. As our statement indicates, we plan to undertake a\nthorough public review of our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication\npractices roughly every five years.\n\n- 14 -\nReferences\nAaronson, Stephanie, Tomaz Cajner, Bruce Fallick, Felix Galbis-Reig, Christopher\nSmith, and William Wascher (2014). “Labor Force Participation: Recent\nDevelopments and Future Prospects,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity,\nFall, pp. 197–275, https://www.brookings.edu/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2016/07/Fall2014BPEA_Aaronson_et_al.pdf.\nAaronson, Stephanie, Mary C.

    "text": "For release on delivery\n9:55 a.m. EDT (8:55 a.m. CDT)\nJune 4, 2019\nOpening Remarks\nby\nJerome H. Powell\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Conference on Monetary Policy Strategy, Tools, and Communications Practices”\nsponsored by the Federal Reserve\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\nChicago, Illinois\nJune 4, 2019\n\nGood morning. I am very pleased to welcome you here today. This conference is\npart of a first-ever public review by the Federal Open Market Committee of our monetary\npolicy strategy, tools, and communications. We have a distinguished group of experts\nfrom academics and other walks of life here to share perspectives on how monetary\npolicy can best serve the public.\nI’d like first to say a word about recent developments involving trade negotiations\nand other matters. We do not know how or when these issues will be resolved. We are\nclosely monitoring the implications of these developments for the U.S. economic outlook\nand, as always, we will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor\nmarket and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent objective. My comments today, like\nthis conference, will focus on longer-run issues that will remain even as the issues of the\nmoment evolve.\nWhile central banks face a challenging environment today, those challenges are\nnot entirely new. In fact, in 1999 the Federal Reserve System hosted a conference titled\n“Monetary Policy in a Low Inflation Environment.” Conference participants discussed\nnew challenges that were emerging after the then-recent victory over the Great Inflation.1\nThey focused on many questions posed by low inflation and, in particular, on what\nunconventional tools a central bank might use to support the economy if interest rates fell\nto what we now call the effective lower bound (ELB). Even though the Bank of Japan\nwas grappling with the ELB as the conference met, the issue seemed remote for the\nUnited States. The conference received little coverage in the financial press, but a\n1 The proceedings of the conference were published in the November 2000 issue of Journal of Money,\nCredit and Banking.\n\n- 2 -\nReuters wire service story titled “Fed Conference Timing on Inflation Odd, but Useful”\nemphasized the remoteness of the risk.2 Participants at the conference could not have\nanticipated that only 10 years later, the world would be engulfed in a deep financial\ncrisis, with unemployment soaring and central banks around the world making extensive\nuse of new strategies, tools, and ways to communicate.\nThe next time policy rates hit the ELB—and there will be a next time—it will not\nbe a surprise. We are now well aware of the challenges the ELB presents, and we have\nthe painful experience of the Global Financial Crisis and its aftermath to guide us. Our\nobligation to the public we serve is to take those measures now that will put us in the best\nposition deal with our next encounter with the ELB. And with the economy growing,\nunemployment low, and inflation low and stable, this is the right time to engage the\npublic broadly on these topics.\nThe review has several parts, all of which are intended to open our monetary\npolicy to critical examination. We are holding a series of Fed Listens events around the\ncountry to help us understand the perspectives of people from diverse backgrounds and\nwith varied interests. This conference and many other engagements will help us bring to\nbear the best thinking from policymakers and experts. Beginning later this year, the\nFOMC will devote time at a series of our regular meetings to assess lessons from these\nevents, supported by staff analysis performed throughout the Federal Reserve System.\nWe will publicly report the outcome of our discussions. In the meantime, anyone who is\n2 Herbst-Bayliss (1999).\n\n- 3 -\ninterested in participating or learning more can find information on the Federal Reserve\nBoard’s website.3\nBefore turning to the specifics of the review, I want to focus a little more closely\non the challenges we face today. For a reference point, at the time of the 1999\nconference, the United States was eight years into an expansion; core inflation was\n1.4 percent, and the unemployment rate was 4.1 percent—not so different from today.4\nMacroeconomists were puzzling over the flatness of the Phillips curve, the level of the\nnatural rate of unemployment, and a possible acceleration in productivity growth—\nquestions that are also with us today.5\nThe big difference between then and now is that the federal funds rate was\n5.2 percent—which, to underscore the point, put the rate 20 quarter-point rate cuts away\nfrom the ELB. Since then, standard estimates of the longer-run normal or neutral rate of\ninterest have declined between 2 and 3 percentage points, and some argue that the\neffective decline is even larger.6 The combination of lower real interest rates and low\ninflation translates into lower nominal rates and a much higher likelihood that rates will\nfall to the ELB in a downturn.\nAs the experience of the past decade showed, extended ELB episodes can be\nassociated with painfully high unemployment and slow growth or recession. Economic\n3 More on Fed Listens events and related information is available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review-of-monetary-policy-strategy-tools-and-\ncommunications-fed-listens-events.htm.\n4 The inflation rate referenced is the October 12-month percent change in the price index for personal\nconsumption expenditures excluding food and energy.\n5 The discussion of all these issues was centered on Fed Chair Alan Greenspan’s (1998) “New Economy”\nhypothesis that the United States had undergone fundamental changes for the better, leading to the\notherwise puzzling outcomes.\n6 See, for example, the estimates of the neutral rate reported on the New York Fed’s website at\nhttps://www.newyorkfed.org/research/policy/rstar. Rachel and Summers (2019) give reasons why the\neffective change may be larger.\n\n- 4 -\nweakness puts downward pressure on inflation, which can raise real interest rates and\nreinforce the challenge of supporting needed job growth. In addition, over time, inflation\nhas become much less sensitive to tightness in resource utilization. This insensitivity can\nbe a blessing in avoiding deflation when unemployment is high, but it means that much\ngreater labor market tightness may ultimately be required to bring inflation back to target\nin a recovery. Using monetary policy to push sufficiently hard on labor markets to lift\ninflation could pose risks of destabilizing excesses in financial markets or elsewhere.\nIn short, the proximity of interest rates to the ELB has become the preeminent\nmonetary policy challenge of our time, tainting all manner of issues with ELB risk and\nimbuing many old challenges with greater significance. For example, the behavior of\ninflation7 now draws much sharper focus. When nominal interest rates were around 4 or\n5 percent, a low-side surprise of a few tenths on inflation did not raise the specter of the\nELB. But the world has changed. Core inflation is currently running a bit below\n2 percent on a trailing 12-month basis. In this setting, a similar low-side surprise, if it\nwere to persist, would bring us uncomfortably closer to the ELB. My FOMC colleagues\nand I must—and do—take seriously the risk that inflation shortfalls that persist even in a\nrobust economy could precipitate a difficult-to-arrest downward drift in inflation\nexpectations. At the heart of the review is the evaluation of potential changes to our\nstrategy designed to strengthen the credibility of our symmetric 2 percent inflation\nobjective.\n7 For example, based on the Federal Reserve staff’s Greenbook forecast, across forecasts prepared for\n59 FOMC meetings between 1997 and 2004, one-third of the year ahead, four-quarter inflation forecast\nerrors were 0.5 percentage point or greater in absolute value. Error tended to be on the low side, and\n45 percent of low-side misses were greater than 0.5 percentage point in absolute value.\n\n- 5 -\nThe ELB problem also complicates the FOMC’s efforts to achieve transparency\nand accountability. The Fed, like most major central banks, is insulated from short-term\npolitical pressures. In our democracy, that insulation carries with it an obligation for us\nto be transparent and publicly accountable. When policy rates reached the ELB during\nthe crisis, central banks resorted to what were then new, untested tools to pursue their\nmandated goals. These tools are no longer new, but their efficacy, costs, and risks remain\nless well understood than the traditional approaches to central banking. My FOMC\ncolleagues and I are committed to explaining why the use of these tools in the wake of\nthe crisis was a prudent and effective approach to pursuing our congressional mandate\nand why tools like these are likely to be needed again. Our review is but one part of our\nefforts to engage with the public on these matters.\nLet me turn to the specifics of the review, which is focused on three questions:\n1. Can the Federal Reserve best meet its statutory objectives with its\nexisting monetary policy strategy, or should it consider strategies that\naim to reverse past misses of the inflation objective?\n2. Are the existing monetary policy tools adequate to achieve and\nmaintain maximum employment and price stability, or should the\ntoolkit be expanded?\n3. How can the FOMC's communication of its policy framework and\nimplementation be improved?\nThese questions are quite broad, and my colleagues and I come to them with open\nminds. We believe our current policy framework is working well, and we have made no\ndecisions about particular changes. In fact, the review is still in its early stages.\n\n- 6 -\nThe first question raises the issue of whether the FOMC should use makeup\nstrategies in response to ELB risks. By the time of the 1999 conference, research was\nbeginning to show that—in models, at least—such strategies could substantially reduce\nthe unemployment and other costs of ELB spells.8 The simplest version goes like this:\nSuppose that a spell with interest rates near the ELB leads to a persistent shortfall of\ninflation relative to the central bank’s goal. But what if the central bank promised\ncredibly that it would deliberately make up for any lost inflation by stimulating the\neconomy and temporarily pushing inflation modestly above the target? In the models, the\nprospect of future stimulus promotes anticipatory consumption and investment that could\ngreatly reduce the pain of being at the ELB.9 Policymakers discussed this reasoning in\nthe wake of the crisis, but neither the Fed nor any other major central bank chose to\npursue such a policy.10 Why? For makeup strategies to work, households and businesses\nmust go out on a limb, so to speak, raising spending in the midst of a downturn. In\ntheory, they would do this based on their confidence that the central bank will deliver the\nmakeup stimulus at some point—perhaps years in the future. In models, great confidence\nin central bankers is achieved by assumption. Despite the flattering nature of this\n8 See Reifschneider and Williams (2000) and references therein. For a more recent review of this subject,\nsee Bernanke, Kiley, and Roberts (2019) and Mertens and Williams (2019).\n9 Eggertsson and Woodford (2003), for example, show that optimal policy at the ELB entails a commitment\nto reflate the price level during subsequent economic expansions. See also Wolman (2005) for a discussion\nof the effectiveness of price-level targeting at the ELB. For a discussion of the relationship between price-\nlevel targeting and average-inflation targeting, see Nessén and Vestin (2005). The strategy in\nReifschneider and Williams (2000), for instance, involves a central bank following a Taylor rule modified\nto make up for shortfalls in policy accommodation during ELB episodes. Kiley and Roberts (2017) study a\nstrategy in which policymakers aim for inflation higher than 2 percent during normal times to compensate\nfor below-target inflation during ELB episodes. Also see Bernanke (2017) for a strategy in which low\ninflation is made up if it occurs when the federal funds rate is at or near the ELB. See also Bernanke,\nKiley, and Roberts (2019) and Mertens and Williams (2019).\n10 The Bank of Japan (2016) came closest, announcing in September 2016 an “inflation-overshooting\ncommitment” (p. 1). The commitment did not, however, come with any explicit goal for a degree or\nduration of overshoot.\n\n- 7 -\nassumption, crisis-era policymakers had major questions about whether their promise of\ngood times to come would really have moved the hearts, minds, and pocketbooks of the\npublic. Part of the problem was that the groundwork had not been laid in advance of the\ndownturn—a problem we could hope to fix well before next time. Policymakers also had\ndeeper concerns about the legitimacy and effectiveness of attempting to bind some future\nFOMC to take actions that could be objectionable from a short-term perspective when the\ntime came to deliver.11\nResearch on makeup strategies has begun to grapple more seriously with the\ncredibility questions.12 But important questions remain. To achieve buy-in by\nhouseholds and businesses, a comprehensible, credible, and actionable makeup strategy\nwill need to be followed by years of central bank policy consistent with that strategy.\nThe second question asks about the adequacy of the Fed’s toolkit for providing\nstimulus when facing the ELB. In the United States, we used several different\nformulations of both forward guidance and large-scale purchases of longer-term\nsecurities.13 While views differ on the effectiveness of these policies, with their use, the\nunemployment rate fell steadily and inflation expectations remained well anchored,\noutcomes that were favorable overall when viewed against the recoveries of many other\nadvanced economies. My own view is that these policies provided meaningful support\nfor demand, but that they should not be thought of as a perfect substitute for our\n11 These issues were discussed by the FOMC at several points, especially during 2011 (see the 2011 FOMC\ntranscripts, available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomchistorical2011.htm).\n12 See, for example, English, López-Salido, and Tetlow (2015); Hebden and López-Salido (2018);\nBernanke, Kiley, and Roberts (2019); and Mertens and Williams (2019).\n13 For details on formulations used by the United States for forward guidance and large-scale purchases of\nlonger-term securities as well as other references, see, for example,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_openmarketops.htm and\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/expiredtools.htm.\n\n- 8 -\ntraditional interest rate tool. In any case, we have a responsibility to thoroughly evaluate\nwhat mix of these tools is likely to work best when the next ELB episode arrives.\nPerhaps it is time to retire the term “unconventional” when referring to tools that\nwere used in the crisis. We know that tools like these are likely to be needed in some\nform in future ELB spells, which we hope will be rare. We now have a significant body\nof evidence regarding the effectiveness, costs, and risks of these tools, including those\nused by the FOMC and others tried elsewhere. Our plans must take advantage of this\ngrowing understanding as assessments are refined.\nThe third question concerns improving communication, which I discussed earlier\nfrom the standpoint of governance and accountability. But transparency also plays a\ncentral role in policy effectiveness through its effects on the expectations of households\nand businesses. Of course, this was the major insight behind the transparency revolution\nin central banking over the past few decades. Today, central banks publicly share a large\nand ever-increasing amount of information about policy. But policymakers and\ncommentators inside and outside central banks sometimes question whether all of the\ntransparency adds up to effective communication.14\nThe FOMC’s famous dot plot is one example. A focus on the median forecast\namounts to emphasizing what the typical FOMC participant would do if things go as\nexpected. But we have been living in times characterized by large, frequent, unexpected\nchanges in the underlying structure of the economy.15 In this environment, the most\n14 A 2016 Brookings conference titled “Understanding Fedspeak” (see\nhttps://www.brookings.edu/events/understanding-fedspeak) raised several aspects of this issue. For\nexample, Olson and Wessel (2016a) presented results of a survey of those who follow the Fed closely; in an\nop-ed (2016b), they noted that “Some 73 percent of academics said Fed communications helps the markets;\nonly 44 percent of private-sector Fed watchers agreed.”\n15 For more on changes in the underlying structure of the economy, see Powell (2018).\n\n- 9 -\nimportant policy message may be about how the central bank will respond to the\nunexpected rather than what it will do if there are no surprises. Unfortunately, at times\nthe dot plot has distracted attention from the more important topic of how the FOMC will\nreact to unexpected economic developments. In times of high uncertainty, the median\ndot might best be thought of as the least unlikely outcome.\nLet me conclude by saying that I look forward to our discussions here and to the\nongoing work of the review that lies ahead. We need the best tools and strategies\npossible for dealing with the challenges we now face, and we must communicate them in\na clear and credible way. My colleagues and I welcome your best thinking on these\nissues.\n\n- 10 -\nReferences\nBank of Japan (2016). “New Framework for Strengthening Monetary Easing:\n‘Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing with Yield Curve Control,’ ”\nannouncement, September 21,\nhttps://www.boj.or.jp/en/announcements/release_2016/k160921a.pdf.\nBernanke, Ben S.

Powell\nChairman\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nConversation with the Chairman: A Teacher Town Hall Meeting\nWashington, D.C.\n(And via video link)\nFebruary 6, 2019\n\nThank you to all the educators who are here with us in Washington or are joining\nus online. I look forward to responding to your questions. But first, I have a few\nthoughts about the vital work you do as economics educators and its connection to what\nthe Federal Reserve is trying to accomplish. I promise to be brief, because it is a school\nnight.\nI am here today, and the Fed has organized this event, because of the importance\nof economics education. Some of your students may go on to become professional\neconomists, but all of them, I hope, will apply the valuable lessons and the skills they\nhave gained from economics in other careers and in others aspects of their lives.\nStudying economics can benefit students in multiple ways. The lessons of\neconomics are valuable in a wide variety of vocations. Moreover, the knowledge gained\nwill empower students as consumers, managers of their own finances, and as informed\ncitizens. Economics has been consistently useful to me over my career in law, finance,\nand government service. It is, of course, central to my current role as a monetary\npolicymaker and financial regulator.\nIn government, economic analysis is one of the principal tools we use in making\npolicy decisions. Among other things, economics is an essential facet of the science of\npublic policy. What policies actually work? Which ones sound good but don’t work, or\nare actually counter-productive? Economics gives us the tools to answer those questions\nand help us make the best the decisions on behalf of the public.\nOf course, economics is not only the basis for judgments and decisions made by\nthe Fed and other government agencies. It also underpins the countless decisions by\nconsumers, businesses, and investors that drive economic activity. The concepts you\n\n- 2 -\nteach and apply in the classroom guide those decisions and even help explain human\nbehavior outside of the workings of the economy. For example, to continue to grow and\nsucceed, any business owner should understand the differences between fixed cost,\nvariable cost, average cost, and marginal cost. Businesses and investors need to\nunderstand present or discounted value, but so should any parent or grandparent starting a\ncollege fund. Economics teaches us about the power of incentives, which are central to\nthinking about and understanding regulatory and tax policy. But incentives also help\nmotivate people in a variety of other settings, such as encouraging students to do their\nbest in school, helping reduce traffic jams, or even nudging someone to save more or to\nexercise regularly. Economics is a practical and powerful tool for understanding how we\nrelate to each other.\nAnd that’s why what you do for your students is so important. Like all teachers,\nyou are helping prepare them for success in life. The knowledge you impart and the\nintellect and talents you help develop are tools that your students can use to achieve that\nsuccess. Economics teaches analytical and critical thinking skills useful to anyone. Part\nof your students’ success is their economic success as capable, creative, and productive\nmembers of the workforce and as consumers adept at managing their finances. Your\nstudents benefit from this education, but so does everyone else in society. We all benefit\nwhen better-educated citizens support economic policies that help our nation prosper.\nWe all benefit from the capability, creativity, and productivity of our workforce, because\nnothing is more important to a healthy and growing economy. Responsible consumers\nskilled in managing their finances are better prepared to weather bad times, and stronger\nhousehold finances overall can help sustain economic growth and mitigate a downturn.\n\n- 3 -\nStabilizing growth and mitigating a downturn, of course, are aspects of the\nFederal Reserve’s mission. Monetary policy can be a powerful tool to achieve these\nends, but, in truth, its powers are dwarfed by larger forces, such as the productivity of the\nAmerican people and the strength of their finances. By educating students and\nsupporting their future contributions to the economy as workers and consumers, all\nteachers, especially economics teachers, are furthering our goals at the Fed, so let me\noffer my further thanks for making our job easier.\nTo help support your work as teachers, the Federal Reserve Board and the\n12 Reserve Banks conduct programs, organize events, and publish books to spread\nknowledge of economics, financial literacy, and the role of the Fed in promoting a\nhealthy economy and financial system. You can find some of those resources at our\nwebsites: FederalReserve.gov and FederalReserveEducation.org.\nEach of the Reserve Banks has community outreach and educational initiatives,\nand the outreach to economics teachers is coordinated by the System Economic\nEducation Group, which has been chaired by Princeton Williams.\nAt the Board of Governors, for some years we have operated a program called\nFedEd, which sends Board employees into high schools throughout the Washington,\nD.C., area. This outreach depends on several dozen volunteers from our staff--typically,\nrecent college graduates--who help teach about the Fed, economics and finance, and\nanswer questions about work opportunities at the Board. The Federal Reserve is\ndedicated to promoting diversity in our ranks and in the economics profession, and FedEd\nand other programs across the Federal Reserve System have helped advance this goal by\nreaching many schools with significant numbers of minority students.\n\n- 4 -\nLet me leave it there, and again thank you for participating in this town hall, and\nthank you for the valuable work you do every school day.",

Powell\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nIntroducing the New York Innovation Center Event\nWashington, D.C.\n(via webcast)\n\nGood afternoon. It is a pleasure to welcome everyone, including colleagues from the\nBank for International Settlements (BIS) and in particular from the BIS Innovation Hub, to the\nopening of the New York Innovation Center.\nThe pace of technological change and innovation over the last decade has led some to\nargue that we are on the brink of a fourth industrial revolution—a digital revolution. Certainly,\nrapid innovation, including through the application of advanced digital technologies, machine\nlearning, artificial intelligence, and big data, is revolutionizing the financial sector. The Federal\nReserve has a mandate to understand and, in some cases, manage these changes, but it also has a\nresponsibility to be at the forefront of change to deliver to the American people—and the\ninternational community—a reliable, efficient, and inclusive monetary and financial system.\nFurthering the efforts around the Federal Reserve System to harness the power of\ninnovation, I am delighted to welcome the opening of the New York Innovation Center. Located\nat the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, in the heart of the most important financial center in\nthe world, this Innovation Center will draw on the expertise at the bank, in the Federal Reserve\nSystem, and from the broader financial community, as well as experts around the world to\nanalyze and bring technology to bear on improving the global financial system.\nIncreasing the synergies of the New York Innovation Center will be its strategic\npartnership with the BIS Innovation Hub, recently established to foster dialogue, collaboration\nand knowledge-sharing among central banks and other authorities and institutions. In particular,\nthe partnership will support our analysis of digital currencies—including central bank digital\ncurrencies; help to improve our current payment system—with a particular focus on making\ncross-border payments faster and less expensive; and it will provide new tools to aid our\nsupervision of the financial system.\n\nLinking up with the BIS in this way will enhance our ability to collaborate with central\nbanks around the world and will ensure that the best and most up-to-date information, research,\nand practices are flowing freely. Since its inception in January 2020, I have served as head of\nthe BIS Innovation Hub Advisory Committee and am very pleased that the Federal Reserve will\nbe able to partner with the Hub in this important way.\nSo I want to extend my thanks to President Williams, Agustin Carstens, and all those that\nworked on the establishment of this center. And I look forward to the advances of both these\ninstitutions in supporting innovation in service to the safety and soundness of the financial\nsystem.\nThank you.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n10:40 a.m. EDT\nOctober 6, 2020\nRecent Economic Developments and the Challenges Ahead\nRemarks by\nJerome H. Powell\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nNational Association for Business Economics\nVirtual Annual Meeting\nOctober 6, 2020\n\nGood morning. It has been just eight months since the pandemic first gained a\nfoothold on our shores, bringing with it the sharpest downturn on record, as well as the\nmost forceful policy response in living memory. Although it is too early for definitive\nconclusions, today I will offer a current assessment of the response to the economic\nfallout of this historic event and discuss the path ahead.\nThe Pre-COVID Economy\nAs the coronavirus spread across the globe, the U.S. economy was in its 128th\nmonth of expansion—the longest in our recorded history—and was generally in a strong\nposition. Moderate growth continued at a slightly above-trend pace. Labor market\nconditions were strong across a range of measures. The unemployment rate was running\nat 50-year lows. PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation was running just\nbelow our 2 percent target.\nThe economy did face longer-term challenges, as all economies do. Labor force\nparticipation among people in their prime working years had been trending down since\nthe turn of the millennium, and productivity gains during the expansion were\ndisappointing. Income and wealth disparities had been growing for several decades. As\nthe expansion continued its long run, however, productivity started to pick up, the labor\nmarket strengthened, and the benefits of growth began to be more widely shared. In\nparticular, improved labor market conditions during the past few years encouraged more\nprime-age workers to rejoin or remain in the labor force. Meanwhile, real wage gains for\nall workers picked up, especially for those in lower paying jobs.\nMost economic forecasters expected the expansion and its benefits to continue,\nand with good reason. There was no economy-threatening asset bubble to pop and no\n\n- 2 -\nunsustainable boom to bust. While nonfinancial business leverage appeared to be\nelevated, leverage in the household sector was moderate. The banking system was\nstrong, with robust levels of capital and liquidity. The COVID-19 recession was unusual\nin that it was not triggered by a buildup of financial or economic imbalances. Instead, the\npandemic shock was essentially a case of a natural disaster hitting a healthy economy.\nGiven the condition of the economy, in the early stages of the crisis it seemed\nplausible that, with a rapid, forceful, and sustained policy response, many sectors of the\neconomy would be able to bounce back strongly once the virus was under control. That\nresponse would need to come from actions across all levels of government, from health\nand fiscal authorities, and from the Federal Reserve.\nIt also seemed likely that the sectors most affected by the pandemic—those\nrelying on extensive in-person contact—would face a long and difficult path to recovery.\nThese sectors and people working in them would likely need targeted and sustained\npolicy support.\nSome asked what the Fed could do to address what was essentially a medical\nemergency. We identified three ways that our tools could help limit the economic\ndamage from the pandemic: providing stability and relief during the acute phase of the\ncrisis when much of the economy was shut down; vigorously supporting the expansion\nwhen it came; and doing what we could to limit longer-run damage to the productive\ncapacity of the economy.\nThe Recession and Nascent Recovery\nWhen it became clear in late February that the disease was spreading worldwide,\nfinancial markets were roiled by a global flight to cash. By the end of the month, many\n\n- 3 -\nimportant markets were faltering, raising the threat of a financial crisis that could\nexacerbate the economic fallout of the pandemic. Widespread economic shutdowns\nbegan in March, and in the United States, with many sectors shut down or operating well\nbelow capacity, real GDP fell 31 percent in the second quarter on an annualized basis.\nEmployers slashed payrolls by 22 million, with those on temporary layoff rising by\n17 million. Broader measures of labor market conditions, such as labor force\nparticipation and those working part time for economic reasons, showed further damage.\nIn response, we deployed the full range of tools at our disposal, cutting rates to\ntheir effective lower bound; conducting unprecedented quantities of asset purchases; and\nestablishing a range of emergency lending facilities to restore market function and\nsupport the flow of credit to households, businesses, and state and local governments.\nWe also implemented targeted and temporary measures to allow banks to better support\ntheir customers.\nThe fiscal response was truly extraordinary. The unanimous passage of the\nCARES Act and three other bills passed with broad support in March and April\nestablished wide-ranging programs that are expected to provide roughly $3 trillion in\neconomic support overall—by far the largest and most innovative fiscal response to an\neconomic crisis since the Great Depression.\nWhat have these policies managed to accomplish so far?\nFirst, the substantial fiscal aid has given vital support to households. The rise in\ntransfers supported necessary spending and contributed to a sharp increase in household\nsaving. Goods consumption is now above its pre-pandemic level. Services consumption\nremains low, although it seems likely that much of this weakness is the byproduct of\n\n- 4 -\nhealth concerns and social distancing, rather than reductions in income and wealth.\nConsumption held up well through August after the expiration of expanded\nunemployment insurance benefits, indicating that savings from transfer payments\ncontinue to support economic activity. A recent Fed survey showed that households in\nJuly had surprisingly upbeat views of their current financial well-being, with 77 percent\nof adults either “doing okay” or “living comfortably,” an improvement even over the\nreading immediately preceding the pandemic.1 Still, since it appears that many will\nundergo extended periods of unemployment, there is likely to be a need for further\nsupport.\nSecond, aid to firms—in particular, the Paycheck Protection Program—and the\ngeneral boost to aggregate demand have so far partly forestalled an expected wave of\nbankruptcies and lessened permanent layoffs. Business investment appears to be on a\nrenewed upward trajectory and new business formation similarly appears to be\nrebounding, pointing to some confidence in the path ahead.\nThird, after briefly seizing up in March, financial markets have largely returned to\nnormal functioning, albeit in the context of extensive ongoing policy support. Financial\nconditions are highly accommodative, and credit is available on reasonable terms for\nmany—though not all—households and businesses. Interest-sensitive spending has been\nrelatively strong, as shown in the housing and auto sectors.\nTaken together, fiscal and monetary policy actions have so far supported a strong\nbut incomplete recovery in demand and have—for now—substantially muted the normal\n1 See Update on the Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households: July 2020 Results, or SHED, issued in\nSeptember 2020 and available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/2019-report-economic-well-being-us-households-update-\n202009.pdf.\n\n- 5 -\nrecessionary dynamics that occur in a downturn. In a typical recession, there is a\ndownward spiral in which layoffs lead to still lower demand, and subsequent additional\nlayoffs. This dynamic was disrupted by the infusion of funds to households and\nbusinesses. Prompt and forceful policy actions were also likely responsible for reducing\nrisk aversion in financial markets and business decisions more broadly.\nWhile the combined effects of fiscal and monetary policy have aided the solid\nrecovery of the labor market so far, there is still a long way to go. Payrolls have now\nrecovered roughly half of the 22 million decline. After rising to 14.7 percent in April, the\nunemployment rate is back to 7.9 percent, clearly a significant and rapid rebound. A\nbroader measure that better captures current labor market conditions—by adjusting for\nmistaken characterizations of job status, and for the decline in labor force participation\nsince February—is running around 11 percent.\nThe burdens of the downturn have not been evenly shared. The initial job losses\nfell most heavily on lower-wage workers in service industries facing the public—job\ncategories in which minorities and women are overrepresented. In August, employment\nof those in the bottom quartile of the wage distribution was still 21 percent below its\nFebruary level, while it was only 4 percent lower for other workers.2 Combined with the\ndisproportionate effects of COVID on communities of color, and the overwhelming\nburden of childcare during quarantine and distance learning, which has fallen mostly on\nwomen, the pandemic is further widening divides in wealth and economic mobility.\n2 Using data from ADP, the Board staff estimate that at the end of April, 41 percent of the workers in the\nbottom quartile (based on their previous wage) had lost their jobs, compared with only 13 percent for the\nother three quartiles. See the Board’s June 2020 Monetary Policy Report, available at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/20200612_mprfullreport.pdf, for more details.\n\n- 6 -\nThe Road Ahead\nI will now turn to the outlook. The recovery has progressed more quickly than\ngenerally expected. The most recent projections by FOMC (Federal Open Market\nCommittee) participants at our September meeting show the recovery continuing at a\nsolid pace. The median participant saw unemployment declining to 4 percent and\ninflation reaching 2 percent by the end of 2023. Of course, the economy may perform\nbetter or worse than expected. The outlook remains highly uncertain, in part because it\ndepends on controlling the spread and effects of the virus. There is a risk that the rapid\ninitial gains from reopening may transition to a longer than expected slog back to full\nrecovery as some segments struggle with the pandemic’s continued fallout. The pace of\neconomic improvement has moderated since the outsize gains of May and June, as is\nevident in employment, income, and spending data. The increase in permanent job loss,\nas well as recent layoffs, are also notable.\nWe should continue do what we can to manage downside risks to the outlook.\nOne such risk is that COVID-19 cases might again rise to levels that more significantly\nlimit economic activity, not to mention the tragic effects on lives and well-being.\nManaging this risk as the expansion continues will require following medical experts’\nguidance, including using masks and social-distancing measures.\nA second risk is that a prolonged slowing in the pace of improvement over time\ncould trigger typical recessionary dynamics, as weakness feeds on weakness. A long\nperiod of unnecessarily slow progress could continue to exacerbate existing disparities in\nour economy. That would be tragic, especially in light of our country’s progress on these\nissues in the years leading up to the pandemic.\n\n- 7 -\nThe expansion is still far from complete. At this early stage, I would argue that\nthe risks of policy intervention are still asymmetric. Too little support would lead to a\nweak recovery, creating unnecessary hardship for households and businesses. Over time,\nhousehold insolvencies and business bankruptcies would rise, harming the productive\ncapacity of the economy, and holding back wage growth. By contrast, the risks of\noverdoing it seem, for now, to be smaller. Even if policy actions ultimately prove to be\ngreater than needed, they will not go to waste. The recovery will be stronger and move\nfaster if monetary policy and fiscal policy continue to work side by side to provide\nsupport to the economy until it is clearly out of the woods.\nGiven this audience, I would be remiss were I not to mention our review of our\nmonetary policy strategy, tools, and communications, which concluded recently with our\nadoption of a flexible average inflation-targeting regime. My colleagues and I have\ndiscussed this new framework in detail in recent remarks. Today I will just note that the\nunderlying structure of the economy changes over time, and that the FOMC’s framework\nfor conducting monetary policy must keep pace. The recent changes to our consensus\nstatement reflect our evolving understanding of several important developments. There\nhas been a decline in estimates of the potential or longer-run growth rate of the economy\nand in the general level of interest rates, presenting challenges for the ability of monetary\npolicy to respond to a downturn. On a more positive note, we have seen that the\neconomy can sustain historically high levels of employment, bringing significant societal\nbenefits and without causing a troubling rise in inflation. The new consensus statement\nacknowledges these developments and makes appropriate changes in our monetary policy\nframework to position the FOMC to best achieve its statutory goals.\n\n- 8 -\nThe forward rate guidance adopted at our September meeting reflects our new\nconsensus statement. The new guidance says that, with inflation running persistently\nbelow our longer-run 2 percent goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation\nmoderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time\nand longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. The\nCommittee expects to maintain an accommodative stance of policy until these outcomes\nare achieved. The Committee also left the target range for the federal funds rate\nunchanged at 0 to 1/4 percent, and it expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target\nrange until labor market conditions have reached levels that are consistent with the\nCommittee’s assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent\nand is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.\nWe expect that the new framework and guidance will support our efforts in\npursuit of a strong economic recovery.\nThank you. I look forward to our discussion.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n9:15 a.m. EDT\nNovember 8, 2023\nOpening Remarks\nby\nJerome H. Powell\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“A Look at the Past, Present, and Future,” a conference celebrating\nthe Centennial of the Division of Research and Statistics\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nWashington, D.C.\nNovember 8, 2023\n\nThank you, Stacey, for the chance to be part of this celebration. It is great to be\nhere to honor the Division of Research and Statistics (R&S) and humbling to see so many\nFed people who served the institution over long and distinguished careers and have\nreturned for this great occasion. The Fed is one of those places where you can work for a\ndecade or so and still feel like a newbie.\nFor those listening outside this room, I will briefly outline R&S’s responsibilities.\nA large part of the division, along with other divisions at the Board, is engaged in\nproducing the Tealbook, which contains the staff’s forecast for the U.S. economy, as well\nas a great deal of data and analysis on financial and economic issues, and which is\ndelivered to the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) before our meetings.\nOutside of the FOMC meeting cycle, R&S deploys its experts wherever they are\nneeded across the Board, providing crucial inputs to work on financial stability, bank\nmerger analysis, and many other topics. R&S is also an ongoing source of specialized\ninformation for policymakers. If Board members have questions about even the most\narcane workings of some aspect of the economy, they can send an email and, in no time,\nbe sitting down with some of the best-informed experts on that subject. Much of the\ntime, these are R&S economists. During the pandemic, when questions arose about how\nthe computer chip shortage was affecting auto production or how businesses were\nresponding to the backlog at U.S. ports, R&S gave detailed briefings on these topics.\nAmong its other activities, the Board of Governors is one of the world’s most productive\neconomic research institutions, and a large share of that work takes place inside R&S,\nsupporting our mission of promoting a healthy economy and a strong and stable financial\nsystem.\n\n- 2 -\nI’ve spoken about research—now let me turn to statistics. In addition to the\ngathering of data from many sources outside the Federal Reserve, R&S is itself the\nsource for some of the most important data on the economy and the financial system.\nOur consumer credit data provide financial markets and the public with a vital indicator\nof the strength of household spending and balance sheets. Each month, the Industrial\nProduction report gives us insights into how well certain sectors of the economy,\nespecially in the manufacturing realm, are operating. R&S is also responsible for the\nFinancial Accounts of the United States, a quarterly compendium of assets, liabilities,\nand transactions for different segments of the economy. And every three years, R&S\nconducts the Survey of Consumer Finances, a premier source of detail and insights about\nhow households are faring in the economy. The latest survey was published just last\nmonth. These and other data series produced by R&S are a significant public service.\nI want to focus in more detail on the forecast, perhaps the most important of\nR&S’s roles. The U.S. economy baseline forecast produced by R&S, along with the\nsimulation of a half-dozen plausible alternative paths, constitutes the largest part of the\nessential bedrock that enables our pursuit of our dual-mandate goals.\nSome people are attracted to extremely challenging tasks. The people of R&S are\nthose people, having chosen such a task in forecasting the path of the U.S. economy,\neight times a year for FOMC meetings, with ongoing updates between meetings. They\ndo this work on the biggest stage and with the highest stakes, knowing that the economy\nvery often surprises us.\nSeveral qualities are required to do this work well.\n\n- 3 -\nI will start with an intense commitment. The work requires everything you have\nto give. You have to love this work to do it well.\nThe job also requires integrity—policymakers count on R&S to give us their best\nthinking, not shading the results for any reason.\nRegular forecasting also demands a systematic approach and a high degree of\nintellectual rigor. Ask Stacey and her colleagues to explain a certain aspect of the\nforecast, and you will find that they have a clear explanation grounded in a rigorous\nframework.\nThat intellectual rigor has to be combined with flexibility and agility. Economic\nmodels can do a reasonably good job of capturing the working of the economy over past\ndecades. Of course, even with state-of-the-art models and even in relatively calm times,\nthe economy frequently surprises us. But our economy is flexible and dynamic, and\nsubject at times to unpredictable shocks, such as a global financial crisis or a pandemic.\nAt those times, forecasters have to think outside the models.\nThis work also takes large doses of courage and humility. And, finally, judgment.\nTo complement this rigorous process, there has to be good judgment, based on\nknowledge and experience.\nPerhaps the most important legacy of the past century for the Division of\nResearch and Statistics is the resilience, the creativity, the energy, the rigor, and the\ncommitment with which R&S has risen to the many challenges it and our country have\nfaced in that span of history. On behalf of the Board and the FOMC, thank you for that,\nand hearty congratulations on your first 100 years of service to the public.",

I have attended this conference twice before, including the first one back in\n2013, and I can attest to the quality of the research and discussions. While I am coming\nto you virtually today, many of you are gathering in person for the first time in three\nyears. I am sure it will make an excellent event even more enjoyable.\nThe Community Banking Research Conference brings together researchers,\nregulators, policymakers, and community bankers to discuss the unique and important\nrole community banks play in our economy. The conference was launched in the years\nfollowing the financial crisis, in a collaboration by the Federal Reserve, the Conference\nof State Bank Supervisors (CSBS), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\n(FDIC). The conference was developed to deepen our understanding of the community\nbank business model and to provide a forum to discuss research with academics,\npolicymakers, regulators, and community bankers.\nThe research presented over the years has informed supervisory and regulatory\npolicy debates and continues to challenge our thinking. It has highlighted the vital links\nbetween community banks and small businesses, the availability of credit in low- and\nmoderate-income communities, how community banks support their local communities in\ntimes of crisis, and the impact of technology.\nA critical feature of the research sessions is that community bankers join\nacademic moderators to provide feedback from a practitioner’s perspective. The\nchallenges facing community banks have changed significantly over the past 10 years.\nCommunity banks have demonstrated remarkable resilience, and conferences like this\nhave helped regulators and supervisors to better understand those changes.\n\n- 2 -\nI want to congratulate the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis for a decade of\nhosting an important and informative conference.\nAnd I want to thank our colleagues at the Fed, the FDIC, and the Conference of\nState Bank Supervisors. On a sadder note, I want to recognize the passing of John Ryan,\nwho was president of the CSBS, this past May. John’s impact on the CSBS and his\ncontributions to the financial services sector overall were significant, and he is missed by\nall who knew and worked with him.\nThanks also to the researchers and all the community banking professionals for\ntheir insight and contributions over the years.\nThank you all, and have a great conference.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n6:45 p.m. EST\nDecember 6, 2018\nWelcoming Remarks\nby\nJerome H. Powell\nChairman\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nHousing Assistance Council’s 2018 Rural Housing Conference\nWashington, D.C.\nDecember 6, 2018\n\nThank you for the kind introduction, and thank you to the Housing Assistance\nCouncil (HAC) for inviting me to be part of this discussion of rural housing. I\nunderstand that you will shortly be presenting awards to people who are working at the\nlocal and national levels and in both the public and private sectors and whose efforts have\nimproved housing conditions for the rural poor. All of you who work in these roles are\ndoing your country a great service by helping to advance economic opportunity in our\ncommunities. I want to thank the award recipients for the difference you make in the\nlives of people in rural communities.\nI am happy to report that our economy is currently performing very well overall,\nwith strong job creation and gradually rising wages. The unemployment rate is\n3.7 percent, the lowest since 1969. A strong job market has encouraged more people to\nparticipate in the labor market, another positive development. In fact, by many national-\nlevel measures, our labor market is very strong.\nAs those at this conference are acutely aware, however, aggregate statistics can\nmask important variations between different demographic and income groups, as well as\nsignificant regional differences. For example, unemployment rates in some persistently\npoor rural counties remain much higher than the national figures. The annual average\nunemployment rate in 2017 exceeded 10 percent in 27 persistently poor rural counties,\nand the rate was 20 percent or more in 2 of those counties. Recent Fed research found\nthat, since 2007, labor force participation rates for those in their prime working years in\nrural areas have increasingly lagged rates in urban areas. Labor force participation has\nbeen particularly low for those with only a high school diploma or less.1 Research has\n1 Alison Weingarden (2017), “Labor Market Outcomes in Metropolitan and Non-Metropolitan Areas:\nSigns of Growing Disparities,” FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\n\n- 2 -\nalso found that business formation and employment growth during the recovery have\nbeen concentrated in large urban areas.2 Data and research findings like these remind us\nthat, despite positive trends in national data, the benefits of the ongoing economic\nexpansion are still not reaching some communities.\nThrough the Fed’s 12 Reserve Banks and their branches, we are able to get a\nclearer picture of conditions in individual communities across the nation. Each of the\nReserve Banks has an active, well-staffed community development function--one of the\ngreat benefits of the Federal Reserve’s structure. We get important and timely\ninformation on the state of local economic and financial conditions, including those\naffecting low- and moderate-income, as well as other underserved, communities.\nOur community development staff provide us with a more nuanced understanding\nof current economic and financial conditions. They also help people in low-income and\nunderserved communities overcome the challenges they face. We support numerous\ninitiatives in rural communities across the country, several of which I would like to\nhighlight.\nThe first initiative is the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis’s longtime\ncommitment to the Mississippi and Arkansas Delta region. This region has struggled for\ndecades with persistent intergenerational poverty and a lack of resources and capacity to\naddress this challenge. Most recently, in 2016 the St. Louis Fed launched the Delta\nCommunities Initiative, and since then it has held 26 regional forums with more than\n500 participants. These forums help to build awareness of promising tools and strategies\nSystem, September 25), https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/labor-market-outcomes-\nin-metropolitan-and-non-metropolitan-areas-signs-of-growing-disparities-20170925.htm.\n2 See, for example, Economic Innovation Group (2016), The New Map of Economic Growth and Recovery\n(Washington: EIG, May), https://eig.org/recoverymap.\n\n- 3 -\nfor community and economic development. A recent survey of participants suggests that\nthese forums are making a real difference.\nA second example is the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas’s commitment to\nadvancing digital inclusion in low-income rural communities. Despite significant effort\nand advances made by public, private, and nonprofit organizations in recent years, nearly\n30 percent of rural households continue to lack access to broadband internet service.\nAlso, fewer than half of households earning less than $20,000 per year have such\nservice.3 In an increasingly digital economy, lack of access to high-speed internet and the\nknowledge of how to make the best use of it limits the ability of families and entire\ncommunities to reach their full potential. To address this problem, the Dallas Fed has\nexplored the role of the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) in addressing the digital\ndivide, the potential for technology to bridge the urban-rural divide in access to health\ncare, and the critical importance of preparing workers for the digital economy.4\nThird and last, community development staff at the Federal Reserve Board and\nseveral Reserve Banks have conducted research to better understand housing affordability\nchallenges affecting rural communities nationwide, recognizing the importance of\nsufficient affordable housing to a community’s economic vitality. Researchers found\nthat, as in many urban areas nationwide, a large portion of renters in rural communities\n3 Housing Assistance Council (2018), “Creating Connections: What Broadband Means for Rural\nAmerica,” Rural Voices, vol. 22 (2), available at http://www.ruralhome.org.\n4 For example, see Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas (2016), Closing the Digital Divide: A Framework for\nMeeting CRA Obligations (Dallas: FRB Dallas, July, rev. December 2016),\nhttps://www.dallasfed.org/~/media/documents/cd/pubs/digitaldivide.pdf; Jordana Barton (2018),\n“Telehealth along the Texas-Mexico Border,” Rural Health Quarterly, June,\nhttp://ruralhealthquarterly.com/home/2018/06/23/telehealth-along-the-texas-mexico-border;\nand Jordana Barton (2018). “Preparing Workers for the Expanding Digital Economy,” Investing in\nAmerica’s Workforce: Improving Outcomes for Workers and Employers, August, available at\nhttps://www.dallasfed.org/cd/digital.\n\n- 4 -\nstruggle to afford their rent--a finding that will not come as a surprise in this room.\nFortunately, our staff also highlighted promising policy and practice solutions that have\nbeen implemented in some communities to try to address these challenges, including the\nestablishment of dedicated funding for affordable housing and the elimination of\nexclusionary land use and zoning policies.5\nWhile this type of research and community engagement work is a central\ncomponent of our efforts to support rural areas, we also know that communities need\nresources and dedicated local partners to help implement many of the strategies involved.\nCRA has been an important tool for strengthening local community and economic\ndevelopment infrastructure since it was enacted in 1977. We also recognize that\nsignificant changes in the financial services industry since then have hindered the law’s\neffectiveness, especially in rural communities, and that an update of the implementing\nregulations is appropriate. As my colleague Governor Brainard has noted, one of the\nprinciples guiding our CRA modernization work is that any redesign of CRA regulations\nshould continue to encourage banks to seek opportunities in underserved areas, including\nrural communities.\nI understand that the HAC has done considerable research and stakeholder\nengagement to shed light on the barriers to the effective use of CRA in rural\ncommunities; all of that work will benefit our reform efforts. The Fed’s ongoing series of\n5 For example, see Ann Carpenter, Douglas White, and Mary Hirt (2018), “Rental Housing Affordability in\nthe Southeast: Data from the Sixth District,” Community and Economic Development Discussion Paper\n2-18 (Atlanta: Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, July), https://www.frbatlanta.org/community-\ndevelopment/publications/discussion-papers/2018/02-rental-housing-affordability-in-the-southeast-2018-\n07-19.aspx; and Andrew Dumont (2018), “Rural Affordable Rental Housing: Quantifying Need,\nReviewing Recent Federal Support, and Assessing the Use of Low Income Housing Tax Credits in Rural\nAreas,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2018-077.

These perspectives will inform our deliberations on this critical\nregulation, and we will make a summary of our discussions available to the public.\nIn closing, while the economy is strong overall, we recognize that some\ncommunities have yet to feel the full benefits of the ongoing expansion. We are\nconducting research, collaborating with communities, and assessing financial regulations\nso that our nation’s current prosperity will benefit small towns and cities alike. The work\nbeing done by tonight’s award recipients and by each of you in this room is critical to\nmaking progress toward that goal. Thank you for being our partners in this work, and\nenjoy the conference.",

Powell\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“2016 U.S. Monetary Policy Forum”\nAn annual conference sponsored by\nUniversity of Chicago Booth School of Business\nNew York, New York\nFebruary 26, 2016\n\nThis paper reviews Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) communications\nfrom the time the Committee began issuing regular postmeeting statements in 1999 to the\npresent.1 The authors provide an extended and insightful discussion of the theory and\npractice of providing forward guidance about monetary policy. They offer one central\nlesson: Data-based forward guidance is mostly good, while time-based forward guidance\nis mostly bad.\nThe authors show that data-based guidance has desirable characteristics and can\nmake monetary policy more effective. When clearly articulated and well understood, it\nallows markets to react appropriately to incoming data, doing the heavy lifting for the\ncentral bank.\nTime-based guidance is found to have certain bad characteristics and should be\navoided, except at the zero lower bound and when other options are not available or not\nworking. Time-based guidance may reduce the sensitivity of rates to incoming\nmacroeconomic data, suppress volatility, encourage risk-taking and increased leverage,\nand threaten financial stability. It may also put policymakers in a box when changes in\nthe economy make it optimal to deviate from previously expressed guidance, but the\nCommittee cannot do so without losing credibility.\nThe authors blame time-based guidance for several episodes in which the\nCommittee zigged when the market looked for it to zag, leaving market participants\nunhappy and, in the authors’ view, the FOMC’s credibility damaged. They argue that the\n1 The views expressed here are my own, and not those of the FOMC.\nSee Michael Feroli, David Greenlaw, Peter Hooper, Frederic Mishkin, and Amir Sufi (2016),\n“Language after Liftoff: Fed Communication Away from the Zero Lower Bound,” paper presented at the\n2016 U.S. Monetary Policy Forum, a conference sponsored by the University of Chicago Booth School of\nBusiness, held in New York, February 26; see\nhttps://research.chicagobooth.edu/igm/events/conferences/2016-usmonetaryforum.aspx.\n\n- 2 -\nCommittee has relied too much on time-based guidance in recent years and should use it\nonly parsimoniously in the future.\nI commend the authors for undertaking this enormously challenging and useful\nexercise. The paper forces us to reconsider the Committee’s evolving understanding of\nthe macroeconomic environment before, during, and after the Great Recession; its\ndecisions and its communications; and the market’s understanding of those decisions,\nwhich have sometimes deviated from what the Committee actually said.\nThe distinction between time-based and data-based guidance is an important one,\nand the potential problems with time-based guidance are real and well described in the\npaper. That said, I am not convinced that this distinction has played a central role in\ndetermining the successes and challenges of FOMC communications in this remarkable\nera, or that it helps us improve in the future. The authors are, in their words,\n“unabashedly judgmental” in labeling specific communications to be either time- or data-\nbased.2 My own judgments differ in significant respects from those described in the\npaper.\nDiscussion of Forward Guidance\nI will start in December 2008, when the Committee said that “weak economic\nconditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for\nsome time.”3 This relatively weak time-based guidance was strengthened in a series of\nsteps until August 2011, when the time-based language became “at least through mid-\n2 See Feroli and others, “Language after Liftoff,” in note 1, p. 20.\n3 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2008), “FOMC Statement and Board Approval of\nDiscount Rate Requests of the Federal Reserve Banks of New York, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta,\nMinneapolis, and San Francisco,” press release, December 16, paragraph 4,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20081216b.htm.\n\n- 3 -\n2013.”4 The calendar reference was later extended in a couple of steps to “at least\nthrough mid-2015.”5 This guidance was explicitly time-based, and the authors seem to\nagree that, through this point, the guidance served its intended purpose at the zero lower\nbound by pushing down medium- and longer-term rates.6\nAt the December 2012 meeting, the Committee ended this calendar-based\nguidance. The Committee instead adopted thresholds, saying that it did not intend to\nraise rates at least as long as unemployment remained above 6½ percent, inflation one to\ntwo years ahead was projected to be no higher than 2½ percent, and longer-term inflation\nexpectations remained well anchored.7 The adoption of thresholds was a clear change to\ndata-based guidance, as its principal sponsors had frequently urged.8 The point was not\n4 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2011), “FOMC Statement,” press release, August 9,\nparagraph 3, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20110809a.htm.\n5 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2012), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement,”\npress release, September 13, paragraph 5,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20120913a.htm.\n6 Some viewed this guidance as merely a forecast of Committee action, designed to better inform the\nmarket and reduce uncertainty. Others have argued that such guidance is understood as a promise to which\nthe Committee will be held irrespective of future macroeconomic developments. The Committee never\noffered a single explanation, and participants may have had different views. Engen, Laubach, and\nReifschneider (2015) argue that the Federal Reserve’s time-based guidance initiated in August 2011 was\nhighly effective in inducing market participants to change their beliefs about the Committee’s reaction\nfunction and to regard monetary policy as more accommodative. Using Blue Chip survey data, the authors\nestimate that the perceived weight on resource slack roughly doubled between March 2011 and March\n2012. In an August 2011 speech, Chairman Bernanke indicated that the guidance about the federal funds\nrate path was highly conditional on the outlook, saying, “in what the Committee judges to be the most\nlikely scenarios for resource utilization and inflation in the medium term, the target for the federal funds\nrate would be held at its current low levels for at least two more years.” (Ben S. Bernanke (2011), “The\nNear- and Longer-Term Prospects for the U.S. Economy,” a speech delivered at “Achieving Maximum\nLong-Run Growth,” a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, held in Jackson\nHole, Wyo., August 26, p. 7, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20110826a.pdf.)\n7 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2012), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement,”\npress release, December 12, paragraph 5,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20121212a.htm.\n8 For example, see Charles L. Evans (2012), “Macroeconomic Effects of FOMC Forward Guidance,”\nspeech delivered at the Spring Panel on Economic Activity, Brookings Institution, Washington, March 22,\nhttps://www.chicagofed.org/publications/speeches/2012/03-22-12-brookings; and Alejandro Justiniano,\nCharles L.

The\nfirst two programs of large-scale asset purchases (LSAPs), popularly known as QE1 and\nQE2, and the maturity extension program were announced in terms of time and quantity--\nthat is, a certain quantity of assets would be purchased over a certain time. In adopting\nQE3, by contrast, the Committee committed to continuing purchases until there was a\nsubstantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market.10 QE3 was fully data-\ncontingent.\nFormer Chairman Bernanke recounts in his recent book that he saw QE3 as akin\nto Mario Draghi’s statement that the European Central Bank would do “whatever it\ntakes.”11 He also notes that FOMC participants held divergent views on the potential\ncosts and benefits of the program. Minutes of the relevant meetings described the\ncomplex discussions and differing views. Contemporaneous reports by Wall Street\nanalysts show frustration and confusion about the Committee’s intentions.\nWhen various FOMC communications suggested that the time to begin reducing\npurchases was nearing, long-term rates rose sharply--the so-called taper tantrum. The\n9 The thresholds’ useful life was fairly short because the unemployment rate fell sharply, from 8.0 percent\nin December 2012 to 6.2 percent in April 2014, while inflation remained below 2.0 percent.\n10 The December 2012 FOMC statement indicated that, “If the outlook for the labor market does not\nimprove substantially, the Committee will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed\nsecurities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until such improvement is achieved in a context\nof price stability. In determining the size, pace, and composition of its asset purchases, the Committee will,\nas always, take appropriate account of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.” (Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System (2012), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement,” press\nrelease, December 12, paragraph 4, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20121212a.htm.)\n11 Ben S. Bernanke (2015), The Courage to Act: A Memoir of a Crisis and Its Aftermath (New York:\nW.W. Norton), p. 532.\n\n- 5 -\ncontention of this paper is that time-based guidance was responsible. But as the paper\nacknowledges, the open-ended, data-contingent nature of the QE3 program created a\nstrong sense that the Fed was “all in” and that the purchases might go on for a long time.\nThat powerful commitment “would set things up for some fireworks” when the time\ncame to provide more precise guidance as to the timing of tapering, whether that was\ndone through time- or data-based guidance.12 While Committee communications are\nsubject to fair criticism, I don’t see an important role in this narrative for time-based\nguidance.\nLet’s turn briefly to 2015 and the run-up to last December’s increase in the federal\nfunds rate--also an important focus of the paper. The authors and many market\nparticipants are critical of communication around the September meeting. With the June\n2015 Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) showing that 15 of 17 FOMC participants\njudged that appropriate policy would entail an initial increase in the federal funds rate by\nthe end of 2015, markets saw about a 50 percent chance that the first increase would\noccur in September. This probability fell to about 30 percent after global markets\nexperienced a sudden bout of volatility following China’s surprise devaluation of its\ncurrency in August. At the September meeting, the FOMC decided to wait to see how\nglobal markets and the economy evolved, noting in its statement that “Recent global\neconomic and financial developments may restrain economic activity somewhat and are\nlikely to put further downward pressure on inflation in the near term.”13\n12 See Feroli and others, “Language after Liftoff,” in note 1, p. 29.\n13 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2015), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement,”\npress release, September 17, paragraph 2,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20150917a.htm.\n\n- 6 -\nA data-driven Committee, making decisions meeting by meeting, is likely to\nsurprise markets from time to time. The authors join many others in criticizing the\n“measured pace” period of 2004 through 2006, during which the Committee increased\nrates by 25 basis points at 17 consecutive FOMC meetings. A common criticism has\nbeen that this high level of predictability made investors complacent, encouraging a\nbuildup of leverage and helping set the stage for the Global Financial Crisis. That\ncriticism may well overstate the importance of the Committee’s communications;\nnonetheless, a number of FOMC participants have said that the Committee intends to be\n“data driven” and not fall into an excessively predictable, data-insensitive path. Lower\npredictability implies more surprises.\nIn the statement released after its October 2015 meeting, the Committee\nreemphasized data dependence and focused on the importance of incoming data for the\nCommittee’s decision “at its next meeting,” which led the market to increase its estimated\nprobability of a December rate increase from 38 percent to 50 percent.14 The October\nand November non-farm payroll reports came in strong and above expectations, raising\nthat probability by the time of the December meeting to about 90 percent. In other\nwords, the Committee used modest time-based guidance to set the stage and then let\nincoming data do the heavy lifting. In the statement released after the FOMC’s most\nrecent meeting in January, the Committee said that, in evaluating future adjustments to\nthe target range for the federal funds rate, it would “assess realized and expected\neconomic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent\n14 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2015), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement,”\npress release, October 28, paragraph 3,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20151028a.htm.\n\n- 7 -\ninflation.”15 This language shows that the Committee has moved away from the time-\nbased guidance of the crisis years.\nAlthough time-based guidance can create communications challenges, I see other\nfactors as having been more important in recent years. In particular, the challenge of\ndeciding when and how to use unconventional tools--and ultimately when and how to\nreduce that usage--is a great one. The task of communicating clearly about those\ndecisions is equally great. And the reality of the FOMC’s size and diversity, not to\nmention uncertainty about the evolving structure of the economy and the effects of\nmonetary policy actions, means that we are still far from the ideal world of a fully\nworked out, clearly specified and transparent consensus on what economists call a\n“reaction function”--a complete description of how policy will respond to changes in\neconomic conditions.\nOften when communicating about the path of policy, it will be hard to avoid a\ncombination of the two forms of guidance. For example, the Committee has embraced\nthe view that the equilibrium level of the federal funds rate is currently below its pre-\ncrisis level and expects the funds rate to return only gradually to its longer-run value.16\nThis view is a key aspect of many Committee participants’ reaction functions, including\nmine. Try saying that without referring to time.\n15 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2016), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement,”\npress release, January 27, paragraph 4,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20160127a.htm.\n16 For example, the January 2016 FOMC statement says, “The Committee expects that economic conditions\nwill evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds\nrate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.” (Board\nof Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2016), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement,” press\nrelease, January 27, paragraph 4, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20160127a.htm.)\n\n- 8 -\nThe authors acknowledge that the distinction between rules and discretion is too\nsimple to capture the problems that monetary policymakers face.17 I would say the same\nof the distinction between time-based and data-based forward guidance.\nLessons Learned and Suggested Improvements\nBefore turning to the paper’s conclusions, I would like to put the Federal\nReserve’s communications into a broader context. In recent years, the FOMC has\nadopted many new and significant communications tools. Since the fall of 2007,\npolicymakers have submitted projections in conjunction with four FOMC meetings each\nyear; in 2012, those projections were augmented to include each participant’s path for\nappropriate monetary policy. In 2011, the Chairman began holding quarterly press\nconferences. In 2012, the Committee first released its statement on Longer-run Goals\nand Monetary Policy Strategy, which formalized the FOMC’s 2 percent inflation\nobjective and is reaffirmed each year at the January meeting. These and other changes\nhave kept the Federal Reserve among the world’s most transparent central banks in its\ncommunications with the public.\nWith that as background, I find significant grounds for agreement and further\nanalysis in the paper’s concluding section, which lays out lessons learned and suggested\nimprovements. The discussion of what is colloquially known as the “dot plot” included\nin the SEP is particularly interesting. The dot plot represents each FOMC participant’s\n17 Feroli and others, “Language after Liftoff,” in note 1, p. 11; and Ben S. Bernanke and Frederic S.\nMishkin (1997), “Inflation Targeting: A New Framework for Monetary Policy?” Journal of Economic\nPerspectives, vol. 11 (Spring), pp. 97-116.\n\n- 9 -\nindividual assessment of the path of the federal funds rate over the next three years that is\nmost likely to promote maximum employment and stable prices.18\nThe dot plot presents a number of challenges. The individual dots are not tied to\nthe individual macroeconomic forecasts presented in the SEP, and no information is\nprovided on the identity of the forecaster--for example, voting members of the\nCommittee are not distinguished from non-voting participants. There is no easy path to\nthe identification of a Committee reaction function. The dots speak as of their date of\npublication after the FOMC meetings held in March, June, September, and December.\nThree months pass between SEPs. The economic outlook can change quite significantly,\nmaking the reigning dots look out of touch. On occasion, the dot plot and the\npostmeeting statement have seemed to send conflicting signals. The dot plot reflects\nindividual views of appropriate policy, while the postmeeting statement reflects the\nconsensus of the Committee.\nThe authors weigh these challenges and ponder whether to eliminate the dot plot;\nsome appear to favor that idea.19 I doubt that most market participants would welcome\nthe elimination of this chart. The SEP provides a number of benefits. It requires FOMC\nparticipants to write down their forecasts for inflation, unemployment, and growth, as\n18 In the SEP collected prior to the March and June FOMC meetings, participants submit projections for the\ncurrent calendar year and two subsequent years; in the September SEP, the forecast horizon is extended out\nan additional calendar year. Thus, the forecast window does not remain constant for the different SEPs in a\ngiven year; Wrightson commentary has suggested that a rolling forecast horizon might be an improvement\nover the current calendar-year focus (Wrightson ICAP (2016), “January 26-27 FOMC Minutes Recap,”\nFebruary 18).\n19 For instance, Michael Feroli (as quoted in a recent article) said, “I think they have outlived their\nusefulness and they risk sending a signal that (Fed officials) have a ‘plan’ rather than that they are data\ndependent” (see Ann Saphir (2016), “Fed’s ‘Dot Plot’ Looks Increasingly out of Touch on Rates,” Markets,\nReuters, February 14, paragraph 8, http://in.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-path-analysis-\nidINKCN0VN0PU); and in a 2012 speech, former Governor of the Bank of Canada Mark Carney stated,\n“Overall research has not generally found that publishing a path leads to better outcomes.” (Mark Carney\n(2012), “Guidance,” a speech delivered to the CFA Society Toronto, Toronto, Canada, December 11,\nparagraph 24, www.bankofcanada.ca/2012/12/guidance.\n\n- 10 -\nwell as their assessments of appropriate monetary policy. This exercise helps\npolicymakers to be more systematic. In addition, by observing how the SEP changes\nover time, the public can better understand how Committee members react to changes in\nthe economy. My view is that the dot plot, on balance, is helpful to market participants\nand hence to the Committee. As the dot plot enters its fifth year of existence, my hope is\nthat we will be able to capture those benefits while avoiding its shortcomings.\nI agree with the paper’s suggestion of greater emphasis on the degree of\nuncertainty around the projections, which is much larger than the dispersion of the\nindividual forecasts. As you know, at its January meeting, the Committee discussed\nadding fan charts to the SEP. Fan charts could help emphasize that the economic outlook\nis uncertain, and that consequently there is considerable uncertainty around the path of\npolicy.\n\nDiscussion of “Language after Liftoff:\nFed Communication Away from\nthe Zero Lower Bound”\nU.S. Monetary Policy Forum\nFebruary 26, 2016\nGovernor Jerome H.

Powell\nChairman\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nRhode Island Business Leaders Day\nWashington, D.C.\nSeptember 27, 2018\n\nGood afternoon. Thank you, Senator Reed, for the kind words and the\nopportunity to be a part of the annual Rhode Island Business Leaders Day. And thank\nyou, all, for sticking with the program for the last speaker of the day. The Federal Open\nMarket Committee, the body within the Federal Reserve that sets monetary policy, just\nconcluded a meeting yesterday. I plan to talk briefly about how my colleagues and I see\nthe economy evolving and our role in keeping it healthy. Importantly, I want to hear\nfrom you. I very much appreciate your views, as business people, of economic\nconditions where you live and work. And, of course, I will be happy to respond to\nquestions.\nOur economy is strong. Growth is running at a healthy clip. Unemployment is\nlow, the number of people working is rising steadily, and wages are up. Inflation is low\nand stable. All of these developments are very good signs. Of course, that is not to say\nthat everything is perfect. The benefits of this strong economy have not reached all\nAmericans. Many of our country’s economic challenges are beyond the scope of the Fed,\nbut we are doing all we can to keep the economy strong and moving forward. That is the\nbest way we can promote an environment in which every American has the opportunity\nto succeed.\nEach time we meet, we face the same question: How can we set monetary policy\nto best support job growth and low, steady inflation? For many years, this question\ncalled for very low interest rates to help an economy that had been damaged by the deep\nfinancial crisis that gripped the world 10 years ago. As the economy has steadily gained\nstrength, the Fed has been gradually returning interest rates closer to the levels that are\nnormal in a healthy economy. We took another step on that path yesterday, with a\n\n- 2 -\nquarter-point increase in short-term interest rates. These rates remain low, and my\ncolleagues and I believe that this gradual return to normal is helping to sustain this strong\neconomy for the longer-run benefit of all Americans.\nAs I mentioned, 10 years have now passed since the depths of the financial\ncrisis--a painful part of our history that cost many Americans their jobs, their homes, and,\nfor some, their hopes and dreams. In addition to holding interest rates low to support the\nrecovery, we have taken many steps to make the financial system safer. In particular, we\nare holding the largest banks to much higher standards in the amount of capital and\nliquidity they hold and in the ways they assess and manage the risks they take. I am\nconfident that the system today is stronger and in a far better position to support the\nfinancial needs of households and businesses through good times and bad. We continue\nto work to sustain these fundamental improvements while also ensuring that regulation is\nboth effective and efficient.\nThank you. I am happy to take your questions.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n7:00 p.m. EST\nNovember 25, 2019\nBuilding on the Gains from the Long Expansion\nRemarks by\nJerome H. Powell\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nAnnual Meeting of the Greater Providence Chamber of Commerce\nProvidence, Rhode Island\nNovember 25, 2019\n\nOver the past year, my colleagues and I on the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC) have been conducting a first-ever public review of how we make monetary\npolicy. As part of that review, we held Fed Listens events around the country where\nrepresentatives from a wide range of groups have been telling us how the economy is\nworking for them and the people they represent and how the Federal Reserve might better\npromote the goals Congress has set for us: maximum employment and price stability.\nWe have heard two messages loud and clear. First, as this expansion continues into its\n11th year—the longest in U.S. history—economic conditions are generally good.\nSecond, the benefits of the long expansion are only now reaching many communities, and\nthere is plenty of room to build on the impressive gains achieved so far.\nThese themes show through in many ways in official statistics. For example,\nmore than a decade of steady advances has pushed the jobless rate near a 50-year low,\nwhere it has remained for well over a year. But the wealth of middle-income families—\nsavings, home equity, and other assets—has only recently surpassed levels seen before\nthe Great Recession, and the wealth of people with lower incomes, while growing, has\nyet to fully recover.1\nFortunately, the outlook for further progress is good: Forecasters are generally\npredicting continued growth, a strong job market, and inflation near 2 percent. Tonight I\nwill begin by discussing the Fed’s policy actions over the past year to support the\nfavorable outlook. Then I will turn to two important opportunities for further gains from\n1 These wealth calculations are from the Federal Reserve’s Distributional Financial Accounts (DFAs). For\nmore details on the DFAs, see Michael Batty, Joseph Briggs, Karen Pence, Paul Smith, and Alice Volz\n(2019), “The Distributional Financial Accounts,” FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System, August 30), https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/the-\ndistributional-financial-accounts-20190830.htm. To view or download the data, see the interactive\nvisualization tool at https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/dataviz/dfa/index.html.\n\n- 2 -\nthis expansion: maintaining a stable and reliable pace of 2 percent inflation and\nspreading the benefits of employment more widely.\nMonetary Policy and the Economy in 2019\nWe started 2019 with a favorable outlook, and over the year the outlook has\nchanged only modestly in the eyes of many forecasters (figure 1). For example, in the\nSurvey of Professional Forecasters, the forecast for inflation is a bit lower, but the\nunemployment forecast is unchanged and the forecast for gross domestic product (GDP)\nis nearly unchanged.2 The key to the ongoing favorable outlook is household spending,\nwhich represents about 70 percent of the economy and continues to be strong, supported\nby the healthy job market, rising incomes, and solid consumer confidence.\nWhile events of the year have not much changed the outlook, the process of\ngetting from there to here has been far from dull. I will describe how we grappled with\nincoming information and made important monetary policy changes through the year to\nhelp keep the favorable outlook on track.\nAs the year began, growth appeared robust, but the economy faced some risks\nflowing mainly from weakening global economic growth and trade developments.\nForeign growth, which slipped in the second half of last year, slid further as 2019\nprogressed. While weaker foreign growth does not necessarily translate into similar\nweakness here, it does hurt our exporters and presents a risk that the weakness may\nspread more broadly. At the same time, business contacts around the country have been\ntelling us that trade-related uncertainties are weighing on their decisions. These global\ndevelopments have been holding back overall economic growth. Manufacturing output,\n2 The projections of FOMC participants as reported in the Summary of Economic Projections show a\nsimilar change.\n\n- 3 -\nwhich had only recently surpassed its level before the Great Recession, has declined this\nyear and is again below its pre-recession peak. Business investment has also weakened.\nIn addition, inflation pressures proved unexpectedly muted this year. After\nremaining close to our symmetric 2 percent objective for much of last year, inflation is\nnow running below 2 percent. Some of the softness in overall inflation is the result of a\nfall in oil prices and should not affect inflation going forward. But core inflation—which\nomits volatile food and energy prices—is also running somewhat below 2 percent.\nThe main themes of our deliberations this year have been a continuing favorable\noutlook founded on strength in the household sector, with a few yellow flags including\nmuted inflation and weakness in manufacturing. In addition, global growth and trade\nhave presented ongoing risks and uncertainties. We also faced some less prominent\nfactors that always confront policymakers. Specifically, we never have a crystal clear\nreal-time picture of how the economy is performing. In addition, the precise timing and\nsize of the effects of our policy decisions cannot be known in real time.\nIn August, the Bureau of Labor Statistics previewed a likely revision to its count\nof payroll job creation for the 12 months ended March 2019. The preview indicated that\njob gains over that period were about half a million lower than previously reported. On a\nmonthly basis, job gains were likely about 170,000 per month, rather than 210,000.\nWhile this news did not dramatically alter our outlook, it pointed to an economy with\nsomewhat less momentum than we had thought.3\n3 The Fed’s real-time assessment of job growth this year is discussed in Jerome H. Powell (2019), “Data-\nDependent Monetary Policy in an Evolving Economy,” speech delivered at “Trucks and Terabytes:\nIntegrating the ‘Old’ and ‘New’ Economies,” the 61st Annual Meeting of the National Association for\nBusiness Economics, Denver, Colorado, October 8,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20191008a.htm.\n\n- 4 -\nUncertainty about how our policies are affecting the economy also entered our\ndiscussions. As you know, we set our policy interest rate to achieve our goals of\nmaximum employment and stable prices. In doing so, we often refer to certain\nbenchmarks. One of these is the interest rate that would be neutral—neither restraining\nthe economy nor pushing it upward. We call that rate “r*” (pronounced “r star”). A\npolicy rate above r* would tend to restrain economic activity, while a setting below r*\nwould tend to speed up the economy. A second benchmark is the natural rate of\nunemployment, which is the lowest rate of unemployment that would not create upward\npressure on inflation. We call that rate “u*” (pronounced “u star”). You can think of r*\nand u* as two of the main stars by which we navigate. In an ideal world, policymakers\ncould rely on these stars like mariners before the advent of GPS. But, unlike celestial\nstars on a clear night, we cannot directly observe these stars, and their values change in\nways that are difficult to track in real time. Standard estimates of r* and u* made by\npolicymakers and other analysts have been falling since 2012 (figure 2). Since the end of\nlast year, incoming data—especially muted inflation data—prompted analysts inside and\noutside the Fed to again revise down their estimates of r* and u*.4 Taken at face value, a\nlower r* would suggest that monetary policy is providing somewhat less support for\nemployment and inflation than previously believed, and the fall in u* would suggest that\nthe labor market was less tight than believed.5 Both could help explain the weakness in\n4 Averaging across the estimates in figure 2, the estimates of r* are down 0.3 percentage point and those of\nu* are down 0.2 percentage point.\n5 Taken literally, the revised estimates of the stars would, by standard rules of thumb, call for a somewhat\nlower federal funds rate. For example, using the Taylor (1993) rule and using Okun’s law to state the rule\nin terms of the unemployment gap with a coefficient of 1 instead of the output gap with a coefficient of 0.5,\nthe shift in r* and u* would call for a 50 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate. John B. Taylor\n(1993), “Discretion versus Policy Rules in Practice,” Carnegie-Rochester Conference Series on Public\nPolicy, vol. 39 (December) (New York: Elsevier), pp. 195–214.\n\n- 5 -\ninflation. As with the revised jobs data, these revised estimates of the stars were not a\ngame changer for policy, but they provided another reason why a somewhat lower setting\nof our policy interest rate might be appropriate.\nHow did we add up all of these considerations? To help keep the U.S. economy\nstrong in the face of global developments and to provide some insurance against ongoing\nrisks, we progressively eased the stance of monetary policy over the course of the year.\nFirst, we signaled that increases in our short-term interest rate were unlikely. Then, from\nJuly to October, we reduced the target range for the federal funds rate by 3/4 percentage\npoint. The full effects of these monetary policy actions will be felt over time, but we\nbelieve they are already helping to support consumer and business sentiment and\nboosting spending in interest-sensitive sectors, such as housing and consumer durable\ngoods.\nWe see the current stance of monetary policy as likely to remain appropriate as\nlong as incoming information about the economy remains broadly consistent with our\noutlook of moderate economic growth, a strong labor market, and inflation near our\nsymmetric 2 percent objective. Looking ahead, we will be monitoring the effects of our\npolicy actions, along with other information bearing on the outlook, as we assess the\nappropriate path of the target range for the federal funds rate. Of course, if developments\nemerge that cause a material reassessment of our outlook, we would respond accordingly.\nPolicy is not on a preset course.\nI will wrap up with two areas where we have an opportunity to build on our gains.\n\n- 6 -\nA Sustained Return of Inflation to 2 percent\nFor many years as the economy recovered from the Great Recession, inflation\naveraged around 1.5 percent—below our 2 percent objective (figure 3). We had long\nexpected that inflation would gradually rise as the expansion continued, and, as I noted,\nboth overall and core inflation ran at rates consistent with our goal for much of 2018. But\nthis year, inflation is again running below 2 percent.\nIt is reasonable to ask why inflation running somewhat below 2 percent is a big\ndeal. We have heard a lot about inflation at our Fed Listens events. People are\nconcerned about the rising cost of medical care, of housing, and of college, but nobody\nseems to be complaining about overall inflation running below 2 percent. Even central\nbankers are not concerned about any particular minor fluctuation in inflation.\nAround the world, however, we have seen that inflation running persistently\nbelow target can lead to an unhealthy dynamic in which inflation expectations drift down,\npulling actual inflation further down. Lower inflation can, in turn, pull interest rates to\never-lower levels. The experience of Japan, and now the euro area, suggests that this\ndynamic is very difficult to reverse, and once under way, it can make it harder for a\ncentral bank to support its economy by further lowering interest rates. That is why it is\nessential that we at the Fed use our tools to make sure that we do not permit an unhealthy\ndownward drift in inflation expectations and inflation. We are strongly committed to\nsymmetrically and sustainably achieving our 2 percent inflation objective so that in\nmaking long-term plans, households and businesses can reasonably expect 2 percent\ninflation over time.\n\n- 7 -\nSpreading the Benefits of Employment\nMany people at our Fed Listens events have told us that this long expansion is\nnow benefiting low- and middle-income communities to a degree that has not been felt\nfor many years. We have heard about companies, communities, and schools working\ntogether to help employees build skills—and of employers working creatively to structure\njobs so that employees can do their jobs while coping with the demands of family and life\nbeyond the workplace. We have heard that many people who in the past struggled to stay\nin the workforce are now working and adding new and better chapters to their lives.\nThese stories show clearly in the job market data. Employment gains have been broad\nbased across all racial and ethnic groups and all levels of educational attainment as well\nas among people with disabilities (figure 4).\nThe strong labor market is also encouraging more people in their prime working\nyears—ages 25 to 54—to rejoin or remain in the labor force, meaning that they either\nhave a job or are actively looking for one. This is a welcome development. For several\ndecades up until the mid-1990s, the share of prime-age people in the labor force rose, as\nan influx of women more than offset some decline in male participation. In the mid-\n1990s, however, prime-age participation began to fall, and the drop-off became steeper in\nthe Great Recession and the early years of the recovery (figure 5). Between 2007 and\n2013, falling participation by both men and women contributed to a 2 percentage point\noverall decline. Our falling participation rate stands out among advanced economies.\nWhile the United States was roughly in the middle of the pack among 32 economies as of\n1995, in 2018 we ranked near the bottom (figure 6). Fortunately, in the strong job market\nsince 2014, prime-age participation has been staging a comeback. So far, we have made\n\n- 8 -\nup more than half the loss in the Great Recession, which translates to almost 2 million\nmore people in the labor force. But prime age participation could be still higher.\nIncome growth of low- and middle-income households has shown a pattern\nsimilar to that of participation, with two decades of disappointing news turning to better\nnews during the past few years. According to Census data, inflation-adjusted incomes for\nthe lowest 20 percent of households declined slightly over the two decades through 2014,\nand income for the middle 20 percent rose only modestly. Since then, incomes for these\ngroups have risen more rapidly, as wage growth has picked up—and picked up most for\nthe lower-paying jobs (figure 7).\nRecent years’ data paint a hopeful picture of more people in their prime years in\nthe workforce and wages rising for low- and middle-income workers. But as the people\nat our Fed Listens events emphasized, this is just a start: There is still plenty of room for\nbuilding on these gains. The Fed can play a role in this effort by steadfastly pursuing our\ngoals of maximum employment and price stability. The research literature suggests a\nvariety of policies, beyond the scope of monetary policy, that could spur further progress\nby better preparing people to meet the challenges of technological innovation and global\ncompetition and by supporting and rewarding labor force participation.6 These policies\ncould bring immense benefits both to the lives of workers and families directly affected\nand to the strength of the economy overall. Of course, the task of evaluating the costs\nand benefits of these policies falls to our elected representatives.\n6 Francesco Grigoli, Zsóka Kóczán, and Petia Topalova (2018), “Labor Force Participation in Advanced\nEconomies: Drivers and Prospects,” chapter 2 in International Monetary Fund, World Economic Outlook\n(Washington: IMF, April), pp. 1–58, https://www.elibrary.imf.org/view/IMF081/24892-\n9781484338278/24892-9781484338278/binaries/9781484338278_Chapter_2-\nLabor_Force_Participation_in_Advanced_Economies-Drivers_and_Prospects.pdf.\n\n- 9 -\nConclusion\nMonetary policy is now well positioned to support a strong labor market and\nreturn inflation decisively to our symmetric 2 percent objective. If the outlook changes\nmaterially, policy will change as well. At this point in the long expansion, I see the glass\nas much more than half full. With the right policies, we can fill it further, building on the\ngains so far and spreading the benefits more broadly to all Americans.\n\nBuilding on the Gains\nFrom the Long Expansion\nJerome H.

    "text": "Opening Remarks:\nNew Economic Challenges and\nthe Fed’s Monetary Policy Review\nJerome H. Powell\nFor the past year and a half, my colleagues and I on the Federal\nOpen Market Committee (FOMC) have been conducting the first-\never public review of our monetary policy framework.1 Earlier today\nwe released a revised “Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Mon-\netary Policy Strategy,” a document that lays out our goals, articulates\nour framework for monetary policy and serves as the foundation\nfor our policy actions.2 Today I will discuss our review, the changes\nin the economy that motivated us to undertake it, and our revised\nstatement, which encapsulates the main conclusions of the review.\nEvolution of the Fed’s Monetary Policy Framework\nWe began this public review in early 2019 to assess the monetary\npolicy strategy, tools and communications that would best foster\nachievement of our congressionally assigned goals of maximum\nemployment and price stability over the years ahead in service to\nthe American people. Because the economy is always evolving, the\nFOMC’s strategy for achieving its goals—our policy framework—\nmust adapt to meet the new challenges that arise. Forty years ago,\nthe biggest problem our economy faced was high and rising infla-\ntion.3 The Great Inflation demanded a clear focus on restoring the\ncredibility of the FOMC’s commitment to price stability. Chair Paul\n1\n\n2 Jerome H. Powell\nVolcker brought that focus to bear, and the “Volcker disinflation,”\nwith the continuing stewardship of Alan Greenspan, led to the stabi-\nlization of inflation and inflation expectations in the 1990s at around\n2%. The monetary policies of the Volcker era laid the foundation for\nthe long period of economic stability known as the Great Modera-\ntion. This new era brought new challenges to the conduct of mone-\ntary policy. Before the Great Moderation, expansions typically ended\nin overheating and rising inflation. Since then, prior to the current\npandemic-induced downturn, a series of historically long expansions\nhad been more likely to end with episodes of financial instability,\nprompting essential efforts to substantially increase the strength and\nresilience of the financial system.4\nBy the early 2000s, many central banks around the world had adopted\na monetary policy framework known as inflation targeting.5 Although\nthe precise features of inflation targeting differed from country to\ncountry, the core framework always articulated an inflation goal as\na primary objective of monetary policy. Inflation targeting was also\nassociated with increased communication and transparency designed\nto clarify the central bank’s policy intentions. This emphasis on trans-\nparency reflected what was then a new appreciation that policy is most\neffective when it is clearly understood by the public. Inflation-target-\ning central banks generally do not focus solely on inflation: Those with\n“flexible” inflation targets take into account economic stabilization in\naddition to their inflation objective.\nUnder Ben Bernanke’s leadership, the Federal Reserve adopted\nmany of the features associated with flexible inflation targeting.6 We\nmade great advances in transparency and communications, with\nthe initiation of quarterly press conferences and the Summary\nof Economic Projections (SEP), which comprises the individual\neconomic forecasts of FOMC participants. During that time, then-\nBoard Vice Chair Janet Yellen led an effort on behalf of the FOMC\nto codify the Committee’s approach to monetary policy. In January\n2012, the Committee issued its first Statement on Longer-Run Goals\nand Monetary Policy Strategy, which we often refer to as the consen-\nsus statement. A central part of this statement was the articulation\nof a longer-run inflation goal of 2%.7 Because the structure of the\n\nOpening Remarks 3\nlabor market is strongly influenced by nonmonetary factors that can\nchange over time, the Committee did not set a numerical objective\nfor maximum employment. However, the statement affirmed the\nCommittee’s commitment to fulfilling both of its congressionally\nmandated goals. The 2012 statement was a significant milestone, re-\nflecting lessons learned from fighting high inflation as well as from\nexperience around the world with flexible inflation targeting. The\nstatement largely articulated the policy framework the Committee\nhad been following for some time.8\nMotivation for the Review\nThe completion of the original consensus statement in January\n2012 occurred early on in the recovery from the Global Financial\nCrisis, when notions of what the “new normal” might bring were\nquite uncertain. Since then, our understanding of the economy has\nevolved in ways that are central to monetary policy. Of course, the\nconduct of monetary policy has also evolved. A key purpose of our\nreview has been to take stock of the lessons learned over this period\nand identify any further changes in our monetary policy framework\nthat could enhance our ability to achieve our maximum-employment\nand price-stability objectives in the years ahead.9\nOur evolving understanding of four key economic developments\nmotivated our review. First, assessments of the potential, or longer-\nrun, growth rate of the economy have declined. For example, since\nJanuary 2012, the median estimate of potential growth from FOMC\nparticipants has fallen from 2.5% to 1.8% (Chart 1). Some slowing\nin growth relative to earlier decades was to be expected, reflecting\nslowing population growth and the aging of the population. More\ntroubling has been the decline in productivity growth, which is the\nprimary driver of improving living standards over time.10\nSecond, the general level of interest rates has fallen both here in the\nUnited States and around the world. Estimates of the neutral federal\nfunds rate, which is the rate consistent with the economy operating\nat full strength and with stable inflation, have fallen substantially,\nin large part reflecting a fall in the equilibrium real interest rate, or\n“r-star.” This rate is not affected by monetary policy but instead is\n\n4 Jerome H.

With interest rates gener-\nally running closer to their effective lower bound even in good times,\nthe Fed has less scope to support the economy during an economic\ndownturn by simply cutting the federal funds rate.12 The result can\nbe worse economic outcomes in terms of both employment and price\nstability, with the costs of such outcomes likely falling hardest on\nthose least able to bear them.\n\nOpening Remarks 5\nChart 2\nReal-Time Projections of Longer-Run Federal Funds Rate\nPercent Percent\n4.25 4.25\n4.00 4.00\n3.75 3.75\n3.50 3.50\n3.25 3.25\n3.00 3.00\n2.75 2.75\n2.50 2.50\n2.25 2.25\n2.00 2.00\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021\nFOMC Blue Chip CBO\nNotes: The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) data are quarterly, extend through June 2020, and are median\nprojections of longer-term normal (rounded to the nearest 1/8 percentage point).

The unemployment rate hovered near 50-year lows for roughly\ntwo years, well below most estimates of its sustainable level. And the\nunemployment rate captures only part of the story. Having declined\nsignificantly in the five years following the crisis, the labor force\nparticipation rate flattened out and began rising even though the\naging of the population suggested that it should keep falling.13 For\nindividuals in their prime working years, the participation rate fully\nretraced its post-crisis decline, defying earlier assessments that the\nGlobal Financial Crisis might cause permanent structural damage to\nthe labor market.\nMoreover, as the long expansion continued, the gains began\nto be shared more widely across society. The Black and Hispan-\nic unemployment rates reached record lows, and the differentials\n\n6 Jerome H. Powell\nbetween these rates and the white unemployment rate narrowed to\ntheir lowest levels on record.14 As we heard repeatedly in our Fed\nListens events, the robust job market was delivering life-changing\ngains for many individuals, families, and communities, particularly\nat the lower end of the income spectrum.15 In addition, many who\nhad been left behind for too long were finding jobs, benefiting their\nfamilies and communities and increasing the productive capacity of\nour economy. Before the pandemic, there was every reason to expect\nthat these gains would continue. It is hard to overstate the benefits of\nsustaining a strong labor market, a key national goal that will require\na range of policies in addition to supportive monetary policy.\nFourth, the historically strong labor market did not trigger a sig-\nnificant rise in inflation. Over the years, forecasts from FOMC par-\nticipants and private-sector analysts routinely showed a return to\n2% inflation, but these forecasts were never realized on a sustained\nbasis (Chart 3). Inflation forecasts are typically predicated on esti-\nmates of the natural rate of unemployment, or “u-star,” and of how\nmuch upward pressure on inflation arises when the unemployment\nrate falls relative to u-star.16 As the unemployment rate moved lower\nand inflation remained muted, estimates of u-star were revised down.\nFor example, the median estimate from FOMC participants declined\nfrom 5.5% in 2012 to 4.1% at present (Chart 4). The muted respon-\nsiveness of inflation to labor market tightness, which we refer to as the\nflattening of the Phillips curve, also contributed to low inflation out-\ncomes.17 In addition, longer-term inflation expectations, which we\nhave long seen as an important driver of actual inflation, and global\ndisinflationary pressures may have been holding down inflation more\nthan was generally anticipated. Other advanced economies have also\nstruggled to achieve their inflation goals in recent decades.\nThe persistent undershoot of inflation from our 2% longer-run\nobjective is a cause for concern. Many find it counterintuitive that\nthe Fed would want to push up inflation. After all, low and stable\ninflation is essential for a well-functioning economy. And we are cer-\ntainly mindful that higher prices for essential items, such as food,\ngasoline and shelter, add to the burdens faced by many families, espe-\ncially those struggling with lost jobs and incomes. However, inflation\n\nOpening Remarks 7\nChart 3\nEvolution of Real-Time Projections for Personal Consumption\nExpenditures Inflation\nPercent Percent\n2.25 2.25\n2.00 2.00\n2018\n1.75 1.75\n2017\n2016\n1.50 1.50\n2014\n2019\n2012\n1.25 1.25\n1.00 1.00\n2013\n0.75 2015 0.75\n0.50 2020 0.50\n0.25 0.25\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021\nFOMC Meeting Date (FOMC) or Survey Vintage (Survey of Professional Forecasters)\nFOMC Survey of Professional Forecasters\nNotes: The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) data, represented by the solid lines, are median projections pub-\nlished quarterly; the latest data vintage is June 2020.

Well-anchored inflation\nexpectations are critical for giving the Fed the latitude to support\nemployment when necessary without destabilizing inflation.18 But\nif inflation expectations fall below our 2% objective, interest rates\nwould decline in tandem. In turn, we would have less scope to cut\ninterest rates to boost employment during an economic downturn,\nfurther diminishing our capacity to stabilize the economy through\ncutting interest rates.

We want to do what we\ncan to prevent such a dynamic from happening here.\nElements of the Review\nWe began our review with these changes in the economy in mind.\nThe review had three pillars: a series of Fed Listens events held around\nthe country, a flagship research conference and a series of Committee\ndiscussions supported by rigorous staff analysis. As is appropriate in\nour democratic society, we have sought extensive engagement with\nthe public throughout the review.\nThe Fed Listens events built on a long-standing practice around\nthe Federal Reserve System of engaging with community groups.\nThe 15 events involved a wide range of participants—workforce\ndevelopment groups, union members, small business owners, resi-\ndents of low- and moderate-income communities, retirees and oth-\ners—to hear about how our policies affect peoples’ daily lives and\n\nOpening Remarks 9\nlivelihoods.19 The stories we heard at Fed Listens events became a\npotent vehicle for us to connect with the people and communities\nthat our policies are intended to benefit. One of the clear messages\nwe heard was that the strong labor market that prevailed before\nthe pandemic was generating employment opportunities for many\nAmericans who in the past had not found jobs readily available. A\nclear takeaway from these events was the importance of achieving\nand sustaining a strong job market, particularly for people from low-\nand moderate-income communities.\nThe research conference brought together some of the world’s lead-\ning academic experts to address topics central to our review, and the\npresentations and robust discussion we engaged in were an impor-\ntant input to our review process.20\nFinally, the Committee explored the range of issues that were\nbrought to light during the course of the review in five consecutive\nmeetings beginning in July 2019. Analytical staff work put together\nby teams across the Federal Reserve System provided essential back-\nground for each of the Committee’s discussions.21\nOur plans to conclude the review earlier this year were, like so\nmany things, delayed by the arrival of the pandemic. When we re-\nsumed our discussions last month, we turned our attention to distill-\ning the most important lessons of the review in a revised Statement\non Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.\nNew Statement on Longer-Run Goals\nand Monetary Policy Strategy\nThe federated structure of the Federal Reserve, reflected in the\nFOMC, ensures that we always have a diverse range of perspectives\non monetary policy, and that is certainly the case today. Nonetheless,\nI am pleased to say that the revised consensus statement was adopted\ntoday with the unanimous support of Committee participants. Our\nnew consensus statement, like its predecessor, explains how we in-\nterpret the mandate Congress has given us and describes the broad\nframework that we believe will best promote our maximum-employ-\nment and price-stability goals. Before addressing the key changes in\n\n10 Jerome H. Powell\nour statement, let me highlight some areas of continuity. We con-\ntinue to believe that specifying a numerical goal for employment is\nunwise, because the maximum level of employment is not directly\nmeasurable and changes over time for reasons unrelated to monetary\npolicy. The significant shifts in estimates of the natural rate of un-\nemployment over the past decade reinforce this point. In addition,\nwe have not changed our view that a longer-run inflation rate of\n2% is most consistent with our mandate to promote both maximum\nemployment and price stability. Finally, we continue to believe that\nmonetary policy must be forward looking, taking into account the\nexpectations of households and businesses and the lags in monetary\npolicy’s effect on the economy. Thus, our policy actions continue to\ndepend on the economic outlook as well as the risks to the outlook,\nincluding potential risks to the financial system that could impede\nthe attainment of our goals.\nThe key innovations in our new consensus statement reflect the\nchanges in the economy I described. Our new statement explicitly\nacknowledges the challenges posed by the proximity of interest rates\nto the effective lower bound. By reducing our scope to support the\neconomy by cutting interest rates, the lower bound increases down-\nward risks to employment and inflation.22 To counter these risks, we\nare prepared to use our full range of tools to support the economy.\nWith regard to the employment side of our mandate, our revised\nstatement emphasizes that maximum employment is a broad-based and\ninclusive goal. This change reflects our appreciation for the benefits of\na strong labor market, particularly for many in low- and moderate-in-\ncome communities.23 In addition, our revised statement says that our\npolicy decision will be informed by our “assessments of the shortfalls of\nemployment from its maximum level” rather than by “deviations from\nits maximum level” as in our previous statement.24 This change may\nappear subtle, but it reflects our view that a robust job market can be\nsustained without causing an outbreak of inflation.\nIn earlier decades when the Phillips curve was steeper, inflation\ntended to rise noticeably in response to a strengthening labor market.\nIt was sometimes appropriate for the Fed to tighten monetary policy\nas employment rose toward its estimated maximum level in order to\n\nOpening Remarks 11\nstave off an unwelcome rise in inflation. The change to “shortfalls”\nclarifies that, going forward, employment can run at or above real-\ntime estimates of its maximum level without causing concern, un-\nless accompanied by signs of unwanted increases in inflation or the\nemergence of other risks that could impede the attainment of our\ngoals.25 Of course, when employment is below its maximum level, as\nis clearly the case now, we will actively seek to minimize that shortfall\nby using our tools to support economic growth and job creation.\nWe have also made important changes with regard to the price-\nstability side of our mandate. Our longer-run goal continues to be an\ninflation rate of 2%. Our statement emphasizes that our actions to\nachieve both sides of our dual mandate will be most effective if lon-\nger-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2%. How-\never, if inflation runs below 2% following economic downturns but\nnever moves above 2% even when the economy is strong, then, over\ntime, inflation will average less than 2%. Households and businesses\nwill come to expect this result, meaning that inflation expectations\nwould tend to move below our inflation goal and pull realized infla-\ntion down. To prevent this outcome and the adverse dynamics that\ncould ensue, our new statement indicates that we will seek to achieve\ninflation that averages 2% over time. Therefore, following periods\nwhen inflation has been running below 2%, appropriate monetary\npolicy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2% for\nsome time.\nIn seeking to achieve inflation that averages 2% over time, we\nare not tying ourselves to a particular mathematical formula that\ndefines the average. Thus, our approach could be viewed as a flex-\nible form of average inflation targeting.26 Our decisions about\nappropriate monetary policy will continue to reflect a broad array of\nconsiderations and will not be dictated by any formula. Of course,\nif excessive inflationary pressures were to build or inflation expecta-\ntions were to ratchet above levels consistent with our goal, we would\nnot hesitate to act.\nThe revisions to our statement add up to a robust updating of our\nmonetary policy framework. To an extent, these revisions reflect the\nway we have been conducting policy in recent years. At the same\n\n12 Jerome H. Powell\ntime, however, there are some important new features. Overall, our\nnew Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy\nconveys our continued strong commitment to achieving our goals,\ngiven the difficult challenges presented by the proximity of interest\nrates to the effective lower bound. In conducting monetary policy,\nwe will remain highly focused on fostering as strong a labor market\nas possible for the benefit of all Americans. And we will steadfastly\nseek to achieve a 2% inflation rate over time.\nLooking Ahead\nOur review has provided a platform for productive discussion and\nengagement with the public we serve. The Fed Listens events helped\nus connect with our core constituency, the American people, and\nhear directly how their everyday lives are affected by our policies. We\nbelieve that conducting a review at regular intervals is a good insti-\ntutional practice, providing valuable feedback and enhancing trans-\nparency and accountability. And with the ever-changing economy,\nfuture reviews will allow us to take a step back, reflect on what we\nhave learned, and adapt our practices as we strive to achieve our dual-\nmandate goals. As our statement indicates, we plan to undertake a\nthorough public review of our monetary policy strategy, tools and\ncommunication practices roughly every five years.\n\nOpening Remarks 13\nEndnotes\n1See Board of Governors (2018) and Clarida (2019).\n2The revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy is\navailable on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressre-\nleases/monetary20200827a.htm\n3Consumer price inflation, which was running below 2% in the early 1960s, had\nrisen into the double digits by the late 1970s and was slightly above 12% when\nthe Committee gathered for an unscheduled meeting in the Eccles Building in\nWashington, D.C., on a Saturday in October 1979—before the days when trans-\nparency was the hallmark of institutional accountability—and decided to change\nthe conduct of monetary policy.

See also the recent evidence in Lopez-Salido and others\n(2020).\n12Both the experience following the Global Financial Crisis and the current situ-\nation drive this point home. After the Global Financial Crisis, the Fed held the\nfederal funds rate at the lower bound for seven years. Thereafter, as the economy\nstrengthened, the federal funds rate reached a peak just above 2%. By comparison,\nthe federal funds rate averaged a little more than 5% in the 1990s. And, at the on-\nset of the COVID pandemic, we quickly cut rates to the effective lower bound. But\nsince the federal funds rate was only about 1-1/2% before the pandemic—because\n\n14 Jerome H. Powell\nthat is what the economy required at that time—our scope to reduce the federal\nfunds rate was far less than in earlier recessions.\n13The labor force participation rate for prime-age individuals (those between 25\nand 54 years old), which is much less sensitive to the effects of population aging,\nhas been rising over the past few years and continued to increase in 2019. For a\nlonger-run perspective, see the analysis presented in Aaronson and others (2014).\n14The decline in the unemployment rate for African-Americans has been par-\nticularly sizable, and its average rate in the second half of October 2019 was the\nlowest recorded since the data began to be reported in 1972; see Board of Gover-\nnors (2020a).

See, for instance, Goodfriend (2007).\n19See the report “Fed Listens: Perspectives from the Public” (Board of Governors,\n2020b), which summarizes the 14 Fed Listens events hosted by the Board and the\nFederal Reserve Banks during 2019, as well as an additional event in May 2020 to\nfollow up with participants about the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on their\ncommunities. Information on the individual Fed Listens events is available on the\nBoard’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review-of-monetary-\npolicy-strategy-tools-and-communications-fed-listens-events.htm\n20The Federal Reserve System’s “Conference on Monetary Policy Strategy, Tools,\nand Communication Practices (A Fed Listens Event)” was hosted by the Federal\nReserve Bank of Chicago in June 2019. See https://www.federalreserve.gov/confer-\nences/conference-monetary-policy-strategy-tools-communications-20190605.htm for\nthe conference program, links to the conference papers and presentations, and\nlinks to session videos.

The 2012 statement noted that the Committee\nwould mitigate “deviations” of employment from the Committee’s assessments of\nits maximum level, suggesting that the Committee would actively seek to lower\nemployment if it assessed that employment was above the Committee’s estimate\nof its maximum level. In practice, the Committee has not conducted policy in this\nway, but rather has supported continued gains in the labor market.\n25In addition, because real-time estimates are highly uncertain, we no longer refer\nto estimates of the natural rate of unemployment from the SEP in our consensus\nstatement. Another reason for dropping this reference is that the unemployment\nrate does not adequately capture the full range of experience in the labor market.\nThe SEP will continue to report FOMC participants’ estimates of the longer-run\nlevel of the unemployment rate, as such information remains a useful, albeit highly\nincomplete, input into our policy deliberations.\n26This strategy embodies some key lessons from the general class of makeup strat-\negies that have been analyzed extensively in the economics literature. The literature\nhas emphasized that the proximity of interest rates to the effective lower bound\nposes an asymmetric challenge for monetary policy, increasing the likelihood that\ninflation and employment will tend to be too low. An extensive discussion about\nhow these issues affect the design of monetary policy, as well as the relevant related\nliterature, can be found in Duarte and others (2020), Arias and others (2020) and\nHebden and others (2020).\n\n16 Jerome H.

Powell\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe Economic Club of New York\nNew York, New York\nJune 1, 2017\n\nThank you for the opportunity to speak here at the Economic Club of New York.\nToday I will discuss the ongoing progress of our economy and the prospects for returning\nboth the federal funds rate and the size of the Fed’s balance sheet to more normal levels.\nAs always, the views I express here are mine and not necessarily those of the Federal\nOpen Market Committee (FOMC).\nEconomic Developments\nThe Federal Reserve is committed to fulfilling our statutory mandate of stable\nprices and maximum employment. To begin with the labor market, many indicators\nsuggest that the economy is close to full employment. In April, the unemployment rate\nwas 4.4 percent, a level not reached since May 2007 and below most current estimates of\nthe natural rate of unemployment (figure 1).1 Estimates of the natural rate are inherently\nuncertain, but other labor market measures are also near their pre-crisis levels, including\na broader measure of labor market underutilization that includes those who would like to\nwork but have not recently looked for a job and those working part time who want full-\ntime work.2 The labor force participation rate, which had declined sharply after the\ncrisis, has now been roughly stable for 3-1/2 years, which represents an improvement\n1 For example, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the natural rate of unemployment is\ncurrently 4.7 percent. The March 2017 Blue Chip Economic Indicators reported that the consensus forecast\nfor the unemployment rate over 2024 to 2028 was 4.7 percent, with the top 10 projections averaging\n5.1 percent and the bottom 10 averaging 4.3 percent. The median estimate of the longer-run normal rate of\nunemployment in the March 2017 Summary of Economic Projections was 4.7 percent. The uncertainty\naround these estimates is large. The canonical paper by Staiger, Stock, and Watson puts the 95 percent\nconfidence interval at 1-1/2 percentage points on either side of the point estimate; see Douglas Staiger,\nJames H. Stock, and Mark W. Watson (1997), “How Precise Are Estimates of the Natural Rate of\nUnemployment?” in Christina D. Romer and David H. Romer, eds., Reducing Inflation: Motivation and\nStrategy (Chicago: University of Chicago Press).\n2 The broader measure is the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ U-6 alternative measure of labor underutilization.\n\n- 2 -\nagainst its estimated downward trend (figure 2). Participation is now close to estimates\nof its trend level.3\nWage data have gradually moved up, consistent with a tightening labor market.\nAlthough average hourly earnings are rising only about 2.5 percent per year, slower than\nbefore the crisis, much of that downshift may reflect the slowdown in productivity\ngrowth we have experienced. For example, over the past three years, unit labor costs--\nthat is, nominal wages adjusted for increases in productivity--have been generally rising a\nbit faster than prices.4\nTurning to inflation, the FOMC interprets price stability to mean inflation of 2\npercent as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE).5\nThis objective is symmetric, so the Committee would be concerned if inflation were to\nrun persistently above or below this target. Inflation has run below 2 percent for most of\nthe period since the financial crisis, reflecting generally soft economic conditions as well\nas transitory factors such as the earlier declines in energy prices. But over the past two\nyears, inflation has moved gradually closer to our objective. Prices rose 1.6 percent over\n3 The labor force participation rate is currently slightly below the Congressional Budget Office’s estimate\nof trend and slightly above trend estimates based on the methodology of Aaronson and others. See\nCongressional Budget Office (2017), The Budget and Economic Outlook: 2017 to 2027 (Washington:\nCBO, January), https://www.cbo.gov/publication/52370; and Stephanie Aaronson, Tomaz Cajner, Bruce\nFallick, Felix Galbis-Reig, Christopher Smith, and William Wascher (2014), “Labor Force Participation:\nRecent Developments and Future Prospects,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Fall, pp. 197-275,\nhttps://www.brookings.edu/bpea-articles/labor-force-participation-recent-developments-and-future-\nprospects.\n4 There are several other measures of nominal wage growth in addition to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’\n(BLS) average hourly earnings. The BLS employment cost index measure of year-over-year wage and\nsalary growth was also 2.5 percent in the first quarter, while the BLS measure of compensation per hour\nrose to 3.9 percent. Compensation per hour is quite volatile and subject to large revisions. The unit labor\ncost measure is based on the BLS measures of compensation per hour and productivity for the business\nsector. All of these measures indicate that compensation has picked up in recent years.\n5 See Federal Open Market Committee (2017), Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy\nStrategy, amended effective January 31 (original version adopted effective January 24, 2012),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomc_longerrungoals.pdf.\n\n- 3 -\nthe 12 months ending in April, compared with only 0.2 percent two years earlier\n(figure 3). But much of that movement reflects price changes in the often-volatile energy\nand food components of the index. Core inflation, which excludes food and energy\nprices, has proven historically to be a better indicator of where overall inflation is\nheading, although it, too, can be affected by transitory factors such as import prices.\nCore inflation was 1.5 percent for the 12 months through April. This measure has also\nrisen since 2015, although its gradual increase appears to have paused because of weak\ninflation readings for March and April. Some of the recent weakness can be explained by\ntransitory factors. And there are good reasons to expect that inflation will resume its\ngradual rise. Incoming spending data have been relatively strong, and the labor market\nshould continue to tighten, exerting some upward pressure on wages and prices.\nNonetheless, it is important that the Committee assess incoming inflation data carefully\nand continue to demonstrate a strong commitment to achieving our symmetric 2 percent\nobjective.\nDespite strong job gains, very weak productivity gains have led to disappointingly\nslow economic growth of only about 2 percent over the course of this expansion\n(figure 4). While monetary policy can contribute to growth by supporting a durable\nexpansion in a context of price stability, it cannot reliably affect the long-run sustainable\nlevel of the economy’s growth.6 The success of monetary policy should be judged by the\n6 I have argued elsewhere that we need to find ways to increase our long-term growth and spread that\nprosperity broadly if we are to avoid this “low growth trap.” We need policies that support business\ninvestment, labor force participation, and productivity growth. Increased spending on public infrastructure\nmay raise private-sector productivity over time. Greater support for public and private research and\ndevelopment, encouragement of workers to increase their skills, and policies that improve product and\nlabor market dynamism may also be fruitful. See Jerome H. Powell (2016), “Recent Economic\nDevelopments and Longer-Run Challenges,” speech delivered at the Economic Club of Indiana,\nIndianapolis, Indiana, November 29,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20161129a.htm.\n\n- 4 -\neconomy’s performance against our statutory mandates of price stability and maximum\nemployment. Today, the economy is as close to our assigned goals as it has been for\nmany years (figure 5).\nMy baseline expectation is that the economy will continue on a path of growth of\nabout 2 percent, strong job creation and tightening labor markets, and inflation moving\nup toward our 2 percent target. I expect that unemployment will decline a bit further and\nremain at low levels for some time, which could draw more workers into the workforce,\nput upward pressure on wages, or cause businesses to invest more as labor costs rise, all\nof which I would view as desirable outcomes. Risks to the forecast now seem more\nbalanced than they have been for some time. In particular, the global picture has\nbrightened as growth and inflation have broadly moved up for the first time in several\nyears. Here at home, risks seem both moderate and balanced, including the downside\nrisk of lower inflation and the upside risk of labor market overheating.\nMonetary Policy Normalization\nThe healthy state of our economy and favorable outlook suggest that the FOMC\nshould continue the process of normalizing monetary policy. The Committee has been\npatient in raising rates, and that patience has paid dividends. While the recent\nperformance of the labor market might warrant a faster pace of tightening, inflation has\nbeen below target for five years and has moved up only slowly toward 2 percent, which\nargues for continued patience, especially if that progress slows or stalls. If the economy\nperforms about as expected, I would view it as appropriate to continue to gradually raise\nrates. I would also see it as appropriate to begin the process of reducing the size of the\n\n- 5 -\nbalance sheet later this year. Of course, both decisions will depend on the performance\nof the economy.\nTo put this process in context, consider where we have come from. Ten years\nago, in the summer of 2007, we were just entering the most painful economic crisis since\nthe Great Depression. The crisis and its aftermath prompted large-scale policy\ninterventions by the Federal Reserve and other authorities to avert the collapse of the\nfinancial system and prevent the economy from spiraling into depression.\nMost of the Federal Reserve’s targeted financial measures--such as liquidity\nfacilities to ensure the flow of credit to households and businesses--were withdrawn soon\nafter the crisis as orderly conditions resumed in financial markets. In contrast, the\nFOMC’s easing of monetary policy increased over time as the longer-term economic\neffects of the crisis gradually became clear. From 2007 through 2013, the FOMC added\never greater support for the economy.7 From late 2008, with rates pinned at the zero\nlower bound, the Committee resorted to unconventional policies to put additional\ndownward pressure on long-term rates, including strong calendar-based forward guidance\nregarding the likely future path of the federal funds rate, and several rounds of large-scale\nasset purchases (often referred to as quantitative easing (QE)).8\nBoth the federal funds rate and the balance sheet are currently set at levels\nintended to provide significant support to economic activity. Normalization of the stance\n7 A chronology of changes in the FOMC’s target federal funds rate is available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/openmarket.htm.\n8 The FOMC’s purchases of longer-term securities (U.S. Treasury securities, agency debt obligations, and\nagency-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities) reduced the outstanding stock of these securities available\nin the market and therefore tended to put upward pressure on bond prices and downward pressure on their\nyields--specifically, on the term premium component of longer-term interest rates. This unconventional\nmonetary policy was an appropriate means of providing a boost to spending by households and firms\nduring a period of economic slack, when our ability to provide accommodation by conventional means was\nlimited by the fact that the federal funds rate had reached almost zero.\n\n- 6 -\nof monetary policy will return both tools to a more neutral setting over time. That\nprocess can be said to have begun in 2014, when the FOMC ended its asset purchases and\nbegan active discussions on lifting the federal funds rate from its lower bound.9 Our first\nrate hike came in December 2015, with another in December 2016, and one additional\nincrease so far this year. The normalization process is projected to have several years left\nto run.\nIn the case of the federal funds rate, the endpoint of that process will occur when\nour target reaches the long-run neutral rate of interest. Estimates of that rate are subject\nto significant uncertainty. The median estimate of its level by FOMC participants in\nMarch was 3 percent, more than a full percentage point below pre-crisis estimates. This\ndecline in the long-run neutral rate, and an even larger decline in the short-run neutral\nrate, imply that even the very low rates of recent years may be providing less support to\nthe economy than may appear. At present, the median FOMC participant estimates that\nwe will reach a long-run neutral level by year-end 2019 if the economy performs about as\nexpected (figure 6).\nThe Balance Sheet\nIn September 2014, the FOMC outlined its plans for the balance sheet. That\ninitial guidance has been supplemented over time in other FOMC communications, most\nrecently in the minutes of the May meeting. Here is a summary of the key points:\n9 Over this period, the size of the balance sheet has been maintained by our reinvestment policy, which I\nwill consider later in the remarks.\n\n- 7 -\n• Normalization of the balance sheet will commence only after the\nnormalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way.10 Most\nFOMC participants think that this condition will be satisfied later this year if\nthe economy continues broadly on its current path.11\n• The balance sheet will be allowed to shrink passively as our holdings of\nTreasury and agency securities mature (or prepay) and roll off.12\n• The process will be gradual and predictable. As noted in the May minutes,\nalthough no decisions have been made, the Committee has discussed\npreannouncing a schedule of gradually increasing caps on the dollar value of\nsecurities that would be allowed to run off in a given month.\n• The Committee will continue to use the federal funds rate as its principal tool\nfor adjusting the stance of monetary policy.13\n• Once the process of balance sheet normalization has begun, it should continue\nas planned as long as there is no material deterioration in the economic\noutlook.14\n10 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2015), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC\nStatement,” press release, December 16,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20151216a.htm.\n11 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2017), “Minutes of the Federal Open Market\nCommittee, May 2-3, 2017,” press release, May 24,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20170524a.htm.\n12 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2014), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC\nStatement on Policy Normalization Principles and Plans,” press release, September 17,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20140917c.htm.\n13 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2017), “Minutes of the Federal Open Market\nCommittee, March 14-15, 2017,” press release, April 5,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20170405a.htm.\n14 See Board of Governors, “Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, May 2-3, 2017,” in note 11.\n\n- 8 -\n• In the long run, the balance sheet should be no larger than it needs to be to\nallow the Committee to conduct monetary policy under its chosen\nframework.15\nTaken together, the Committee’s communications present the broad outline of our\nlikely approach to normalizing the balance sheet. Although the process of normalizing\nthe size of the balance sheet will be in the background, that process will interact with the\nCommittee’s decisions regarding the federal funds rate. As the Fed’s balance sheet\nshrinks, so debt held by the public will grow, which in theory should tighten financial\nconditions by putting upward pressure on long-term rates. Any such tightening could\naffect the Committee’s decisions on the federal funds rate. But how big is this effect\nlikely to be?\nModel-based approaches to that question estimate changes to financial conditions\nthrough increases in the term premium as the balance sheet shrinks. These estimates vary\nbut are generally modest.16 One reason is that, for several years, the FOMC has signaled\nits intention to normalize the balance sheet as economic conditions allow, and so some of\nthe effects of normalization should already be priced in. A recent research paper by\nFederal Reserve staff estimated that unconventional policies are holding down term\n15 See Board of Governors, “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement on Policy Normalization Principles\nand Plans,” in note 12.\n16 See, for example, Eric M. Engen, Thomas Laubach, and David Reifschneider (2015), “The\nMacroeconomic Effects of the Federal Reserve’s Unconventional Monetary Policies,” Finance and\nEconomics Discussion Series 2015-005 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,\nFebruary), http://dx.doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2015.005; Brian Bonis, Jane Ihrig, and Min Wei (2017), “The\nEffect of the Federal Reserve’s Securities Holdings on Longer-Term Interest Rates,” FEDS Notes\n(Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, April 20),\nhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17016/2380-7172.1977; and Troy Davig and A. Lee Smith (2017), “Forecasting the\nStance of Monetary Policy under Balance Sheet Adjustments,” Macro Bulletin (Kansas City, Mo.: Federal\nReserve Bank of Kansas City, May 10),\nhttps://www.kansascityfed.org/~/media/files/publicat/research/macrobulletins/mb17davigsmith0510.pdf.\n\n- 9 -\npremiums by about 100 basis points, but that these effects should decline to about\n85 basis points by the end of 2017 as market participants see the normalization process\napproaching.17 The same approach suggests that bringing forward the date of the start of\nthe anticipated phasing out of the Federal Reserve’s reinvestments from mid-2018 to the\nend of 2017 should have raised the term premium by only about 5 basis points.18 Of\ncourse, markets sometimes react quite differently than expected, as the 2013 taper\ntantrum showed.\nThe market’s response to recent changes in expectations for reinvestment policy\nalso suggests that there need not be a major reaction when the Committee begins to phase\nout reinvestments. Long-term rates did not react strongly to the reinvestment discussions\nin the minutes for the FOMC’s March and May meetings, which led market participants\nto bring forward their expectations about the starting date for this process by about six\nmonths (figure 7).19 A recent survey of economists also suggests that they expect that a\ngradual, well-telegraphed reduction in the Fed’s balance sheet should have modest\neffects.20 These results augur well for an orderly phaseout of reinvestments. If changes\nto reinvestment policy do tighten financial conditions more than anticipated, then I expect\nthat the FOMC would take that into account.\n17 See Bonis, Ihrig, and Wei, “Effect of the Federal Reserve’s Securities Holdings,” in note 16.\n18 Of course, estimates of the effects of monetary policy on term premiums often differ. Engen, Laubach,\nand Reifschneider estimated that the Federal Reserve’s asset purchases are currently holding down term\npremiums by about 60 basis points, less than the estimate of Bonis, Ihrig, and Wei, but their findings still\nimply a similar small effect of bringing forward the date of normalization by six months; see Bonis, Ihrig,\nand Wei, “Effect of the Federal Reserve’s Securities Holdings,” and Engen, Laubach, and Reifschneider,\n“Macroeconomic Effects,” in note 16.\n19 See the results of the March and May 2017 primary dealer surveys, which are available on the Federal\nReserve Bank of New York’s website at\nhttps://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/primarydealer_survey_questions.html.\n20 See David Harrison (2017), “Economists See Modest Impact from a Fed Balance-Sheet Reduction,” Wall\nStreet Journal, May 11.\n\n- 10 -\nThe Long-Run Framework\nOver the next few years, the runoff of assets acquired through QE is expected to\nreduce the balance sheet substantially below its current level of $4.5 trillion. In the long\nrun, the ultimate size of the balance sheet will depend mainly on the demand for Federal\nReserve liabilities--currency, reserves, and other liabilities--and on the Committee’s long-\nrun framework for setting interest rates.21\nThe next slide compares the Fed’s balance sheet of May 2007 with that of May\n2017 (figure 8). On the asset side, the balance sheet increased by about $3.5 trillion as\nthe FOMC acquired securities in its QE programs. These assets were matched on the\nliability side of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet by a $2.2 trillion increase in reserve\nbalances held by commercial banks, a $700 billion increase in currency outstanding, and\na $500 billion increase in other liabilities.\nAs can be seen more clearly in the next slide, prior to the crisis, currency was the\nFed’s main liability (figure 9). Currency outstanding has nearly doubled over the past 10\nyears to $1.5 trillion, growing at a compound annual rate of 6.8 percent. This growth\nreflects strong domestic and international demand for U.S. currency, which is expected to\ncontinue. The eventual level of demand for reserves is less certain but is highly likely to\nexceed pre-crisis levels when reserve balances averaged only about $15 billion. Reserves\nare the ultimate “safe asset,” and demand for safe assets has increased substantially over\ntime because of long-run trends, including regulatory requirements. Other liabilities\n21 For a more detailed discussion of the longer-run framework, see Lorie K. Logan (2017), “Implementing\nMonetary Policy: Perspective from the Open Market Trading Desk,” speech delivered at the Money\nMarketeers of New York University, New York, May 18,\nhttps://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2017/log170518.\n\n- 11 -\ninclude the Treasury General Account, the foreign repurchase agreement (or repo) pool,\nbalances held at the Fed by designated financial market utilities, and other items.\nTo gain a sense of the possible long-run size of the balance sheet, the next slide\nshows simulations under three different assumptions for the ultimate level of reserve\nbalances: $100 billion, $600 billion, and $1 trillion (figure 10).22 These simulations\nshow that, due to the growth of currency and other liabilities, the balance sheet will\nremain considerably above its pre-crisis levels even if reserves were to fall back to $100\nbillion (the black line). At its current growth rate, currency in circulation would reach $2\ntrillion by 2022 and $2.8 trillion in 2027. Even in the low case in which reserves decline\nto $100 billion, our balance sheet would be about $2.4 trillion in 2022 and would grow\nfrom there in line with currency demand. If the long-run level of reserves is $600 billion\nin 2022, then the balance sheet would be about $2.9 trillion.23\nThe appropriate long-run level of reserves will also depend on the operating\nframework the Committee chooses. Before the crisis, reserves were scarce, and the\nCommittee used open market operations to control the federal funds rate by managing\n22 The intermediate figure of $600 billion is based on the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s May 2017\nsurveys of primary dealers and market participants. Following the 2017 study by Ferris, Kim, and\nSchlusche, the federal funds rate path used in the balance sheet simulations consists of the modal path\ngiven in the FOMC participants’ Summary of Economic Projections (SEP); see Erin E. Syron Ferris, Soo\nJeong Kim, and Bernd Schlusche (2017), “Confidence Interval Projections of the Federal Reserve Balance\nSheet and Income,” FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,\nJanuary 13), https://dx.doi.org/10.17016/2380-7172.1875. In the simulations shown here, the SEP used\npertains to the projections submitted in conjunction with the March 2017 FOMC meeting. All three of the\nsimulated balance sheet paths shown are predicated on a 12-month reinvestment phaseout commencing in\nlate 2017. The FRB/US model is used to generate the associated paths of the 10-year Treasury yield as\nwell as the paths of other financial and macroeconomic variables. Different paths of these variables imply\ndifferent trajectories of the balance sheet, in part by changing the implied path of currency in circulation.\nOther assumptions used in generating the simulations are like those described in Ferris, Kim, and Schlusche\n(2017). The time of balance sheet normalization is defined as the point at which reserve balances decline to\ntheir assumed terminal value. Both in Ferris, Kim, and Schlusche (2017) and in the illustration here, the\nevolution of the balance sheet is represented by the path of the Federal Reserve’s System Open Market\nAccount holdings.\n23 In the simulations from which these values are obtained, it is assumed that some prominent items in the\n“Other liabilities” category diminish to zero by the end of 2022.\n\n- 12 -\nreserve supply. This process was operationally and resource intensive for the Desk and\nits counterparties. As a consequence of QE, however, reserves have been highly\nabundant and will remain so for some years. To affect financial conditions, the Federal\nReserve has therefore used administered rates, including the interest rate paid on excess\nreserves (IOER) and, more recently, the offering rate of the overnight reverse repurchase\nagreement (ON RRP) facility. This approach, sometimes referred to as a “floor system,”\nis simple to operate and has provided good control over the federal funds rate. In\nNovember 2016, when the Committee discussed using a floor system as part of its\nlonger-run framework, I was among those who saw such an approach as “likely to be\nrelatively simple and efficient to administer, relatively straightforward to communicate,\nand effective in enabling interest rate control across a wide range of circumstances.”24\nSome have advocated a return to a framework similar to the pre-2007 system, in\nwhich the volume of reserves would likely be far below its present level and the federal\nfunds rate would be managed by frequent open market operations.25 This “corridor”\nframework remains a feasible option, although, in my view, it may be less robust over\ntime than a floor system.\nConcluding Remarks\nAfter a tumultuous decade, the economy is now close to full employment and\nprice stability. The problems that some commentators predicted have not come to pass.\nAccommodative policy did not generate high inflation or excessive credit growth; rather,\n24 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2016), “Minutes of the Federal Open Market\nCommittee, November 1-2, 2016,” press release, November 23, paragraph 6,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20161123a.htm.\n25 See, for example, John B. Taylor (2016), “Interest on Reserves and the Fed’s Balance Sheet,” Cato\nJournal, vol. 36 (Fall), pp. 711-20.\n\n- 13 -\nit helped restore full employment and return inflation closer to our 2 percent goal. The\ncurrent discussions of the normalization of monetary policy are a result of that success.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n12:00 p.m. EST\nNovember 28, 2018\nThe Federal Reserve’s Framework for Monitoring Financial Stability\nRemarks by\nJerome H. Powell\nChairman\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe Economic Club of New York\nNew York, New York\nNovember 28, 2018\n\nIt is a pleasure to be back at the Economic Club of New York. I will begin by\nbriefly reviewing the outlook for the economy, and then turn to a discussion of financial\nstability. My main subject today will be the profound transformation since the Global\nFinancial Crisis in the Federal Reserve’s approach to monitoring and addressing financial\nstability. Today marks the publication of the Board of Governors’ first Financial\nStability Report. Earlier this month, we published our first Supervision and Regulation\nReport. Together, these reports contain a wealth of information on our approach to\nfinancial stability and to financial regulation more broadly. By clearly and transparently\nexplaining our policies, we aim to strengthen the foundation of democratic legitimacy\nthat enables the Fed to serve the needs of the American public.\nOutlook and Monetary Policy\nCongress assigned the Federal Reserve the job of promoting maximum\nemployment and price stability. I am pleased to say that our economy is now close to\nboth of those objectives. The unemployment rate is 3.7 percent, a 49-year low, and many\nother measures of labor market strength are at or near historic bests. Inflation is near our\n2 percent target. The economy is growing at an annual rate of about 3 percent, well\nabove most estimates of its longer-run trend.\nFor seven years during the crisis and its painful aftermath, the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (FOMC) kept our policy interest rate unprecedentedly low--in fact,\nnear zero--to support the economy as it struggled to recover. The health of the economy\ngradually but steadily improved, and about three years ago the FOMC judged that the\ninterests of households and businesses, of savers and borrowers, were no longer best\nserved by such extraordinarily low rates. We therefore began to raise our policy rate\n\n- 2 -\ngradually toward levels that are more normal in a healthy economy. Interest rates are still\nlow by historical standards, and they remain just below the broad range of estimates of\nthe level that would be neutral for the economy--that is, neither speeding up nor slowing\ndown growth. My FOMC colleagues and I, as well as many private-sector economists,\nare forecasting continued solid growth, low unemployment, and inflation near 2 percent.\nThere is a great deal to like about this outlook. But we know that things often\nturn out to be quite different from even the most careful forecasts. For this reason, sound\npolicymaking is as much about managing risks as it is about responding to the baseline\nforecast. Our gradual pace of raising interest rates has been an exercise in balancing\nrisks. We know that moving too fast would risk shortening the expansion. We also know\nthat moving too slowly--keeping interest rates too low for too long--could risk other\ndistortions in the form of higher inflation or destabilizing financial imbalances. Our path\nof gradual increases has been designed to balance these two risks, both of which we must\ntake seriously.\nWe also know that the economic effects of our gradual rate increases are\nuncertain, and may take a year or more to be fully realized. While FOMC participants’\nprojections are based on our best assessments of the outlook, there is no preset policy\npath. We will be paying very close attention to what incoming economic and financial\ndata are telling us. As always, our decisions on monetary policy will be designed to keep\nthe economy on track in light of the changing outlook for jobs and inflation.\nUnder the dual mandate, jobs and inflation are the Fed’s meat and potatoes. In\nthe rest of my comments, I will focus on financial stability--a topic that has always been\non the menu, but that, since the crisis, has become a more integral part of the meal.\n\n- 3 -\nHistorical Perspective on Financial Stability\nThe term “financial stability” has a particular meaning in this context. A stable\nfinancial system is one that continues to function effectively even in severely adverse\nconditions. A stable system meets the borrowing and investment needs of households\nand businesses despite economic turbulence. An unstable system, in contrast, may\namplify turbulence and prolong economic hardship in the face of stress by failing to\nprovide these essential services when they are needed most.\nFor Economic Club of New York trivia buffs, I will note that the second ever\npresentation to this club by a Federal Reserve official was about this very topic. The date\nwas March 18, 1929. Weeks before, the Fed had issued a public statement of concern\nover stock market speculation, and had provided guidance frowning on bank funding of\nsuch speculation. William Harding, a former Fed Chair and then president of the Federal\nReserve Bank of Boston, defended the Fed’s actions in his talk. He argued that, while the\nFed should not act as the arbiter of correct asset prices, it did have a primary\nresponsibility to protect the banking system’s capacity to meet the credit needs of\nhouseholds and businesses. At the meeting, critics argued that public statements about\ninflated asset prices were “fraught with danger;” that the nation’s banks were so well\nmanaged that they should not “face public admonition”; and, more generally, that the Fed\nwas “out of its sphere.”1 Of course, Harding spoke just a few months before the 1929\nstock market crash, which signaled the onset of the Great Depression.2\n1 See remarks of W.P.G. Harding at a dinner of the Economic Club of New York on March 18, 1929, as\nreported in “Clash on Policies of Reserve Board” by the New York Times on March 19, 1929, p. 52; and in\n“Reserve Policy Upheld and Hit” by the Wall Street Journal on March 19, 1929, p. 21. Also see “Wall\nStreet News and Comment,” Special Dispatch to the [Daily Boston] Globe, on March 24, 1929, p. A60.\n2 Many factors after the initial crash, including what are now seen as major policy errors, contributed to the\nGreat Depression. See Milton Friedman and Anna Jacobson Schwartz (1963), A Monetary History of the\nUnited States, 1867-1960 (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press); and Ben S. Bernanke (1983),\n\n- 4 -\nFast forwarding, a host of Depression-era reforms helped avoid, for the next\nthree-quarters of a century, a systemic financial crisis and the associated severe economic\ndislocation--the longest such period in American history. Those decades saw many\nadvances in monetary policy and in bank regulatory policy, but the appropriate role for\ngovernment in managing threats to the broader financial system remained unresolved.\nPeriodic bouts of financial stress during this period--such as the Latin American debt\ncrisis, the savings and loan crisis, and the Russian debt default--were met with\nimprovised responses. Policymakers conjured fixes from a mixture of private-sector\nrescues, emergency liquidity, occasional implicit or explicit bailouts, and monetary\naccommodation. Outside of these crisis responses, however, systemic issues were not a\ncentral focus of policy.\nThe Global Financial Crisis demonstrated, in the clearest way, the limits of this\napproach. Highly inventive and courageous improvisation amid scenes of great drama\nhelped avoid another Great Depression, but failed to prevent the most severe recession in\n75 years. The crisis made clear that there can be no macroeconomic stability without\nfinancial stability, and that systemic stability risks often take root and blossom in good\ntimes.3 Thus, as the emergency phase of the crisis subsided, Congress, the Fed, and the\nother financial regulators began developing a fundamentally different approach to\nfinancial stability. Instead of relying on improvised responses after crises strike,\npolicymakers now constantly monitor vulnerabilities and require firms to plan in advance\n“Nonmonetary Effects of the Financial Crisis in the Propagation of the Great Depression,” American\nEconomic Review, vol. 73 (June), pp. 257-76.\n3 Hyman Minsky had long emphasized this point. For instance, see Hyman P. Minsky (1991), “Financial\nCrises: Systemic or Idiosyncratic,” Working Paper 51, prepared for presentation at “Crisis in Finance,” a\nconference of the Jerome Levy Economics Institute, Bard College, April.\n\n- 5 -\nfor financial distress, in a framework that lays out solutions in advance during good\ntimes.\nThe New Approach to Financial Stability\nThis new approach can be divided into three parts. First, build up the strength and\nresilience of the financial system. Second, develop and apply a broad framework for\nmonitoring financial stability on an ongoing basis. And third, explain the new approach\nas transparently as possible, so that the public and its representatives in Congress can\nprovide oversight and hold us accountable for this work. Although I’ll focus mainly on\nthe stability efforts of the Federal Reserve, a number of federal regulatory agencies have\nresponsibilities in this area. All of these agencies are represented on the Financial\nStability Oversight Council, or FSOC, which is chaired by the Treasury Secretary and\nwhich provides a forum for interagency cooperation in responding to emerging risks.\nBuilding Resilience of the Financial System\nAfter 10 years of concentrated effort in the public and private sectors, the system\nis now much stronger, with greater capacity to function effectively in stressful times. In\nthe banking system, we have implemented a post-crisis regulatory framework based on\nrobust capital and liquidity requirements, a strong stress-testing regime, and mandatory\nliving wills for the largest firms. As a result, banks now have much more high quality\ncapital than before (figure 1). The most recent stress tests indicate that, even after a\nsevere global recession, capital levels at the largest banks would remain above regulatory\nminimums, and above the levels those banks held in good times before the crisis.4 The\n4 See the Federal Reserve’s November 2018 Supervision and Regulation Report, available on the Board’s\nwebsite at https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/2018-november-supervision-and-regulation-report-\npreface.htm.\n\n- 6 -\nmost systemically important financial institutions also now hold roughly 20 percent of\ntheir assets in the form of high quality liquid assets--that is, safe assets that could be\nreadily sold at short notice (figure 2). The share of these assets is about four times its\npre-crisis level.\nCompared with other economies, lending and borrowing in the United States\ndepend less on bank loans and more on funds flowing through a wide array of capital\nmarket channels. The crisis revealed that this capital market centric system, despite its\nmany benefits, also provides more places where systemic risks can emerge. In response,\nCongress and the regulatory agencies have made many stability-enhancing changes\noutside of the banking system. For example, many derivatives transactions are now\nrequired to be centrally cleared, which, through netting, has reduced exposures and\nenabled better management of counterparty risk. Tri-party repurchase agreement (repo)\nreforms have substantially improved the resilience of that marketplace, in particular by\nlimiting intraday loans. Before the crisis, prime institutional money market funds were\npermitted to report a constant, $1 share price so long as the value of the underlying assets\nremained near $1. This reporting convention, combined with the implicit support of the\nplans’ sponsors, led investors to treat those funds like bank deposits, even though they\nwere not likewise insured. These funds are now required to report floating net-asset\nvalues, and after this reform investors chose to migrate to government-only funds, which\nare safer and less susceptible to runs (figure 3).5 These and other measures have reduced\nthe risk that key non-bank parts of the system would freeze up in the face of market\nstress.\n5 Given that government money fund asset holdings are limited to safe assets, they are allowed to maintain\na $1 share price.\n\n- 7 -\nA New Framework for Monitoring Systemic Risks\nInnovation and risk-taking contribute to the dynamism of our financial system and\nour economy. As Hyman Minsky emphasized, along with the many benefits of\ndynamism comes the reality that the financial system will sometimes evolve toward\nexcess and dangerous imbalances.6 This reality underscores the vital importance of the\nsecond part of post-crisis reform: monitoring for emerging vulnerabilities.\nAs laid out in our new Financial Stability Report, we have developed a\nframework to help us monitor risks to stability in our complex and rapidly evolving\nfinancial system. The framework distinguishes between shocks, that is, trigger events\nthat can be hard to predict or influence, and vulnerabilities, defined as features of the\nfinancial system that amplify shocks. The report is organized around four broad\nvulnerabilities that have been prominent in financial crises through the centuries. Each of\nthese vulnerabilities is often found to some degree even in healthy market-based systems,\nand there is not, at present, any generally accepted standard for assessing at what level\nthe vulnerabilities begin to pose serious stability risks. In lieu of such a standard, we flag\ncases in which the vulnerabilities rise well beyond historical norms, and then form\njudgments about the stability risks those cases present.\nThe first vulnerability is excessive leverage in the financial sector.7 If a highly\nleveraged segment of the financial system is buffeted by adverse events, the affected\nentities may all need to deleverage at the same time by selling assets, leading to what is\ncalled a “fire sale.” Both the resulting decline in asset prices and the impaired ability of\nthe segment to play its role in the economy can amplify the effects of a downturn. We\n6 See Minsky, “Financial Crises,” in note 3.\n7 A more highly leveraged sector is one that relies more heavily on borrowed money.\n\n- 8 -\nsaw this chain of events play out repeatedly in various parts of the financial sector in the\nweeks following the failure of Lehman Brothers in 2008.\nIn our surveillance, we examine leverage across many types of financial\ninstitutions, including banks, insurance companies, hedge funds, and various funding\nvehicles. Currently, we do not detect a broad-based buildup of abnormal or excessive\nleverage. As with banks, capital levels at insurance companies and broker-dealers appear\nrobust. In addition, securitization levels are far below their pre-crisis levels, and those\nstructures that do exist rely on more stable funding (see figure 4). Our view into leverage\nand risk-taking outside the banking sector is admittedly incomplete, however, and we are\nalways working to get a better view of emerging leverage excesses.8\nThe second vulnerability is funding risk, which arises when banks or nonbank\nfinancial entities rely on funding that can be rapidly withdrawn. If depositors or market\nparticipants lose faith in the soundness of an institution or the system as a whole, unstable\nfunding can simply vanish in what is called a “run.” During the crisis, we saw\nwidespread runs, including at broker-dealers, some segments of the repo market, and\nmoney market mutual funds. These runs did severe damage, contributing to a\ngeneralized panic at the time. Had the authorities not stepped in, the damage could have\nbeen even more severe.\nToday we view funding-risk vulnerabilities as low. Banks hold low levels of\nliabilities that are able and likely to run, and they hold high levels of liquid assets to fund\nany outflows that do occur. Money market mutual fund reforms have greatly reduced the\nrun risk in that sector. More generally, it is short-term, uninsured funding that would be\n8 Sometimes we look to bank lending for information. Data from the stress tests suggest that the nation’s\nlargest banks have committed about $1 trillion in lines of credit to nonbanks.\n\n- 9 -\nmost likely to run in a future stress event, and the volume of such funding is now\nsignificantly below pre-crisis peaks.\nTaken together, the evidence on these first two vulnerabilities strongly supports\nthe view that financial institutions and markets are substantially more resilient than they\nwere before the crisis. Indeed, the American financial system has successfully weathered\nsome periods of significant stress over the past several years.9\nThe third vulnerability is excessive debt loads at households and businesses.\nCredit booms have often led to credit busts and sometimes to painful economic\ndownturns. When the bust comes, those who have overborrowed tend to sharply reduce\ntheir spending. Defaults typically rise faster than had been expected, which may put\nfinancial institutions into distress. These effects may combine to bring a serious\neconomic downturn.\nThis boom-bust pattern was clear in measures of household debt around the crisis\nperiod, with mortgage debt rising far above its historical trend and then contracting\nsharply (see figure 5). After the contraction, household debt has grown only moderately.\nThe net increase in mortgage debt has been among borrowers with higher credit scores.\nWhile heavily indebted households always suffer in a downturn, all of this suggests that\nhousehold debt would not present a systemic stability threat if the economy sours.\nNonfinancial business borrowing presents a subtler story. With corporate debt,\nthe United States has not faced a massive credit boom like that experienced with\nresidential mortgages before the recent crisis. Instead, after controlling for its trend,\n9 Examples include episodes of intensified concerns over euro-area fiscal challenges, the discontinuous and\nlarge appreciation of the Swiss franc in January 2015, and the market volatility associated with global\ngrowth concerns in late 2015.\n\n- 10 -\nbusiness borrowing relative GDP has risen during expansions, no doubt reflecting\nbusiness optimism, and then fallen when the cycle turned, as some of that optimism\nproved unfounded (see figure 6). By this measure, the ratio of corporate debt to GDP is\nabout where one might expect after nearly a decade of economic expansion: it is well\nabove its trend, but not yet at the peaks hit in the late 1980s or late 1990s. Further, the\nupward trend in recent years appears broadly consistent with the growth in business\nassets relative to GDP.\nThere are reasons for concern, however. Information on individual firms reveals\nthat, over the past year, firms with high leverage and interest burdens have been\nincreasing their debt loads the most (see figure 7). In addition, other measures of\nunderwriting quality have deteriorated, and leverage multiples have moved up. Some of\nthese highly leveraged borrowers would surely face distress if the economy turned down,\nleading investors to take higher-than-expected losses--developments that could\nexacerbate the downturn. The question for financial stability is whether elevated\nbusiness bankruptcies and outsized losses would risk undermining the ability of the\nfinancial system to perform its critical functions on behalf of households and businesses.\nFor now, my view is that such losses are unlikely to pose a threat to the safety and\nsoundness of the institutions at the core of the system and, instead, are likely to fall on\ninvestors in vehicles like collateralized loan obligations with stable funding that present\nlittle threat of damaging fire sales.10 Of course, we will continue to monitor\ndevelopments in this sector carefully.\n10 See Jerome H. Powell (2015), “Financial Institutions, Financial Markets, and Financial Stability,” speech\ndelivered at the Stern School of Business, New York University, New York, N.Y., February 18,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20150218a.htm.\n\n- 11 -\nThe fourth and final vulnerability arises when asset values rise far above\nconventional, historically observed valuation benchmarks--a phenomenon popularly\nreferred to as a “bubble.” The contentious term “bubble” does not appear in our work,\nhowever.11 Instead, we focus is on the extent to which an asset’s price is high or low\nrelative to conventional benchmarks based on expected payoffs and current economic\nconditions. Historically, when asset prices soar far above standard benchmarks, sharp\ndeclines follow with some regularity, and those declines may bring economic misery\nreaching far beyond investors directly involved in the speculative boom. We therefore\npay close attention when valuations get to the extreme ends of what we have seen in\nhistory.\nLooking across the landscape of major asset classes, we see some classes for\nwhich valuations seem high relative to history. For example, even after standard\nadjustments for economic conditions, valuations on riskier forms of corporate debt and\ncommercial properties are in the upper ends of their post-crisis distributions, although\nthey are short of the levels they hit in the pre-crisis credit boom. We see no major asset\nclass, however, where valuations appear far in excess of standard benchmarks as some\ndid, for example, in the late 1990s dot-com boom or the pre-crisis credit boom.\nThe asset class that gets the most attention day-to-day is, of course, the stock\nmarket. Today, equity market prices are broadly consistent with historical benchmarks\nsuch as forward price-to-earnings ratios (see figure 8). It is important to distinguish\nbetween market volatility and events that threaten financial stability. Large, sustained\n11 Analysts differ over how to define the term “bubble,” and debate continues about the degree to which\neconomic fundamentals might explain even the most famous apparent bubble cases from history. On the\ntopic of tulip mania, for example, see Peter M. Garber (1989), “Tulipmania,” Journal of Political Economy,\nvol. 97 (June), pp. 535-60.”\n\n- 12 -\ndeclines in equity prices can put downward pressure on spending and confidence. From\nthe financial stability perspective, however, today we do not see dangerous excesses in\nthe stock market.\nMonitoring Likely Triggers for Financial Distress\nI mentioned the distinction between vulnerabilities and shocks, or triggers. In\naddition to monitoring vulnerabilities under our four-part framework, we also consult a\nbroad range of contacts regarding sources of risk that might trigger distress at any given\ntime. For example, discussions with contacts currently point to risks emanating from the\nnormalization of monetary policy in the United States and elsewhere, the unsettled state\nof trade negotiations, Brexit negotiations, budget discussions between Italy and the\nEuropean Union, and cyber-related disruptions.12\nHaving identified possible triggers, we can assess how a particular trigger is likely\nto interact with known vulnerabilities. A good current example is that of Brexit. U.S.\nbanks and broker-dealers participate in some of the markets most likely to be affected by\nBrexit. The Fed and other regulators have been working with U.S. financial institutions\nthat have operations in the European Union or the United Kingdom to prepare for the full\nrange of possible outcomes to the negotiations. In addition, the scenarios used in the\nstress tests routinely feature severe global contractions and show that U.S. banks have the\ncapital to weather even highly disruptive events.\n12 The Financial Stability Report does not currently have a standard set of metrics for determining the\nresiliency of critical financial systems to cyber disruptions. Nonetheless, cyber risks are the subject of\nongoing policy efforts at that Federal Reserve and other relevant agencies, and these entities are working to\ndevelop resiliency expectations and measures, which may be part of future discussions in the stability\nreport.\n\n- 13 -\nBottom Line: Financial Stability Risks Are Moderate\nI have reviewed a few of the key facts that inform our thinking about financial\nstability, and you will find a great deal more detail in our new report. You will also find\nthat the report does not come to a bottom line conclusion. As I noted earlier, we have\nlimited experience with this monitoring, and there is no widely accepted basis for\nreaching a bottom line. Thus, the purpose of the report is to provide a common platform\nand set of readings from which policymakers and other interested parties can form their\nown views. Individual policymakers will sometimes differ in their assessments and on\nthe relative weight they put on particular vulnerabilities. My own assessment is that,\nwhile risks are above normal in some areas and below normal in others, overall financial\nstability vulnerabilities are at a moderate level.13\nIn my view, the most important feature of the stability landscape is the strength of\nthe financial system. The risks of destabilizing runs are far lower than in the past. The\ninstitutions at the heart of the financial system are more resilient. The stress tests\nroutinely feature extremely severe downturns in business credit, and the largest banks\nhave the capital and liquidity to continue to function under such circumstances. Because\nthis core resilience is so important, we are committed to preserving and strengthening the\nkey improvements since the crisis, particularly those in capital, liquidity, stress testing,\nand resolution.\n13 The staff have also assessed financial stability vulnerabilities as moderate. For instance, see the minutes\nof the Federal Open Market Committee meeting, July 31-August 1, 2018, available on the Board’s website\nat https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20180822a.htm.\n\n- 14 -\nConclusion\nI’d like to conclude by putting financial stability and our two new reports in a\nlonger-term context. To paraphrase a famous line, “eternal vigilance is the price of\nfinancial stability.” We will publish these reports regularly as part of our vigilance.\nOver time, some may be tempted to dismiss the reports entirely or to\noverdramatize any concerns they raise. Instead, these reports should be viewed as you\nmight view the results of a regular health checkup. We all hope for a report that is not\nvery exciting. Many baby boomers like me are, however, reaching an age where a good\nreport is, “Well, there are a number of things we should keep an eye on, but all things\nconsidered you are in good health.” That is how I view the Financial Stability Report out\ntoday.\nWe hope that this report and the Supervision and Regulation Report will be\nimportant tools, sharing Federal Reserve views and stimulating public dialogue regarding\nthe stability of the financial system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n12:15p.m. EST\nMarch 3, 2017\nInnovation, Technology, and the Payments System\nRemarks by\nJerome H. Powell\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nBlockchain: The Future of Finance and Capital Markets?\nThe Yale Law School Center for the Study of Corporate Law\nWeil, Gotshal & Manges Roundtable\nYale University\nNew Haven, Conn.\nMarch 3, 2017\n\nNew technology and innovative businesses increasingly affect our daily\nfinancial lives. Mobile devices, high-speed data communication, and online\ncommerce are creating expectations that convenient, secure, real-time payment and\nbanking capabilities should be available whenever and wherever they are needed.\nAt the same time, disruptive new technologies suggest that traditional financial\nservice providers must innovate and adapt or be left behind.\nAgainst this backdrop of technological change and heightened expectations,\nit is worth remembering our broad public policy objectives, which are driven by\nthe fundamental importance of the payments system in our society. Today, I will\nlay out those objectives as we see them at the Federal Reserve, and focus in\nparticular on their application in three specific areas where technological\ninnovation is driving change: creating a real-time retail payments system, using\ndistributed ledger technology to develop new clearing and settlement services, and\nthe issuance of digital currencies by central banks.\nPublic Policy Objectives for the Payments System\nWe trust financial intermediaries to hold and transfer funds in a safe and\nsecure manner to meet the needs of commerce. The payments system provides\nfinancial institutions and their customers a variety of ways to transfer funds, but\nthe goal is essentially the same in all cases: to move money from one individual or\nbusiness to another in a reliable, secure, low-cost, and convenient manner.\n\n- 2 -\nThe Federal Reserve and other central banks have adopted broad public\npolicy objectives to guide the development and oversight of the payments system.\nAt the Fed, we have identified efficiency and safety as our most fundamental\nobjectives, as set forth in our Policy on Payment System Risk.1\nAn efficient payments system provides the infrastructure needed to transfer\nmoney in low-cost and convenient ways. Efficient systems are innovative in\nimproving the quality of services in response to changing technology and changing\ndemand. Efficient systems are also broadly accessible through means that are\nconvenient for consumers, businesses, and financial institutions around the\ncountry. Safe payment systems are built from proven technology and operate\nreliably and with integrity. Safe systems address a range of well-known risks,\nincluding legal, operational, security, and financial risks. Information security and\nprivacy have become particularly important in recent years. Overall, the payments\nsystem must be innovative, while also addressing risks, supporting financial\nstability and maintaining public confidence.\n1 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “The Federal Reserve Policy on Payment System Risk”\n(Washington: Board of Governors, 2016), https://www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/files/psr_policy.pdf. See\nalso Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, The Federal Reserve System Purposes & Functions, 10th\nedition (Washington: Board of Governors, 2016), www.federalreserve.gov/pf/pf.htm and Federal Reserve System,\n“Strategies for Improving the U.S. Payment System” (Washington: Board of Governors and Federal Reserve\nSystem, 2015), https://fedpaymentsimprovement.org/wp-content/uploads/strategies-improving-us-payment-\nsystem.pdf.\n\n- 3 -\nFaster and More Secure Retail Payment Systems\nThe development of real-time retail payments has been gaining momentum\nglobally. The UK has had a system in place since 2008. Australia is actively\ndeveloping a new nationwide system. The European Central Bank, the Bank of\nJapan, and several other central banks have also been acting as catalysts to promote\nreal-time payments initiatives. The broad emergence of real-time systems\nthroughout the world reflects the growing demand for such systems, and the need\nfor the payments system to keep up with evolving technology.2\nIn the United States, our traditional bank-centric payments system,\nsometimes operating on decades-old infrastructure, has adjusted slowly to the\nevolving demands for greater speed and safety. Innovators have built new systems\nand services that ride on top of the old rails but with mixed results, and over time,\nour system has grown more fragmented. Our payments system is large and\ndiverse, with a wide array of financial institutions, systems, and service providers;\nit will take coordinated action to make fundamental and successful nationwide\nimprovements. The Federal Reserve has often helped address problems of this\nnature by convening stakeholders in the payments system and encouraging them to\nidentify key issues and to work together to make fundamental improvements.\n2 For a broad discussion of international developments and issues in faster payments, see Committee on Payments\nand Market Infrastructures, “Fast Payments—Enhancing the Speed and Availability of Retail Payments” (Basel,\nSwitzerland: Bank for International Settlements, November 2016), www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d154.pdf.\n\n- 4 -\nWith this in mind, the Federal Reserve has in recent years been working\nwith a wide range of stakeholders to improve the speed, efficiency, and safety of\nthe U.S. payments system. Significant dialogue and public responses to a\nconsultation paper in 2013 indicated that stakeholders would welcome a broad\ninitiative to work for change. In response, in 2015, the Federal Reserve launched\nseveral initiatives including a Faster Payments Task Force and a Secure Payments\nTask Force.\nI spoke about the payments security initiative on another occasion.3 The\nSecure Payments Task Force has been advancing important work, including\noutlining ways for the industry to improve payment identity management practices,\ncrafting guidance on standardizing fraud and risk data, and developing a\nframework for protecting sensitive payment data. You can expect to see the results\nof these efforts later this year.\nToday, however, I will focus on the Faster Payments Task Force. In\nforming the task force, we committed to an inclusive and transparent approach that\nwould ensure representation of diverse stakeholder interests. The group is\ncomprised of over 300 representatives from financial institutions, technology\n3 See Jerome H. Powell, “Building a Safer Payment System” (speech delivered at the Federal Reserve Bank of\nKansas City Conference, “The Puzzle of Payments Security: Fitting the Pieces Together to Protect the Retail\nPayments System,” Kansas City, Missouri, June 25, 2015),\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20150625a.htm.\n\n- 5 -\ncompanies, consumer advocates, and others.4 The role of the task force is to\nidentify and assess alternative approaches for implementing safe, ubiquitous, faster\npayment capabilities in the United States.\nTo support that mission, the task force developed a framework, called the\n“Faster Payments Effectiveness Criteria,” to provide guidance to the wider\npayments community on the desired attributes of a future payments system. The\nframework identified 36 “effectiveness criteria” that a faster payments system\nshould meet, covering six broad areas: ubiquity, efficiency, safety and security,\nspeed, legal framework, and governance. Task force members and others have\nwidely embraced the effectiveness criteria. Our hope is that the criteria will serve\nas a lasting blueprint for payments service providers in designing innovative future\nproducts.\nThe task force also established a process through which its members could\nsubmit proposals for faster payments capabilities and have them assessed against\nthe effectiveness criteria by a qualified independent assessment team. The task\nforce encouraged members to submit proposals reflecting both products under\ndevelopment and conceptual designs. There was overwhelming enthusiasm around\nthe process, and the task force ultimately completed reviews of 19 faster payments\n4 Information about the Faster Payments Task Force and the companion Secure Payments Task Force is available at\nhttps://fedpaymentsimprovement.org/.\n\n- 6 -\nproposals. Collectively, the proposals represent a broad range of creative and\ninnovative ways to deliver real-time payments. Some are based on current designs\nand established technology. Others leverage the latest innovative ideas and\ntechnologies.\nIn 2017, the task force has been working on a final report. Part 1 of the\nreport--the background and motivation for pursuing faster payments--was\npublished in January.5 Part 2 will include the proposals themselves and their\nassessments, along with task force recommendations for moving the U.S. payments\nsystem forward in implementing faster payments. Part 2 will be released around\nthe middle of this year. Until then, the proposals remain confidential to the task\nforce.\nThe role of the task force is not to select one or more proposals for\nimplementation, but rather to assess the proposals against the task force criteria. It\nwill be the job of the financial industry to take these proposals forward as they see\nfit. I strongly encourage the industry and other stakeholders to continue the work\nof bringing ubiquitous real-time payments systems and services to the U.S. market.\nIt will be important that we keep end users in mind as the new real-time\nenvironment evolves, emphasizing inclusion, safety and trust, and consumer\n5 See “The U.S. Path to Faster Payments, Final Report Part One: The Faster Payments Task Force Approach,”\nFaster Payments Task Force (2017). https://fedpaymentsimprovement.org/wp-content/uploads/path-to-faster-\npayments.pdf.\n\n- 7 -\neducation and protections. End users will ultimately determine the success of new\npayment services and the future direction of faster payments in this country.\nDistributed Ledger Technologies\nLet’s turn to another type of new technology that may have important\nimplications for the payments and financial systems: distributed ledger technology,\nor DLT. Bitcoin helped bring this technology to public attention. Using\nblockchain technology--which employs a form of DLT--and an open architecture,\nBitcoin allows for the transfer of value (bitcoins) between participants connected to\nits ecosystem without reliance on banks or other trusted intermediaries. This\nfeature has led some to predict that DLT will in the long run render parts of the\nbanking and payments system obsolete, as the intermediation of funds through the\nbanking system will become unnecessary.\nFaced with these dramatic predictions, we have seen banks and market\ninfrastructures collaborate with technology firms to explore the use and further\ndevelopment of DLT. In 2016, there was widespread experimentation. Efforts by\nfinancial institutions often focused on evaluating the technology, identifying\npotential uses, and conducting proofs of concept. Prominent examples included\nthe use of distributed ledgers to store transactional data and records in tamper-\nproof ways, as well as the use of the technology as a primary means to hold and\ntransfer money or assets. By the end of 2016, a few major U.S. clearing\n\n- 8 -\norganizations had announced plans to use distributed ledger technology in limited\nways.\nAs we have followed developments over the past year, a few lessons have\ncome into better focus.6 First, in contrast to Bitcoin’s open architecture, work by\nthe financial industry has focused on the development of “permissioned” systems,\nwhich establish criteria to determine who is permitted access to particular systems,\nledgers, functions, or information. In the near term, this approach seems more\nlikely than fully open systems to provide the needed governance and management\nto address operational, security, and financial risks. Indeed, access is typically\npermissioned in situations that require the protection of systems and information in\nthe financial and other industries. Even in permissioned systems, some key issues\nwill remain, including whether finality of settlement is to be determined by a\ncentral trusted party or by a majority of participants, and whether participants are\nable to view information on other parties’ transactions. Some argue that movement\naway from open systems undermines the potential efficiency and the spirit of DLT.\nAt least for now, in payment, clearing, and settlement, safety and confidence must\nalso weigh in the balance.\n6 See David Mills, Kathy Wang, Brendan Malone, Anjana Ravi, Jeff Marquardt, Clinton Chen, Anton Badev,\nTimothy Brezinski, Linda Fahy, Kimberley Liao, Vanessa Kargenian, Max Ellithorpe, Wendy Ng, and Maria Baird,\n“Distributed Ledger Technology in Payments, Clearing, and Settlement,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series\n2016-095 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, December 2016),\nwww.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/feds/2016/files/2016095pap.pdf.\n\n- 9 -\nSecond, firms are still grappling with the business case for upgrading and\nstreamlining payment, clearing, settlement, and related functions with DLT.\nPromoters of DLT offer a vision of streamlined processes that lead to faster\nprocessing, reduced reconciliation, and lower long-run operating costs. Some\nargue that in certain markets, faster and more predictable processing will also\nreduce the capital and liquidity costs of operations. But upgrades are often costly,\nlengthy, and risky, particularly if the technology is still being proven, as is the case\nfor DLT. Network effects can also affect adoption, since multiple firms may all\nneed to adopt a particular implementation of DLT in order to justify its use in a\nspecific market.\nThird, technical issues remain. Practical issues such as whether a particular\nversion of DLT will work for the intended purpose are still being explored. Issues\nof reliability, scalability, and security remain very important. Beyond these issues,\nstandardization and interoperability across different versions of DLT will need to\nbe addressed to allow technology integration and avoid market fragmentation. In\ngeneral, industry members and technology providers recognize these important\nissues and have taken initial steps to address problems. It will be important to keep\nthese challenges firmly in mind as we move beyond experimentation and into the\ndevelopment and deployment of new products and processes.\n\n- 10 -\nFourth, governance and risk management will be critical. For individual\nfirms or clearing houses that adopt DLT as an internal technology upgrade, the\ngovernance and risk-management processes are likely to be internalized within\nexisting organizations and be akin to other technology upgrades. However, if new\nnetworks of bilateral payment, clearing, and settlement are established, the new\ntechnology may involve tightly coupled protocols and operations. The safety of\nthe overall design will depend on a highly interdependent framework. If\nautomated risk management, smart contracts, and similar tools are deployed across\na network, cascades of rapid and hard-to-control obligations and liquidity flows\ncould propagate across a network and the financial system in response to events.\nThis interdependence will likely call for creative organizational thinking to address\nthe need for governance and strong risk management.\nFinally, the legal foundations supporting DLT will need\nattention. Deployments of DLT will involve firms, perhaps in different\njurisdictions, with systems that record and transfer information and assets under\nexisting legal frameworks. Which bodies of law apply to the particular firms,\nassets, and activities will determine the associated rights and responsibilities when\ntransfers are made, cleared, and settled. For example, whether and how banking,\npayments, securities, or commodities laws apply in a given context are likely to be\nimportant in designing systems and services and understanding their\n\n- 11 -\nproperties. And, as with any new technology, things may go wrong. We will need\na thorough analysis of how DLT fits into current legal frameworks and what gaps\nneed to be filled by contractual agreements or new laws and regulations. A robust\nlegal basis that provides certainty across relevant jurisdictions is essential for\nbuilding strong governance, risk management, and operations.\nDigital Currencies Issued by Central Banks to the General Public\nMy last topic is the potential use of DLT or other technologies by central\nbanks to issue a digital currency to the general public. In a sense, the idea of a\ndigital currency is merely a 21st century analog of paper currency. While this is a\nfascinating idea, there are significant policy issues that need to be analyzed.7\nFirst, there are meaningful technical challenges. We should have serious\nreservations about our ability to keep a generally circulating digital currency safe\nand secure over the long run. A digital currency issued by a central bank would be\na global target for cyber attacks, cyber counterfeiting, and cyber theft. The threats\ncould significantly exceed historical experience with paper currency.\nA digital currency would also be a prime target as a potential vehicle for\nglobal criminal activities, including money laundering. Central banks could face\ndifficult trade-offs between strengthening security and enabling illegal activity.\n7 Several of these and additional issues relating to the issuance of digital currencies by central banks are touched on\nbriefly in Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructure, “Digital Currencies” (Basel, Switzerland: Bank for\nInternational Settlements, November 2015), www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d137.pdf.\n\n- 12 -\nAdvanced cryptography could reduce vulnerability to cyber attacks but make it\neasier to hide illegal activity. To the extent we relax strong cryptography to make\nit easier for authorities to monitor illegal activity, we could simultaneously weaken\nsecurity. Growing computer power over time could be used to increase security\nbut could also increase threats.\nSecond, privacy issues must be seriously considered. Central banks would\nhave to maintain records of digital currency issuance and might need to maintain\nrecords of individual transactions in order to authenticate those transactions and to\ncombat cyber risks and illegal activity. In today’s environment, commercial banks\nmaintain extensive records for individual debit and credit card transactions and\nincreasingly monitor patterns of behavior for fraud. Such records in the hands of a\ncentral bank or government entity, however, could raise serious privacy concerns\nby users and might limit public appeal. Again, there may be important trade-offs\nbetween privacy and risk.\nAny central bank actively considering issuing its own digital currency would\nneed to carefully consider the full range of the payments system and other policy\nissues, which do seem substantial, as well as the potential societal benefits. To my\nmind, they should also consider whether the private sector can substantially meet\nthe same needs.\n\n- 13 -\nPrivate-sector products and systems already exist or are being developed that\nwill fulfill demands that central-bank-issued digital currencies might otherwise\nseek to meet. Prepaid cards grew out of the wave of retail payments innovation in\nthe mid-1990s and are now in widespread use. And as I mentioned earlier,\nnew private-sector-led faster payments initiatives are coming. In the United States,\na faster payments system that operates around the clock and provides the capability\nto hold and transfer deposits insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\nin real time would go a long way toward providing the low-risk and flexible\npayment arrangements that paper currency historically provided. Indeed, I would\nexpect private-sector systems to be more forward leaning than central banks in\nproviding new features to the public through faster payments systems as they\ncompete to attract retail customers. A central bank issued digital currency would\ncompete with these and other innovative private-sector products and may stifle\ninnovation over the long run.\nConclusion\nWe live in a time of extraordinary technological change. We should be open\nto the new ideas and innovations that will drive economic growth and\nimprovements in our financial system. At the same time, the public rightfully\nexpects that authorities will do whatever it takes to keep their money safe. Those\n\n- 14 -\nof us in the public sector will insist on safety and security, while also working to\nassure that our citizens benefit from payments system innovation.",

Powell\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nDivision of International Finance 75th Anniversary Conference,\nFederal Reserve Board\nWashington, D.C.\nJune 2, 2025\n\nThank you, Beth Anne.\nI want to start by offering my condolences to the family and friends of former\nVice Chair Stanley Fischer. Stan was a colleague of ours at the Fed, and a giant in the\nfield of international economics. In addition to reaching the highest levels of the field in\nhis own right, he was a trusted and generous mentor and teacher to a generation of the\nmost important economic thinkers, including many heads of global central banks,\nadvisers to presidents, and countless economists. We will miss him.\nCongratulations to Division of International Finance (IF) on 75 years of\noutstanding work in service to the Federal Reserve Board and, by extension, to all\nAmericans. Many current staff members are here to celebrate today, as well as a number\nof IF alumni, including past division directors Ted Truman, Karen Johnson, Nathan\nSheets, and Steve Kamin. The division has produced many other notable alums,\nincluding Chair and Secretary Janet Yellen; professor, author, chess grandmaster, and our\nkeynote speaker, Ken Rogoff; and humanitarian and economist Albert Hirschman,\nfamous for the Herfindahl–Hirschman Index and more recently as a character in Netflix’s\nTransatlantic, to name just a few.\nIn my time at the Fed, the IF division has provided invaluable insight into global\neconomic activity, international trade and capital flows, and developments in foreign\nfinancial markets. Division staff have also played a key role during episodes of global\nfinancial stress. And your research and analysis are critical inputs into our monetary\npolicy decisions. Thank you to all that have served in this division over the past 75 years.\nToday I will kick off this conference by briefly reviewing why the division was created\n\n- 2 -\nand highlighting a few of its many accomplishments over the years, before turning you\nover to a robust set of presentations and panels.\nNew Era for Global Economy\nThe IF division was created on July 1, 1950, but the idea began to germinate a\nfew years earlier. The U.S. emerged from World War II as a global economic\nsuperpower. The Bretton Woods Agreement placed the U.S., and the Fed, in a central\nposition in the global economy. Our mission then, as it is now, was to serve the\nAmerican people. But it was clear at that moment that the Fed needed to have better\nknowledge of global developments to achieve our dual-mandate goals.\nA 1948 memo proposing to create this division stated, “Problems of international\neconomics and finance have become increasingly large, complex, and significant in\nrecent years, and our foreign economic relations will undoubtedly continue to give rise to\nissues of the first magnitude.” That is the rare economic forecast that turned out to be\nspot on!\nSeventy-five years later, it remains critical that the Fed understand the policies\nand practices of other governments and central banks, and their implications for the U.S.\neconomy and financial markets. Exchange rate policy, of course, is now firmly in the\nhands of the U.S. Treasury. However, the end of the Bretton Woods era in the 1970s\nfundamentally changed the conduct of monetary policy, as policymakers had to\nunderstand the effects of potentially more volatile movements of the U.S. dollar on\nAmerican families and businesses.\nUnderstanding global trade and capital movements has only grown in importance\nsince 1950, as we saw during the pandemic. The IF division helps produce the data on\n\n- 3 -\ninternational capital flows, and has spent decades researching the effects of these flows\nand international trade on U.S. and foreign economies. Understanding this complex and\ninterconnected web is essential for us to anticipate the path of employment and inflation.\nAnother important development in the 1970s was the increasing use of\nmacroeconomic modeling, which greatly influenced the division’s work. Under the\ndirection of former Division Director Ralph Bryant, IF developed its first multicountry\nmodel. Always on the forefront, over the years, economists in the division—many of\nwhom are in this room today—developed increasingly sophisticated models, with each\nnew generation expanding the capability to tackle the international risks and issues of the\nday. These models have proven useful for understanding how international shocks\ntransmit through the economy and financial markets, for assessing risks and uncertainties\nthrough alternative scenarios, and for better comprehending the implications of various\nshocks for the U.S. and global economy. The results have informed research papers,\nBoard memos and briefings, as well as the risks and uncertainty assessment that Federal\nOpen Market Committee members receive in advance of every meeting.\nPrepared for Crisis\nThe IF division has also played an important role in responding to global\neconomic turbulence. A prime example is the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980s.\nThat episode required analytical thinking about the macroeconomic repercussions of the\ncrisis as it played out around the world. Work by division, and by the International\nMonetary Fund and other institutions, led to the establishment of emergency facilities to\nprevent more dire financial outcomes. As global capital flows increased, other episodes\nof financial distress surfaced across the world, including in Mexico, Asia, and Russia.\n\n- 4 -\nInternational capital flows and spillovers became, and remain, a recurrent feature in the\ndivision’s analytical and monitoring work.\nThe expertise generated through study and response to those global challenges\nproved invaluable when stress hit closer to home during the Global Financial Crisis and\nthe pandemic. Both of those events required immediate, broad, and, in many cases,\nunprecedented responses to avoid disrupting the availability of credit to American\nhouseholds and businesses. The nation, and the world, looked to the Federal Reserve to\nlead in these moments. During the Global Financial Crisis, when global funding markets\ncame under stress, the IF division worked to establish swap line arrangements with\nseveral major central banks that helped restore stability in U.S. dollar funding markets.\nAnd during the pandemic, the IF division helped lead efforts to expand the provision of\ndollar liquidity by setting up the FIMA Repo Facility.1\nThese periods of acute financial stress and uncertainty prompted the division to\ndevelop new tools and analytical products that could be used to understand and respond\nto the events unfolding on the ground. For instance, the division has devised new\nmethods to measure and assess the effect of various types of uncertainty on economic\nactivity, including new indexes that were built to track geopolitical risk, inflation, trade\npolicy, and economic uncertainty. As we continue to navigate the current period of\nheightened uncertainty, this work is critical to understanding the quantitative implications\nof uncertainty shocks.\n1 Foreign and International Monetary Authorities Repo Facility\n\n- 5 -\nConclusion\nI will conclude by saying that, for 75 years, nine Fed chairs and countless Board\nmembers have greatly benefited from the guidance and counsel of IF staff—and not just\nwhen responding to crisis. This team helps assure we are well prepared for our\ninternational engagements, by providing detailed materials ahead of time and often by\ntraveling with us. IF staff are always welcome and productive companions. In these and\nother endeavors, we benefit from the robust relationships you establish and maintain with\nour global counterparts.\nThank you to Beth Anne and all the staff here that organized this wonderful event.\nAnd, finally, thank you again to all the current and former IF staff for what you have\ndone and continue to do to help us be a globally knowledgeable and responsive central\nbank, so that we can deliver on our dual mandate for all Americans.",

Powell\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Understanding Fedspeak,” an event cosponsored by\nthe Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at the Brookings Institution\nand the Center for Financial Economics at Johns Hopkins University\nWashington, D.C.\nNovember 30, 2016\n\nThanks to David Wessel and the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy\nat the Brookings Institution for putting together this event.1 Today I will share my own\nviews on the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) public communications, which\nare designed to serve three important purposes. The first is to provide the transparency\nthat enables the Congress and the public to hold the Committee accountable for its\ndecisions on monetary policy. The second is to enhance the effectiveness of monetary\npolicy. If the public understands the central bank’s views on the economy and monetary\npolicy, then households and businesses will take those views into account in making their\nspending and investment plans; policy will be more effective as a result. And the third is\nto show the full range of FOMC participants’ views, even if doing so may sometimes\nmake it difficult for the public to identify a consensus view. In my view,\nacknowledgment of this diversity of views is important in sustaining the public’s support\nover time for the Federal Reserve as an institution--what Jon Faust refers to in his paper\nas our “democratic legitimacy.”2 In my comments, I will also react to Jon’s thought-\nprovoking and well-reasoned paper.\nThe Modern Era\nI will start with a brief tour of the modern era of FOMC communications,\nbeginning with the issuance of the first postmeeting statement in February 1994.3 That\n1 The views I express here are my own.\n2 See Jon Faust (2016), “Oh, What a Tangled Web We Weave: Monetary Policy Transparency in Divisive\nTimes,” paper prepared for “Understanding Fedspeak,” an event cosponsored by the Hutchins Center on\nFiscal and Monetary Policy at the Brookings Institution and the Center for Financial Economics at Johns\nHopkins University, held at the Brookings Institution, Washington, November 30.\n3 For a review FOMC communications, see Mark A. Wynne (2013), “A Short History of FOMC\nCommunication,” Economic Letter, vol. 8 (Dallas: Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, September),\nhttps://www.dallasfed.org/assets/documents/research/eclett/2013/el1308.pdf.\n\n- 2 -\nstatement contained four sentences and noted that the policy action was being announced\nimmediately “so as to avoid any misunderstanding of the Committee’s purposes.”4 The\nCommittee took additional steps to enhance transparency over the next two decades by\nputting its target for the federal funds rate into the statement (July 1995); releasing\nstatements after every meeting rather than only after meetings at which the Committee\nhad changed its policy (May 1999); including voting information along with an\nexplanation of dissents in the statement (March 2002); adding the first explicit forward-\nguidance language to the statement--the “considerable period” language (August 2003);\nand accelerating the release of the minutes after an FOMC meeting (December 2004).5\nThe pace of change accelerated notably after Ben Bernanke became Chairman in\n2006. At that time, the Fed was said to be a bit of a communications laggard compared\nwith some other central banks. Chairman Bernanke’s agenda would move the FOMC to\nthe forefront of transparency and accountability in modern central banking.\nIn October 2007, after extensive discussions and internal trial runs, the FOMC\npublished its first Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), which built on the\nmacroeconomic forecasts from the semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress.\nSince then, SEP projections have been expanded to include longer-run values for real\ngross domestic product growth, the unemployment rate, headline PCE (personal\nconsumption expenditures) price inflation, and the federal funds rate; assessments of\n4 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (1994), FOMC statement, press release,\nFebruary 4, paragraph 3, https://www.federalreserve.gov/fomc/19940204default.htm.\n5 The expedited release shortened the lag between an FOMC meeting and the publication of the meeting\nminutes between two and five weeks. See Deborah J. Danker and Matthew M. Luecke (2005),\n“Background on FOMC Meeting Minutes,” Federal Reserve Bulletin, vol. 91 (Spring), pp. 175-79,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/bulletin/2005/spring05_fomc.pdf.\n\n- 3 -\nuncertainty and risks to the economic outlook; and, of course, the federal funds rate\nprojections, or “dot plot,” added in January 2012.6 An extensive write-up of the\nprojections is included as an addendum to the meeting minutes. Finally, and perhaps\nmost important, since April 2011, the Chair has held a quarterly press conference\nfollowing the FOMC meetings at which SEP projections are collected.\nIn January 2012, the Committee first released its Statement on Longer-Run Goals\nand Monetary Policy Strategy, which is reaffirmed annually. This consensus statement\nserves as a quasi-constitutional document that clarifies that the Committee’s inflation\nobjective is 2 percent as measured by the annual change in the PCE price index, that this\nobjective is symmetric, that the maximum level of employment is largely determined by\nnonmonetary factors affecting the structure and dynamics of the labor market, and that\nthe Committee will take a balanced approach to promote its objectives of maximum\nemployment and 2 percent inflation under circumstances in which the Committee judges\nthat those objectives are not complementary.\nCompared with a decade ago, FOMC participants express their views more\nfrequently through speeches and interviews, and our communications vehicles reveal a\ngreater diversity of viewpoints. In FOMC meetings, as readers of our transcripts know,\nFOMC participants now speak longer than they did before 2006, and they typically make\ntheir remarks prior to hearing the policy views of the Chair. Since September 2010, the\nminutes have included paragraphs that reflect the views on monetary policy expressed by\nall meeting participants, not just those who vote on the policy decision. These changes,\n6 The “dot plot” is a figure that provides individual policymaker assessments of appropriate monetary\npolicy as defined by the value of the federal funds rate target or the midpoint of the federal funds rate target\nrange at the end of each calendar year of the SEP forecast.\n\n- 4 -\ntaken together with the SEP and the dot plot, have given greater emphasis to the diversity\nof views of Fed policymakers.\nDiscussion\nThe large size and unique structure of the FOMC have important implications for\nour communications. The Committee has seats for up to 19 participants, up to 12 of\nwhom hold votes at any given time. Governors are appointed by the President and\nconfirmed by the Senate. Reserve Bank Presidents are appointed by the Banks’ private-\nsector board members who are not affiliated with commercial banks, subject to approval\nby the Board of Governors. This unique federated structure was designed to ensure a\ndiversity of views, among other purposes. My strong view is that this institutionalized\ndiversity of thinking is a strength of our System. My own experience is that the best\noutcomes are reached when opposing viewpoints are clearly and strongly presented\nbefore decisions are made. The Committee’s diversity shows through most clearly at\ntimes such as these, when economic conditions have been particularly challenging and\nwhen there have been significant policy disagreements.\nOur communications are intended to enable the public to better understand how\nthe Committee sees the economic situation and outlook, as well as what the Committee is\nlikely to do if incoming data differ from that outlook--the Committee’s “reaction\nfunction.” My sense is that market participants and other members of the public focus\ninstead mainly on the timing of the next policy change or on how many policy moves will\noccur in a given year. It also seems that the public may not fully appreciate the\nuncertainty that surrounds the outlook. In addition, market participants often say that\nthere are too many voices saying too many different things about policy--the cacophony\n\n- 5 -\nproblem. The dot plot has been a poor predictor of the Committee’s actual policy path,\nand some have questioned its usefulness. However, markets do not appear to be\nunusually uncertain about FOMC decisions.7\nIn theory, our communications about monetary policy can be roughly divided into\nthose that express the consensus and those that show the diversity of views. Today I will\nfocus on the latter. Specifically, are communications that illustrate the diversity of views\nabout the likely policy path--particularly the dot plot and public commentary by FOMC\nparticipants other than the Chair--currently serving us well? And if not, how can we\nmake improvements?\nQuestions of how much to say about the likely path of policy were extensively\ndebated in the public sphere in the years leading up to the Bernanke era, and by the\nFOMC while Ben was Chairman.8 The benefits of greater transparency are typically\nthought to include more efficient pricing of financial assets and a closer alignment\nbetween the market’s views and those of the Committee.9 Transparency should allow\nasset prices to respond immediately to incoming economic data, which would foster\nprogress toward the Committee’s objectives. Those who supported the publication of\nsome form of policy rate path generally saw it as part of a forecast-based approach to\npolicymaking, in which policy plans depend in a complex way on policymakers’\n7 See, for example, David Mericle (2016), US Daily: The Fed and the Markets: A Failure to\nCommunicate? (New York: Goldman Sachs, September 20).\n8 See Alan S. Blinder, Michael Ehrmann, Marcel Fratzscher, Jakob De Haan, and David-Jan Jansen (2008),\n“Central Bank Communication and Monetary Policy: A Survey of Theory and Evidence,” Journal of\nEconomic Literature, vol. 46 (December), pp. 910-45.\n9 See Ben S. Bernanke (2004), “Central Bank Talk and Monetary Policy,” speech delivered at the Japan\nSociety Corporate Luncheon, New York, October 7,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2004/200410072/default.htm.\n\n- 6 -\noutlooks, risk assessments, and objectives.10 The whole forward interest rate curve\nmatters for financial conditions, not just the overnight rate. Monetary policy was\ntherefore thought to be made more effective by communication of the full expected path\nof policy, which could then be incorporated into private-sector expectations and longer-\nterm interest rates. But all along, there have been other voices urging caution and asking,\nin effect, “How much transparency is too much?” As Don Kohn noted in 2005 remarks,\n“more is not necessarily always better” when it comes to Fed communication.11 Critics\nhave often argued that too much discussion of the likely path of policy could be taken as\na commitment to a particular path and timing and could ultimately constrain the\nCommittee from pursuing what it views to be the optimal path. Indeed, to the extent that\nthe Committee’s talk about the path of policy is given weight, that talk may leave “too\nlittle scope for private assessments of economic developments to show through” in\nmarket prices.12\nJon notes in his paper that communications about monetary policy generally\nreceived high marks from 2008 through early 2013, and he focuses his analysis on the\nchallenging period since mid-2013. I am also going to skip over the years 2013-14,\nwhich included the “taper tantrum” and the relatively uneventful taper itself. I will focus\ninstead on the years 2015-16, which seem to me to be the most relevant to the challenges\n10 See Ben S. Bernanke (2004), “The Logic of Monetary Policy,” speech delivered at the National\nEconomists Club, Washington, December 2,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2004/20041202/default.htm.\n11 See Donald L. Kohn (2005), “Central Bank Communication,” speech delivered at the Annual Meeting of\nthe American Economic Association, Philadelphia, January 9, paragraph 5,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2005/20050109/default.htm.\n12 Quote taken from Kohn, “Central Bank Communication,” paragraph 12, in note 10. This point has been\nemphasized in work by Stephen Morris and Hyun Shin. See, for example, Jeffery D. Amato, Stephen\nMorris, and Hyun Song Shin (2002), “Communication and Monetary Policy,” Oxford Review of Economic\nPolicy, vol. 18 (December), pp. 495-503.\n\n- 7 -\nthe Committee faces today. I will pay particular attention to the dot plot, the cacophony\nissue, and the need to do a better job of explaining uncertainty.\nThe Dot Plot\nThe dot plot is not a consensus forecast of the Committee. Rather, the dots\nrepresent each individual participant’s assessment of the appropriate policy path. The\nCommittee considered the use of a consensus forecast in 2012 but abandoned the effort\nafter struggling to reach agreement on its parameters.13\nAs you can see from figure 1, the median dots have moved down from SEP to\nSEP. The December 2014 SEP median dots showed increases of 350 basis points over\nthe years 2015-2017. In the event, there was one 25 basis point rate increase in 2015, and\nthe September 2016 SEP median shows one more in 2016 and two in 2017--for a total of\n100 basis points. Figures 2 and 3 display rate expectations derived from financial market\nprices and forecasts made by financial market participants, respectively. These market\npaths have also declined significantly over the period. And the path estimated from\novernight index swaps (figure 2) has been substantially below the SEP median. It does\nnot appear that markets have uncritically accepted the dots, let alone taken them as a\ncommitment.14\n13 According to the minutes from the October 22-23, 2012, FOMC meeting, “In their discussion,\nparticipants agreed that FOMC communications could be enhanced by clarifying the linkage between\nparticipants’ economic forecasts, including the underlying policy assumptions, and the Committee’s policy\ndecision as expressed in the postmeeting statement. However, most participants judged that, given the\ndiversity of their views about the economy’s structure and dynamics, it would be difficult for the\nCommittee to agree on a fully specified longer-term path for monetary policy to incorporate into a\nquantitative consensus forecast in a timely manner, especially under present conditions in which the policy\ndecision comprises several elements.” See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2012),\n“Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, October 23-24, 2012,” press release, November 14,\nparagraph 52, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20121114a.htm.\n14 The expected policy rate paths shown in figures 1, 2, and 3 are not entirely comparable. The SEP paths\nare median values of the modal projections of individual participants for the end of the calendar year. The\n\n- 8 -\nSome argue that the downward march of the dots has damaged the Committee’s\ncredibility. For me, the story is both more complicated and more interesting. Like Jon, I\ndo not think of the dot plot as a useful predictor of near-term policy moves. But that is\nnot to say that the dot plot is without value. Indeed, changes in the SEP and the dot plot\nover time have been quite revealing about the evolution of policymakers’ views about the\npath of policy.\nIn recent years, FOMC participants have significantly revised their views about\nthe values to which key economic variables will converge over the longer run. The same\nis true of many other economic forecasters. Since the beginning of 2012, participants’\nviews about the longer-run annual growth potential of the economy have dropped from\n2.45 percent to 1.85 percent (figure 4).15 Much of the downward revision in estimates of\nlonger-run potential growth reflects the implications of demographic trends and the\nslowdown in productivity growth.16 These structural factors have also weighed on\nparticipants’ assessments of the longer-run neutral federal funds rate--the rate that would\nbe neither expansionary nor contractionary if the economy were operating near its\novernight index swap (OIS) paths are estimated using a spline approach; each line corresponds to the\nestimated path on the day before the release of SEP projections. OIS paths are mean forecasts of market\nparticipants and may be influenced by variations in risk premiums over time. The primary dealer survey\npaths are medians of modal forecasts, and the survey responses are collected about a week before the SEP\nprojections are released.\n15 Other forecasters--for instance, Blue Chip and the Survey of Professional Forecasters--have also revised\ndown their estimates for longer-run real gross domestic product (GDP) growth. See Jerome H. Powell\n(2016), “Recent Economic Developments, the Productive Potential of the Economy, and Monetary Policy,”\nspeech delivered at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, Washington, May 26,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20160526a.htm. In making these comparisons, I\nuse the midpoint of the central tendency for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate.\n16 See John G. Fernald (2015), “Productivity and Potential Output before, during, and after the Great\nRecession,” in Jonathan A. Parker and Michael Woodford, eds., NBER Macroeconomics Annual 2014,\nvol. 29 (Chicago: University of Chicago Press), pp. 1-51; and Etienne Gagnon, Benjamin K. Johannsen,\nand David Lopez-Salido (2016), “Understanding the New Normal: The Role of Demographics,” Finance\nand Economics Discussion Series 2016-080 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem, October), https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/feds/2016/files/2016080pap.pdf.\n\n- 9 -\npotential.17 The median assessment of the longer-run neutral federal funds rate declined\nfrom 4.25 percent in 2012 to 2.90 percent in September of this year, with 60 basis points\nof that shift occurring just since September 2015 (figure 5). The persistence of low\ninflation despite faster-than-expected reductions in unemployment has also led\nparticipants to lower their estimates of the longer-run normal unemployment rate; the\nmedian estimate has declined from 5.60 percent in January 2012 to 4.85 percent in\nSeptember 2016 (figure 6).\nTaken together, these revisions explain a good part of the downward movement of\nthe dots. One way to see that is through the application of a policy rule, such as a Taylor\nrule.18 Simple policy rules, as they are sometimes called, incorporate key factors for\nmonetary policy, including the natural rate of unemployment, the neutral rate of interest,\nand deviations of inflation and unemployment from their long-run values. As they\nprepare for FOMC meetings, FOMC participants routinely see policy recommendations\nfrom a variety of rules, including several Taylor rule variations. While these rules are\nuseful as benchmarks, in my view they should not be excessively relied on for policy\ndecisions.19\n17 For further discussion of the neutral nominal federal funds rate, see Janet L. Yellen (2015), “The\nEconomic Outlook and Monetary Policy,” speech delivered at the Economic Club of Washington,\nWashington, December 2, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/yellen20151202a.htm.\n18 See Fernanda Nechio and Glenn D. Rudebusch (2016), “Has the Fed Fallen behind the Curve This\nYear?” FRBSF Economic Letter 2016-33 (San Francisco: Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco,\nNovember), http://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-letter/2016/november/has-fed-\nfallen-behind-curve-this-year.\n19 For example, FRB/US simulations using the Taylor (1993) rule for the period 2010-15 show\nsubstantially higher unemployment and lower inflation than was actually realized. For more information\nabout the Taylor (1993) rule, see John B. Taylor (1993), “Discretion versus Policy Rules in Practice,”\nCarnegie-Rochester Conference Series on Public Policy, vol. 39 (December), pp. 195-214.\n\n- 10 -\nThe red solid line in figure 7 shows the policy prescription using the original 1993\nTaylor rule together with the September SEP dots for the federal funds rate.20 The\nTaylor rule prescription has been derived using the median value for core PCE price\ninflation, the unemployment rate, and the longer-run normal unemployment rate from the\nSeptember 2016 SEP.\nThe intercept in this Taylor rule represents the longer-run real interest rate--or r*--\nwhich is set to 2 percent. If we replace that intercept with the median of the longer-run r*\nimplied by the most recent SEP, which is 0.9 percent, we see that the rule prescribes\nmuch lower settings for policy interest rates than the unadjusted rule (the blue dashed line\nin figure 7). The lower intercept does not completely close the gap between the Taylor\nrule prescription and the dots. However, many observers believe that the neutral real\ninterest rate is currently well below its longer-run value. The language that has appeared\nin the Committee’s postmeeting statement since December 2015 that “the federal funds\nrate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the\nlonger run” is consistent with this view.21\nWe can estimate a short-run, time-varying r* using a standard reduced-form IS\n(investment and saving) equation that relates the unemployment gap to its own lagged\nvalue and the lagged real interest rate gap. We use the median of FOMC participants’\n20 The SEP policy projections are for the midpoint of the federal funds rate target range at the end of a\ncalendar year. The Taylor (1993) rule is defined as R = 2 + π + 0.5(π – 2) + 0.5Y. In this expression, R\nt t t t\nis the federal funds rate, π is the percent change in the core PCE price index from four quarters earlier, and\nY is the output gap. The rule used here is in terms of the unemployment gap instead of the output gap. The\noutput gap is approximated using Okun’s law; specifically, Y = 2.0(U* – U), where U is the\nt t\nunemployment rate and U* is the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment, or NAIRU.\n21 See, for example, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2016), “Federal Reserve Issues\nFOMC Statement,” press release, November 2, paragraph 4,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20161102a.htm.\n\n- 11 -\nprojections from the September SEP in this exercise. The IS specification employed here\nis similar to that used in Laubach-Williams (2003) and is shown in figure 8.22 Using\nthese short-run, time-varying estimates of r* as intercepts in our Taylor rule gives us the\npurple dashed-dotted line in figure 9. This rule now tells us that the median dot remains\nslightly below the adjusted rule’s prescription at the end of 2016 and 2017 but is back in\nline by the end of 2018.\nAs Don Kohn recently noted, “We have been in uncharted waters with unreliable\nanchors.”23 The downward march of the dots shows that policymakers have been\nlearning, and our understanding of the economy has been evolving, as we navigate the\ntreacherous shoals of the post-crisis economy. The revisions in the longer-run values and\nthe short-run, time-varying r* estimates provide a framework for understanding\npolicymakers’ evolving views of the economy and of appropriate monetary policy. And\nthe dots for 2016 and 2017 lie below the purple dashed-dotted line in figure 9, showing\nthat FOMC participants see an even more gradual path of rate increases than suggested\nby the short-run r* estimates. This lower path may be related to global economic\nweakness and risk-management considerations at the effective lower bound. Of course,\nall of this would have happened in the absence of an SEP or a dot plot. The new\n22 For a discussion of the short-run, time-varying estimates of r* using projections from the SEP, see\nMichelle Bongard and Benjamin K. Johannsen (2016), “The Neutral Rate and the Summary of Economic\nProjections,” FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, November\n28), https://doi.org/10.17016/2380-7172.1890. These authors combine the IS specification used here with\nSEP projections to calculate implied values for r*. See also Thomas Laubach and John C. Williams (2003),\n“Measuring the Natural Rate of Interest,”\nReview of Economics and Statistics, vol. 85 (November), pp. 1063-70.\n23 See Donald Kohn (2016), “How Should Central Bankers Talk about Future Monetary Policy? Lessons\nfrom the Crisis and Beyond” (Washington: Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy, Brookings\nInstitution, November), https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/kohn_central-bankers.pdf.\n\n- 12 -\ncommunications tools have made the process more transparent to the public. In this\nsense, the dot plot is more messenger than message.\nCacophony\nI often hear that there are too many voices offering too much diversity of views\nabout the likely path of policy—the cacophony problem. Reserve Bank Presidents and\nGovernors are expected to publicly discuss their views on the economy and policy.\nIndeed, our policy on the external communications of FOMC participants states that “the\nCommittee’s public accountability is strengthened by open discussion of Committee\nparticipants’ views about the economic outlook as well as their judgments about the\nappropriate course of monetary policy.”24 Central banking often comes across as obscure\nand complicated, and we try to help the public understand what we do. But there is more\nto it than that. Jon Faust’s paper captures well the framers’ vision of an institutionalized\ndiversity of perspectives. In my view, the public expression of our diverse views helps\nsustain public support for the Federal Reserve as a public institution. Those members of\nthe public who disagree with our policy should know that their concerns are given voice\nin our deliberations. But there is a tradeoff here that needs to be managed: On the one\nhand, the effectiveness of policy is thought to depend on the public’s understanding of\nthe Committee’s consensus. On the other hand, the expression of diverse views may\nsometimes make it difficult for the public to see that consensus.\nJon sees this public discussion about policy as mainly a form of negotiation. In\nmy view, motivations are simpler and more obvious. Many of us enjoy getting out of the\n24 The FOMC Policy on External Communications of Committee Participants was adopted in June 2011\nand is available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_ExtCommunicationParticipants.pdf; for the\nquoted text, see p. 1.\n\n- 13 -\noffice to speak to outside groups. We appear to enjoy talking to print journalists, and\nsome of us like going on television. With the proliferation of media of all kinds, there is\na need for content, and we have been willing suppliers. In my view, these public\nappearances are mostly not about gaining leverage in a negotiation. There is a single\nFOMC participant who has most of the leverage in our policy discussions. Observers\nwould be well advised to listen carefully to what she says.\nI strongly agree with Jon that it is wise not to read too much about the path of\npolicy into all of this communication. FOMC participants other than the Chair speak\nonly for themselves and customarily make that clear at the beginning of their remarks.\nTheir commentary is not intended to express the consensus or to predict its evolution.\nAs Jon notes, during the Greenspan era, there was very little discussion of the\nlikely path for the policy rate by FOMC participants, including the Chairman. The\nproliferation of forward policy guidance during the crisis utterly broke that equilibrium.\nMany of us seem to be trained to a new habit, which is to offer one’s views about the\nnear-term path for policy, typically at the end of a speech on the outlook. While such\ncommunication can serve a useful purpose, I have come around to the view that focusing\ntoo much on the precise timing of policy moves may be adding to confusion and\nfrustration about our communications. I am trying to avoid this problem in my own\nremarks.\nUncertainty\nAll economic forecasts are subject to considerable uncertainty. There is always a\nwide range of plausible outcomes for important economic variables, including the federal\nfunds rate. In her remarks at Jackson Hole in August, Chair Yellen showed the median\n\n- 14 -\npath for the federal funds rate from the June SEP surrounded by a 70 percent confidence\ninterval based on the historical accuracy of private and government forecasts.25 I\nreproduce that figure here (figure 10), updated for the September 2016 SEP.26 Note that\nthe tan confidence interval in the figure is much wider than the disparity of views as\nrepresented by the central tendency of the projections (the black dashed lines). This\nuncertainty is a fundamental aspect of our world, and it should probably feature more\nprominently in our communications.\nConclusion\nTo sum up, the FOMC and individual participants communicate a great deal these\ndays--much more than in the past. Some of those communications are designed to\nexpress the consensus, and some are designed to show the diversity of views. In my\nview, communications should do more to emphasize the uncertainty that surrounds all\neconomic forecasts, should downplay short-term tactical questions such as the timing of\nthe next rate increase, and should focus the public’s attention instead on the\nconsiderations that go into making policy across the range of plausible paths for the\neconomy.\n25 The reason for the confidence interval is that the economy is frequently buffeted by shocks and thus\nrarely evolves as predicted. See Janet L. Yellen (2016), “The Federal Reserve’s Monetary Policy Toolkit:\nPast, Present, and Future,” speech delivered at “Designing Resilient Monetary Policy Frameworks for the\nFuture,” a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, held in Jackson Hole, Wyo.,\nAugust 26, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/yellen20160826a.htm.\n26 The confidence interval equals the median SEP path for the federal funds rate plus or minus average root\nmean squared prediction errors of the three-month Treasury bill rate (subject to a lower bound of 12.5 basis\npoints), for horizons from zero to three years ahead, based on forecast errors made over the past 20 years.\nFor general information on the methodology used to construct confidence intervals using historical\nforecasting errors, see David Reifschneider and Peter Tulip (2007), “Gauging the Uncertainty of the\nEconomic Outlook from Historical Forecasting Errors,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2007-60\n(Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, November), available at\nwww.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2007/200760/200760abs.html.\n\nFigure 1.

Powell\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nGender and the Economy Conference, a symposium hosted by\nthe Division of Consumer and Community Affairs\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nWashington, D.C.\n(via webcast)\nNovember 8, 2021\n\nGood morning. I am pleased to welcome everyone to today’s conference on\ngender and the economy. Thank you for being here, for participating, and for lending\nyour expertise on this important topic.\nWe have gathered an impressive lineup of speakers and panelists, who will\naddress a range of timely and important issues.\nTo open the conference, I will give a brief tour of the important research on\ndisplay here, then discuss how the pandemic has affected the economy along gender\nlines.\nResearch\nThe speakers and panelists will be exploring a wide range of topics, from a\nhistorical review of gender issues and the economy to how someone’s education\noptions—and the financing of those choices—affect that person’s early career and\nfinancial stability. Speakers and panelists will also be looking at the influence of family\nand caregiving on career advancement and will discuss timely topics of wealth and\nretirement.\nThe Pandemic and Gender\nThe pandemic widened deep-rooted inequities in our economy. Along racial,\ngender, and socioeconomic lines, those least able to bear it, unfortunately, were those\nwho were most affected. Women make up the majority of frontline workers, who have\nbeen under substantial strain—and subject to personal risks—during the pandemic.\nAdditionally, women took on the majority of caring responsibilities, for older relatives\nand children alike. As schools closed and childcare services shuttered during the worst of\nthe pandemic, that added responsibility and stress made working more difficult for some\n\n- 2 -\nand took many away from their jobs. These burdens are real and have been an additional\nchallenge during an already challenging time.\nIn a reversal of previous recessions, women suffered more from job losses in the\nCOVID-19 recession than men. In April 2020, the unemployment rate for women was\n16.1 percent, compared with 13.6 percent for men. The gap persisted until September of\nthat year, and while it has since reversed, it does not account for the many women who\nleft the workforce entirely.1\nIncreased childcare responsibilities during the pandemic also affected many\nparents’ working lives. Mothers of small children were more likely to exit the labor force\nduring the pandemic compared with previous periods. These increases were larger\namong mothers who earned less before the pandemic.2\nThis issue was widespread and had significant financial consequences on many\nhouseholds. The Federal Reserve’s 2020 Survey of Household Economics and\nDecisionmaking shows that the pandemic disrupted childcare or in-person schooling for\nnearly 70 percent of parents, with 25 percent of mothers reporting they did not work or\nworked less as a result. Many faced substantial financial difficulty. Only 37 percent of\nmothers who reported not working or working less because of childcare or schooling\ndisruptions would cover a $400 expense with cash or its equivalent.\nAs households and the economy continue to recover, the lessons learned during\nthis era will help inform how policymakers and communities work to bridge those gaps.\n1 Statistics come from historical tables A-1 (“Employment Status of the Civilian Population by Sex and\nAge”) of the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Employment Situation report. See Bureau of Labor Statistics\n(2021), “The Employment Situation,” https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsatabs.htm.\n2 See Katherine Lim and Mike Zabek (2021), “Women’s Labor Force Exits during COVID-19:\nDifferences by Motherhood, Race, and Ethnicity,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2021-067\n(Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, October),\nhttps://doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2021.067.\n\n- 3 -\nLong-standing disparities weigh on the productive capacity of our economy, which can\nonly realize its full potential if everyone has a solid chance to contribute to, and to reap\nthe benefits of, broad-reaching prosperity.\nConclusion\nIn closing, I want to thank you all for taking the time to join this discussion.\nThese are vital issues not just to the economy, but to families across the country. There is\nmore to be done, but this conference highlights the number of world-class researchers,\npractitioners, and policymakers who are dedicated to understanding and addressing these\ndeeply entrenched issues.\nAs a group, we have an opportunity to reaffirm the importance of gender parity\nand diversity in our professions, in our research, and in our policymaking. Thank you.",

Powell\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nPeterson Institute for International Economics\nWashington, D.C.\nMay 13, 2020\n\nThe coronavirus has left a devastating human and economic toll in its wake as it\nhas spread around the globe. This is a worldwide public health crisis, and health-care\nworkers have been the first responders, showing courage and determination and earning\nour lasting gratitude. So have the legions of other essential workers who put themselves\nat risk every day on our behalf.\nAs a nation, we have temporarily withdrawn from many kinds of economic and\nsocial activity to help slow the spread of the virus. Some sectors of the economy have\nbeen effectively closed since mid-March. People have put their lives and livelihoods on\nhold, making enormous sacrifices to protect not just their own health and that of their\nloved ones, but also their neighbors and the broader community. While we are all\naffected, the burden has fallen most heavily on those least able to bear it.\nThe scope and speed of this downturn are without modern precedent, significantly\nworse than any recession since World War II. We are seeing a severe decline in\neconomic activity and in employment, and already the job gains of the past decade have\nbeen erased. Since the pandemic arrived in force just two months ago, more than\n20 million people have lost their jobs. A Fed survey being released tomorrow reflects\nfindings similar to many others: Among people who were working in February, almost\n40 percent of those in households making less than $40,000 a year had lost a job in\nMarch.1 This reversal of economic fortune has caused a level of pain that is hard to\ncapture in words, as lives are upended amid great uncertainty about the future.\n1 Board of Governors, 2019. Also see the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Household Economics and\nDecisionmaking (forthcoming) and its Report on the Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households in 2019,\nFeaturing Supplemental Data from April 2020 (forthcoming).\n\n- 2 -\nThis downturn is different from those that came before it. Earlier in the\npost–World War II period, recessions were sometimes linked to a cycle of high inflation\nfollowed by Fed tightening.2 The lower inflation levels of recent decades have brought a\nseries of long expansions, often accompanied by the buildup of imbalances over time—\nasset prices that reached unsupportable levels, for instance, or important sectors of the\neconomy, such as housing, that boomed unsustainably. The current downturn is unique\nin that it is attributable to the virus and the steps taken to limit its fallout. This time, high\ninflation was not a problem. There was no economy-threatening bubble to pop and no\nunsustainable boom to bust. The virus is the cause, not the usual suspects—something\nworth keeping in mind as we respond.\nToday I will briefly discuss the measures taken so far to offset the economic\neffects of the virus, and the path ahead. Governments around the world have responded\nquickly with measures to support workers who have lost income and businesses that have\neither closed or seen a sharp drop in activity. The response here in the United States has\nbeen particularly swift and forceful.\nTo date, Congress has provided roughly $2.9 trillion in fiscal support for\nhouseholds, businesses, health-care providers, and state and local governments—about\n14 percent of gross domestic product. While the coronavirus economic shock appears to\nbe the largest on record, the fiscal response has also been the fastest and largest response\nfor any postwar downturn.\nAt the Fed, we have also acted with unprecedented speed and force. After rapidly\ncutting the federal funds rate to close to zero, we took a wide array of additional\n2 Romer and Romer, 1989.\n\n- 3 -\nmeasures to facilitate the flow of credit in the economy, which can be grouped into four\nareas. First, outright purchases of Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities to\nrestore functionality in these critical markets. Second, liquidity and funding measures,\nincluding discount window measures, expanded swap lines with foreign central banks,\nand several facilities with Treasury backing to support smooth functioning in money\nmarkets. Third, with additional backing from the Treasury, facilities to more directly\nsupport the flow of credit to households, businesses, and state and local governments.\nAnd fourth, temporary regulatory adjustments to encourage and allow banks to expand\ntheir balance sheets to support their household and business customers.\nThe Fed takes actions such as these only in extraordinary circumstances, like\nthose we face today. For example, our authority to extend credit directly to private\nnonfinancial businesses and state and local governments exists only in “unusual and\nexigent circumstances” and with the consent of the Secretary of the Treasury. When this\ncrisis is behind us, we will put these emergency tools away.\nWhile the economic response has been both timely and appropriately large, it may\nnot be the final chapter, given that the path ahead is both highly uncertain and subject to\nsignificant downside risks. Economic forecasts are uncertain in the best of times, and\ntoday the virus raises a new set of questions: How quickly and sustainably will it be\nbrought under control? Can new outbreaks be avoided as social-distancing measures\nlapse? How long will it take for confidence to return and normal spending to resume?\nAnd what will be the scope and timing of new therapies, testing, or a vaccine? The\nanswers to these questions will go a long way toward setting the timing and pace of the\n\n- 4 -\neconomic recovery. Since the answers are currently unknowable, policies will need to be\nready to address a range of possible outcomes.\nThe overall policy response to date has provided a measure of relief and stability,\nand will provide some support to the recovery when it comes. But the coronavirus crisis\nraises longer-term concerns as well. The record shows that deeper and longer recessions\ncan leave behind lasting damage to the productive capacity of the economy.3 Avoidable\nhousehold and business insolvencies can weigh on growth for years to come. Long\nstretches of unemployment can damage or end workers’ careers as their skills lose value\nand professional networks dry up, and leave families in greater debt.4 The loss of\nthousands of small- and medium-sized businesses across the country would destroy the\nlife’s work and family legacy of many business and community leaders and limit the\nstrength of the recovery when it comes. These businesses are a principal source of job\ncreation—something we will sorely need as people seek to return to work. A prolonged\nrecession and weak recovery could also discourage business investment and expansion,\nfurther limiting the resurgence of jobs as well as the growth of capital stock and the pace\nof technological advancement. The result could be an extended period of low\nproductivity growth and stagnant incomes.\nWe ought to do what we can to avoid these outcomes, and that may require\nadditional policy measures. At the Fed, we will continue to use our tools to their fullest\nuntil the crisis has passed and the economic recovery is well under way. Recall that the\nFed has lending powers, not spending powers. A loan from a Fed facility can provide a\n3 For example, see Reifschneider, Wascher, and Wilcox, 2015; Blanchard and Summers, 1987; and Martin,\nMunyan, and Wilson, 2014, 2015.\n4 Davis and Von Wachter, 2011.\n\n- 5 -\nbridge across temporary interruptions to liquidity, and those loans will help many\nborrowers get through the current crisis. But the recovery may take some time to gather\nmomentum, and the passage of time can turn liquidity problems into solvency problems.\nAdditional fiscal support could be costly, but worth it if it helps avoid long-term\neconomic damage and leaves us with a stronger recovery. This tradeoff is one for our\nelected representatives, who wield powers of taxation and spending.\nThank you. I look forward to our discussion.\n\n- 6 -\nReferences\nBlanchard, Olivier J., and Lawrence H.

Powell\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\n10th Annual U.S. Treasury Market Conference\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York\nNew York, New York\nvia prerecorded video\nSeptember 26, 2024\n\nHello, everyone, and welcome to the 10th Annual U.S. Treasury Market\nConference. “Tenth annual” is a phrase that generates a bit of surprise, and much pride.\nIt is surprising because it does not seem like the first of these gatherings, which I was\nhonored to play a role in organizing, was all that long ago. But we can also take pride\nbecause the conference has proven useful and important for a full decade, as I expect it\nwill do for many more years to come.\nMuch has changed in the economy since we first gathered in 2015—but the\nimportance of the U.S. Treasury market has not. As you all know, this market is the\ndeepest and most liquid in the world. In addition to meeting the financing needs of the\nfederal government, it plays a critical role in the implementation of monetary policy. It is\nno exaggeration to say that the Treasury market is part of the bedrock of our economy\nand indeed of the world economy.\nThe October ’14 flash crash and the subsequent publication of the Interagency\nWorking Group report on that event are what brought us together for the first annual\nconference.1 October 2014 was a wakeup call because there had never been such a large\nswing in Treasury prices in such a short period of time. The Interagency Working Group\nreport shed light on how much the structure of the Treasury market had changed and how\nlarge a role high-speed, electronic trading firms were playing in it. It also showed the\nvalue of cooperation and communication between the five agencies in the working group,\nsomething that proved again to be vital during the disruptions caused by the COVID-19\npandemic.\n1 See Interagency Working Group on Treasury Market Surveillance, Joint Staff Report: The U.S. Treasury\nMarket on October 15, 2014 (Washington: Interagency Working Group, July 2015), joint-staff-report-the-\nus-treasury-market-on-10-15-2014.pdf.\n\n- 2 -\nI am pleased to see that all working group members are represented here today.\nYou will be hearing directly from many senior leaders, including your host, President\nWilliams; Vice Chair Barr; and Secretary Yellen, who, of course, was Fed chair at the\ntime of the first conference.\nIt is essential that our Treasury markets are able to efficiently transform Treasury\nsecurities into cash, even at times of elevated stress. As I noted at this event in 2015,\n“these markets need to keep functioning at a high level, and we all have a stake in making\nsure that they do.” I remain wholly dedicated to that goal.2\nI wish you a productive and educational conference. Thank you.\nNote: On September 26, 2024, the text of the speech was updated to reflect the delivered remarks in the\nvideo version of this speech.\n2 See Jerome H.

The documentary\nwill remind us of Marriner’s immense contribution not just to the region, but also to our\nnation during the Great Depression, World War II, and thereafter.\nMany Eccles family members are present here today. I would like to especially\nrecognize Marriner’s grandson, Chip Eccles; Marriner’s nephew, Spencer Eccles; and\nSpencer’s daughter, Hope Eccles. Randy was fortunate to marry Hope, and he has a\nsecond Federal Reserve connection. He is our Vice Chair for Supervision.\nIn a way, I feel that I know Marriner, too. I work in a building named after him. I\nsit in the office where he sat as Chair. And his portrait hangs in a room where I\nfrequently meet with guests, Board colleagues, and staff. When I sit in my usual seat, he\nstands, looking over my left shoulder, an enigmatic expression—neither approving nor\ndisapproving—on his face. Talk about pressure!\nMore seriously, his legacy endures in much more than a name on a building and a\nportrait on a wall. As the Depression deepened, he presciently recognized that the federal\ngovernment should act forcefully to put people back to work and stimulate business. In a\nspeech delivered here in Utah in 1932, Marriner asked what was the purpose of an\neconomic system if not to allow those willing and able to work the opportunity to do so,\nto “guarantee to them sustenance for their families and protection against want and\n\n- 2 -\ndestitution.”1 His ideas helped form the basis of Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal and\nanticipated the not-yet-published tenets of British economist John Maynard Keynes.\nAfter World War II, he recognized, again presciently, that high inflation, not contraction,\nposed the principal threat to the U.S. economy.\nAnd, perhaps most importantly from my perspective as Fed Chair, he is\nresponsible more than any other person for the fact that the United States today has an\nindependent central bank—a central bank able to make decisions in the long-term best\ninterest of the economy, without regard to the political pressures of the moment. During\nhis years on the Fed Board, Marriner played a crucial role in two landmark\naccomplishments that established the modern Federal Reserve—the Banking Act of\n1935, near the start of his tenure at the Fed, and the Federal Reserve-Treasury Accord of\n1951, at the end.\nFDR nominated Marriner to lead the Fed Board in 1934. He accepted on the\ncondition that Roosevelt support a restructuring of the Fed, which had failed to counter\nthe contraction gripping the nation’s economy. The result was the Banking Act of 1935,\nwhich significantly strengthened the structural independence of the Federal Reserve.\nAnd, symbolically important, it authorized the Board to move its meetings from the\nTreasury Department to a new building—the building that now bears Marriner’s name—\non Constitution Avenue, across from the Lincoln Memorial.\nDuring World War II, the Fed effectively ceded control of monetary policy to the\nTreasury Department by agreeing to maintain a low interest rate peg on government\n1 See Marriner S. Eccles (1932), “Depression: Its Causes, Effects and Suggested Remedies,” speech\ndelivered at the Utah State Bankers Convention, June 17, Marriner S. Eccles Papers, FRASER, Federal\nReserve Bank of St. Louis, pp. 6–7, https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/archival/1343/item/463025.\n\n- 3 -\nbonds. The low rates helped the government finance the war, but after the war ended,\ninflation soared. It subsided for a time but, with the Korean War, spiked again. In 1951,\nMarriner led other Board members in precipitating a clean break with the peg\narrangement, laying the foundation for the modern Fed. The Federal Reserve-Treasury\nAccord of that year separated government debt management from monetary policy and\nfreed the Fed to combat high inflation and set short-term interest rates based on what was\nbest for the economy.\nThose are just the highlights of Marriner’s Fed career. You will learn much more\nin the film we are about to see. In closing, I leave you with this statement from Marriner,\ninscribed on a plaque in the Eccles Building: “The management of the central bank must\nbe absolutely free from the dangers of control by politics and by private interests, singly\nor combined.”",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n8:00 a.m. EDT\nApril 8, 2015\nRemarks on Monetary Policy\nRemarks by\nJerome H. Powell\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nC. Peter McColough Series on International Economics\nCouncil on Foreign Relations\nNew York, New York\nApril 8, 2015\n\nThanks for the opportunity to speak to you today. In these brief remarks, I will\ndiscuss the progress of the economy and the path forward for monetary policy.1 The\ncurrent expansion is almost six years old and is now one of the longest since World\nWar II. While the pace of improvement has at times been frustratingly slow, by some\nmeasures the recovery is now well advanced. By other measures, there is still room for\nimprovement. Assessing the scope for further improvement will be important in judging\nthe appropriate path for monetary policy.\nAfter its most recent meeting in March, the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC) modified its forward guidance to say that an increase in the target range for the\nfederal funds rate will be appropriate when the Committee has seen further improvement\nin the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its\n2 percent objective over the medium term. Such an increase could come as soon as the\nJune FOMC meeting. The timing of liftoff and the pace of subsequent rate increases will\ndepend on incoming data and on realized and expected progress toward our\ncongressionally mandated goals of stable prices and maximum employment. Monetary\npolicy works with long and variable lags, so rate increases need to begin well before we\nreach those goals.\nLet us turn to the two main economic conditions for liftoff that the Committee\narticulated. We have already seen a great deal of progress in the labor market, and I\nexpect that progress to continue. Despite slowing in March, job creation has been\nparticularly strong over the past two years. The unemployment rate has declined from\n10 percent in October 2009 to 5.5 percent in March 2015, a level that is not far above\n1 The views I express here today are mine alone and not necessarily those of any other member of the\nFederal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nmany estimates of its natural rate. But the unemployment rate probably understates the\namount of slack still remaining in the labor market. The labor force participation rate\ncontinues to be unusually low, suggesting that potential workers may be waiting on the\nsidelines for further improvements in job opportunities and wages. The number working\npart time who want full-time jobs also remains elevated. The low level of wage increases\nalso suggests additional slack.\nThe Committee said that it will want to be reasonably confident that inflation will\nmove back to 2 percent over the medium term. On a 12-month basis, headline inflation\nin February, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures price index, stood at\n0.3 percent; meanwhile, core inflation, which excludes volatile energy and food\ncomponents, was 1.4 percent. These low current readings are partly a consequence of\ntwo transient shocks--the dramatic decline in oil prices and the effect of the appreciation\nof the dollar on import prices. Before those shocks, both headline inflation and core\ninflation were running at about 1.5 percent. When the effects of these shocks pass, I\nexpect that inflation will return roughly to those earlier levels and then rise gradually to\nour 2 percent objective over the medium term as labor and product markets tighten\nfurther. Despite the current low inflation readings, survey-based measures of inflation\nexpectations in the United States have been stable. However, market-based readings on\ninflation compensation have declined significantly since mid-2014. I view this decline as\nmore likely reflecting movements in risk premiums and other transitory factors, rather\nthan shifts in longer-term inflation expectations. Still, it will be important to keep an eye\non the performance of inflation breakevens.\n\n- 3 -\nI expect that economic conditions will support the first rate increase later this\nyear. I do not expect that such an increase or the associated market reaction will\nmaterially restrain the progress of the economy. From a macroeconomic perspective, the\nprecise timing of liftoff is less important than the path of subsequent additional rate\nincreases. My view is that, if the economy continues on its expected path, it will be\nappropriate for a time to increase rates fairly gradually. Of course, if the economy\nimproves faster or inflation increases more than expected, it will be appropriate to raise\nrates faster. And if economic performance disappoints or inflation remains lower than\nexpected, it will be appropriate to delay liftoff or raise rates more slowly thereafter.\nThere are several reasons why it may be appropriate to raise rates somewhat\ngradually, including the proximity of the zero lower bound for interest rates and\ncontinuing economic headwinds in the wake of the crisis.2 I would like to explore a\nrationale that has received somewhat less attention, which is the unusually high level of\nuncertainty today about capacity measures such as the natural rate of unemployment.3\nUncertainty about the precise level of these indicators becomes more important for policy\nas the expansion continues and the economy approaches its potential, defined as the level\nof output that is consistent with stable prices.\n2 See Janet Yellen (2015), “Normalizing Monetary Policy: Prospects and Perspectives,” speech delivered\nat “The New Normal Monetary Policy,” a research conference sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of\nSan Francisco, San Francisco, March 27,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/yellen20150327a.htm.\n3\nThe natural rate of unemployment can be thought of as the unemployment rate at which the labor market\nis at its long-run equilibrium and inflation is stable. We cannot directly observe the natural rate but must\ninfer it based on the performance of wages, prices, and labor market indicators. Most FOMC participants\nestimate that the longer-run normal rate is currently in the range of 5.0 to 5.2 percent. Confidence intervals\naround statistical estimates of the natural rate are routinely estimated to be quite wide. For example,\nStaiger, Stock, and Watson estimate a 95 percent confidence range around the natural rate to extend nearly\n1½ percentage points on either side of the point estimate. See Douglas Staiger, James H. Stock, and Mark\nW. Watson (1997), “How Precise Are Estimates of the Natural Rate of Unemployment?” in Christina D.\nRomer and David H. Romer, eds., Reducing Inflation: Motivation and Strategy (Chicago: University of\nChicago Press).\n\n- 4 -\nAll else equal, a decision to return interest rates to more-normal levels implies\nthat the economy is nearing its capacity. The financial crisis did significant damage to\nthe productive capacity of our economy, and the damage was of a character, extent, and\nduration that cannot be fully known today. Given this uncertainty, it is even more\ndifficult than usual to assess how much slack remains. It seems plausible that at least part\nof this supply-side damage could be reversed if the economy enjoys a period of sustained\ngrowth.4 To encourage that outcome, as monetary policymakers consider removing\naccommodation, we should look for a little more proof than usual that labor markets are\ntightening or other supply-side constraints are binding. Of course, if the effects of the\ncrisis prove difficult to reverse and, as a result, inflation pressures do emerge, the Federal\nReserve will use its tools to contain them.\nLet us take a brief look at the implications of severe financial crises for economies\ngenerally. Studies document that severe financial crises around the world have typically\nleft behind large and sustained reductions in the level of output.5 The recent crisis is no\nexception, and figure 1 shows such an effect for the U.S., U.K., euro-area and Canadian\n4 See, for example, Laurence M. Ball (2014), “Long-Term Damage from the Great Recession in OECD\nCountries,” NBER Working Paper Series 20185 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic\nResearch, May); and Robert E. Hall (2014), “Quantifying the Lasting Harm to the U.S. Economy from the\nFinancial Crisis,” NBER Working Paper Series 20183 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic\nResearch, May).\n5 See Robert F. Martin, Teyanna Munyan, and Beth Anne Wilson (2014), “Potential Output and\nRecessions: Are We Fooling Ourselves?” IFDP Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System, November 12), www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/notes/ifdp-notes/2014/potential-\noutput-and-recessions-are-we-fooling-ourselves-20141112.html; Carmen M. Reinhart and Kenneth S.\nRogoff (2009), This Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly (Princeton: Princeton\nUniversity Press); Valerie Cerra and Sweta Chaman Saxena (2008), “Growth Dynamics: The Myth of\nEconomic Recovery,” American Economic Review, vol. 98 (March), pp. 439-57; and Davide Furceri and\nAnnabelle Mourougane (2009), “The Effect of Financial Crises on Potential Output: New Empirical\nEvidence from OECD Countries,” OECD Economics Department Working Papers 699 (Paris:\nOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, May), available at\nwww.oecd.org/eco/theeffectoffinancialcrisesonpotentialoutputnewempiricalevidencefromoecdcountries.ht\nm. For a different view, see Christina D. Romer and David H.

The underlying pattern is an interesting one. Economists and\npolicymakers have tended at first to view a decline in output as a cyclical shock to\ndemand and to realize only gradually over time that a crisis has done substantial and\nlasting damage to the productive capacity of the economy.6 As a result, estimates of the\ngap between actual and potential output often narrow over time, partly through higher\nactual output but also through lower estimates of potential. For example, figure 2 shows\nthat the Congressional Budget Office has made a series of downward revisions to its\nestimates of potential output in recent years.7\nThis supply-side damage has typically appeared both in the labor market and in\nthe capital stock.8 Long spells of unemployment cause skills to atrophy and make it more\ndifficult for workers to find new jobs, raising the natural rate of unemployment for those\nwho do remain in the labor force and causing others to throw in the towel and drop out.\nExtended periods of weak demand appear to cause companies to invest less in plant and\ntechnology, which slows the growth of the productivity of the workforce. The number of\nnew business formations declines sharply, perhaps because of reduced credit availability,\nwhich may depress hiring, productivity, business innovation, and hence trend output.9\n6 For example, Martin, Munyan, and Wilson show that estimates of potential output generated by common\nfiltering techniques tend to revise down following recessions as actual output grows slower than its pre-\nrecession trend; see Martin, Munyan, and Wilson, “Potential Output and Recessions,” in note 5. In other\nwords, looking backward with many years of hindsight at the evolution of output following a financial\ncrisis, the negative effect on potential output is clearer than it is when estimating the level of potential\noutput in real time immediately following the crises. As an example of this type of exercise, see Furceri\nand Mourougane, “Effect of Financial Crises on Potential Output,” in note 5.\n7 See Congressional Budget Office (2014), Revisions to CBO’s Projection of Potential Output since 2007\n(Washington: CBO, February), www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/45150-PotentialOutput.pdf.\n8 See Dave Reifschneider, William Wascher, and David Wilcox (2013), “Aggregate Supply in the United\nStates: Recent Developments and Implications for the Conduct of Monetary Policy,” Finance and\nEconomics Discussion Series 2013-77 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,\nNovember), www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2013/201377/201377abs.html; and Hall, “Quantifying the\nLasting Harm to the U.S. Economy,” in note 4.\n9 For evidence regarding the link between fewer start-ups and lower job growth, see Ryan Decker, John\nHaltiwanger, Ron Jarmin, and Javier Miranda (2014), “The Role of Entrepreneurship in U.S. Job Creation\n\n- 6 -\nCorporate spending on research and development has also been strongly procyclical,\nwhich may have similar effects.10\nTurning to the recent U.S. experience, many economists now estimate that\nsubstantially more than half of the shortfall in gross domestic product relative to its pre-\ncrisis trend represents a reduction of potential output and not just a shortfall in demand.11\nU.S. labor force damage likely accounts for some part of the shortfall.12 The greater part\nappears to have resulted from lower trend labor productivity due to reduced capital\ninvestment and “multifactor productivity,” which is often thought of as capturing the\neffects of technological innovation.13 The employment rebound suggests that strong\nmeasures--such as those the Fed took during and after the crisis--can prevent even sharp\njob losses from becoming permanent. But the productivity slowdown suggests that\nmonetary policy cannot, by itself, avert all of the damage.\nand Economic Dynamism,” Journal of Economic Perspectives, vol. 28 (Summer), pp. 3-24. For an\nestimate of how the latest recession affected aggregate trend productivity growth in the United States, see\nReifschneider, Wascher, and Wilcox, “Aggregate Supply in the United States,” in note 8.\n10 See Gadi Barlevy (2005), “Why Don’t Recessions Encourage More R&D Spending?” Chicago Fed\nLetter 220 (Chicago: Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, November),\nwww.chicagofed.org/digital_assets/publications/chicago_fed_letter/2005/cflnovember2005_220.pdf; and\nDiego Comin and Mark Gertler (2006), “Medium-Term Business Cycles,” American Economic Review,\nvol. 93 (June), pp. 523-51.\n11 See Congressional Budget Office, Revisions to CBO’s Projection of Potential Output, in note 7; Hall,\n“Quantifying the Lasting Harm to the U.S. Economy,” in note 4; Ball, “Long-Term Damage from the Great\nRecession,” in note 4; and Reifschneider, Wascher, and Wilcox, “Aggregate Supply in the United States,”\nin note 8.\n12 There is considerable debate about how much of the decline in the employment-to-population ratio and\nlabor force participation has been due to the recession, how much of that decline is reversible, and,\nrelatedly, how much of the decline would have occurred regardless in the absence of a recession. For the\nargument that much of the decrease in labor force participation would likely have occurred even in the\nabsence of the recession, see Stephanie Aaronson, Tomaz Cajner, Bruce Fallick, Felix Galbis-Reig,\nChristopher Smith, and William Wascher (2014), “Labor Force Participation: Recent Developments and\nFuture Prospects,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Fall, pp. 197-275, available at\nwww.brookings.edu/about/projects/bpea/papers/2014/labor-force-participation-recent-developments-and-\nfuture-prospects; for the argument that most of the decline is related to the severity of the recession and is\nlikely reversible, see Christopher J. Erceg and Andrew T. Levin (2013), “Labor Force Participation and\nMonetary Policy in the Wake of the Great Recession,” IMF Working Paper 13/245 (Washington:\nInternational Monetary Fund, July), available at www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.aspx?sk=41133.0.\n13 See Reifschneider, Wascher, and Wilcox (2013), “Aggregate Supply in the United States,” in note 8.\n\n- 7 -\nThis consideration raises the question I mentioned a moment ago. Should we\nthink of this supply-side damage as permanent or temporary? In many previous episodes\naround the world, post-crisis reductions in output have proved permanent. Nonetheless,\nit seems plausible that at least part of the damage can be reversed. As business\nconfidence improves, employers may be more willing to take a chance on someone with\nan extended spell of unemployment. A stronger job market and rising wages may\nencourage more potential workers to join the labor force.14 Over a longer period,\nstronger demand can produce higher capital investment, driving higher productivity. A\nlong expansion could also produce higher productivity as companies strive to get more\nout of every dollar of capital and hour of work and as the strong economy encourages\nentrepreneurship and innovation.\nTo give us the best chance to recover lost ground, we need policies that support\nlabor force participation, business and household confidence, hiring and investment, and\nproductivity growth--policies, I hasten to add, that are, for the most part, outside the remit\nof the Federal Reserve. Monetary policy also has a role to play by continuing to support\nthe expansion as long as inflation expectations remain stable and realized inflation stays\nclose to our 2 percent objective. Indeed, in the current circumstances, accommodative\npolicy may not only help restore some of our economy’s potential, but should also help\nreturn inflation to our 2 percent objective more expeditiously.\nThere is no risk-free path for monetary policy. The biggest risk of tightening too\nearly or too fast is that the economy may weaken more than expected, forcing the central\nbank to reverse course. The record of central banks lifting off from the zero lower bound\n14 In fact, as the recovery has progressed, the labor force participation rate and other broad indicators have\nmoved back toward their longer-run trends.\n\n- 8 -\nsuggests caution in this regard. A second risk is that we could prematurely truncate the\nprocess of healing damage from the crisis, thereby ensuring that the admittedly severe\ncyclical effects become permanent.\nOverly accommodative monetary policy also poses risks. First, the economy\ncould overheat, and rising inflation could require the Committee to raise rates faster,\nwhich--if overdone--could produce a damaging recession. For now, I would be more\nconcerned with a second risk, which is that more-accommodative policy could lead to\nfrothy financial conditions and eventually undermine financial stability. While I do not\nsee a troubling buildup of these risks today, tighter monetary policy might eventually be\nnecessary if such risks do appear.\nConclusion\nTo wrap up, with the support of extraordinary monetary accommodation, our\neconomy has made substantial progress. As the FOMC moves to return monetary policy\nto a more normal footing, it makes sense to me to move fairly gradually as long as the\nincoming data evolve about as expected. Doing so would, among other benefits, give our\neconomy the best chance to make up lost ground.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n4:35 p.m. EDT\nOctober 25, 2023\nIntroductory Remarks\nby\nJerome H. Powell\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\n2023 Daniel Patrick Moynihan Lecture on Social Science and Public Policy, hosted by\nthe American Academy of Political and Social Science\nWashington, D.C.\nOctober 25, 2023\n\nI am delighted and honored to introduce Professor Alan Blinder as this year’s\nwinner of the Daniel Patrick Moynihan Prize.\nThe Moynihan Prize honors those who “champion the use of informed judgment\nto advance the public good.”1 In the field of economics, I can think of no better example\nof such a champion than Alan Blinder. The very heart of his distinguished career has\nbeen advancing the use of informed judgment in economic policymaking.\nAs Alan has observed, in our political economy, there exist two neighboring\ntribes, sharing common interests but separated by cultural and language barriers. On one\nside of the border there is the academy, particularly social scientists, who work to assess\nthe costs and benefits of public policies, actual and possible. On the other side are the\npolicymakers, including elected officials as well as those who work at various\ngovernment agencies. Folks on the academy side generally feel that the policymakers\nwould make better policy if they paid more attention to academic work. Meanwhile,\npolicymakers often look across that divide desiring that academic work pay more\nattention to the practical realities of policymaking.\nLike Moynihan himself, Alan Blinder is that rare person who both transcends this\nbarrier and recognizes its significance. As he made clear to the Senate during his\nconfirmation process to become Vice Chair of the Federal Reserve, “Academic\neconomists are often aloof from practical policy debates; but I have not been.”2 And he\n1 See American Academy of Political and Social Science (2022), “The Moynihan Prize,” webpage,\nparagraph 1, https://www.aapss.org/the-moynihan-prize.\n2 See Alan S. Blinder (1994), “Attachment to Senate Banking Questionnaire,” in Nominations of Alan S.\nBlinder, Steven M.H. Wallman, and Philip N. Diehl, hearing before the Committee on Banking, Housing,\nand Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, May 6, Senate Hearing 103-611, 103 Cong. (Washington: Government\nPrinting Office), p. 54, https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/title/nominations-alan-s-blinder-steven-mh-wallman-\nphilip-n-diehl-6513.\n\n- 2 -\nhas regularly called on his academic colleagues to “train their powerful tools on real-\nworld issues instead of chasing intellectual will-o’-the-wisps.”3\nAlan’s academic work is a testimony to those principles. He has used the\npowerful tools of economics to address the critical policy topics of our time. From his\npathbreaking work on the great stagflation of the 1970s,4 through his analysis of central\nbank structure, independence, and communications,5 to his research on financial crises6\nand his masterful summary of the past 60 years of monetary and fiscal policy,7 Alan’s\nwork is always policy relevant, rigorous, and crystal clear.\nAlan has also been a top monetary policymaker, in addition to advising\nPresidents, Fed Chairs and numerous other officials on both a formal and informal basis.\nBut his work goes beyond his excellence as a member of both the academic and\npolicymaker tribes.\nAlan’s life’s work has featured a continuous effort to foster greater understanding\nand communication across the divide. To illustrate this, I will close with two broad\ncategories of engagement that have been hallmarks of Alan’s career.\nThe first is Alan’s work addressing the academy–policy divide itself. Two of his\nbooks, published 30 years apart, show his career-long focus answering this question:\n3 See Alan S. Blinder (1997), “What Central Bankers Could Learn from Academics—and Vice Versa,”\nJournal of Economic Perspectives, vol. 11 (Spring), p. 17.\n4 See Alan S. Blinder (1979), Economic Policy and the Great Stagflation (New York: Academic Press).\n5 See Alan S. Blinder (1998), Central Banking in Theory and Practice (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press);\nAlan Blinder, Charles Goodhart, Philipp Hildebrand, David Lipton, and Charles Wyplosz (2001), How Do\nCentral Banks Talk? Geneva Reports on the World Economy 3 (Geneva: International Center for\nMonetary and Banking Studies), https://www.cimb.ch/uploads/1/1/5/4/115414161/geneva3.pdf; and\nAlan S. Blinder (2004), The Quiet Revolution: Central Banking Goes Modern (New Haven, Conn.: Yale\nUniversity Press).\n6 See Alan S. Blinder (2013), After the Music Stopped: The Financial Crisis, the Response, and the Work\nAhead (New York: Penguin Press).\n7 See Alan S. Blinder (2022), A Monetary and Fiscal History of the United States, 1961–2021 (Princeton,\nN.J.: Princeton University Press).\n\n- 3 -\nHow can social science, and particularly economics, support good public policies? First\nin Hard Heads, Soft Hearts, he articulates the problems these groups have in\ncommunicating and working with each other. He provides guidance and examples of\nsuccess and failure while advocating an economic philosophy that combines “profound\nrespect for the virtues of free markets with profound concern for those the market leaves\nbehind.”8 He restated that philosophy more recently in Advice and Dissent, in which he\ncatalogs his own experience trying to bridge that gap, outlines what that experience has\ntaught him, and gives additional direction “toward more useful economic advice met by\nless political dissent.”9\nThe second category is Alan’s engagement with the broader American public. He\nis the rare public figure who speaks fluently in both English and “Economics,” and both\naudiences rightly consider him a native speaker. A natural teacher, Alan has\ncommunicated clearly and accessibly over the years with a wide range of audiences,\nbringing to bear facts, insights and lessons from history and policymaking. His countless\nnewspaper columns, broadcast interviews and many books do more than clearly explain\nthe economic issues of the day. Through them, Alan has managed to make economics\nboth fascinating and essential to an extraordinarily wide audience. That is doubtless due\nin part to his habit of serving up the substance with a healthy dose of humor. Whether it\nis an academic article on the economics of brushing teeth,10 a dinner talk outlining\n8 See Alan S. Blinder (1987), Hard Heads, Soft Hearts: Tough-Minded Economics for a Just Society\n(Reading, Mass.: Addison-Wesley Publishing Company), p. 23.\n9 Alan S. Blinder (2018), Advice and Dissent: Why America Suffers When Economics and Politics Collide\n(New York: Basic Books), p. 308.\n10 See Alan S. Blinder (1974), “The Economics of Brushing Teeth,” Journal of Political Economy, vol. 82\n(July–August), pp. 887–91.\n\n- 4 -\ncritical issues for central bankers with the help of Gilbert and Sullivan,11 or the general\nwit on display in any of his regular columns, Alan’s style enlivens even the most\ntechnical and dry topics. Moynihan surely would have approved.\nA personal note. Over the span of four decades, and counting, for many\npolicymakers from different sectors of the political forest, and for me personally, Alan\nBlinder has been a friend, a source of good advice, a supporter, an insightful critic, a role\nmodel, and a wise soul. In short, a mensch. His published writings as an academic\neconomist are essential to our work, and beyond count. The same is true of the\nfriendships he has forged. He embodies so much of what many policymakers aspire to in\nhis commitment to hard-headed analysis, tempered by a soft heart, that supports good\npublic policy that benefits all Americans.\nThank you. I am delighted and honored to introduce Professor Alan Blinder of\nPrinceton University, this year’s winner of the Daniel Patrick Moynihan Prize.\n11 See Alan S.

    "text": "For release on delivery\n9:05 a.m. EDT\nOctober 5, 2017\nTreasury Markets and the TMPG\nRemarks by\nJerome H. Powell\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nTMPG Best Practices @ 10: A Look Back and a Look Ahead\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York\nOctober 5, 2017\n\nI am honored to join you to celebrate the first 10 years of the Treasury Market Practices\nGroup (TMPG). The TMPG has become an essential forum where industry participants gather\nunder the auspices of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to address market practice issues as\nthey arise in the fast evolving markets for Treasury securities. Outside this room, you are\ncompetitors, and that vigorous competition serves your firms, your customers, and ultimately the\nU.S. taxpayer. But when members of the TMPG attend meetings, they bring their long\nexperience and deep expertise to bear to safeguard the functioning and overall health of these\nmarkets. As I have heard a number of people say, TMPG members check their partisan interests\nat the door. The TMPG is the place where market participants recognize and address their\nresponsibilities to each other. I know that they take that responsibility seriously, and I encourage\nall of the market participants here today to take the TMPG’s recommendations just as seriously\nand to adopt them as best practices that will enhance the market’s functioning.\nI first encountered Treasury markets in a serious way 25 years ago, when I served as\nUnder Secretary of the Treasury for Finance under President George H. W. Bush. These markets\nmade national headlines when we learned that a Salomon Brothers’ trader had repeatedly\ncircumvented Treasury auction rules to corner the market for the on-the-run two-year Treasury.\nAs it became clear that Salomon’s senior management had known about the issue for several\nmonths without alerting regulators, the scandal threatened to bring down one of the largest\nfinancial firms of that time. Over one memorable August weekend, we first prohibited the firm\nfrom dealing in government securities on behalf of customers, and then reduced that sanction as\ntop Salomon management left the firm and Warren Buffett, then a large Salomon shareholder,\nagreed to assume the chairmanship of the board of directors. This event takes up a chapter in\n\n- 2 -\nBuffett’s biography, The Snowball, and it is a good illustration of why we need the TMPG. I\nreread that chapter every couple of years, and it still gives me nightmares.1\nAfter the dust settled, we had to grapple with the wider implications of the scandal for the\nmarket itself and particularly the role of regulatory oversight. We certainly could have used a\nTMPG to help us with this work, but none existed at that time. Our recommendations were\nsummarized in a joint report to the Congress issued by the Treasury Department, the Securities\nand Exchange Commission (SEC), and the Federal Reserve Board. Among the issues we\nconsidered were how to encourage a level playing field for all market participants, and when and\nwhere regulators should respond to the periodic technical difficulties the market sometimes\nexperienced.\nAs we drew up the report, we were deeply aware of the importance that Treasury markets\nheld for the American economy. The sale of Treasury bonds, notes, and bills finances the U.S.\ngovernment, and those securities are in turn a primary vehicle for savings for a wide range of\nU.S. households. Treasury securities are also an important source of collateral within the\nfinancial system. This last role has become all the more critical in recent years as regulations\nhave required banks to hold larger amounts of high-quality liquid assets so that they can safely\nmeet their potential liquidity needs.\nWe also knew that, despite the misconduct by Salomon Brothers, Treasury markets\ngenerally worked quite well. These markets are and have long been among the deepest and most\nliquid markets in the world. It was important to make the auction system more robust to\npotential manipulation, and we made several recommendations to do so and to open up the\n1 Alice Schroeder, The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life (New York: Bantam, 2009).\n\n- 3 -\nprocess to greater competition. However, in other areas that already worked well, we chose, for\nexample, to open up issuance of securities that were in short supply (or “squeezed”) when\nneeded rather than to risk negatively affecting the functioning of Treasury markets by instituting\nmore invasive regulation.\nThere is certainly a role for regulation, but regulation should always take into account the\nimpact that it has on markets--a balance that must be constantly weighed. More regulation is not\nthe best answer to every problem. There is also a role for a body such as the TMPG to address\nmarket problems.\nThe TMPG’s approach to “fails” in the Treasury and mortgage-backed securities markets\nprovides a good example. Fails--that is, the failure to deliver collateral in either a cash or\nrepurchase agreement transaction--impose a cost on the party expecting delivery. If the practice\nwere to become too frequent, then it could seriously impair market functioning. But at the same\ntime, it doesn’t make sense to simply outlaw the practice, since that limits flexibility in a way\nthat may not always be called for and would likely reduce market liquidity. The TMPG’s\nrecommendations were carefully calibrated to set financial incentives that would minimize fails\nand have been a marked success.\nThe TMPG also plays an important role in helping to “fill in the cracks” between the\ncompeting regulations that various Treasury market participants face. Many different institutions\nand individuals depend on these markets, and the regulatory system reflects that. The\nGovernment Securities Act gave the Treasury Department some rulemaking authority over all\ngovernment securities brokers and dealers. But the act also required these firms to register with\nthe SEC. At the same time, the Federal Reserve regulates many of the banks that are active in\nthese markets, and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York also plays an essential role, both as\n\n- 4 -\nfiscal agent for the U.S. government and, by nature of its frequent activity in these markets, in\nconducting monetary policy operations. And of course, the Commodity Futures Trading\nCommission regulates Treasury futures markets. The agencies work well together, but there is\nreal value in having an industry group help to identify issues that cross regulatory boundaries.\nI’ll give two examples. First, in 2016, the TMPG conducted a study of financial\nbenchmarks and uncovered uses of ICAP’s federal funds open rate that had not previously been\nwell understood.2 As ICAP decided to stop publishing the rate, the TMPG also helped to guide\nmarket participants to an alternative that is aligned with the International Organizations of\nSecurities Commissions Principles for Financial Benchmarks while steering the market away\nfrom the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) as a potential alternative--a move that now\nseems prescient given the subsequent news around the long-run risks to LIBOR. More recently,\nthe TMPG has been busy creating a map of clearing and settlement in Treasury markets, work\nthat I am sure all of the regulatory agencies will find to be of great interest.\nAll of this is incredibly valuable. In fact, my only regret about the TMPG is that we\ndidn’t think of creating something like it earlier. As regulators, we fully support your work, and\nwill continue to make sure that our own rules support these markets. The Financial Industry\nRegulatory Authority’s (FINRA’s) new collection of the Treasury transactions of its members\nthrough its Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine, or TRACE system, will do much to\nimprove the regulatory agencies’ understanding of the dynamics of this market. But as in the\npast, we should also be concerned about creating a level playing field. For that reason, the Board\n2 The ICAP Fed Funds Open rate was a daily indicator published by ICAP, a broker in the federal funds market, as\nto where a representative federal fund transaction would be priced at the start of the U.S. trading day. ICAP did not\nconsider the rate to be International Organizations of Securities Commissions compliant, although it was nonetheless\nused as a financial benchmark by some market participants. ICAP ceased publication of the index in September\n2016.\n\n- 5 -\nof Governors is continuing to negotiate with FINRA for it to act as our agent in collecting similar\ndata from banks. We do not want to create a regulatory arbitrage where the same activity done\nwithin a broker–dealer is treated differently than when it is done within a bank.\nThe TMPG and similar groups around the world play an important role by helping both\nregulators and industry leaders address market concerns before they threaten market function. I\nthank the members for their service and look forward to today’s discussions.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n1:30 p.m. EDT (12:30 p.m. CDT)\nApril 16, 2025\nEconomic Outlook\nRemarks by\nJerome H. Powell\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nEconomic Club of Chicago\nChicago, Illinois\nApril 16, 2025\n\nThank you for the introduction. I am looking forward to our conversation,\nProfessor Rajan. First, I will briefly discuss the outlook for the economy and monetary\npolicy.\nAt the Fed, we are always focused on the dual-mandate goals given to us by\nCongress: maximum employment and stable prices. Despite heightened uncertainty and\ndownside risks, the U.S. economy is still in a solid position. The labor market is at or\nnear maximum employment. Inflation has come down a great deal but is running a bit\nabove our 2 percent objective.\nRecent Economic Data\nTurning to the incoming data, we will get the initial reading on first-quarter GDP\nin a couple of weeks. The data in hand so far suggest that growth has slowed in the first\nquarter from last year’s solid pace. Despite strong motor vehicle sales, overall consumer\nspending appears to have grown modestly. In addition, strong imports during the first\nquarter, reflecting attempts by businesses to get ahead of potential tariffs, are expected to\nweigh on GDP growth.\nSurveys of households and businesses report a sharp decline in sentiment and\nelevated uncertainty about the outlook, largely reflecting trade policy concerns. Outside\nforecasts for the full year are coming down and, for the most part, point to continued\nslowing but still positive growth. We are closely tracking incoming data as households\nand businesses continue to digest these developments.\nIn the labor market, during the first three months of the year, nonfarm payrolls\ngrew by an average of 150,000 jobs a month. While job growth has slowed relative to\nlast year, the combination of low layoffs and lower labor force growth has kept the\n\n- 2 -\nunemployment rate in a low and stable range. Meanwhile, the ratio of job openings to\nunemployed job seekers has remained just above 1, near its pre-pandemic level. Wage\ngrowth has continued to moderate while still outpacing inflation. Overall, the labor\nmarket appears to be in solid condition and broadly in balance and is not a significant\nsource of inflationary pressure.\nAs for our price-stability mandate, inflation has significantly eased from its\npandemic highs of mid-2022 without the kind of painful rise in unemployment that has\nfrequently accompanied efforts to bring down high inflation. Progress on inflation\ncontinues at a gradual pace, and recent readings remain above our 2 percent objective.\nEstimates based on data released last week show that total PCE prices rose 2.3 percent\nover the 12 months ending in March and that, excluding the volatile food and energy\ncategories, core PCE prices rose 2.6 percent.\nLooking forward, the new Administration is in the process of implementing\nsubstantial policy changes in four distinct areas: trade, immigration, fiscal policy, and\nregulation. Those policies are still evolving, and their effects on the economy remain\nhighly uncertain. As we learn more, we will continue to update our assessment. The\nlevel of the tariff increases announced so far is significantly larger than anticipated. The\nsame is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and\nslower growth. Both survey- and market-based measures of near-term inflation\nexpectations have moved up significantly, with survey participants pointing to tariffs.\nSurvey measures of longer-term inflation expectations, for the most part, appear to\nremain well anchored; market-based breakevens continue to run close to 2 percent.\n\n-3 -\nMonetary Policy\nAs we gain a better understanding of the policy changes, we will have a better\nsense of the implications for the economy, and hence for monetary policy. Tariffs are\nhighly likely to generate at least a temporary rise in inflation. The inflationary effects\ncould also be more persistent. Avoiding that outcome will depend on the size of the\neffects, on how long it takes for them to pass through fully to prices, and, ultimately, on\nkeeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.\nOur obligation is to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored and to\nmake certain that a one-time increase in the price level does not become an ongoing\ninflation problem. As we act to meet that obligation, we will balance our\nmaximum employment and price-stability mandates, keeping in mind that, without price\nstability, we cannot achieve the long periods of strong labor market conditions that\nbenefit all Americans. We may find ourselves in the challenging scenario in which our\ndual-mandate goals are in tension. If that were to occur, we would consider how far the\neconomy is from each goal, and the potentially different time horizons over which those\nrespective gaps would be anticipated to close.\nConclusion\nAs that great Chicagoan Ferris Bueller once noted, “Life moves pretty fast.” For\nthe time being, we are well positioned to wait for greater clarity before considering any\nadjustments to our policy stance. We continue to analyze the incoming data, the evolving\noutlook, and the balance of risks. We understand that elevated levels of unemployment\nor inflation can be damaging and painful for communities, families, and businesses. We\n\n- 4 -\nwill continue to do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-\nstability goals.\nThank you. I look forward to your questions.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n10:00 a.m. EDT (8:00 a.m. MDT)\nAugust 23, 2024\nReview and Outlook\nRemarks by\nJerome H. Powell\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Reassessing the Effectiveness and Transmission of Monetary Policy,”\nan economic symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\nJackson Hole, Wyoming\nAugust 23, 2024\n\nFour and a half years after COVID-19’s arrival, the worst of the pandemic-related\neconomic distortions are fading. Inflation has declined significantly. The labor market is\nno longer overheated, and conditions are now less tight than those that prevailed before\nthe pandemic. Supply constraints have normalized. And the balance of the risks to our\ntwo mandates has changed. Our objective has been to restore price stability while\nmaintaining a strong labor market, avoiding the sharp increases in unemployment that\ncharacterized earlier disinflationary episodes when inflation expectations were less well\nanchored. While the task is not complete, we have made a good deal of progress toward\nthat outcome.\nToday, I will begin by addressing the current economic situation and the path\nahead for monetary policy. I will then turn to a discussion of economic events since the\npandemic arrived, exploring why inflation rose to levels not seen in a generation, and\nwhy it has fallen so much while unemployment has remained low.\nNear-Term Outlook for Policy\nLet’s begin with the current situation and the near-term outlook for policy.\nFor much of the past three years, inflation ran well above our 2 percent goal, and\nlabor market conditions were extremely tight. The Federal Open Market Committee’s\n(FOMC) primary focus has been on bringing down inflation, and appropriately so. Prior\nto this episode, most Americans alive today had not experienced the pain of high inflation\nfor a sustained period. Inflation brought substantial hardship, especially for those least\n\n- 2 -\nable to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. High\ninflation triggered stress and a sense of unfairness that linger today.1\nOur restrictive monetary policy helped restore balance between aggregate supply\nand demand, easing inflationary pressures and ensuring that inflation expectations\nremained well anchored. Inflation is now much closer to our objective, with prices\nhaving risen 2.5 percent over the past 12 months (figure 1).2 After a pause earlier this\nyear, progress toward our 2 percent objective has resumed. My confidence has grown\nthat inflation is on a sustainable path back to 2 percent.\nTurning to employment, in the years just prior to the pandemic, we saw the\nsignificant benefits to society that can come from a long period of strong labor market\nconditions: low unemployment, high participation, historically low racial employment\ngaps, and, with inflation low and stable, healthy real wage gains that were increasingly\nconcentrated among those with lower incomes.3\nToday, the labor market has cooled considerably from its formerly overheated\nstate. The unemployment rate began to rise over a year ago and is now at 4.3 percent—\nstill low by historical standards, but almost a full percentage point above its level in early\n2023 (figure 2). Most of that increase has come over the past six months. So far, rising\n1 Shiller (1997) and Stantcheva (2024) study why people dislike inflation. Pfafjar and Winkler (2024)\nstudy households’ attitudes toward inflation and unemployment. Binetti, Nuzzi, and Stantcheva (2024)\ninvestigate households’ attitudes toward, and understanding of, inflation. Kaplan and Schulhofer-Wohl\n(2017) and Jaravel (2021) document heterogeneity in the inflation rate experienced by households across\nthe income distribution.\n2 The data for the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index is available for June 2024. Over\nthe 12 months to June 2024, the PCE price index increased 2.5 percent. Data for the consumer price index\nand producer price index are available through July 2024 and can be used to estimate the level of the PCE\nprice index through July. While such an estimate is subject to uncertainty, it suggests that inflation\nremained near 2.5 percent through July.\n3 Research documenting such benefits include Aaronson and others (2019), who discuss the experience in\nthe 2010s and review related historical evidence.\n\n- 3 -\nunemployment has not been the result of elevated layoffs, as is typically the case in an\neconomic downturn. Rather, the increase mainly reflects a substantial increase in the\nsupply of workers and a slowdown from the previously frantic pace of hiring. Even so,\nthe cooling in labor market conditions is unmistakable. Job gains remain solid but have\nslowed this year.4 Job vacancies have fallen, and the ratio of vacancies to unemployment\nhas returned to its pre-pandemic range. The hiring and quits rates are now below the\nlevels that prevailed in 2018 and 2019. Nominal wage gains have moderated. All told,\nlabor market conditions are now less tight than just before the pandemic in 2019—a year\nwhen inflation ran below 2 percent. It seems unlikely that the labor market will be a\nsource of elevated inflationary pressures anytime soon. We do not seek or welcome\nfurther cooling in labor market conditions.\nOverall, the economy continues to grow at a solid pace. But the inflation and\nlabor market data show an evolving situation. The upside risks to inflation have\ndiminished. And the downside risks to employment have increased. As we highlighted\nin our last FOMC statement, we are attentive to the risks to both sides of our dual\nmandate.\nThe time has come for policy to adjust. The direction of travel is clear, and the\ntiming and pace of rate cuts will depend on incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the\nbalance of risks.\n4 Payroll employment grew by an average of 170,000 per month over the three months ending in July. On\nAugust 21, the Bureau of Labor Statistics released the preliminary estimate of the upcoming annual\nbenchmark revision to the establishment survey data, which will be issued in February 2025. The\npreliminary estimate indicates a downward adjustment to March 2024 total nonfarm employment of\n818,000.\n\n- 4 -\nWe will do everything we can to support a strong labor market as we make further\nprogress toward price stability. With an appropriate dialing back of policy restraint, there\nis good reason to think that the economy will get back to 2 percent inflation while\nmaintaining a strong labor market. The current level of our policy rate gives us ample\nroom to respond to any risks we may face, including the risk of unwelcome further\nweakening in labor market conditions.\nThe Rise and Fall of Inflation\nLet’s now turn to the questions of why inflation rose, and why it has fallen so\nsignificantly even as unemployment has remained low. There is a growing body of\nresearch on these questions, and this is a good time for this discussion.5 It is, of course,\ntoo soon to make definitive assessments. This period will be analyzed and debated long\nafter we are gone.\nThe arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic led quickly to shutdowns in economies\naround the world. It was a time of radical uncertainty and severe downside risks. As so\noften happens in times of crisis, Americans adapted and innovated. Governments\nresponded with extraordinary force, especially in the U.S. Congress unanimously passed\nthe CARES Act. At the Fed, we used our powers to an unprecedented extent to stabilize\nthe financial system and help stave off an economic depression.\nAfter a historically deep but brief recession, in mid-2020 the economy began to\ngrow again. As the risks of a severe, extended downturn receded, and as the economy\n5 Early examples include Ball, Leigh, and Mishra (2022) and di Giovanni and others (2022). More recent\nwork includes Benigno and Eggertsson (2023, 2024), Blanchard and Bernanke (2023, 2024), Crump and\nothers (2024), Bai and others (2024), and Dao and others (forthcoming).\n\n- 5 -\nreopened, we faced the risk of replaying the painfully slow recovery that followed the\nGlobal Financial Crisis.\nCongress delivered substantial additional fiscal support in late 2020 and again in\nearly 2021. Spending recovered strongly in the first half of 2021. The ongoing pandemic\nshaped the pattern of the recovery. Lingering concerns over COVID weighed on\nspending on in-person services. But pent-up demand, stimulative policies, pandemic\nchanges in work and leisure practices, and the additional savings associated with\nconstrained services spending all contributed to a historic surge in consumer spending on\ngoods.\nThe pandemic also wreaked havoc on supply conditions. Eight million people left\nthe workforce at its onset, and the size of the labor force was still 4 million below its pre-\npandemic level in early 2021. The labor force would not return to its pre-pandemic trend\nuntil mid-2023 (figure 3).6 Supply chains were snarled by a combination of lost workers,\ndisrupted international trade linkages, and tectonic shifts in the composition and level of\ndemand (figure 4). Clearly, this was nothing like the slow recovery after the Global\nFinancial Crisis.\nEnter inflation. After running below target through 2020, inflation spiked in\nMarch and April 2021. The initial burst of inflation was concentrated rather than broad\nbased, with extremely large price increases for goods in short supply, such as motor\n6 The Federal Reserve Board staff’s estimate of the labor force makes two adjustments to the Bureau of\nLabor Statistics’ published estimates: (i) reweighing Current Population Survey respondents such that the\nlabor force estimates in all years reflect the Census Bureau’s latest vintage of population estimates; and (ii)\naccounting for net immigration that is likely not fully reflected in the Census Bureau’s latest population\nestimates, as detailed in the CBO’s 2024 Demographic Outlook (see\nhttps://www.cbo.gov/publication/59899). The pre-pandemic trend described here is calculated by\nappending the CBO’s January 2020 projected labor force growth from the start of the pandemic through\n2024:Q2 onto the level of the labor force just before the start of the pandemic. (See Congressional Budget\nOffice (2020), The Budget and Economic Outlook: 2020 to 2030; https://www.cbo.gov/publication/56073.)\n\n- 6 -\nvehicles. My colleagues and I judged at the outset that these pandemic-related factors\nwould not be persistent and, thus, that the sudden rise in inflation was likely to pass\nthrough fairly quickly without the need for a monetary policy response—in short, that the\ninflation would be transitory. Standard thinking has long been that, as long as inflation\nexpectations remain well anchored, it can be appropriate for central banks to look through\na temporary rise in inflation.7\nThe good ship Transitory was a crowded one, with most mainstream analysts and\nadvanced-economy central bankers on board.8 The common expectation was that supply\nconditions would improve reasonably quickly, that the rapid recovery in demand would\nrun its course, and that demand would rotate back from goods to services, bringing\ninflation down.\nFor a time, the data were consistent with the transitory hypothesis. Monthly\nreadings for core inflation declined every month from April to September 2021, although\nprogress came slower than expected (figure 5). The case began to weaken around\nmidyear, as was reflected in our communications. Beginning in October, the data turned\nhard against the transitory hypothesis.9 Inflation rose and broadened out from goods into\n7 For example, former Chair Ben Bernanke and Olivier Blanchard summarize the standard approach in their\nwork on inflation the following way: “Standard central banking doctrine holds that, so long as inflation\nexpectations are reasonably well anchored, there is a case for ‘looking through’ temporary supply shocks\nrather than responding to the short-run increase in inflation” (Blanchard and Bernanke, 2024, p. 2). Clarida\n(forthcoming) notes how central banks around the world faced a sharp rise in the relative price of goods\nand chose, at least initially, to accommodate the price pressures with an expected transitory increase in\ninflation.\n8 In the September 2021 Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), the median projection for headline\ninflation in 2022 was 2.2 percent. In the August 2021 Survey of Professional Forecasters (the closest\nsurvey to the September SEP), the median projection for headline inflation in 2022 was also 2.2 percent.\nProjections from the Blue Chip survey were similar around this time.\n9 Beginning with the data for October, readings for monthly core PCE jumped to 0.4 percent or higher and\ninflationary pressures broadened out across goods and services categories. And monthly job gains, already\nstrong, were consistently revised higher over the second half of 2021. Measures of wage inflation also\naccelerated.\n\n- 7 -\nservices. It became clear that the high inflation was not transitory, and that it would\nrequire a strong policy response if inflation expectations were to remain well anchored.\nWe recognized that and pivoted beginning in November. Financial conditions began to\ntighten. After phasing out our asset purchases, we lifted off in March 2022.\nBy early 2022, headline inflation exceeded 6 percent, with core inflation above\n5 percent. New supply shocks appeared. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine led to a sharp\nincrease in energy and commodity prices. The improvements in supply conditions and\nrotation in demand from goods to services were taking much longer than expected, in part\ndue to further COVID waves in the U.S.10 And COVID continued to disrupt production\nglobally, including through new and extended lockdowns in China.11\nHigh rates of inflation were a global phenomenon, reflecting common\nexperiences: rapid increases in the demand for goods, strained supply chains, tight labor\nmarkets, and sharp hikes in commodity prices.12 The global nature of inflation was\nunlike any period since the 1970s. Back then, high inflation became entrenched—an\noutcome we were utterly committed to avoiding.\nBy mid-2022, the labor market was extremely tight, with employment increasing\nby over 6½ million from the middle of 2021. This increase in labor demand was met, in\npart, by workers rejoining the labor force as health concerns began to fade. But labor\nsupply remained constrained, and, in the summer of 2022, labor force participation\n10 For example, labor supply continued to be materially affected by COVID even after vaccines became\nbroadly available in the U.S. By late 2021, anticipated increases in labor force participation had not yet\nmaterialized, likely owing, in part, to the rise of the Delta and Omicron COVID variants.\n11 For example, in March 2022, lockdowns were imposed in the Jilin province, the largest center for auto\nproduction. Authorities also ramped up or extended restrictions in manufacturing hubs in the southeast and\nin Shanghai, where lockdowns had initially been scheduled to end in April 2022.\n12 The global nature of this inflationary episode is emphasized in Cascaldi-Garcia and others (2024) and\nClarida (forthcoming), among others.\n\n- 8 -\nremained well below pre-pandemic levels. There were nearly twice as many job\nopenings as unemployed persons from March 2022 through the end of the year, signaling\na severe labor shortage (figure 6).13 Inflation peaked at 7.1 percent in June 2022.\nAt this podium two years ago, I discussed the possibility that addressing inflation\ncould bring some pain in the form of higher unemployment and slower growth. Some\nargued that getting inflation under control would require a recession and a lengthy period\nof high unemployment.14 I expressed our unconditional commitment to fully restoring\nprice stability and to keeping at it until the job is done.\nThe FOMC did not flinch from carrying out our responsibilities, and our actions\nforcefully demonstrated our commitment to restoring price stability. We raised our\npolicy rate by 425 basis points in 2022 and another 100 basis points in 2023. We have\nheld our policy rate at its current restrictive level since July 2023 (figure 7).\nThe summer of 2022 proved to be the peak of inflation. The 4-1/2 percentage\npoint decline in inflation from its peak two years ago has occurred in a context of low\nunemployment—a welcome and historically unusual result.\nHow did inflation fall without a sharp rise in unemployment above its estimated\nnatural rate?\nPandemic-related distortions to supply and demand, as well as severe shocks to\nenergy and commodity markets, were important drivers of high inflation, and their\n13 It has been argued that the natural rate of unemployment had risen, and that the unemployment rate was\nless informative about tightness in labor market than other measures such as those involving vacancies. For\nexample, see Crump and others (2024). More generally, research has emphasized that the unemployment\nrate and the ratio of vacancies to unemployment often provide similar signals, but the signals differed in the\npandemic period, and the ratio of vacancies to unemployment is a better overall indicator. For example,\nsee Ball, Leigh, and Mishra (2022) and Benigno and Eggertsson (2023, 2024).\n14 For example, Ball, Leigh, and Mishra (2022) and Cecchetti and others (2023) present analyses\nemphasizing that disinflation would require economic slack.\n\n- 9 -\nreversal has been a key part of the story of its decline. The unwinding of these factors\ntook much longer than expected but ultimately played a large role in the subsequent\ndisinflation. Our restrictive monetary policy contributed to a moderation in aggregate\ndemand, which combined with improvements in aggregate supply to reduce inflationary\npressures while allowing growth to continue at a healthy pace. As labor demand also\nmoderated, the historically high level of vacancies relative to unemployment has\nnormalized primarily through a decline in vacancies, without sizable and disruptive\nlayoffs, bringing the labor market to a state where it is no longer a source of inflationary\npressures.\nA word on the critical importance of inflation expectations. Standard economic\nmodels have long reflected the view that inflation will return to its objective when\nproduct and labor markets are balanced—without the need for economic slack—so long\nas inflation expectations are anchored at our objective. That’s what the models said, but\nthe stability of longer-run inflation expectations since the 2000s had not been tested by a\npersistent burst of high inflation. It was far from assured that the inflation anchor would\nhold. Concerns over de-anchoring contributed to the view that disinflation would require\nslack in the economy and specifically in the labor market. An important takeaway from\nrecent experience is that anchored inflation expectations, reinforced by vigorous central\nbank actions, can facilitate disinflation without the need for slack.\nThis narrative attributes much of the increase in inflation to an extraordinary\ncollision between overheated and temporarily distorted demand and constrained supply.\nWhile researchers differ in their approaches and, to some extent, in their conclusions, a\nconsensus seems to be emerging, which I see as attributing most of the rise in inflation to\n\n- 10 -\nthis collision.15 All told, the healing from pandemic distortions, our efforts to moderate\naggregate demand, and the anchoring of expectations have worked together to put\ninflation on what increasingly appears to be a sustainable path to our 2 percent objective.\nDisinflation while preserving labor market strength is only possible with anchored\ninflation expectations, which reflect the public’s confidence that the central bank will\nbring about 2 percent inflation over time. That confidence has been built over decades\nand reinforced by our actions.\nThat is my assessment of events. Your mileage may vary.\nConclusion\nLet me wrap up by emphasizing that the pandemic economy has proved to be\nunlike any other, and that there remains much to be learned from this extraordinary\nperiod. Our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy emphasizes\nour commitment to reviewing our principles and making appropriate adjustments through\na thorough public review every five years. As we begin this process later this year, we\nwill be open to criticism and new ideas, while preserving the strengths of our framework.\nThe limits of our knowledge—so clearly evident during the pandemic—demand humility\nand a questioning spirit focused on learning lessons from the past and applying them\nflexibly to our current challenges.\n15 Blanchard and Bernanke (2023) use a traditional (flexible) Phillips curve approach to reach this\nconclusion for the U.S. Blanchard and Bernanke (2024) and Dao and others (forthcoming) examine a\nbroader set of countries using similar approaches. Di Giovanni and others (2022) and Bai and others\n(2024) use different techniques and emphasize supply constraints and shocks in the increase in inflation\nover 2021 and 2022.\n\n- 11 -\nReferences\nAaronson, Stephanie R., Mary C.

Powell\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nAt the\nRoundtable of the Alternative Reference Rates Committee\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York\nNew York, New York\nNovember 2, 2017\n\nGood morning. I am sorry that I am not able to be with you today at the FRBNY for this\nimportant meeting. I thought that I would begin by discussing the LIBOR related events that\nhave brought us here, and then talk about the way forward.\nLIBOR gained negative public attention when reports began to surface during the\nfinancial crisis that employees at some banks had attempted to manipulate the rate by altering the\nquotes they submitted for use in the calculation of LIBOR. A number of agencies, including the\nCommodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the Department of Justice, and the U.K.\nFinancial Conduct Authority (FCA), took the lead in investigating and prosecuting the cases of\nLIBOR manipulation that were uncovered. The Federal Reserve also joined in international\nefforts to strengthen LIBOR. Among other things, we joined the ICE Benchmark\nAdministration’s (IBA’s) LIBOR Oversight Committee as an observer, and we also worked\nintensively with international authorities and IBA in developing and encouraging the reforms set\nout in IBA’s Roadmap for LIBOR.\nBut at the same time, as we and other authorities collected data on the transactions\nunderlying banks’ submissions to LIBOR, we began to see that those transactions were relatively\nfew and far between. As a result, many began to question whether LIBOR could be truly and\npermanently fixed. To be sure, much has been done to address the cases of attempted\nmanipulation, and LIBOR has much stronger governance in place than it did before the crisis.\nThe question instead was whether there were enough actual LIBOR transactions to form a stable\nbasis for this critical rate.\nSince many of the pressures around LIBOR stem from the low level of underlying\ntransactions, let me share some data regarding activity in U.S. dollar wholesale funding markets.\nToday, there are 17 banks that submit quotes in support of dollar LIBOR. Some have suggested\n\n- 2 -\nrequiring more banks to submit LIBOR data, but doing so would not materially improve the\nsituation. The panels in Figure 1 show the distribution of daily aggregate wholesale dollar\nfunding volumes for the 30 global systemically important banks (or GSIBs). The data here\ninclude all of the Eurodollar, federal funds, CD, and commercial paper transactions that the\nFederal Reserve has access to--the most complete picture of U.S. dollar unsecured funding that I\nam aware of. For one-month funding, shown in the top panel, the median daily volume of\ntransactions by these banks since money-market reforms took effect last year was just over $1\nbillion. For three-month funding (the middle panel), the most heavily referenced LIBOR tenor,\nthe median is less than $1 billion per day. On some days we see less than $100 million. If we\ncompare this to the more than $100 trillion in outstanding volumes of U.S. dollar LIBOR\ncontracts, it should be clear that the activity in this market is miniscule compared to the size of\nthe contracts written on it.\nIn our view, it would not be feasible to produce a robust, transaction-based rate\nconstructed from the activity in wholesale unsecured funding markets. A transactions-based rate\nfrom this market would be fairly easy to manipulate given such a thin level of activity, and the\nrate itself would likely be quite volatile. Thus, LIBOR seems consigned to rely primarily on\nsome form of expert judgment rather than direct transactions.\nAs we discussed these issues with the officials in the United Kingdom who oversee and\nregulate LIBOR, we also became aware that they were receiving a steady stream of requests, and\nsometimes demands, from banks seeking to leave the LIBOR panels. The use of expert\njudgment in submissions allows LIBOR to be published every day, but many banks are now\nunderstandably uncomfortable with being asked to provide judgment about something that they\ndo very little of. In his July speech, Andrew Bailey discussed the efforts of the FCA to keep\n\n- 3 -\nthese banks on the panels. Market participants should understand that the official sector has\ndone everything it can to stabilize and strengthen LIBOR. Without the intervention of U.K.\nauthorities, LIBOR would be in a weaker state today.\nBut that balancing act has grown increasingly difficult. As time has passed, some banks\nhave grown more resistant to public-sector entreaties to remain on the panels. As you know, one\nbank left the U.S. dollar panel last year. At the same time, we have had to confront the fact that,\nif banks could not be persuaded to voluntarily remain on panels, then the legal powers to compel\nthem to do so were limited. Under European Union benchmark regulations, which LIBOR will\nsoon be subject to, authorities can only compel submissions to a critical benchmark for a period\nof two years. Given this time limit, brokering a voluntary agreement with the submitting banks\nto stay on for a longer period was the last, best choice that authorities had available to guarantee\nsome further period of stability for LIBOR. CFTC Chairman Chris Giancarlo and I have\npublicly supported the FCA’s efforts to secure an agreement with the submitting banks to stay on\nthrough the end of 2021, and we have encouraged the U.S. banks that submit to LIBOR to\ncooperate with FCA’s effort.\nOf course, LIBOR may remain viable well past 2021, but we do not think that market\nparticipants can safely assume that it will. Users of LIBOR must now take in to account the risk\nthat it may not always be published. While the public’s understanding of this risk has increased\nsignificantly since Andrew Bailey’s speech, the official sector has been concerned about it for\nsome years, as reflected for example in our public comments and in the annual reports of the\nFinancial Stability Oversight Council. Given our understanding of the risks to LIBOR, the\nFederal Reserve convened the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (or ARRC) in 2014 in\ncooperation with the Treasury Department and CFTC. Consistent with recommendations from\n\n- 4 -\nthe Financial Stability Board (FSB), we charged the ARRC with identifying a robust alternative\nto U.S. dollar LIBOR and with developing a plan to encourage its use in some derivatives and\nother transactions as appropriate.\nThe ARRC has accomplished the things that we asked of it. I want to thank the members\nfor their work and also to extend my special thanks to Sandie O’Connor as the chair of the\nARRC. Sandie will discuss the ARRC’s work shortly, but I’ll make a few points.\nFirst, I’d note that, like most market participants, the ARRC members initially had a\ndifficult time conceiving of any kind of transition from LIBOR. As is the case for all of you, a\ntransition will be a complicated task for the broker-dealers and other members of the ARRC, and\nwill involve significant costs. Over time, however, I think the ARRC members have developed a\ngreater understanding of the risks to LIBOR and now see that, despite those complications and\ncosts, a transition may prove necessary. I also think that, having had time to consider the\ntransition plans that Sandie will talk about, ARRC members have become more comfortable with\nthe idea that a transition is feasible, even if the necessity of achieving it is regrettable.\nSecond, it is clear that any rate the ARRC selected as a potential alternative needed to be\nhighly robust. There would be no point in selecting a rate that might find itself quickly in the\nsame kinds of conditions that LIBOR is in now. In our view, the ARRC has chosen the most\nrobust rate available. In general, only overnight unsecured or secured funding markets appeared\nto have enough underlying transactions to produce a robust rate. The overnight Treasury repo\nmarket is the largest and most active market in any tenor of U.S. rates markets. Figure 2\nillustrates the point: the transactions underlying the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR),\nat about $700 billion per day or more, are much larger than the volumes in overnight unsecured\nmarkets, even much larger than estimates of the volume in Treasury bills, and they dwarf the\n\n- 5 -\nvolumes in other term markets. The alternative reference rate needs to be able to stand the\nweight of having trillions of dollars written on it, and the ARRC has definitely met this standard\nin choosing SOFR.\nThird, we charged the ARRC with devising plans for a voluntary transition that\nencouraged the use of their recommended rate where appropriate. We have never told anyone\nthat they cannot use LIBOR. The ARRC did consider whether other cash products could move\nfrom LIBOR to the rates it evaluated, but their paced transition plan has focused on derivatives\nbecause that is where the largest gross exposures to LIBOR are, and because it may be easier for\nmany derivatives transactions to move away from LIBOR to a new rate.\nNow, however, market participants have realized that they may need to more seriously\nconsider transitioning other products away from LIBOR, and the ARRC has expanded its work\nto help ensure that this can be done in a coordinated way that avoids unnecessary disruptions.\nSandie will discuss plans to eventually create a term reference rate, which may help to smooth\nany transition. That term reference rate would have to be built by first developing futures and\nOIS markets that reference SOFR. It will likely never be as robust as SOFR itself, and so\nderivatives transactions will almost certainly need to be based on the overnight rate, but a term\nreference rate could conceivably be used in some loan or other contracts that currently reference\nLIBOR.\nAll of the work that we will talk about today will help, but we have to acknowledge that\nthe transition will be complicated. Unfortunately, as I have discussed, we cannot guarantee that\nit won’t be necessary. The most complicated aspects involve the legacy contracts that reference\nLIBOR, many of which do not have strong language in place if LIBOR were to stop publication.\nThe FSB has been working with the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (or ISDA)\n\n- 6 -\nto devise better language for derivatives, and ISDA’s Scott O’Malia and Katherine Tew Darras\nwill discuss that work later this morning. As people now consider the risks around LIBOR for\nother types of contracts, they will need to go through their documentation to understand what the\nfallback language is and how it can be improved. We will also discuss those issues today. This\nis important work, both for the parties to these contracts and for our financial stability. While\nthere may be no perfect contract language or fallback, good risk management requires that we\nwork together to find language and fallbacks that are robust and that limit unintended valuation\nchanges.\nSo, while much work has been done, there is more still to do. I have been heartened in\nseeing that many market participants are already confronting these issues. For some, Andrew\nBailey’s speech was a difficult wake-up call. But the efforts we have undertaken with the ARRC\nshow what is possible when the official sector works collectively with market participants. If\nmarket participants are willing to continue to work together, then we can safely achieve the\ntransitions needed to create a better and more robust system that will help to ensure our ongoing\nfinancial stability.\n\nFigure 1: Distribution of Daily Unsecured Funding Volumes of the G-SIB Firms\nPost Money-Market Reform\nPercent of days with\nOne-Month Funding Volumes\nobserved volume\n12%\nMedian\n10%\n8%\n6%\n4%\n2%\n0%\n$100 $500 $1.0 $1.5 $2.0 $2.5 $3.0 $3.5 $4.0 $4.5\nmillion million billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion\nPercent of days with\nThree-Month Funding Volumes\nobserved volume\n14%\nMedian\n12%\n10%\n8%\n6%\n4%\n2%\n0%\n$100 $500 $1.0 $1.5 $2.0 $2.5 $3.0 $3.5 $4.0 $4.5\nmillion million billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion\nPercent of days with\nSix-Month Funding Volumes\nobserved volume\n18%\nMedian\n15%\n12%\n9%\n6%\n3%\n0%\n$100 $500 $1.0 $1.5 $2.0 $2.5 $3.0 $3.5 $4.0 $4.5\nmillion million billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion\nSource: FR2420 and DTCC.

Powell\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\n67th Annual Meeting of the National Association for Business Economics\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania\nOctober 14, 2025\n\nThank you, Emily. And thank you to the National Association for Business\nEconomics for the Adam Smith Award. It is an honor just to be mentioned alongside\npast recipients, including my predecessors Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke. Thank you\nfor this recognition and for the opportunity to speak with you today.\nMonetary policy is more effective when the public understands what the Federal\nReserve does and why. With that in mind, I hope to enhance understanding of one of the\nmore arcane and technical aspects of monetary policy: the Federal Reserve’s balance\nsheet. A colleague recently compared this topic to a trip to the dentist, but that\ncomparison may be unfair—to dentists.1\nToday, I will discuss the essential role our balance sheet played during the\npandemic, along with some lessons learned. I will then review our ample reserves\nimplementation framework and the progress we have made toward normalizing the size\nof our balance sheet. I will conclude with some brief remarks on the economic outlook.\nBackground on the Fed’s Balance Sheet\nOne of the primary purposes of a central bank is to provide the monetary\nfoundation for the financial system and the broader economy. This foundation is made of\ncentral bank liabilities. On the Fed’s balance sheet, the liability side of the ledger totaled\n$6.5 trillion as of October 8, and three categories account for roughly 95 percent of that\ntotal.2 First, Federal Reserve notes—that is, physical currency—totaled $2.4 trillion.\nSecond, reserves—funds held by depository institutions at the Federal Reserve Banks—\n1 See Christopher J. Waller (2025), “Demystifying the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet,” speech delivered\nat the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, Dallas, Texas, July 10,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250710a.htm.\n2 For details discussed below, see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2025), Statistical\nRelease H.4.1, “Factors Affecting Reserve Balances of Depository Institutions and Condition Statement of\nFederal Reserve Banks” (October 9), https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h41/20251009/h41.pdf.\n\n- 2 -\ntotaled $3.0 trillion. These deposits allow commercial banks to make and receive\npayments and meet regulatory requirements. Reserves are the safest and most liquid\nasset in the financial system, and only the Fed can create them. The adequate provision\nof reserves is essential to the safety and soundness of our banking system, the resilience\nand efficiency of our payments system, and ultimately the stability of our economy.\nThird is the Treasury General Account (TGA), currently at about $800 billion,\nwhich essentially is the checking account for the federal government. When the Treasury\nmakes or receives payments, those flows affect dollar-for-dollar the supply of reserves or\nother liabilities in the system.3\nThe asset side of our ledger consists almost entirely of securities, including $4.2\ntrillion of U.S. Treasury securities and $2.1 trillion of government-guaranteed agency\nmortgage-backed securities (MBS).4 When we add reserves to the system, we generally\ndo so by purchasing Treasury securities in the open market and crediting the reserve\naccounts of the banks involved in the transaction with the seller. This process effectively\ntransforms securities held by the public into reserves but does not change the total\namount of government liabilities held by the public.5\n3 Other liabilities include reverse repurchase agreements and accounts held by designated financial market\nutilities, foreign central banks, and international financial institutions.\n4 Within its securities portfolio, the Federal Reserves also holds $2.3 billion in government agency debt.\n5 In 2021, the standing repo facility was established to serve as a backstop in money markets to support the\neffective implementation of monetary policy and smooth market functioning. It is available to provide\nliquidity to primary dealers and eligible depository institutions through overnight repurchase agreements.\nThe Federal Reserve also maintains U.S. dollar liquidity swap lines with several major central banks to\nprevent strains in global dollar funding markets from spilling over into domestic markets. The Foreign and\nInternational Monetary Authorities Repo Facility also is a source of dollar liquidity for approved foreign\ncentral banks and international monetary authorities. Beyond securities, the Fed maintains lending\nfacilities that serve as crucial backstops for the banking system. The loans we make through these facilities\nshow up as assets on our balance sheet, with the corresponding liability typically being reserves. Our\ndiscount window provides no-questions-asked liquidity to eligible depository institutions. In unusual and\nexigent circumstances, we may establish emergency liquidity facilities, in consultation with the Secretary\nof the Treasury. These facilities have demonstrated their critical importance in times of stress.\n\n- 3 -\nThe Balance Sheet Is an Important Tool\nThe Fed’s balance sheet serves as a critical policy tool, especially when the policy\nrate is constrained by the effective lower bound (ELB). When COVID-19 struck in\nMarch 2020, the economy came to a near standstill and financial markets seized up,\nthreatening to transform a public health crisis into a severe, prolonged economic\ndownturn.\nIn response, we established a number of emergency liquidity facilities. Those\nprograms, supported by Congress and the Administration, provided critical support to\nmarkets and were remarkably effective in restoring confidence and stability. At their\npeak in July 2020, loans from these facilities totaled just over $200 billion. Most of these\nloans were quickly unwound as conditions stabilized.6\nAt the same time, the market for U.S. Treasury securities—normally the deepest,\nmost liquid market in the world and the bedrock of the global financial system—was\nunder extraordinary pressure and on the verge of collapse. We used large-scale purchases\nof securities to restore functionality to the Treasury market. Faced with unprecedented\nmarket dysfunction, the Fed purchased Treasury and agency securities at an extraordinary\npace in March and April of 2020. These purchases supported the flow of credit to\nhouseholds and businesses and fostered more accommodative financial conditions to\n6 The combined peak in balances across these facilities occurred in July 2020 at just above $200 billion,\nincluding loans totaling $2.5 billion by the Primary Dealer Credit Facility, $20.6 billion by the Money\nMarket Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility, $68.1 billion by the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity\nFacility (PPPLF), $12.8 billion by the Commercial Paper Funding Facility, $41.4 billion by the Corporate\nCredit Facilities, $37.5 billion by the Main Street Lending Program (MSLP), $16.1 billion by the Municipal\nLiquidity Facility, and $8.8 billion by the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility; see Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System (2020), Statistical Release H.4.1, “Factors Affecting Reserve\nBalances of Depository Institutions and Condition Statement of Federal Reserve Banks” (July 2),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h41/20200702. At present, the only remaining balances from the\npandemic-era emergency lending facilities are $75 million in the PPPLF and $4.1 billion in the MSLP. All\nother emergency lending facilities have already been fully repaid.\n\n- 4 -\nsupport the recovery of the economy when it ultimately came.7 This source of policy\naccommodation was important as we had lowered the federal funds rate close to zero and\nexpected it to remain there for some time.\nBy June 2020, we slowed our purchase pace to a still substantial $120 billion per\nmonth. In December 2020, as the economic outlook remained highly uncertain, the\nFOMC said that we expected to maintain that pace of purchases “until substantial further\nprogress has been made toward the Committee’s maximum employment and price\nstability goals.”8 That guidance provided assurance that the Fed would not prematurely\nwithdraw support while the economic recovery remained fragile amid unprecedented\nconditions.\nWe maintained that pace of asset purchases through October 2021. By then, it\nhad become apparent that elevated inflation was not likely to go away without a strong\nmonetary response. At our meeting in November 2021, we announced a phaseout of\nasset purchases. At our next meeting in December, we doubled the pace of the taper and\nsaid that asset purchases would conclude by mid-March of 2022. Over the entire period\nof purchases, our securities holdings increased by $4.6 trillion.\nA number of observers have raised questions, fairly enough, about the size and\ncomposition of asset purchases during the pandemic recovery.9 Throughout 2020 and\n7 See Jerome H. Powell (2020), “Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference” (Washington: Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System, April 29),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/mediacenter/files/FOMCpresconf20200429.pdf.\n8 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2020), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC\nStatement,” press release, December 16, paragraph 4,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20201216a.htm.\n9 See, for example, Gauti B.

During that tumultuous period, we\ncontinued purchases in order to avoid a sharp, unwelcome tightening of financial\nconditions at a time when the economy still appeared to be highly vulnerable. Our\nthinking was informed by recent episodes in which signals about reducing the balance\nsheet had triggered significant tightening in financial conditions. We were thinking of\nevents of December 2018, as well as the 2013 “taper tantrum.”10\nRegarding the composition of our purchases, some have questioned the inclusion\nof agency MBS purchases given the strong housing market during the pandemic\nrecovery.11 Outside of purchases aimed specifically at market functioning, MBS\npurchases are primarily intended, like our purchases of Treasury securities, to ease\nbroader financial conditions when the policy rate is constrained at the ELB.12 The extent\nto which these MBS purchases disproportionately affected housing market conditions\nduring this period is challenging to determine. Many factors affect the mortgage market,\nEconomic Activity, Fall, pp. 3–26, https://www.brookings.edu/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2024/09/1.a_EnglishSack.pdf; (2024), “General Discussion,” Brookings Papers on\nEconomic Activity, Fall, pp. 88–92, https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/17160-\nBPEA-BPEA-FA24_WEB_Symposium_GD.pdf; and Andrew T.

While multiple factors were in play, many market participants pointed to the description of the\nFed’s quantitative tightening as being on “autopilot” as exacerbating the turmoil. The “taper tantrum” was\na sharp market selloff in 2013 when Chair Ben Bernanke suggested the Fed might soon reduce its asset\npurchases, causing Treasury yields to spike and triggering volatility in financial markets.\n11 See, for example, Aaron Klein and Alan Cui (2025), “Quantitative Easing and Housing Inflation Post-\nCOVID,” Series on Financial Markets and Regulation, Brookings Center on Regulations and Markets,\nOctober 8, https://www.brookings.edu/articles/quantitative-easing-and-housing-inflation-post-covid.\n12 See, for example, Chair Bernanke’s description of the operation of balance sheet tools as part of his\ndiscussion of monetary policy in the post–Global Financial Crisis (GFC) environment: Ben S. Bernanke\n(2012), “Monetary Policy since the Onset of the Crisis,” speech delivered at a symposium sponsored by the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, held in Jackson Hole, Wyo., August 31,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bernanke20120831a.pdf.\n\n- 6 -\nand many factors beyond the mortgage market affect supply and demand in the broader\nhousing market.13\nWith the clarity of hindsight, we could have—and perhaps should have—stopped\nasset purchases sooner. Our real-time decisions were intended to serve as insurance\nagainst downside risks. We knew that we could unwind purchases relatively quickly\nonce we ended them, which is exactly what we did. Research and experience tell us that\nasset purchases affect the economy through expectations regarding the future size and\nduration of our balance sheet.14 When we announced our taper, market participants\nbegan pricing in its effects, pulling forward the tightening in financial conditions.15\nStopping sooner could have made some difference, but not likely enough to\nfundamentally alter the trajectory of the economy. Nonetheless, our experience since\n2020 does suggest that we can be more nimble in our use of the balance sheet, and more\nconfident that our communications will foster appropriate expectations among market\nparticipants given their growing experience with these tools.\n13 Research indicates that house price increases during this time reflected factors well beyond mortgage\nrates. For example, Mondragon and Wieland (2022) estimate that the shift to remote work explains\napproximately one-half of the rise in house prices during the pandemic; for more details, see John A.\nMondragon and Johannes Wieland (2022), “Housing Demand and Remote Work,” NBER Working Paper\nSeries 30041 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic Research, May; revised May 2025),\nhttps://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w30041/w30041.pdf.\n14 See, for example, Mark Carlson, Stefania D’Amico, Cristina Fuentes-Albero, Bernd Schlusche, and Paul\nWood (2020), “Issues in the Use of the Balance Sheet Tool,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series\n2020-071 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, August),\nhttps://doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2020.071.\n15 Even before the taper in purchases was completed in 2022, markets were anticipating the rapid decline in\nthe size of the balance sheet that we subsequently delivered. Those expectations were formed based on our\ncommunications, even though the anticipated pace was three times faster than our experience from 2017 to\n2019. For example, the median respondents to the Survey of Primary Dealers in June 2022 anticipated that\nthe size of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) portfolio would ultimately fall by more than\n$2 trillion in less than three years, from its mid-2022 level of $8.5 trillion to $6.25 trillion by 2025:Q1. See\nquestion 3b in the June 2022 dealer survey results: Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Markets Group\n(2022), “Responses to Survey of Primary Dealers,” June,\nhttps://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/markets/survey/2022/jun-2022-spd-results.pdf.\n\n- 7 -\nSome have also argued that we could have better explained the purpose of asset\npurchases in real time.16 There is always room for improved communication. But I\nbelieve our statements were reasonably clear about our objectives, which were to support\nand then sustain smooth market functioning and to help foster accommodative financial\nconditions. Over time, the relative importance of those objectives evolved with economic\nconditions. But the objectives were never in conflict, so at the time this issue appeared to\nbe a distinction without much of a difference. That is not always the case, of course. For\nexample, the March 2023 banking stress led to a sizable increase in our balance sheet\nthrough lending operations. We clearly differentiated these financial stability operations\nfrom our monetary policy stance. Indeed, we continued to raise the policy rate through\nthat time.\nOur Ample Reserves Framework Works Well\nTurning to my second topic, our ample reserves regime has proven highly\neffective, delivering good control of our policy rate across a wide range of challenging\neconomic conditions, while promoting financial stability and supporting a resilient\npayments system.17\n16 See William B. English and Brian Sack (2024), “Challenges around the Federal Reserve’s Monetary\nPolicy Framework and Its Implementation,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Fall, pp. 3–26,\nhttps://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/1.a_EnglishSack.pdf, as well as Donald Kohn\n(2025), “Fed Should Be Sure to Include Monetary Policy Tools in Forthcoming Framework Review,”\nBrookings Commentary, January 24, https://www.brookings.edu/articles/fed-should-be-sure-to-include-\nmonetary-policy-tools-in-forthcoming-framework-review.\n17 By contrast, before the GFC, the Fed implemented monetary policy through a fundamentally different\napproach, a scarce reserves regime. This system relied on complicated reserve requirements to stabilize\nreserve demand, as the Fed did not have the authority to pay interest on reserves. Because banks did not\nreceive interest on reserves, they engaged in a variety of costly activities to minimize their reserve\nrequirements. To hit the federal funds rate target, the Fed had to conduct daily open market operations to\nfine-tune reserve supply. That approach was operationally burdensome for both depository institutions and\nthe Federal Reserve. It minimized systemwide liquidity consistent with the federal funds target rate, thus\nmaking the banking system more vulnerable to shocks. Unexpected swings in reserve demand at times led\nto excess volatility in short-term interest rates. In this scarce regime, banks relied more heavily on\n\n- 8 -\nIn this framework, an ample supply of reserves ensures adequate liquidity in the\nbanking system, and control of our policy rate is achieved through the setting of our\nadministered rates—interest on reserve balances and the overnight reverse repo rate.\nThis approach allows us to maintain rate control independently of the size of our balance\nsheet. That is important given large, unpredictable swings in liquidity demand from the\nprivate sector and significant fluctuations in autonomous factors affecting reserve supply,\nsuch as the Treasury General Account.\nThis framework has proven resilient whether the balance sheet is shrinking or\ngrowing. Since June 2022, we have reduced the size of our balance sheet by $2.2\ntrillion—from 35 percent to just under 22 percent of GDP—while maintaining effective\ninterest rate control.18\nOur long-stated plan is to stop balance sheet runoff when reserves are somewhat\nabove the level we judge consistent with ample reserve conditions.19 We may approach\nthat point in coming months, and we are closely monitoring a wide range of indicators to\ninform this decision.20 Some signs have begun to emerge that liquidity conditions are\nunsecured borrowing from other financial institutions—funding that can rapidly evaporate in times of\nstress, as was evident in the GFC.\n18 In January 2022, the FOMC released its “Principles for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s\nBalance Sheet,” followed in May by more detailed plans for doing so; see Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System (2022), “Principles for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet,”\npress release, January 26,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20220126c.htm; and Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System (2022), “Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s\nBalance Sheet,” May 4, press release,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20220504b.htm.\n19 Once balance sheet runoff has ceased, reserve balances will continue to gradually decline as other\nFederal Reserve liabilities grow over time. At some point, the Committee will determine that reserve\nbalances have reached an appropriately ample level. Thereafter, the Committee will manage securities\nholdings as needed to maintain ample reserves over time.\n20 While reserves appear to remain abundant, they are declining and will continue to do so. Since we began\nshrinking our balance sheet in 2022, the quantity of reserves has not changed much as the excess liquidity\nin the system was absorbed and then subsequently released by our overnight reverse repo facility. Now,\nhowever, balances in that facility have declined to minimal levels, so further declines in our securities\nholdings will translate more directly into lower reserves. Currently, reserve balances stand just below $3\n\n- 9 -\ngradually tightening, including a general firming of repo rates along with more noticeable\nbut temporary pressures on selected dates. The Committee’s plans lay out a deliberately\ncautious approach to avoid the kind of money market strains experienced in September\n2019. Moreover, the tools of our implementation framework, including the standing repo\nfacility and the discount window, will help contain funding pressures and keep the federal\nfunds rate within our target range through this transition to lower reserve levels.\nNormalizing the size of our balance sheet does not mean going back to the\nbalance sheet we had before the pandemic. In the longer run, the size of our balance sheet\nis determined by the public’s demand for our liabilities rather than our pandemic-related\nasset purchases. Non-reserve liabilities currently stand about $1.1 trillion higher than just\nprior to the pandemic, thus requiring that our securities holdings be equally higher.\nDemand for reserves has risen as well, in part reflecting the growth of the banking system\nand the overall economy.\nRegarding the composition of our securities portfolio, relative to the outstanding\nuniverse of Treasury securities, our portfolio is currently overweight longer-term\nsecurities and underweight shorter-term securities. The longer-run composition will be a\ntopic of Committee discussion. Transition to our desired composition will occur\ngradually and predictably, giving market participants time to adjust and minimizing the\nrisk of market disruption. Consistent with our longstanding guidance, we aim for a\nportfolio consisting primarily of Treasury securities over the longer run.21\ntrillion, or about 10 percent of GDP. By comparison, reserves as a share of GDP stood near 8 percent of\nGDP in early 2019, prior to the acute funding pressures that emerged later that year. Note that reserves as a\nshare of GDP is merely indicative, not a measure of the ampleness of reserves. Assessments of where\nreserves stand relative to ample levels depend on a wide range of market indicators.\n21 As noted in the minutes of the May 2022 FOMC meeting, the Committee could, at some point, consider\nsales of agency MBS to accelerate progress toward a longer-run SOMA portfolio composed primarily of\nTreasury securities; see Federal Open Market Committee (2022), “Minutes of the Federal Open Market\n\n- 10 -\nSome have questioned whether the interest we pay on reserves is costly to\ntaxpayers. In fact, that is not the case. The Fed earns interest income from the Treasury\nsecurities that back reserves. Most of the time, our interest earnings from Treasury\nholdings more than cover the interest paid on reserves, generating significant remittances\nto the Treasury. By law, we remit all profits to the Treasury after covering expenses.\nSince 2008, even after accounting for the recent period of negative net income, our total\nremittances to Treasury have totaled more than $900 billion. While our net interest\nincome has temporarily been negative due to the rapid rise in policy rates to control\ninflation, this is highly unusual. Our net income will soon turn positive again, as it\ntypically has been throughout our history. Of course, having negative net income has no\nbearing on our ability to conduct monetary policy or meet our financial obligations.22\nIf our ability to pay interest on reserves and other liabilities were eliminated, the\nFed would lose control over rates. The stance of monetary policy would no longer be\nappropriately calibrated to economic conditions and would push the economy away from\nour employment and price stability goals. To restore rate control, large sales of securities\nover a short period of time would be needed to shrink our balance sheet and the quantity\nof reserves in the system. The volume and speed of these sales could strain Treasury\nmarket functioning and compromise financial stability. Market participants would need\nto absorb the sales of Treasury securities and agency MBS, which would put upward\nCommittee” (Washington: FOMC, May 3–4),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20220504.pdf.\n22 See, for example, Alyssa Anderson, Dave Na, Bernd Schlusche, and Zeynep Senyuz (2022), “An\nAnalysis of the Interest Rate Risk of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet, Part 1: Background and\nHistorical Perspective,” FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,\nJuly 15), https://doi.org/10.17016/2380-7172.3173; and Alyssa Anderson, Philippa Marks, Dave Na, Bernd\nSchlusche, and Zeynep Senyuz (2022), “An Analysis of the Interest Rate Risk of the Federal Reserve's\nBalance Sheet, Part 2: Projections under Alternative Interest Rate Paths,” FEDS Notes (Washington:\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, July 15), https://doi.org/10.17016/2380-7172.3174.\n\n- 11 -\npressure on the entire yield curve, raising borrowing costs for the Treasury and the\nprivate sector. Even after that volatile and disruptive process, the banking system would\nbe less resilient and more vulnerable to liquidity shocks.\nThe bottom line is that our ample reserves regime has proven remarkably\neffective for implementing monetary policy and supporting economic and financial\nstability.\nCurrent Economic Conditions and Monetary Policy Outlook\nI will close with a brief discussion of the economy and the outlook for monetary\npolicy. Although some important government data have been delayed due to the\nshutdown, we routinely review a wide variety of public- and private-sector data that have\nremained available. We also maintain a nationwide network of contacts through the\nReserve Banks who provide valuable insights, which will be summarized in tomorrow’s\nBeige Book.\nBased on the data that we do have, it is fair to say that the outlook for\nemployment and inflation does not appear to have changed much since our September\nmeeting four weeks ago. Data available prior to the shutdown, however, show that\ngrowth in economic activity may be on a somewhat firmer trajectory than expected.\nWhile the unemployment rate remained low through August, payroll gains have\nslowed sharply, likely in part due to a decline in labor force growth due to lower\nimmigration and labor force participation. In this less dynamic and somewhat softer\nlabor market, the downside risks to employment appear to have risen. While official\nemployment data for September are delayed, available evidence suggests that both\n\n- 12 -\nlayoffs and hiring remain low, and that both households’ perceptions of job availability\nand firms’ perceptions of hiring difficulty continue their downward trajectories.23\nMeanwhile, 12-month core PCE inflation was 2.9 percent in August, up slightly\nfrom earlier this year, as rising core goods inflation has outpaced continued disinflation in\nhousing services. Available data and surveys continue to show that goods price increases\nprimarily reflect tariffs rather than broader inflationary pressures. Consistent with these\neffects, near-term inflation expectations have generally increased this year, while most\nlonger-term expectation measures remain aligned with our 2 percent goal.\nRising downside risks to employment have shifted our assessment of the balance\nof risks. As a result, we judged it appropriate to take another step toward a more neutral\npolicy stance at our September meeting. There is no risk-free path for policy as we\nnavigate the tension between our employment and inflation goals. This challenge was\nevident in the dispersion of Committee participants’ projections at the September\nmeeting. I will stress again that these projections should be understood as representing a\nrange of potential outcomes whose probabilities evolve as new information informs our\nmeeting-by-meeting approach to policymaking. We will set policy based on the\nevolution of the economic outlook and the balance of risks, rather than following a\npredetermined path.\nThank you again for this award and for inviting me to join you today. I look\nforward to our conversation.\n23 State-level data on unemployment insurance claims during September remain available, as do some non-\ngovernmental statistics on job openings and hiring. September results regarding perceptions of\nemployment conditions by firms and households are also available from recurring surveys, such as the\nNational Federation of Independent Business’s Jobs Report and the Conference Board’s Consumer\nConfidence Survey.",

Powell\nChairman\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\n“Revolution or Evolution? Reexamining Economic Paradigms”\n60th Annual Meeting of the National Association for Business Economics\nBoston, Massachusetts\nOctober 2, 2018\n\nIt is a pleasure and an honor to speak here today at the 60th Annual Meeting of\nthe National Association for Business Economics (NABE). Since 1959, NABE has\npromoted the use of economics in the workplace and advanced the worthy purpose of\nensuring that leading American businesses benefit from the insights of economists.\nToday I will focus on the Federal Reserve’s ongoing efforts to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices. I am pleased to say that, by these measures, the economy\nlooks very good. The unemployment rate stands at 3.9 percent, near a 20-year low.\nInflation is currently running near the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC)\nobjective of 2 percent. While these two top-line statistics do not always present an\naccurate picture of overall economic conditions, a wide range of data on jobs and prices\nsupports a positive view. In addition, many forecasters are predicting that these favorable\nconditions are likely to continue. For example, the medians of the most recent\nprojections from FOMC participants and the Survey of Professional Forecasters, as well\nas the most recent Congressional Budget Office (CBO) forecast, all have the\nunemployment rate remaining below 4 percent through the end of 2020, with inflation\nstaying very near 2 percent over the same period.1\nFrom the standpoint of our dual mandate, this is a remarkably positive outlook.\nIndeed, I was asked at last week’s press conference whether these forecasts are too good\nto be true--a reasonable question! Since 1950, the U.S. economy has experienced periods\nof low, stable inflation and periods of very low unemployment, but never both for such\n1 I am referring to the most recent forecast for year-end 2018 through 2020. The unemployment rate for\neach forecast bottoms out at 3.4 percent or 3.5 percent in 2019 and remains below 4 percent. Headline PCE\n(personal consumption expenditures) inflation is between 1.9 percent and 2.1 percent for all three years and\nforecasts. The sources for the forecast data are given in the notes to figure 1.\n\n- 2 -\nan extended time as is seen in these forecasts.2 Standard economic thinking has long\noffered an explanation for this: If unemployment were to remain this low for this long,\nemployers would be pushing up wages as they compete for scarce workers, and rising\nlabor costs would feed into more-rapid price inflation faced by consumers.\nThis dynamic between unemployment and inflation is known as a Phillips curve\nrelationship, and at times it can pose a fundamental tension between the two sides of the\nFed’s mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability. Recent low\ninflation and unemployment have some analysts asking, “Is the Phillips curve dead?”3\nOthers argue that the Phillips curve still lurks in the background and could reemerge at\nany time to exact revenge for low unemployment in the form of high inflation.\nMy comments today have two main objectives. The first is to explain how\nchanges in the Phillips curve help account for the somewhat surprising but broadly shared\ncurrent forecasts of continued very low unemployment with inflation near 2 percent. At\nthe risk of spoiling the surprise, I do not see it as likely that the Phillips curve is dead, or\nthat it will soon exact revenge. What is more likely, in my view, is that many factors,\nincluding better conduct of monetary policy over the past few decades, have greatly\nreduced, but not eliminated, the effects that tight labor markets have on inflation.\nHowever, no one fully understands the nature of these changes or the role they play in the\n2 For example, there have been four periods with quarterly average unemployment below 4 percent since\n1950. In an early 1950s episode, inflation ranged from below zero to 8 percent. Toward the end of the\n1950s, unemployment was near 4 percent for a time, dipping to 3.9 percent for one quarter. During this\nlow unemployment period, inflation rose steadily from under 1 percent to over 3 percent. The remaining\ntwo episodes with unemployment under 4 percent--one each in the 1960s and 1990s--are discussed later in\nthe speech.\n3 This question is asked in the title of a recent editorial by Alan Blinder (2018), and a Google search reveals\nmany similar titles. The research on the topic is reviewed more fully later in the speech.\n\n- 3 -\ncurrent context. Common sense suggests we should beware when forecasts predict\nevents seldom before observed in the economy.4\nThus, my second objective today is to explain, given this uncertainty about the\nunemployment-inflation relationship, the important role that risk management plays in\nsetting monetary policy. I will explore the FOMC’s monitoring and balancing of risks as\nwell as our contingency planning for cases when risk becomes reality.\nHistorical Perspective on Jobs and Inflation\nLet us start with a look at the modern history of jobs and inflation in the United\nStates. Figure 1 shows headline inflation and unemployment from 1960 to today and\nextended through 2020 using the average of median projections from both FOMC\nparticipants and the Survey of Professional Forecasters, and the CBO projections. As the\nfigure makes clear, a multiyear period with unemployment below 4 percent and stable\ninflation would, if realized, be unique in modern U.S. data.5\nTo understand the basis for these forecasts, it is useful to contrast two very\ndifferent periods included in figure 1: From 1960 to 1985, and the period from 1995 to\ntoday. The first period includes the Great Inflation, and the latter includes both the Great\nModeration and the distinctly immoderate period of the Global Financial Crisis and its\naftermath.\nFigure 2 shows unemployment and core, rather than headline, inflation in these\ntwo periods. While our inflation objective concerns headline inflation, switching to core\n4 Herb Stein (1998) made the analogous point that one should doubt the assertion that some program will\n“cause the economy to perform outside the range of its past experience” (p. 217).\n5 See note 2. Unless otherwise noted, all statements about inflation will be four-quarter percent changes in\nquarterly average data, and all statements about unemployment will be about the quarterly average\nunemployment rate.\n\n- 4 -\ninflation makes some relationships clearer by removing a good deal of variability due to\nfood and energy prices, variability that is not primarily driven by labor market conditions\nor monetary policy.\nThere is a dramatic difference in the unemployment-inflation relationship across\nthese two periods. During the Great Inflation, unemployment fluctuated between roughly\n4 percent and 10 percent, and inflation moved over a similar range. In the recent period,\nthe unemployment rate also fluctuated between roughly 4 percent and 10 percent, but\ninflation has been relatively tame, averaging 1.7 percent and never declining below\n1 percent or rising to 2.5 percent. Even during the financial crisis, core inflation barely\nbudged. As a thought experiment, look at the right panel and imagine that you could see\nonly the red line (inflation), and not the blue line (unemployment). Nothing in the red\nline hints at a major economic event, let alone the immense upheaval around the time of\nthe global financial crisis.\nNotice that, in each period, there is only one episode in which unemployment\ndrops below 4 percent. In the late 1960s, unemployment remained at or below 4 percent\nfor four years, and during that time inflation rose steadily from under 2 percent to almost\n5 percent. By contrast, the late 1990s episode of below-4-percent unemployment was\nquite brief, and during the episode and surrounding quarters inflation was reasonably\nstable and remained below 2 percent.\nTo explore the Phillips curve relationship in these two periods more closely, we\nneed to bring in the concept of the natural rate of unemployment. In standard economic\nthinking, an unemployment rate above the natural rate indicates slack in the labor market\nand tends to be associated with downward pressure on inflation; unemployment below\n\n- 5 -\nthe natural rate represents a tight labor market and is associated with upward inflation\npressure.\nFigure 3 repeats figure 2 but replaces unemployment with labor market slack as\nmeasured by unemployment minus the CBO’s current estimate of the natural rate of\nunemployment at each point in time.6 Periods of tight labor markets are shaded. During\nthe Great Inflation, inflation generally rose in the tight, shaded periods and fell in the\nunshaded ones, just as conventional Phillips curve reasoning predicts.\nFrom 1995 to today, the large and persistent swings in the gap between\nunemployment and the natural rate were associated with, at most, a move of a few tenths\nin the inflation rate. Comparing the shaded and unshaded regions, you might see some\nassociation between slack and the minor ups and downs in inflation, but the pattern is not\nat all consistent. It is evidence like this that fuels speculation about the Phillips curve’s\ndemise.\nWhether dead, sick, or merely resting, many of the questions about the Phillips\ncurve come down to figuring out what changed between these two periods, and why. Let\nus turn to a conceptual framework for examining these questions more systematically.\nA Simple Framework for Understanding Changes in the Jobs-Inflation Relationship\nA natural starting point is the simplest form of a Phillips curve equation, which\nposits that inflation this year is determined by some combination of current labor market\n6 This estimate is the CBO’s current assessment of what the natural rate was at each period in the sample,\nnot a measure of the natural rate as perceived in real time. I discuss the importance of this distinction in\nPowell (2018).\n\n- 6 -\nslack, inflation last year, and some other factors that I will leave aside for this discussion\n(figure 4):7\nInflation(t) = -B Slack(t) + C Inflation(t - 1) + Other(t).\nThe value of B is often referred to as the slope of the Phillips curve. With a larger\nvalue of B, any change in labor market slack translates into a bigger change in inflation.\nAs we say, as B increases, the Phillips curve steepens. The value of C determines\ninflation’s persistence--that is, how long any given change in inflation tends to linger. As\nthe value of C increases, higher inflation this year translates more into higher inflation\nnext year. A particularly nasty case arises when B and C are both large. In this case,\nslack has a large effect on inflation, and that effect tends to be very persistent. One\nimplication of a large C is that, if a boom drives inflation up, it will tend to stay up unless\noffset by a subsequent bust.8\nFigure 5 shows regression estimates of B and C, computed over 20-year samples\nstarting with the sample from 1965 to 1984 and including each 20-year sample through\n2017. During the Great Inflation samples, the value of C is near 1, meaning that higher\ninflation one year tended to translate almost one-for-one into higher inflation the next.\nThe Phillips curve is also relatively steep in the Great Inflation samples, with 1 extra\npercentage point of lower unemployment converting into roughly 1/2 percentage point of\nhigher inflation. Thus, the Great Inflation presented that nasty case just described.\n7 What is reported here is an updated version of results reported in Erceg and others (2018), and that work\nprovides additional discussion. Note that the “Other” term includes a constant.\n8 The text refers to when C is less than 1, in which case a rise in inflation would ultimately die out on its\nown. When C is 1, the Phillips curve is of the “accelerationist” variety, and any offsetting rise in inflation\ndue to labor market tightness would be permanent unless offset by an equal amount of subsequent slack.\nBlanchard (2016) has a good discussion of this issue.\n\n- 7 -\nFortunately, things changed. The estimates of both B and C fall in value as the\nestimation sample shifts forward in time. In the most recent samples, the Phillips curve is\nnearly flat, with B very near zero, and C is about 0.25, meaning that roughly one fourth of\nany rise or fall in inflation carries forward. These results give numerical form to what we\nsee in the right-hand panel of figure 3, covering the recent period: Large and persistent\nmoves in the unemployment gap were associated with, at most, modest transitory moves\nin inflation.\nWhat Led to the Changes in the Phillips curve?\nThese developments amount to a better world for households and businesses,\nwhich no longer experience or even fear the scourge of high and volatile inflation. To\nprovide a sound basis for monetary policy, it is important to understand what happened\nand why, so we can avoid a return to the bad old days of the 1970s. Like many, I believe\nbetter monetary policy has played a central role.9\nTo understand the mechanism, let us ask how central banks could, presumably\ninadvertently, amplify and extend the duration of inflation’s response to labor market\ntightness. To do so, the central bank could persistently ease the stance of monetary\npolicy in response to an uptick in inflation. No responsible central banker today would\nintentionally do this, but much research suggests that during the Great Inflation,\nmisunderstandings about how the economy worked led the Fed effectively to behave in\nthis manner.10 Some policymakers may have believed the misguided notion that\n9 The account I present of the role of anchored expectations in stabilizing the economy and favorably\naltering Phillips curve dynamics echoes a long-held view at the Fed. See Bernanke (2007) and Yellen\n(2015). Kiley (2015) reviews the recent research literature on this topic. Blanchard (2016) presents a very\nsimilar perspective.\n10 To be clear, during the periods of rising inflation in the 1960s and 1970s, the FOMC was generally\nraising the federal funds rate, but with inflation rising, the real federal funds rate was rising much more\nslowly or even falling. In this sense, the effective stance of policy was tightening slowly or was easing.\n\n- 8 -\naccommodating permanently higher inflation could purchase permanently higher\nemployment.11 Other policymakers misperceived the level of the natural rate of\nunemployment, which we now believe had shifted up markedly in the 1960s. With the\nhigher natural rate, the labor market was much tighter and provided much greater upward\npressure on inflation than policymakers realized in real time. As a result, they were\ncontinually “behind the curve.”12\nThe channel through which monetary policy can amplify and extend inflation’s\nresponse to shocks becomes even stronger when we take account of expectations. If\npeople come to expect that upward blips in inflation will result in ongoing higher\ninflation, they will build that view into wage and price decisions. In this case, people’s\nexpectations become a force adding momentum to inflation, and breaking inflation’s\nmomentum can require convincing people to change their minds and behavior--never an\neasy task. Arguably, this is why a federal funds rate near 20 percent--roughly 10 percent\nin real terms--was required in the early 1980s to turn the tide on high inflation. The cost,\nin the form of very high unemployment, is clear in the Great Inflation figures.\nThe Great Inflation taught us that a main task of monetary policy is to keep inflation\nexpectations anchored at some low level.\nThis idea is behind the adoption in recent decades of inflation targets, such as the\nFed’s 2 percent objective, by central banks around the world. When monetary policy\ntends to offset shocks to inflation, rather than amplifying and extending them, and when\npeople come to expect this policy response, a surprise rise or fall in labor market\ntightness will naturally have smaller and less persistent effects on inflation. Research\n11 Romer and Romer (2002) make this argument.\n12 I discuss this argument in greater depth in Powell (2018).\n\n- 9 -\nsuggests that this reasoning can account for a good deal of the change in the Phillips\ncurve relationship.13 It is also likely that many other factors have contributed to changes\nin inflation dynamics over recent decades. We do not fully understand the causes and\nimplications of these changes, which raises risk management issues that I will take up\nnow.14\nA Favorable Outlook, but What Could Go Wrong?\nTo set the stage, let us return to the situation facing the FOMC. The baseline\nforecasts of most FOMC participants and a broad range of others show unemployment\nremaining below 4 percent for an extended period, with inflation steady near 2 percent. I\nhave made the case that this forecast is not too good to be true and does not signal the\ndeath of the Phillips curve. Instead, the outlook is consistent with evidence of a very flat\nPhillips curve and inflation expectations anchored near 2 percent.\nBut we still must face the cautionary advice to beware when forecasts point to\nrarely seen outcomes. As a way of heeding this advice, the Committee takes a risk\nmanagement approach, which has three important parts: monitoring risks; balancing\nrisks, both upside and downside; and contingency planning for surprises. Let me\ndescribe a few of the risks and how we are thinking about them.\nCould Inflation Expectations Become Unanchored?\nFirst is the risk that inflation expectations might lose their anchor. We attribute a\ngreat deal of the stability of inflation in recent years to the anchoring of longer-term\n13 Yellen (2017) gives a more detailed account of how a very flat Phillips curve with anchored expectations\ncan account well for the recent inflation and unemployment data. See also note 9.\n14 Many changes not directly related to policy might nonetheless have been precipitated by the\nimprovement in policy. For example, Pfajfar and Roberts, (2018) present evidence that when inflation is\nmore stable, people simply pay less attention to it and that this could help account for changes in the\nPhillips curve relationship.\n\n- 10 -\ninflation expectations. And we are aware that it could be very costly if those expectations\nwere to drift materially. As you probably know from our public communications, we\ncarefully monitor survey- and market-based proxies for expectations, and we do not see\nevidence of a material shift in longer-term expectations (figure 6). The survey measures\nhave been particularly steady for some time.15 The financial market-based measures\ninclude both an expectations component and a volatile inflation premium component, so\nthey tend to move around much more than the surveys, but we see no evidence of a\nmaterial change in these measures, either.\nThe risks to inflation expectations are, of course, two sided. Until this summer,\ninflation had remained stubbornly below 2 percent for several years. And major\neconomies in much of the world have been struggling mainly with disinflationary forces.\nThus, we have been and will remain alert for possible downward drift in expectations.\nSome argue the contrary case--that by only gradually removing accommodation as the\nunemployment rate has fallen, the FOMC may have fallen behind the curve, thereby\nrisking an upward drift in expectations. From the standpoint of contingency planning,\nour course is clear: Resolutely conduct policy consistent with the FOMC’s symmetric 2\npercent inflation objective, and stand ready to act with authority if expectations drift\nmaterially up or down.\nCould Inflation Pressures Move up More than Expected in a Hot Economy?\nA second risk is that labor market tightness or tightness in other parts of the\nproduction chain might lead to higher inflation pressure than expected--the “revenge of\n15 That is, movements in these measures have been modest, especially taking into account precision of the\nsurveys.\n\n- 11 -\nthe Phillips curve” scenario.16 As I mentioned, the FOMC carefully monitors a wide\narray of early indicators of inflation pressure to evaluate this risk. Wages and\ncompensation data are one important source of information. These measures have picked\nup some recently, but in a way that is quite welcome. Specifically, the rise in wages is\nbroadly consistent with observed rates of price inflation and labor productivity growth\nand therefore does not point to an overheating labor market. Further, higher wage growth\nalone need not be inflationary. The late 1990s episode of low unemployment saw wages\nrise faster than inflation plus productivity growth without an appreciable rise in inflation.\nDespite what shows up in the aggregate wage and compensation data, however, I\nam sure that, like us, many of you are hearing widespread anecdotes about labor\nshortages and increasing bottlenecks in production. For example, as shown in figure 7,\nthe words “shortage” and “bottleneck” are increasingly appearing in the Beige Book, the\nFederal Reserve’s report summarizing discussions with our business contacts around the\ncountry.17 The message we are hearing in our conversations is supported by a wide range\nof more conventional measures. For example, the survey of members of the National\nFederation of Independent Business finds firms increasingly reporting that job openings\nare hard to fill (figure 8). Further, these businesses now list “quality of labor” as their\nmost important problem, as opposed to the more typical report of “poor sales.”\nWe review a wide variety of measures of this type, and these indicators show\nwhat I think most business people see: an economy operating with limited slack. Notice,\n16 Gordon (2018) presents one version of the revenge hypothesis.\n17 The length of the Beige Book has varied somewhat over time; for example, the Beige Book was\nredesigned in 2017, with the number of words reduced about 10 percent. It is unclear whether the number\nof important words like “shortage” would have been affected by that redesign, but if so, it would go in the\ndirection of holding down the observed recent increase.\n\n- 12 -\nhowever, that these measures are near levels that prevailed in the late 1990s or early\n2000s, a period when core inflation remained under 2 percent.\nWhile the late 1990s case proves that elevated values of these tightness measures\ndo not automatically translate into rising inflation, a single episode provides only limited\nreassurance. Thus, the FOMC takes seriously the possibility that tight markets for labor\nor other inputs could provide greater upward pressure on inflation than in the baseline\noutlook. Our best estimates, however, suggest that so long as inflation expectations\nremain anchored, a modest steepening of the Phillips curve would be unlikely to cause a\nsignificant rise in inflation or demand a disruptive policy tightening.18 Once again, the\nkey is the anchored expectations.\nIs the Natural Rate of Unemployment Lower Than Expected?\nA third risk--in this case an upside risk--is that the natural rate of unemployment\ncould be even lower than current estimates. Some have argued that the Fed should be\nremoving policy accommodation much more slowly, pushing the economy to see if the\nnatural rate of unemployment is lower still.\nAdvocates of this view note that over the past several years of policy\nnormalization, the economy has continued to strengthen and unemployment has fallen,\nbut inflation has remained quiet. As I discussed in a recent speech, many analysts have\naccounted for the lack of rising inflation pressure by lowering their estimate of the natural\nrate.19 For example, since the start of 2016, the unemployment rate has fallen about 1\npercentage point, and estimates of the natural rate from four well-known sources have\nfallen over that period between 0.3 percent and 0.7 percent (figure 9).\n18 See, for example, Erceg and others (2018).\n19 See Powell (2018).\n\n- 13 -\nIf the natural rate is now materially lower than we believe, that would imply less\nupward pressure on inflation--the flip side of the “revenge of the Phillips curve” risk.\nOur policy of gradual interest rate normalization represents the FOMC’s attempt to take\nboth of these risks seriously. Removing accommodation too quickly could needlessly\nforeshorten the expansion. Moving too slowly could risk rising inflation and inflation\nexpectations. Our path of gradually removing accommodation, while closely monitoring\nthe economy, is designed to balance these risks.\nIn wrapping up this discussion of risks to the favorable outlook, I should\nemphasize that I have chosen to focus on three risks that are all associated with the\nPhillips curve. There are, of course, myriad other risks. To name just a few, we must\nconsider the strength of economies abroad, the effects of ongoing trade disputes, and\nfinancial stability issues. I hope my discussion of three particular risks gives a sense of\nhow we approach these issues.\nConclusion\nMany of us have been looking back recently on the decade that has passed since\nthe depths of the financial crisis. In light of that experience, I am glad to be able to stand\nhere and say that the economy is strong, unemployment is near 50-year lows, and\ninflation is roughly at our 2 percent objective. The baseline outlook of forecasters inside\nand outside the Fed is for more of the same.\nThis historically rare pairing of steady, low inflation and very low unemployment\nis testament to the fact that we remain in extraordinary times. Our ongoing policy of\ngradual interest rate normalization reflects our efforts to balance the inevitable risks that\n\n- 14 -\ncome with extraordinary times, so as to extend the current expansion, while maintaining\nmaximum employment and low and stable inflation.\n\n- 15 -\nReferences\nBernanke, Ben S.

    "text": "For release on delivery\n11:00 a.m. EDT (10:00 a.m. local time)\nOctober 9, 2019\nOpening Remarks\nby\nJerome H. Powell\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat a\n“Community Listening Session”\na Fed Listens event at\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\nKansas City, Missouri\nOctober 9, 2019\n\nGood morning. I am happy to be here in Kansas City for the 13th of 14 Fed\nListens events. I look forward to hearing the perspectives of the community and business\nleaders participating today.\nThe Reserve Banks and the Board have been holding Fed Listens events around\nthe country as part of a comprehensive and public review of our monetary policy\nstrategy, tools, and communications practices. Almost all of the Fed Listens meetings,\nlike this one, have been open to the press and live-streamed on the internet. Both the\nbreadth and transparency of the review are unprecedented for us.\nOne reason we are conducting this review is that it is always a good practice for\nany organization to occasionally take a step back and ask if it could be doing its job more\neffectively. But we must pose that question not just to ourselves. Because Congress has\ngranted the Federal Reserve significant protections from short-term political pressures,\nwe have an obligation to clearly explain what we are doing and why. And we have an\nobligation to actively engage the people we serve so that they and their elected\nrepresentatives can hold us accountable. We have invited you here because we want to\nbetter understand how monetary policy affects your lives and the lives of the people your\norganizations represent. We want to hear your perspective on maximum employment\nand price stability—the monetary policy goals Congress has assigned us.\nNow is a good time to conduct the review. Unemployment is at a half-century\nlow, and inflation is running close to, but a bit below, our 2 percent objective. While not\neveryone fully shares economic opportunities and the economy faces some risks, overall,\nit is—as I like to say—in a good place. Our job is to keep it there as long as possible.\nWhile we believe our strategy and tools have been and remain effective, the U.S.\n\n- 2 -\neconomy, like other advanced economies around the world, is facing some longer-term\nchallenges—from low growth, low inflation, and low interest rates. While slow growth is\nobviously not good, you may be asking, “What’s wrong with low inflation and low\ninterest rates?” Low can be good, but when inflation—and, consequently, interest\nrates—are too low, the Fed and other central banks have less room to cut rates to support\nthe economy during downturns.\nSo, in this review, we are examining strategies that might better allow us to\nsymmetrically and sustainably achieve 2 percent inflation. Doing so would help prevent\ninflation expectations among consumers, businesses, and investors from slipping too low,\nas they appear to have done in several advanced economies. More-firmly anchored\nexpectations, in a virtuous circle, would help keep actual inflation around our target, thus\npreserving our ability to change interest rates as appropriate to meet our mandate. We are\nalso looking at whether our existing monetary policy tools will be adequate when the next\ndownturn comes. Finally, we are asking whether our communications practices can be\nimproved to better support the effectiveness of our policy.\nAfter today, we have one Fed Listens session remaining, later this month in\nChicago. At the July meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, my colleagues and\nI began discussing what we have learned so far from the Fed Listens events. We\ncontinued that discussion at our September meeting and have a lot left to do. We plan to\npublicly report our conclusions during the first half of next year.\nOne clear takeaway of the sessions so far is the importance of sustaining this\nhistorically strong job market. People from low- and moderate-income communities tell\nus that this long recovery, now in its 11th year, is benefiting them and their neighbors to a\n\n- 3 -\ndegree that has not been felt for many years. Employers are partnering with community\ncolleges and nonprofit organizations to offer training. And people who have struggled to\nstay in the workforce in the past are getting new opportunities.\nOnce again, I’m happy to be here. Now it is your turn to speak. We’re listening.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n10:00 a.m. EST\nJanuary 20, 2015\n“Comments on the Fair and Effective Markets Review”\nRemarks by\nJerome H. Powell\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Making Markets Fair and Effective for All”\nSponsored by The Brookings Institution\nWashington, D.C.\nJanuary 20, 2015\n\nI want to thank the Brookings Institution for inviting me to comment today on\nMartin Wheatley’s presentation on the Fair and Effective Markets Review (Review). 1\nThe Review is an ambitious and important initiative. Although London is perhaps the\nleading center for many fixed-income, currency, and commodities (FICC) markets, these\nmarkets are global, and the United States and the largest U.S. firms play key roles in\nthem. So the Review addresses issues that affect our markets as well.\nThe Review looks to identify further steps that should be taken to restore public\nconfidence in FICC markets in the wake of the depressingly numerous instances of\nserious misconduct in these markets in recent years. That misconduct has been, and will\ncontinue to be, addressed through substantial fines and criminal prosecution of the firms\nand individuals involved. The Federal Reserve continues to take part in these\nenforcement actions in cooperation with other U.S. agencies.\nThe design of the Review is not only to advance the enforcement process, but also\nto look carefully at markets and firms and ask whether there are structural vulnerabilities\nor incentives for bad conduct that have not been well addressed by reforms to date. I will\noffer comments on a few specific areas and discuss some of our parallel efforts here in\nthe United States.\nFirst, as the Review notes, there is a perception that FICC markets and their\nparticipants are highly sophisticated and do not need protection. While that may be\ngenerally true, the perspective is too narrow, because the importance of these markets\nextends far beyond the largest participants in them. The market mechanism allocates\ncredit and determines the borrowing costs of households, companies and governments.\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily shared by other members of the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nProper market functioning is really a public good that relies on confidence and trust\namong market participants and the public. Bad conduct, weak internal firm governance,\nmisaligned incentives, and flawed market structure can all place this trust at risk.\nOne of the ways we have to influence incentives is through compensation\npractices at supervised institutions. Many have argued that pre-crisis compensation\npractices at the largest financial firms allowed or created misaligned incentives. In\nresponse, many firms have changed their compensation practices since the crisis to better\nalign incentives between individuals and firms, particularly through enhanced deferral of\nincentive compensation, with delayed vesting and the possibility of more robust forfeiture\nin a broader set of circumstances. We have strongly encouraged these reforms in our\nsupervision of these institutions. In my view, the reforms are both essential and generally\non target. The U.S. financial regulators, including the Federal Reserve, are also preparing\nfor public comment a proposed new rule on incentive compensation that will codify and\nstrengthen these initiatives.\nAs the Review notes, greater transparency can also help curb market abuses and\nstrengthen competition. In the United States, we have had over a decade of experience\nwith the Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (TRACE) in over-the-counter\ncorporate bond, MBS and ABS markets. The Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board\nprovides similar data for municipal bonds. The Dodd-Frank Act also imposed rules\nrequiring greater transparency in over-the-counter derivatives markets through the use of\ncentral clearing, trade repositories, and swap execution facilities. Given the issues\naround OTC derivatives during the recent crisis, these clearly are important initiatives.\nBut despite significant progress, there are still a number of impediments to sharing trade\n\n- 3 -\nreport data across regulatory agencies and jurisdictions, leaving us with only a piecemeal\npicture of the overall market rather than the full transparency that we desire.\nThe issues around foreign exchange (FX) benchmarks serve to illustrate one of\nthe important challenges discussed in the Review--the difficulty of managing the\npotential conflicts of interest associated with the traditional market-maker model. In FX\nmarkets, a wide range of end users seek to guarantee trade execution at the WM Reuters\nfixing at 4:00 p.m. U.K. time each day. This practice results in dealers having advance\ninformation about flows, and at the same time places them at some risk, as they are\nagreeing to execute these orders at an unknown future price. This advance information\ncan create a perception that dealers are trading ahead of their clients, and it certainly\ncreated incentives to attempt to influence the fixing price. The recent Financial Stability\nBoard (FSB) report on foreign exchange benchmarks2 made a number of\nrecommendations designed to address these issues in this specific market, including use\nof trading platforms to maximize the netting of fixing orders, encouraging dealers to\ncharge a transparent bid-asked spread or other fee to compensate them for the risk they\ntake, and strengthening dealers’ internal systems and controls to better manage potential\nconflicts of interest.\nOf course, similar challenges exist with market-making in other FICC markets.\nMany firms have taken up these challenges with their own reforms, and their efforts serve\nto emphasize how complicated these issues can be. Dealers must communicate with\nother firms, within their own firms and with their clients, and must execute their clients’\n2 http://www.financialstabilityboard.org/2014/09/r_140930/\n\n- 4 -\ntrades. The challenge is to identify and preserve the legitimate benefits of such\ncommunication and trading while safeguarding against improper uses of information. It\nmay be that these challenges can be addressed through coordinated private efforts; for\nexample, through such bodies as the Foreign Exchange Committee and the Treasury\nMarket Practices Group, sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. These\ngroups are actively working on industry best practices in their markets and have often\nplayed a constructive role on market practices that enhance market functioning. It may\nalso be that further supervisory or regulatory action is needed.\nTurning to our work on interest rate benchmark reform, it is worth recalling that,\nbefore the scandal broke, the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) was not regulated.\nU.K. authorities have now addressed this shortcoming by making both the submission\nand administration of LIBOR regulated activities. The process by which firms make their\nLIBOR submissions is now subject to careful monitoring. The new LIBOR\nadministrator, ICE Benchmark Administration, now regulated by the Financial Conduct\nAuthority, is evaluating changes to LIBOR so that it can be based as much as possible on\nactual arm’s-length transactions from a broader base of funding transactions.\nWith surveillance and penalties in place, and a new administrator, one might be\nexcused for thinking that there is nothing more to be done. In fact, some people do think\nthat. That is emphatically not the view of the FSB Official Sector Steering Group that I\nnow co-chair with Martin, which concluded that it is essential to develop one or more risk\nfree (or near risk free) alternatives to LIBOR for use in financial contracts such as interest\nrate derivatives. The reasons are related to the structure of both LIBOR and the market\nthat underlies it. Unsecured interbank borrowing has been in a secular decline for some\n\n- 5 -\ntime, and there is a scarcity, or outright absence in longer tenors, of actual transactions\nthat banks can use to estimate their daily submission to LIBOR or that can be used by\nothers to verify those submissions. LIBOR is huge--there are roughly $300 trillion in\ngross notional contracts that reference it--so the incentives to manipulate it still remain in\nplace. And the structural problems go much further than the incentives for manipulation.\nMarkets need to be fair, effective, and also safe. If the publication of LIBOR were to\nbecome untenable because the number of transactions that underlie it declined further,\nthen untangling the outstanding LIBOR contracts would entail a legal mess that could\nendanger our financial stability.\nFor these reasons, the Federal Reserve has convened a group of the largest global\ndealers to form the Alternative Reference Rates Committee. We have asked them to\nwork with us in promoting alternatives to U.S. dollar LIBOR that better reflect the\ncurrent structure of funding markets. As the Review’s consultation document notes,\nissues of this kind are really global in nature; U.S. dollar LIBOR contracts are traded\nthroughout the world, not simply in the United States. For this reason we are working in\nclose consultation with our foreign regulatory counterparts in this endeavor.\nOne of the reasons that I emphasize structural issues such as the market-maker\nmodel or the secular decline in unsecured interbank borrowing is that FICC markets are\nundergoing rapid changes that seem likely to have far-ranging consequences. Issues that\na few years ago concerned equity markets now arise in FICC markets as well. As the\nconsultation document notes, broker-dealers are curtailing some of their market-making\nactivities and their appetite for providing liquidity in response to regulatory changes and\ntheir own assessment of the risks and returns of these activities. At the same time, other\n\n- 6 -\nplayers such as mutual funds, exchange traded funds, algorithmic and high-frequency\ntraders, and electronic exchanges are taking more prominent roles. These changes will\naffect market liquidity and functioning in ways that are difficult to foresee. It is possible\nthat some of these factors played a role in the sharp swing in Treasury yields last October\n15, and we are working with other regulators to understand exactly what happened that\nday and to determine whether there are implications for regulatory or supervisory policy.\nThe Review raises the right questions in considering the troubling patterns of\nmarket abuse, and also in considering the structural changes that we are now seeing. It is\nimportant that market participants, end users, and regulators collectively take a step back\nand consider, as the Review invites us to do, whether the changing structure of FICC\nmarkets will result in markets that are fair, effective, and safe.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n1:15 p.m. EST\nNovember 17, 2015\nCentral Clearing in an Interdependent World\nRemarks by\nJerome H. Powell\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe Clearing House Annual Conference\nNew York, N.Y.\nNovember 17, 2015\n\nThank you for inviting me to speak today.1 I attended The Clearing House\nannual meeting in 2013 and spoke about financial market infrastructure reform.\nTwo years have passed, and this is a good opportunity to take stock. I’ll start by\nreviewing the progress made in strengthening central counterparty (or CCP)\nclearing, and then offer some thoughts on expanded central clearing for repurchase\nagreement (or repo) markets--an area of significant current interest.\nIn the years leading up to the financial crisis, the over-the-counter (OTC)\nderivatives market experienced rapid growth and an underappreciated buildup of\nrisk. The huge losses suffered by the American International Group (AIG) on its\nderivatives positions and the lack of transparency about the exposures of AIG’s\ncounterparties were major accelerants to the financial panic that reached its acute\nphase in September 2008. In response, in 2009 the Group of Twenty nations\ncommitted to moving standardized derivatives to central clearing, and to requiring\nposting of margin for derivatives that are not centrally cleared.2\nI am a believer in the potential benefits of central clearing under the right\ncircumstances. But central clearing is not a panacea. Charts similar to that in\nFigure 1 are often used to illustrate the netting of exposures and simplification that\n1 These remarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve Board or\nthe Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 G20 Leaders Statement: The Pittsburg Summit, September 24-25 2009. https://g20.org/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2014/12/Pittsburgh_Declaration_0.pdf\n1\n\ncentral clearing can bring to an OTC market. The tangled and highly opaque\npicture of a purely bilateral market is replaced by the neat hub-and-spoke network\nin which a CCP is buyer to every seller, and seller to every buyer, allowing netting\nand greater transparency for participants and regulators alike. Of course, reality is\nnot so elegant, as Figure 2 illustrates. There are multiple CCPs, even within\nproduct classes, and major dealers act as clearing members across a broad network\nof CCPs. Clearing members also perform a range of services for CCPs, including\ncustody, liquidity provision, and settlement. By design, increased central clearing\nwill concentrate risks in CCPs; it is essential that, as these risks accumulate, the\nCCPs build up their ability to manage them. It is often noted that CCPs made it\nthrough the recent financial crisis without direct government assistance. But many\nof their major clearing members did receive such assistance. CCPs must now plan\nfor a world in which these large firms will fail and be resolved without government\nsupport.\nRecognizing the importance of strengthening our financial market\ninfrastructure, the regulatory community has clarified and significantly raised\nexpectations for CCPs and all key financial market infrastructures (FMIs or market\ninfrastructures). These heightened expectations are set forth in the Principles for\nFinancial Market Infrastructures (or PFMIs), which were adopted in 2012 by the\nCommittee on Payment and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) and the International\n2\n\nOrganization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO).3 The PFMIs lay out\ncomprehensive requirements for financial market infrastructures, including CCPs.\nClearing and settlement activities are cross-border and indeed global in\nnature. Major U.S. financial institutions interact with market infrastructures\naround the world. The PFMIs have established a rigorous set of internationally\nagreed upon standards for the quality and quantity of loss-absorbing resources and\nliquidity, governance, risk management, stress testing, recovery and orderly wind-\ndown, and other key areas.\nI believe that there has been reasonably good progress in implementing these\nreforms here in the United States. For example, according to the Financial\nStability Board, over 70 percent of new U.S. interest rate and credit derivatives are\nnow centrally cleared.4 And the Federal Reserve and other U.S. regulatory\nagencies have recently announced final margin rules for uncleared derivatives as\nwell, which should enhance the resilience of trading that still occurs outside of\ncentral clearing.5\n3 Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems and Technical Committee of the International Organization of\nSecurities Commissions (2012), “Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures,” final report, April,\nwww.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d101a.pdf.\n4See Financial Stability Board (2015), “OTC Derivatives Market Reforms: Ninth Progress Report on\nImplementation” (Basel, Switzerland: FSB, July), www.financialstabilityboard.org/wp-content/uploads/OTC-\nDerivatives-Ninth-July-2015-Progress-Report.pdf\n5 See www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/bcreg20151030b1.pdf\n3\n\nBut there is still plenty of work left to do. CCPs are implementing the\nPFMIs under the oversight of national regulators; clearing members have been\nvocal commentators on this process. To assure that the standards are consistently\nimplemented across jurisdictions and across FMIs, CPMI and IOSCO are\nconducting joint reviews of the risk-management practices of a range of global\nderivatives-clearing CCPs. Working in conjunction with the Basel Committee on\nBanking Supervision and the Financial Stability Board (FSB), they have also set\nout a detailed work plan for further enhancing the resilience, recovery planning and\nresolvability of CCPs.\nEarlier this year, CPMI-IOSCO conducted surveys of more than 30 of the\nmost systemically important CCPs regarding their stress testing, margin, recovery\nplanning, and loss allocation frameworks. The survey responses have now been\nreceived and are being analyzed. I expect that these exercises will result in more\ngranular guidance to CCPs covering a wide set of operational areas, further helping\nto ensure consistency of implementation of the PFMIs and market infrastructure\nresilience.\nFurther work on resolution is also necessary. The FSB has conducted a\nsurvey on CCP resolution regimes and resolution planning within its membership,\nand found that many jurisdictions are still in the process of developing resolution\n4\n\nregimes. As the reform process moves forward, this will be an important area of\nfocus.\nAll of these efforts are directly aimed at strengthening FMIs. But the\nstrength and resilience of a CCP ultimately depends on the strength and resilience\nof its clearing members. I’d now like to shift focus to the relationship between\nthese market utilities and the institutions that use them.\nBarring an operational event, CCPs only face credit or liquidity risk when\none of their members fails to make a payment when due. Thus, one effective way\nto make a CCP safer is to make its members safer. In that sense, the post-crisis\nreforms that have greatly strengthened our largest and most systemically important\nbanking institutions have directly benefitted CCPs and other FMIs.\nWhile requiring bank holding companies and their associated broker-dealers\nto be better capitalized and hold more liquid assets has unquestionably made them\nsafer, it has also raised their balance sheet costs and thereby created incentives to\nscale back on less profitable business lines. Clearing has traditionally been a low\nmargin business, and broker-dealers have often offered these services to clients in\nthe belief that doing so may lead to more profitable business. In the new\nenvironment, broker dealers are reconsidering this model, and may reduce services\nto smaller clients or move to an agency model with higher fees.\n5\n\nBanks and broker-dealers serve not only as clearing members of CCPs, but\nalso as liquidity providers and as custodians of their cash and securities. CCPs\ntypically have lines of credit with banks and other arrangements for secured credit\nto meet their potential liquidity needs. The higher cost of funding for large\nfinancial institutions has made these liquidity arrangements substantially more\nexpensive and more difficult to obtain. Given the balance sheet costs involved,\nfinancial institutions may also be less willing to hold cash deposits on behalf of\ntheir CCP clients.\nThese considerations suggest that there will be a period of adjustment as\nfirms and market infrastructures adapt their business models to the new regulatory\nlandscape. This is not necessarily a cause for alarm. To some extent, these\nadjustments are desirable. Liquidity risk seems to have been systematically\nunderpriced before the crisis. Firms are now much more focused on both\nmanaging and more accurately pricing this risk. It is also appropriate that the\npricing of a bank’s services accurately reflect the costs and profitability of different\nbusiness lines, which should lead to a more efficient allocation of resources.\nOne area where market participants are actively searching for new business\nmodels is the repo market, where there are currently several private initiatives for\ngreater central clearing. Expanded repo clearing could potentially bring a range of\nbenefits, including greater opportunities for netting and related reductions in\n6\n\nbalance sheet costs for dealers affiliated with a bank holding company. The\nevolution of repo markets and central clearing can serve to illustrate both the\npotential benefits and the complexities that arise as the market seeks new\ninfrastructure models.\nRepo Clearing\nThe U.S. repo market is composed of several segments, as illustrated in\nFigure 3. Dealers are at the center of the figure and operate in all five of the\nsegments shown. In the bilateral market (segments 1 through 3), participants often\nimpose narrow restrictions on the specific securities eligible for collateral. In this\nportion of the market, cash providers tend to be professional investors such as asset\nmanagers (segment 1), or the securities dealers themselves. Cash borrowers\ninclude prime brokerage clients (segment 3). Securities dealers may also borrow\ncash in this market, or may borrow it and then redistribute it to other dealers\n(segment 2).\nThe tri-party repo market (segments 4 and 5) is used to finance general\ncollateral pools rather than specific securities, and trades in this portion of the\nmarket are settled on the books of the two clearing banks, Bank of New York\n7\n\nMellon and JP Morgan Chase. 6 Money market mutual funds and securities lenders\nare among the most prominent cash providers in segment 4, while securities\ndealers are the primary borrowers of cash. Dealers may use this cash to fund their\nown portfolios; they may also lend it to other dealers in the general collateral\nfinance (GCF) repo market (segment 5). This segment is cleared through the Fixed\nIncome Clearing Corporation, and is currently the only segment of the market that\nis centrally cleared.\nBased on figures from September 2015, the size of the tri-party repo market,\nsegment 4, was approximately $1.5 trillion and the GCF market (segment 5) was\napproximately $300 billion. The general lack of data on bilateral repo activity\nmakes it difficult to know the precise size of each individual segment of that\nmarket, but bilateral repo and securities lending taken together accounted for\napproximately $1.7 trillion in outstanding activity.7\nGiven its vast scale and position at the center of the wholesale finance\nmarkets, repo is without doubt a critical activity. Repo is a key source of financing\nfor a wide range of firms, and an important “safe asset” for investors. The GCF\n6 General collateral or GC repo involve repo transactions secured by a range of Treasury or other assets that are\naccepted as collateral by the majority of intermediaries in the repo market. GC repo assets are high quality and\nliquid, but not subject to exceptional specific demand.\n7 These estimates are based on the methodology described in Adam Copeland, Isaac Davis, Eric LeSueur, and\nAntoine Martin (2012), “Mapping and Sizing the U.S. Repo Market,”\nlibertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2012/06/mapping-and-sizing-the-us-repo-market.html#.VkiGUCtQpps\n8\n\nsegment, although modest in size compared to the overall market, is a key source\nof financing for smaller dealers, particularly in times of financial stress. The\navailability of repo funding for a diverse range of participants supports market\nliquidity by enabling them to make markets in Treasury and agency securities.\nCCPs themselves also rely on these markets, often using repo to earn interest on\ncash collateral and counting on access to repo markets in their liquidity planning.\nThe FSB has called on authorities to “consider the pros and cons of\nbroadening participation in repo clearing arrangements.”8 What are the potential\nbenefits of greater clearing in this market? In addition to the potential netting\nbenefits I mentioned earlier, a CCP typically performs three other beneficial\neconomic functions: 1) a reduction in the potential cost of counterparty default\ncoming from the orderly liquidation of a defaulting member’s positions, 2) greater\ntransparency and a reduction in operational risk from enhanced reporting\nrequirements and standardization of data, and 3) the sharing of risk among\nmembers of the CCP through some mutualization of the costs of a counterparty’s\ndefault. I’ll discuss each of these in turn.\nOrderly liquidation\n8 Financial Stability Board (2013), “Strengthening Oversight and Regulation of Shadow Banking: Policy Framework\nfor Addressing Shadow Banking Risks in Securities Lending and Repos” (Basel, Switzerland: FSB, August),\nwww.financialstabilityboard.org/wp-content/uploads/r_130829b.pdf\n9\n\nWhile repos are generally a low risk, low margin business, they proved to be\nvulnerable to runs during the financial crisis, when concerns of possible defaults by\nlarge financial firms led to a sudden withdrawal of funding from repo markets. As\na result, a reform project led by my colleagues at the Federal Reserve Bank of New\nYork produced a set of measures that have sharply reduced the amount of intraday\ncredit and improved risk management practices in the tri-party repo market. These\nreforms have made the overall structure of that market much safer, and\nsignificantly reduced the likelihood of a borrower default. But if a default were to\ntake place, some counterparties, particularly those unwilling or unable to hold\nsizable positions, would retain strong incentives to sell assets quickly regardless of\nthe price received.\nA repo CCP could help to address this “fire sale” risk. CCPs have rule-\nbased processes to dispose of the portfolio of a defaulted member. CCPs can\ntransfer positions to solvent broker-dealers, or hedge positions and auction them\noff over time.\nGreater transparency and reduction in operational risk\nCentral clearing could also improve transparency and bring a reduction in\noperational risks. CCPs are in position to aggregate trade information from all\nclearing members, and thus to monitor and manage counterparty and market-risk\n10\n\nexposure better than individual members. As I noted earlier, we have relatively\nlittle information on bilateral repo activity, so greater clearing in this segment\ncould have significant benefits in helping to aggregate market information. CCPs\nalso provide participants with central confirmation of trades and netting of\npositions, allowing their members to reduce operational risk of post-trade\nprocessing.\nRisk sharing\nIn terms of risk sharing, when a CCP clearing member defaults, any\nresulting losses are shared among the surviving members and the CCP itself\naccording to pre-agreed rules. Members of a CCP contribute to a default fund that\ncan be used to absorb these losses. The degree of risk sharing depends on the\ndesign of the CCP, but transparent rules help to create an orderly, predictable\nprocess for managing a default.9\nFinding a way forward\nThe potential benefits of proposals for expanded central clearing of repo in\nU.S. markets are undergoing a period of evaluation by regulatory authorities and\n9 While details vary, in a waterfall, to cover losses resulting from a defaulting member, a CCP typically first uses the\nfinancial resources of the defaulting member, including margin and default fund contributions. If losses still exist,\nthen the CCP uses its capital (skin in the game), followed by the default fund contributions of surviving members.\nFurther losses could be absorbed by additional assessments on surviving members.\n11\n\nmarket participants alike. For these proposals, it will not be a simple matter to find\na way forward while meeting the heightened regulatory expectations I mentioned\nearlier. The liquidity requirement of the PFMIs will present a particular challenge\n-- a CCP must have sufficient liquid resources to meet its payment obligations on\ntime in extreme but plausible market conditions, including in the event of a default\nof that participant whose default would generate the largest obligations.10 In repo\ntrading, unlike in swaps, the full notional principal amount is exchanged at the\nbeginning and end of the trade. As a result, the liquidity requirements for repo\nclearing will be quite high.\nAnother key question is how great the opportunities for netting actually are,\nin light of the dominance of “one-way flows” in U.S. repo markets. Netting for\nbalance sheet purposes is only permitted for offsetting trades with the same\nmaturity and counterparty.11 The many repo market participants who act as either\nlenders or borrowers – but not both – have little opportunity for netting. Netting\nopportunities are therefore more likely to occur in the interdealer market, so it is\nnot surprising that the current repo CCP operates in this segment of the market.12\n10 Principle 7 in the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures, April 2012. Committee on Payment and\nSettlement Systems and Technical Committee of the International Organization of Securities Commissions.\nwww.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d101a.pdf\n11 See Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 41, “Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain\nRepurchase and Reverse Purchase Agreements,”\nwww.fasb.org/jsp/FASB/Document_C/DocumentPage?cid=1175801626916&acceptedDisclaimer=true\n12 Repo CCPs mainly exist in markets where the underlying flows provide large-scale opportunities for multilateral\nnetting. For example, CCPs play a large role in the European and the Canadian repo markets, which are primarily\ninterbank markets.\n12\n\nFurther gains in netting could arise if clearing expanded to the bilateral market or if\nsome of the larger end users in the tri-party market, for example money market\nmutual funds or hedge funds, were able to gain access to the CCP. This could pose\nits own complications, however, as some of these institutions may be unwilling or\nlegally unable to engage in the risk mutualization that exists in most clearing\nmodels.\nConclusion\nDespite these challenges, it is worth noting that, in the right setting, central\nclearing can produce significant benefits, including reduced credit and liquidity\nrisks; improved default management and reduced risk of fire sales; greater\ntransparency; and improved risk management. Of course, this does not mean that\nevery product should be cleared, or that every type of repo trading would benefit\nfrom clearing. In my view, clearing should be limited to those assets that are\nhighly liquid and expected to remain so even in severely stressed market\nconditions. While any model for expanded repo clearing will have to satisfy\nstringent regulatory requirements, regulators should be open to emerging clearing\nsolutions where they provide substantial benefits and can meet these standards.\nThis may be particularly true for repo trading in government and agency securities,\nsince new regulations require financial institutions to hold such high-quality\ncollateral under the assumption that it can be quickly converted to cash. It is\n13\n\ntherefore important to consider ways to support their continued liquidity where\npossible.\n14\n\nFigure 1.

    "text": "For release on delivery\n11:40 a.m. EST (8:40 a.m. PST)\nNovember 4, 2013\nAdvanced Economy Monetary Policy and Emerging Market Economies\nRemarks by\nJerome H. Powell\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco 2013 Asia Economic Policy Conference:\nProspects for Asia and the Global Economy\nSan Francisco, California\nNovember 4, 2013\n\nI appreciate this opportunity to offer a few thoughts on the effects of advanced\neconomy monetary policies on emerging market economies (EMEs)--an issue of great\nimportance for Asia and the global economy.1 Since the global financial crisis, the\nFederal Reserve has sought to strengthen the U.S. economic recovery through highly\naccommodative monetary policy. But my colleagues and I are keenly aware that the U.S.\neconomy operates in a global environment. We understand that America’s prosperity is\nbound up with the prosperity of other nations, including emerging market nations.\nEmerging market economies have long grappled with the challenges posed by\nlarge and volatile cross-border capital flows. The past several decades are replete with\nepisodes of strong capital inflows being followed by abrupt reversals, all too often\nresulting in financial crisis and economic distress.2 Some of this volatility no doubt\nreflects the evolution of strengths and vulnerabilities within the EMEs themselves.\nIn recent years, renewed attention has been placed on the role of advanced\neconomies and of common or global factors in driving capital movements.3 In particular,\nmany observers have singled out monetary policy in the United States and other\nadvanced economies as a key driver. As advanced economies pursued highly\naccommodative monetary policies and EMEs subsequently received strong capital\ninflows, reflecting investors’ pursuit of higher returns, concerns were expressed that a\nflood of liquidity would overwhelm emerging markets, drive up asset prices to\nunsustainable levels, set off credit booms, and thus sow the seeds of future crises. More\n1 I would like to thank Trevor Reeve for his assistance in the preparation of these remarks.\n2 Notable examples of such crises include Latin America in the early 1980s, Mexico in 1994, the Asian\nfinancial crises beginning in 1997, Russia in 1998, Argentina in 2001, and Brazil in 2002. See Broner and\nothers (2013), Forbes and Warnock (2012), Ghosh and others (2012), and Reinhart and Reinhart (2009) for\ndiscussions of large capital flow movements.\n3 An earlier literature also examined the role of “push” and “pull” factors in explaining international capital\nflows. Examples include Calvo and others (1993, 1996), Fernandez-Arias (1996), and Chuhan and others\n(1998).\n\n- 2 -\nrecently, there have been concerns about potential financial and economic dislocations\nassociated with the advanced economies’ eventual exit from highly accommodative\npolicies.\nIn my remarks today, I will discuss the extent to which monetary policy in the\nadvanced economies--and in the United States in particular--has contributed to changes in\nemerging market capital flows and asset prices, and I will place this discussion in a\nbroader context of economic and financial linkages among economies. I will also address\nthe risks that EMEs may face from the eventual normalization of monetary policy in the\nadvanced economies.\nThe heightened attention to advanced economies’ monetary policies and the\npotential spillovers to EMEs is understandable in light of the unprecedented policy steps\ntaken in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. The severity of the crisis and the\nchallenge of a slow recovery required central banks in the advanced economies and\nelsewhere to take aggressive action in order to fulfill their mandates. In the United\nStates, the Federal Reserve is bound by its dual mandate to pursue price stability and\nmaximum employment. In following that mandate, the Fed cut the federal funds rate to\nits effective lower bound in late 2008 and then turned to two less conventional policy\ntools to provide additional monetary accommodation. The first is forward guidance on\nthe federal funds rate. By lowering private-sector expectations for the future path of\nshort-term rates, forward guidance has reduced longer-term interest rates and raised asset\nprices, thereby leading to more accommodative financial conditions. The second tool is\nlarge scale asset purchases, which likewise increase policy accommodation by reducing\nlonger-term interest rates and raising asset prices.\n\n- 3 -\nThe Federal Reserve has not been alone in implementing unconventional\nmonetary policies. The Bank of England has also engaged in substantial asset purchases\nand recently introduced explicit forward guidance for its policy rate. The Bank of Japan,\na pioneer in the use of unconventional policy, has recently embarked on an ambitious\nasset purchase program to combat deflation. And the European Central Bank (ECB)\nsubstantially extended its liquidity provision by offering unlimited longer-term\nrefinancing operations. The ECB also purchased some securities in distressed markets,\nand recently indicated that it expects interest rates to remain low for an extended period.\nThus, since the end of the crisis, central banks in the advanced economies have adopted\nsimilar policies to promote recovery and price stability.\nWhile a great deal of attention has focused on unconventional policy actions,\nespecially asset purchases, these policies appear to affect financial conditions and the real\neconomy in much the same way as conventional interest rate policy. Indeed, recent\nresearch suggests that adjustments in policy rates and unconventional policies have\nsimilar cross-border effects on asset prices and economic outcomes.4 If that is so, then\nthe overall stance of policy accommodation matters more here than the particular form of\neasing. Moreover, neither conventional nor unconventional monetary policy actions are\nshocks that come out of the blue. Instead, they are the policies undertaken by central\nbanks to offset the adverse shocks that have restrained our economies. Thus, any\nspillovers from monetary policy actions must be evaluated against the consequences of\nfailing to respond to these adverse shocks.\n4 See Glick and Leduc (2013), IMF (2013a), Moore and others (2013), Rosa (2012), and Wu and Xia\n(2013). Recent research by Federal Reserve Board staff finds that reductions in U.S. interest rates for any\nreason--whether caused by monetary policy or other factors--have typically been associated with declines\nin EME interest rates and appreciation of EME currencies. Moore and others (2013) document a similar\nhistorical relationship.\n\n- 4 -\nIn a world of global trade and integrated capital markets, it is natural for\neconomic and financial shocks and policy actions to be transmitted across borders.\nSpillovers from advanced-economy monetary policies are to be expected.5 In theory,\nwhen advanced economies ease monetary policy in response to a contractionary shock,\ntheir interest rates will decline, prompting investors to rebalance their portfolios toward\nhigher-yielding assets. Some of this rebalancing will occur domestically, but some\ninvestment will also move abroad, resulting in capital flows to EMEs. In response, EME\ncurrencies should tend to appreciate against those of the advanced economies, and EME\nasset prices should rise. Conversely, a tightening of advanced economy monetary policy\nin response to a stronger economy should lead these movements to reverse; that is,\ntightening should reduce capital flows to EMEs and diminish upward pressure on EME\ncurrencies and asset prices.\nAre these basic relationships apparent in the data? The left side of chart 1 shows\nan index of EME local-currency sovereign bond yields along with a roughly similar\nmaturity U.S. Treasury yield. The line on the right is the differential between the two,\nplotted against net inflows of private capital to a selection of EMEs, shown by the bars.\nIf interest rates were the main driver of capital flows, these two series ought to move in a\nsimilar fashion. At times, this is indeed the case: From mid-2009 to early 2011, the\ninterest rate differential and EME capital inflows rose together. But the overall\nrelationship is not particularly tight. In early 2007, capital flows to EMEs were quite\nstrong even with a low interest rate differential. And in mid-2011, capital inflows\nstepped down even as the interest rate differential remained elevated. As I will discuss in\n5 The U.S. economy is affected by spillovers from abroad as well, and these are very much a part of our\npolicymaking environment.\n\n- 5 -\na moment, the lack of a tight relationship between capital flows and interest rates\nsuggests that other factors also have been important.\nEven though interest-rate differentials and capital inflows do not always move in\nthe same direction, numerous empirical studies have shown that interest rates do in fact\nhelp explain capital flows once other determinants of these flows are also taken into\naccount.6 In particular, when U.S. rates decline relative to those in EMEs, private capital\nflows to EMEs tend to rise, consistent with investors rebalancing toward higher-yielding\nassets. In a similar vein, event studies have shown that the Federal Reserve’s policy\nannouncements, including those related to asset purchases, have been associated with\ncapital flows to EMEs as well as upward movements in EME currencies and asset\nprices.7 But the role of monetary policy in driving capital flows and the effects of those\nflows on EMEs should not be overstated. In this regard, I will offer two considerations.\nFirst, many factors affect capital flows to EMEs, not just the stance of advanced\neconomy monetary policy. Differences in growth prospects across countries and the\nassociated differences in expected investment returns are important factors.8 Chart 2\nshows the growth rate of real GDP for EMEs and advanced economies. Given their stage\nof development and demographic profile, EMEs should grow faster than advanced\neconomies on a trend basis. As shown by the line in the right panel, EME growth has, in\nfact, consistently outpaced that of the advanced economies. In addition, the bounceback\nof the EMEs from the global financial crisis widened this differential even more,\n6 See, for example, Ahmed and Zlate (2013), Bluedorn and others (2013), Fratzcher and others (2013),\nGhosh and others (2012), and IMF (2011).\n7 See Chen and others (2012), Fratzscher and others (2013), Hausman and Wongswan (2011), IMF\n(2013b), and Moore and others (2013).\n8 See Ahmed and Zlate (2013), Forbes and Warnock (2012), Fratzcher and others (2013), and Ghosh and\nothers (2012).\n\n- 6 -\nalthough the gap has diminished more recently as growth in the EMEs has slowed.\nMoreover, investing in EMEs has become more attractive as many EMEs have improved\ntheir macroeconomic policies and institutional frameworks over recent decades; growth\ndifferentials may partly be reflecting these improvements. As is evident in the right-hand\nchart, the relationship between the growth differential and capital inflows to EMEs seems\nto be quite strong. In particular, the rise in capital flows following the global financial\ncrisis coincided with stronger relative growth performance in EMEs. And in 2011,\ncapital inflows diminished along with the growth differential.\nAnother key driver of EME capital flows is global attitude toward risk. Swings in\nsentiment between “risk-on” and “risk-off” have led investors to reposition across asset\nclasses, resulting in corresponding movements in capital flows.9 Indeed, as shown in\nchart 3, the most common measure of uncertainty and the market price of volatility--the\nVIX--is strongly correlated with net inflows into EMEs. Although the causes of\nmovements in global risk sentiment are uncertain, the ebb and flow of potential crises and\npolicy responses, such as we experienced during the European crisis, are clearly\nimportant. Of course, movements in risk sentiment may not be fully independent of\nmonetary policy. An interesting line of research has begun to consider how changes in\nmonetary policy itself may affect risk sentiment. For example, some studies indicate that\nan easing of U.S. monetary policy tends to lower volatility (as measured by the VIX),\nincrease leverage of financial intermediaries, and boost EME capital inflows and\ncurrencies.10\n9 See Ahmed and Zlate (2013), Bluedorn and others (2013), Forbes and Warnock (2012), and IMF (2011).\n10 See Bruno and Shin (2013) and Rey (2013).\n\n- 7 -\nA second point to bear in mind when assessing monetary policy spillovers is that\nexpansionary policies in the advanced economies are not beggar-thy-neighbor; in other\nwords, they do not undermine exports from EMEs. In recent decades, some EMEs have\nsuccessfully pursued an export-led growth strategy, and policymakers in those economies\nhave sometimes expressed concern that their exports will be unduly restrained as\naccommodative policies in the advanced economies lead their currencies to appreciate.\nHowever, as shown in chart 4, although EME currencies bounced back from their lows\nduring the global financial crisis--when global investors fled from assets they perceived\nto be risky--for many EMEs real exchange rates have moved sideways or have even\ndeclined over the past two years. Some of this weakness may reflect the foreign\nexchange market intervention and capital controls that policymakers used to staunch the\nrise in their currencies.\nBut even if advanced economy monetary policies were to put upward pressure on\nEME currencies, the consequent drag on their exports must be weighed against the\npositive effects of stronger demand in the advanced economies. According to\nsimulations of the Federal Reserve Board’s econometric models of the global economy,\nthese two effects roughly offset each other, suggesting that accommodative monetary\npolicies in the advanced economies have not reduced output and exports in the EMEs.11\nIndeed, this view seems to be supported by recent experience, as the U.S. current account\nbalance has remained fairly stable since the end of the global financial crisis. Over the\nlonger run, advanced economy policy actions that strengthen global growth and global\ntrade will benefit the EMEs as well.\n11 See Bernanke (2013).\n\n- 8 -\nA particularly important consideration regarding spillovers from accommodative\nmonetary policies in the advanced economies is the extent to which such policies\ncontribute to financial stability risks in the EMEs. Because many EMEs have financial\nsectors that are relatively small, large capital inflows may foster asset price bubbles and a\ntoo-rapid expansion of credit. These are serious concerns, irrespective of the relative\nimportance of monetary policies in the advanced economies in driving these flows.\nWhile the picture is a mixed one and some markets show signs of froth, indicators of\nfinancial stability do not seem to show widespread imbalances.12\nFor example, EME equity prices, shown in chart 5, plunged during the global\nfinancial crisis, rebounded thereafter, but then generally flattened out or even declined.\nThere are exceptions, of course, such as Indonesia, whose stock market soared until\nearlier this year. But in aggregate, EME stock prices remain below their pre-crisis peak,\nwhereas the S&P 500 is well above its own pre-crisis peak.\nChart 6 portrays the rise in credit to the domestic nonfinancial private sector as a\nshare of GDP from its pre-crisis level. For some EMEs, the rise in credit does not seem\nout of line with historical trends, but some economies have experienced potentially\nworrisome increases. Credit growth in China is particularly noteworthy, but this does not\nseem to be the result of accommodative monetary policies in the advanced economies.\nMuch of the rise took place in the aftermath of the crisis, in large part reflecting policy-\ndriven stimulus to support economic recovery. In addition, China’s relatively closed\ncapital account limits the extent to which domestic credit conditions are influenced by\ndevelopments abroad, including changes in advanced economy monetary policy.\nIncreases in credit in some other economies, notably Brazil, have also been driven to a\n12 See IMF (2013a, 2013b).\n\n- 9 -\nsignificant degree by policy actions to support aggregate demand. And, of course, EMEs\nhave policy tools to limit the expansion of credit.\nAnother area of potential concern is excessive valuations in property markets.\nChart 7 displays inflation-adjusted house prices for several Asian economies. The most\nstriking increases have occurred in Hong Kong, which, through its open capital account\nand essentially fixed exchange rate, is tied most directly to U.S. financial conditions. Of\ncourse, the degree of Hong Kong’s exposure to U.S. financial conditions is a policy\nchoice, and other factors have also contributed to the run-up in its property prices. House\nprices have also resumed their rise in China. But, as with credit growth, this rise seems to\nreflect domestic developments as opposed to spillovers from global financial conditions.\nIn light of these potential financial stability concerns, it is encouraging that EME\npolicymakers have devoted substantial effort since the Asian financial crisis of the late\n1990s to bolster the resilience of their banking systems. Banks in many EMEs have\nrobust earnings and solid capital buffers.13 Compared with past experience, emerging\nmarket banking systems also generally enjoy improved management and a proactive\napproach by authorities to mitigate risks. Nevertheless, in an environment of volatile\nglobal markets, regulators should guard against the buildup of vulnerabilities, such as\nexcessive dependence on wholesale and external funding, declining asset quality, and\nforeign currency mismatches.\nTo summarize my discussion so far, EMEs clearly face challenges from volatile\ncapital flows and the attendant moves in asset prices. Accommodative monetary policies\nin the advanced economies have likely contributed to some of these flow and price\npressures, and may also have contributed to the buildup of some financial vulnerabilities\n13 See IMF (2013a).\n\n- 10 -\nin certain emerging markets. That said, other factors appear to have been even more\nimportant. Moreover, expansionary monetary policies in the advanced economies have\nsupported global growth to the benefit of advanced and emerging economies alike.\nTurning to the risks and policy challenges going forward, much attention has\nfocused on potential effects in EMEs when recovery prompts the United States and other\nadvanced economies to begin the gradual process of returning policy to a normal stance.\nAs events over the summer demonstrated, even the discussion of such a policy shift may\nbe accompanied by considerable volatility.\nAs shown in chart 8, from May through August, U.S. Treasury yields rose\nsubstantially as market participants reassessed the future course of U.S. monetary policy.\nIn response, EME bond and equity funds experienced very large outflows, as shown by\nthe bars. EME yields rose as well, in some cases by more than those on Treasury\nsecurities, and many EME currencies depreciated. The magnitude of these market\nresponses may have been amplified by the carry-trade strategies that many investors had\nin place; these strategies were designed to take advantage of interest rate differentials and\nappeared profitable as long as EME interest rate differentials remained wide and EME\nexchange rates remained stable or were expected to appreciate. When anticipations of\nFed tapering led to higher U.S. interest rates and higher market volatility, these trades\nmay have been quickly unwound, engendering particularly sharp declines in EME\nexchange rates and asset prices.\nThese developments, however, do not appear to have been driven solely by\nperceptions of U.S. monetary policy. As I noted earlier, GDP growth in many EMEs has\nfallen from the pace of previous years, which may have led investors to rethink their\n\n- 11 -\ninvestment choices. Additionally, it appears that the retreat from emerging markets\nreflected a change in global risk sentiment, as investors focused on vulnerabilities in\nEMEs following a period of complacency. Asset prices have fallen considerably more in\neconomies with large current account deficits, high inflation, and fiscal problems than in\ncountries with stronger fundamentals. For example, as shown in chart 9, changes in EME\nexchange rates and interest rates since April have been correlated with current account\ndeficits. In general, economies with larger current account deficits experienced greater\ndepreciations of their currencies and larger increases in their bond yields. Thus, while a\nreassessment of U.S. monetary policy may have triggered the recent retrenchment from\nEMEs, investor concerns about underlying vulnerabilities appear to have amplified the\nreaction.\nWhatever their source, large capital outflows from EMEs can pose challenges for\nEME policymakers by simultaneously producing significant currency depreciation, asset\nprice deflation, and inflationary pressures. In such cases, EME central banks are in the\ndifficult position of judging whether to tighten policy at the same time that demand is\nweakening. It is notable that some central banks with stronger records on price stability\nhave been able to avoid tightening whereas others have been forced to raise rates to\ndefend price stability in the face of domestic weakness.\nMonetary policy in the United States is likely to remain highly accommodative\nfor some time, as our economy fights to overcome the remaining headwinds from the\nglobal financial crisis. As our economic recovery continues, however, the time will come\nto gradually reduce the pace of asset purchases and eventually bring those purchases to a\n\n- 12 -\nstop. The timing of this moderation in the pace of purchases is necessarily uncertain, as it\ndepends on the evolution of the economy.\nWhile moderating the pace of purchases and the eventual increase in the federal\nfunds rate may well affect capital flows, interest rates and asset prices in EMEs, the\noverall macroeconomic effects need not be disruptive. First, tightening will in all\nlikelihood occur in the context of a more firmly established economic recovery in the\nUnited States so that any adverse effects on EME financial conditions should be buffered\nby the beneficial effects of higher external demand. Second, although conditions vary\nfrom country to country, on the whole, EMEs exhibit greater resilience than they did in\nprior decades, reflecting, among other factors, more flexible exchange rates, greater\nstocks of international reserves, stronger fiscal positions, and better regulated and more\nconservatively managed banking systems.\nEMEs have policy tools to help manage any negative externalities that may arise,\nand recent developments provide additional rationale for them to redouble their efforts to\nbolster their resiliency.14 Reducing vulnerabilities, improving policy frameworks, and\nsafeguarding the financial sector will go a long way toward making EMEs more robust to\na wide range of shocks, not just those that may arise from changes in monetary policy in\nthe advanced economies. Global investors should also learn from the experience of this\nsummer, when it became clear that unwinding leveraged carry trades can be difficult in\nan environment of lower liquidity.\nAs for advanced economies, policymakers should move gradually to restore\nnormal policies only as their economic recoveries are more firmly established, consistent\nwith their mandates. In addition, policymakers should communicate as clearly as\n14 See Sanchez (2013).\n\n- 13 -\npossible about their policy aims and intentions in order to limit the odds of policy\nsurprises and a consequent sharp adjustment in financial markets in response. Indeed, my\ncolleagues on the FOMC and I are committed to just such an approach.\nIn closing, the Federal Reserve’s mandate, like those of other central banks, is\nfocused on the pursuit of domestic policy objectives. This focus is entirely appropriate.\nYet, experience has shown that the fortunes of the U.S. economy are deeply intertwined\nwith those of the rest of the world. Economic prospects for the United States are\nimportantly influenced by the course of the world economy, and, by the same token,\nprosperity around the globe depends to a significant extent on a strong U.S. economy. In\norder for the Federal Reserve to fulfill its dual mandate of price stability and maximum\nemployment, we must take account of these international linkages. Indeed, the Federal\nReserve has a long and varied history of doing so, including our actions during the global\nfinancial crisis. There is every reason to expect that to continue.15\nThank you. I’ll be happy to take a few questions or comments.\n15 See Eichengreen (2013).\n\n- 14 -\nReferences\nAhmed, Shaghil, and Andrei Zlate (2013). “Capital Flows to Emerging Market\nEconomies: A Brave New World?” International Finance Discussion Papers\n1081.

    "text": "For release on delivery\n10:50 a.m. EDT\nAugust 3, 2015\nStructure and Liquidity in Treasury Markets\nRemarks by\nJerome H. Powell\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe Brookings Institution\nWashington, D.C.\nAugust 3, 2015\n\n- 1 -\nI’m very pleased to be here to discuss the current structure of the Treasury markets.1 My\ninvolvement with these markets dates back to the early 1990s, when I served as Under Secretary of\nthe Treasury for Finance. Some of you will recall the Salomon Brothers auction bidding scandal that\nbroke in the summer of 1991. That event required those of us with oversight responsibilities to do a\nthorough evaluation of the structure of the primary Treasury market, and ultimately to propose a\nseries of reforms.2 As part of that process, we put together a public conference to consider further\nreforms to Treasury auction procedures, with the participation of regulators, academics, and the\nfinancial sector. Some of the ideas that came out of that conference eventually led to changes in the\nway primary auctions were conducted, changes that I believe were beneficial to the efficiency and\nintegrity of the Treasury market. The issues we are discussing today relate to the secondary market\nrather than to the auctions. Although the Treasury market remains deep and resilient, there are\nnonetheless reasonable questions as to whether market functioning can be improved.\nThe events of October 15 last year have been folded into the more general debate about\nmarket liquidity across a number of markets. I take the concerns about a decline in market liquidity\nseriously. Hard evidence on the level of liquidity in secondary Treasury markets is mixed, with some\nmeasures at or above pre-crisis levels and some suggesting a reduced ability to buy or sell large\npositions without material price effect--a reasonable definition of liquidity.3 It is also possible that\n1 These remarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve Board or the\nFederal Open Market Committee. References to the “Treasury markets” refer to the interdealer cash and futures\nmarkets, unless otherwise specified.\n2 See Department of the Treasury, Securities and Exchange Commission, and Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System (1992), Joint Report on the Government Securities Market (Washington: Government Printing Office,\nJanuary), www.treasury.gov/resource-center/fin-mkts/Documents/gsr92rpt.pdf. The formation of an interagency\nworking group, which in July 2015 published a joint staff report on the events of October 15, 2014\n(http://ipv6.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Documents/Joint_Staff_Report_Treasury_10-15-2014.pdf), was\namong the reforms noted in the 1992 report.\n3 The joint staff report on the U.S. Treasury market on October 15, 2014 (see note 2), includes measures of benchmark\norder book depth in the cash market that have declined since 2013 although they are comparable to levels in the early\n2000s. Measured trade sizes in both cash and futures markets are lower than levels in the early 2000s.\n\n- 2 -\nliquidity may be more prone to disappearing at times of stress. On October 15, for example, market\ndepth declined sharply, and we saw a sudden spike in prices that was without precedent for a period\nwith little relevant news. Other events--such as the 2013 “taper tantrum,” the “bund tantrum” last\nspring, and the sharp moves on March 18 in the euro-dollar exchange rate--all broadly show the same\npattern: rapidly diminishing liquidity, and large price moves for a given quantum of news.4 But the\ncauses and implications of these events are unclear. Is this the new normal? We don’t know. Current\nmacroeconomic and market conditions are unprecedented in many respects. For now, what we have\nis a small number of broadly similar events that bear careful consideration.\nMost of these considerations apply across markets, but they are particularly important here\nbecause of the crucial role that Treasury securities play within the global financial system. In\naddition to serving the financing needs of the U.S. government, Treasury markets are important for\nthe conduct of monetary policy. Treasuries serve as high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) for a wide\nrange of financial institutions, including dealers in the Treasury market, and as collateral in myriad\ntransactions conducted bilaterally and through clearing houses and exchanges. Treasury securities\nare a global reserve asset, and Treasury markets are a key vehicle through which market participants\nmanage their interest-rate risk. The integrity and continued liquidity of the Treasury markets affect\nnearly everyone.\nTreasury markets have undergone important changes over the years. The footprints of the\nmajor dealers, who have long played the role of market makers, are in several respects smaller than\nthey were in the pre-crisis period. Dealers cite a number of reasons for this change, including\n4 Between April and June of this year, interest rates on longer-dated German bunds rose sharply and amid considerable\nvolatility on certain days, an event that observers coined the “bund tantrum.” On March 18, 2015, shortly after 4 p.m.\nEDT and two hours after the release of the March FOMC monetary policy statement, the euro rose over 3 percent\nagainst the dollar in a four-minute period and then reversed most of its gain over the next three minutes.\n\n- 3 -\nreductions in their own risk appetite and the effects of post-crisis regulations. At the same time, the\nFederal Reserve and foreign owners (about half of which are foreign central banks) have increased\ntheir ownership to over two-thirds of outstanding Treasuries (up from 61 percent in 2004). Banks\nhave also increased their holdings of Treasuries to meet HQLA requirements. These holdings are\nless likely to turn over in secondary market trading, as the owners largely follow buy and hold\nstrategies.5 Another change is the increased presence of asset managers, which now hold a bigger\nshare of Treasuries as well. Mutual fund investors, who are accustomed to daily liquidity, now\nbeneficially own a greater share of Treasuries.\nPerhaps the most fundamental change in these markets is the move to electronic trading,\nwhich began in earnest about 15 years ago. It is hard to overstate the transformation in these markets.\nOnly two decades ago, the dealers who participated in primary Treasury auctions had to send\nrepresentatives, in person, to the offices of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to submit their\nbids on auction days. They dropped their paper bids into a box. The secondary market was a bit\nmore advanced. There were electronic systems for posting interdealer quotes in the cash market, and\nthe Globex platform had been introduced for futures. Still, most interdealer trades were conducted\nover the phone and futures trading was primarily conducted in the open pit.\nToday these markets are almost fully electronic. Interdealer trading in the cash Treasury\nmarket is conducted over electronic trading platforms.6 Thanks to advances in telecommunications\n5 In order to promote the smooth clearing of Treasury and agency securities, the Federal Reserve offers a securities\nlending program to primary dealers.\n6 Many automated trading firms are now able to directly access these platforms. There is also a sizable amount of\ntrading between dealers and their customers that does not take place on these platforms. While much of that trading is\nstill by phone, an appreciable share is also electronic.\n\n- 4 -\nand computing, the speed of trading has increased at least a million-fold.7 Advances in computing\nand faster access to trading platforms have also allowed new types of firms and trading strategies to\nenter the market. Algorithmic and high-frequency trading firms deploy a wide and diverse range of\nstrategies. In particular, the technologies and strategies that people associate with high frequency\ntrading are also regularly employed by broker-dealers, hedge funds, and even individual investors.\nCompared with the speed of trading 20 years ago, anyone can trade at high frequencies today, and\nso, to me, this transformation is more about technology than any one particular type of firm.\nGiven all these changes, we need to have a more nuanced discussion as to the state of the\nmarkets. Are there important market failures that are not likely to self-correct? If so, what are the\ncauses, and what are the costs and benefits of potential market-led or regulatory responses?\nSome observers point to post-crisis regulation as a key factor driving any decline or change\nin the nature of liquidity. Although regulation had little to do with the events of October 15, I would\nagree that it may be one factor driving recent changes in market making. Requiring that banks hold\nmuch higher capital and liquidity and rely less on wholesale short-term debt has raised funding costs.\nRegulation has also raised the cost of funding inventories through repurchase agreement (repo\nmarkets). Thus, regulation may have made market making less attractive to banks. But these same\nregulations have also materially lowered banks’ probabilities of default and the chances of another\nfinancial crisis like the last one, which severely constrained liquidity and did so much damage to our\neconomy. These regulations are new, and we should be willing to learn from experience, but their\nbasic goals--to make the core of the financial system safer and reduce systemic risk--are appropriate,\n7 Marcia Stigum (1990), in describing the secondary bond market, noted that trades could be completed in a matter of\nseconds. Currently, trading can occur at speeds below one microsecond. (See Marcia L. Stigum (1990), The Money\nMarket, 3rd ed. (Homewood, Ill.: Dow Jones-Irwin), p. 649.)\n\n- 5 -\nand we should be prepared to accept some increase in the cost of market making in order to meet\nthose goals.\nRegulation is only one of the factors--and clearly not the dominant one--behind the evolution\nin market making. As we have seen, markets were undergoing dramatic change long before the\nfinancial crisis. Technological change has allowed new types of trading firms to act as market makers\nfor a large and growing share of transactions, not just in equity and foreign exchange markets but\nalso in Treasury markets. As traditional dealers have lost market share, one way they have sought\nto remain competitive is by attempting to internalize their customer trades--essentially trying to\ncreate their own markets by finding matches between their customers who are seeking to buy and\nsell. Internalization allows these firms to capture more of the bid-ask spread, but it may also reduce\nliquidity in the public market. At the same time it does not eliminate the need for a public market,\nwhere price discovery mainly occurs, as dealers must place the orders that they cannot internalize\ninto that market.\nWhile the changes I’ve just discussed are unlikely to go away, I believe that markets will\nadapt to them over time. In the meantime, we have a responsibility to make sure that market and\nregulatory incentives appropriately encourage an evolution that will sustain market liquidity and\nfunctioning.\nIn thinking about market incentives, one observer has noted that trading rules and structures\nhave grown to matter crucially as trading speeds have increased--in her words, “At very fast\nspeeds, only the [market] microstructure matters.”8 Trading algorithms are, after all, simply a set\nof rules, and they will necessarily interact with and optimize against the rules of the trading\n8 See Maureen O’Hara (2014), “High Frequency Market Microstructure,” working paper, April, p. 2,\nwww2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/wbs/subjects/finance/fof2014/programme/maureen_ohara.pdf.\n\n- 6 -\nplatforms they operate on. If trading is at nanoseconds, there won’t be a lot of “fundamental” news\nto trade on or much time to formulate views about the long-run value of an asset; instead, trading at\nthese speeds can become a game played against order books and the market rules. We can\ncomplain about certain trading practices in this new environment, but if the market is structured to\nincentivize those practices, then why should we be surprised if they occur?\nThe trading platforms in both the interdealer cash and futures markets are based on a central\nlimit order book, in which quotes are executed based on price and the order they are posted. A\ncentral limit order book provides for continuous trading, but it also provides incentives to be the\nfastest. A trader that is faster than the others in the market will be able to post and remove orders\nin reaction to changes in the order book before others can do so, earning profits by hitting out-of-\ndate quotes and avoiding losses by making sure that the trader’s own quotes are up to date.\nTechnology and greater competition have led to lower costs in many areas of our economy.\nAt the same time, slower traders may be put at a disadvantage in this environment, which could\ncause them to withdraw from markets or seek other venues, thus fracturing liquidity. And one can\ncertainly question how socially useful it is to build optic fiber or microwave networks just to trade\nat microseconds or nanoseconds rather than milliseconds. The cost of these technologies, among\nother factors, may also be driving greater concentration in markets, which could threaten their\nresilience. The type of internalization now done by dealers is only really profitable if done on a\nlarge scale, and that too has led to greater market concentration.\nA number of observers have suggested reforms for consideration. For example, some\nrecent commentators propose frequent batch auctions as an alternative to the central limit order\n\n- 7 -\nbook, and argue that this would lead to greater market liquidity.9 Others have argued that current\nmarket structures may lead to greater volatility, and suggested possible alterations designed to\nimprove the situation.10 To be clear, I am not embracing any particular one of these ideas. Rather,\nI am suggesting that now is a good time for market participants and regulators to collectively\nconsider whether current market structures can be improved for the benefit of all.\nQuestions about market structure also arise in the funding markets for Treasuries. As many\nhave noted, there is a link between funding liquidity and market liquidity, and for Treasury markets\nthe links to funding in the repo market are especially close.11 Post crisis reforms have made the\nrepo market safer but also raised the costs of repo transactions. Greater use of central clearing\ncould potentially lower these costs by allowing participants to net more of their transactions.\nAuthorities have emphasized a greater use of clearing for a wide range of products, and I believe\nthere could be benefits to greater clearing in repo markets as well. There are several private\nproposals to accomplish that, and any solution will have to satisfy demanding regulatory\nrequirements.\nTo wrap up, we need more clarity on the implications of structural changes in these critical\nmarkets for market liquidity and function. This is a good time to hold another public conference to\n9 See, for example, Elaine Wah and Michael P. Wellman (2013), “Latency Arbitrage, Market Fragmentation, and\nEfficiency: A Two-Market Model,” in Proceedings of the 14th ACM Conference on Electronic Commerce (Ann Arbor,\nMich.: University of Michigan, June), pp. 855-72, http://web.eecs.umich.edu/srg/?page_id=1383; and Eric Budish,\nPeter Cramton, and John Shim (forthcoming), “The High-Frequency Trading Arms Race: Frequent Batch Auctions as\na Market Design Response,” Quarterly Journal of Economics (first published online on July 23, 2015, and available at\nhttp://qje.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/07/22/qje.qjv027.full.pdf+html).\n10 Yacine Ait-Sahalia and Mehmet Saglam (2013), “High Frequency Traders: Taking Advantage of Speed,” NBER\nWorking Paper Series 19531 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic Research, October),\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3386/w19531.\n11 See, for example, Marcus Brunnermeier and Lasse Pedersen (2009), “Market Liquidity and Funding Liquidity,”\nReview of Financial Studies, vol. 22, pp. 2201-38. In Treasury markets, the ability to conduct repo agreements can\nprovide market makers a flexible channel to fund their inventories and can help to lower the costs of providing market\nliquidity.\n\n- 8 -\ndiscuss Treasury market structure. In fact, that is one of the recommendations in the October 15\nreport released last month. The conference will take place this fall at the Federal Reserve Bank of\nNew York, in cooperation with the Treasury Department, the Board of Governors, the Securities\nand Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. My hope and\nexpectation is that it will bring market participants and regulators closer to an understanding of\nwhether there are changes in trading and risk management practices, regulation and market\nstructure that could make our Treasury markets even more liquid and more resilient.",

At the Federal Reserve, we are intently focused on the dual-mandate goals\ngiven to us by Congress: maximum employment and stable prices.\nRecent Economic Data\nEconomic growth\nThe economy has been growing at a solid pace. GDP expanded at a 2.3 percent\nannual rate in the fourth quarter of last year, extending a period of consistent growth that\nhas been supported by resilient consumer spending. Recent indicators point to a possible\nmoderation in consumer spending relative to the rapid growth rate over the second half of\n2024. Further, recent surveys of households and businesses point to heightened\nuncertainty about the economic outlook. It remains to be seen how these developments\nmight affect future spending and investment. Sentiment readings have not been a good\npredictor of consumption growth in recent years. We continue to carefully monitor a\nvariety of indicators of household and business spending.\nThe labor market\nMany indicators show that the labor market is solid and broadly in balance. The\njobs report released this morning showed employers added 151,000 jobs to payrolls in\nFebruary and the unemployment rate was 4.1 percent last month. Smoothing over the\nmonth-to-month volatility, since September, employers have added a solid 191,000 jobs a\n\n- 2 -\nmonth on average. The unemployment rate remains low and has held in a narrow range\nbetween 3.9 and 4.2 percent for the past year. The jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed,\nand the quits rate has moved below pre-pandemic levels. Wages are growing faster than\ninflation, and at a more sustainable pace than earlier in the pandemic recovery. With\nwage growth moderating and labor supply and demand having moved into better balance,\nthe labor market is not a significant source of inflationary pressure.\nInflation\nInflation has come down a long way from its mid-2022 peak above 7 percent\nwithout a sharp increase in unemployment—a historically unusual and most welcome\noutcome. While progress in reducing inflation has been broad based, recent readings\nremain somewhat above our 2 percent objective. The path to sustainably returning\ninflation to our target has been bumpy, and we expect that to continue. We see ongoing\nprogress in categories that remain elevated, such as housing services and the market-\nbased components of non-housing services. Inflation can be volatile month-to-month,\nand we do not overreact to one or two readings that are higher or lower than anticipated.\nData released last week showed that total PCE prices rose 2.5 percent over the 12 months\nending in January and that, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE\nprices rose 2.6 percent. We pay close attention to a broad range of measures of inflation\nexpectations, and some near-term measures have recently moved up. We see this in both\nmarket- and survey-based measures, and survey respondents, both consumers and\nbusinesses, are mentioning tariffs as a driving factor. Beyond the next year or so,\nhowever, most measures of longer-term expectations remain stable and consistent with\nour 2 percent inflation goal.\n\n- 3 -\nMonetary Policy\nLooking ahead, the new Administration is in the process of implementing\nsignificant policy changes in four distinct areas: trade, immigration, fiscal policy, and\nregulation. It is the net effect of these policy changes that will matter for the economy\nand for the path of monetary policy. While there have been recent developments in some\nof these areas, especially trade policy, uncertainty around the changes and their likely\neffects remains high. As we parse the incoming information, we are focused on\nseparating the signal from the noise as the outlook evolves. We do not need to be in a\nhurry, and are well positioned to wait for greater clarity.\nPolicy is not on a preset course. If the economy remains strong but inflation does\nnot continue to move sustainably toward 2 percent, we can maintain policy restraint for\nlonger. If the labor market were to weaken unexpectedly or inflation were to fall more\nquickly than anticipated, we can ease policy accordingly. Our current policy stance is\nwell positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides\nof our dual mandate.\nConclusion\nBefore I conclude, I will note that at our last FOMC meeting, we began our\nsecond five-year review of our monetary policy framework. We will consider changes to\nour consensus statement (Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy)\nand to our communications as part of this review. The consensus statement articulates\nour framework for the conduct of monetary policy in pursuit of the goals assigned to us\nby Congress. We will consider lessons of the past five years and adapt our approach,\n\n- 4 -\nwhere appropriate, to best serve the American people, to whom we are accountable. The\n2 percent longer-run inflation goal will be retained and is not a focus of the review.\nThis public review will be familiar to those who followed our process five years\nago. We will hold outreach events around the country involving a wide range of parties,\nincluding Fed Listens events. We are open to new ideas and critical feedback. We will\nhost a research conference in Washington in May. Our intent is to wrap up the review by\nlate summer.\nThank you. I look forward to your questions.",

Powell\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Monetary Policy Challenges in a Global Economy,” a policy panel at\nthe 24th Jacques Polak Annual Research Conference, hosted by\nthe International Monetary Fund\nWashington, D.C.\nNovember 9, 2023\n\nThank you for the opportunity to participate in today’s panel discussion. My\nassigned topic is U.S. monetary policy in the current global inflation episode. I will\nbriefly address the U.S. outlook and then turn to three broader questions raised by the\nhistoric events of the pandemic era.\nU.S. inflation has come down over the past year but remains well above our\n2 percent target (figure 1).1 My colleagues and I are gratified by this progress but expect\nthat the process of getting inflation sustainably down to 2 percent has a long way to go.\nThe labor market remains tight, although improvements in labor supply and a gradual\neasing in demand continue to move it into better balance.2 Gross domestic product\ngrowth in the third quarter was quite strong, but, like most forecasters, we expect growth\nto moderate in coming quarters. Of course, that remains to be seen, and we are attentive\nto the risk that stronger growth could undermine further progress in restoring balance to\nthe labor market and in bringing inflation down, which could warrant a response from\nmonetary policy. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is committed to\nachieving a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation\ndown to 2 percent over time; we are not confident that we have achieved such a stance.\nWe know that ongoing progress toward our 2 percent goal is not assured: Inflation has\n1 Inflation under our preferred measure, the 12-month change in the total personal consumption\nexpenditures (PCE) price index, has declined from 6.6 percent in September 2022 to 3.4 percent in\nSeptember 2023. The 12-month change in the core PCE measure, which excludes the volatile food and\nenergy prices and therefore may provide a better signal of where inflation is headed, has declined from 5.5\npercent in September 2022 to 3.7 percent in September 2023.\n2 The labor force participation rate has moved up since late last year, particularly for individuals aged 25 to\n54 years, where that rate has increased by nearly 1 percentage point, on net, since December. Private\npayrolls increased by an average of 191,000 per month over the 12 months ending in October 2023, down\nfrom a rate of 435,000 per month over the 12 months ending in October 2022. Meanwhile, both the quits\nrate and the wage premium for job switchers have returned to their pre-pandemic ranges. And while they\nremain above a level that would be consistent with 2 percent inflation in the longer run, broad indicators of\n12-month wage growth continue to trend lower.\n\n- 2 -\ngiven us a few head fakes. If it becomes appropriate to tighten policy further, we will not\nhesitate to do so. We will continue to move carefully, however, allowing us to address\nboth the risk of being misled by a few good months of data, and the risk of\novertightening. We are making decisions meeting by meeting, based on the totality of the\nincoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation,\nas well as the balance of risks, determining the extent of additional policy firming that\nmay be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time. We will keep at it until the\njob is done.\nWith that, I will turn to three questions that have arisen from the receding but still\nelevated inflation we are experiencing today. The first question is, with the benefit of\n2-1/2 years to look back, what we can say about the initial causes and ongoing policy\nimplications of the current inflation.\nAfter running below our 2 percent target over the first year of the pandemic, core\nPCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation rose sharply in March 2021.\nEconomic forecasters generally did not see this coming, as shown by the February 2021\nSurvey of Professional Forecasters, which showed core PCE inflation running at or below\ntarget over the subsequent three years.3 The real-time questions for policymakers were\nwhat caused the high inflation and how policy should react. At the outset, many\nforecasters and analysts, including FOMC participants, viewed the sudden upturn in\ninflation as mostly a function of pandemic-related shifts in the composition of demand, a\ndisruption of supply chains, and a sharp decline in labor supply. The resulting supply and\ndemand imbalances led to large increases in the prices of a range of items most directly\n3 The median projections of Q4-to-Q4 core PCE inflation from the February 2021 Survey of Professional\nForecasters were 1.8 percent, 1.9 percent, and 2.0 percent for 2021, 2022, and 2023, respectively.\n\n- 3 -\naffected by the pandemic, especially goods. In this view, as the pandemic abated, our\ndynamic and flexible economy was likely to adapt fairly quickly. Supply disruptions and\nshortages would diminish. Labor supply would rebound, aided by the arrival of vaccines\nand the reopening of schools. Elevated demand for goods would shift back to services.\nInflation would ease reasonably quickly without the need for a significant policy\nresponse.4\nIndeed, although monthly core PCE inflation spiked in March and April of 2021,\nbeginning in May it declined for five consecutive months, providing some support for\nthis view (figure 2). But in the fourth quarter of 2021, the data clearly changed amid\nwaves of new COVID-19 variants, with only gradual progress in restoring global supply\nchains, and relatively few workers rejoining the labor force. That lack of progress,\ncombined with very strong demand from households, contributed to a tight economy and\na historically tight labor market, and more persistent high inflation.\nThe Committee signaled a change in our policy approach, and financial conditions\nbegan to tighten. A new shock arrived in February 2022, when Russia invaded Ukraine,\nresulting in a sharp increase in energy and other commodity prices. When we lifted off in\nMarch, it was clear that bringing down inflation would depend both on the unwinding of\nthe unprecedented pandemic-related demand and supply distortions and on our tightening\nof monetary policy, which would slow the growth of aggregate demand, allowing supply\ntime to catch up. Today, these two processes are working together to bring inflation\ndown. The FOMC has raised the federal funds rate target range by 5-1/4 percentage\n4 Both the June Summary of Economic Projections and the August Survey of Professional Forecasters\nshowed a near-uniform view that the incipient inflation would pass quickly and that inflation for 2022\nwould run near 2 percent. Neither the forecasters nor policymakers foresaw more than a modest tightening\nof monetary policy.\n\n- 4 -\npoints and reduced our securities holdings by more than $1 trillion. Monetary policy is in\nrestrictive territory and putting downward pressure on demand and inflation.\nThe unwinding of pandemic-related supply and demand distortions is playing an\nimportant role in the decline of inflation. For example, wage growth has steadily fallen\nby most measures since mid-2022 (figure 3), despite continued robust job gains,\nreflecting a resurgence in labor supply thanks to higher labor force participation and a\nreturn of immigration to pre-pandemic levels.\nWhile the broader supply recovery continues, it is not clear how much more will\nbe achieved by additional supply-side improvements. Going forward, it may be that a\ngreater share of the progress in reducing inflation will have to come from tight monetary\npolicy restraining the growth of aggregate demand.5\nTurning to my second question, for many years, it has been generally thought that\nmonetary policy should limit its response to, or “look through,” supply shocks to the\nextent that they are temporary and idiosyncratic.6 Many argue as well that, in the future,\nsupply disruptions are likely to be more frequent or more persistent than in the decades\njust before the pandemic.7 A second question, then, is what we have learned about the\nstandard “looking through” approach.\nThe idea that the response to the inflationary effects of supply shocks should be\nattenuated arises, in part, from the tradeoff presented by those shocks. Supply shocks\n5 See, for example, Ben Bernanke and Olivier Blanchard (2023), “What Caused the U.S. Pandemic-Era\nInflation?” Hutchins Center Working Paper 86 (Washington: Brookings Institution, Hutchins Center on\nFiscal and Monetary Policy, June), https://www.brookings.edu/articles/what-caused-the-u-s-pandemic-era-\ninflation.\n6 As I will return to later, this presumes that inflation expectations are well anchored.\n7 See, for example, Agustín Carstens (2022), “A Story of Tailwinds and Headwinds: Aggregate Supply and\nMacroeconomic Stabilization,” remarks delivered at “Reassessing Constraints on the Economy and\nPolicy,” a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, held in Jackson Hole, Wyo.,\nAugust 26, https://www.kansascityfed.org/Jackson%20Hole/documents/9668/JH2022_Carstens.pdf.\n\n- 5 -\ntend to move prices and employment in opposite directions, whereas monetary policy\npushes each in the same direction. Therefore, the response of monetary policy to higher\nprices stemming from an adverse supply shock should be attenuated because it would\notherwise amplify the unwanted decline in employment.8 In addition, supply shocks\nhave most frequently come from the volatile food and energy categories and have passed\nquickly. While food and energy prices critically affect the budgets of households and\nbusinesses, the policy tools of central banks work more slowly than commodity markets\nmove. Responding aggressively to quickly passing price increases could exacerbate\nmacroeconomic volatility without supporting price stability.\nOur experience since 2020 highlights some limits of that thinking. To begin with,\nit can be challenging to disentangle supply shocks from demand shocks in real time, and\nalso to determine how long either will persist, particularly in the extraordinary\ncircumstances of the past three years. Supply shocks that have a persistent effect on\npotential output could call for restrictive policy to better align aggregate demand with the\nsuppressed level of aggregate supply. The sequence of shocks to global supply chains\nexperienced from 2020 to 2022 suppressed output for a considerable time and may have\npersistently altered global supply dynamics. Such a sequence calls on policymakers to\nuse policy restraint to limit inflationary effects.\nPolicy restraint in this case is also good risk management. Supply shocks that\ndrive inflation high enough for long enough can affect the longer-term inflation\nexpectations of households and businesses. Monetary policy must forthrightly address\n8 For an example in the context of energy price shocks, see Martin Bodenstein, Christopher J. Erceg, and\nLuca Guerrieri (2008), “Optimal Monetary Policy with Distinct Core and Headline Inflation Rates,”\nJournal of Monetary Economics, supp., vol. 55 (October), pp. S18–33.\n\n- 6 -\nany risks of a potential de-anchoring of inflation expectations, as well-anchored\nexpectations help facilitate bringing inflation back to our target. The sharp policy\ntightening during 2022 likely contributed to keeping inflation expectations well anchored.\nMy third question is the level where interest rates will settle once the effects of\nthe pandemic are truly behind us. By 2019, the general level of nominal interest rates had\ndeclined steadily over several decades (figure 4). As the pandemic arrived, many\nadvanced economies had below-target inflation and low or mildly negative policy rates,\nraising difficult questions about the efficacy of interest rate policy when constrained by\nthe effective lower bound (ELB). Over two decades, an extensive literature had\nidentified a number of possible changes to the widely used inflation-targeting regime,\nincluding negative policy rates, nominal income targeting, and various forms of makeup\nstrategies under which persistent shortfalls in inflation would be followed by a period of\ninflation running moderately above 2 percent.9 Today, inflation and policy rates are\nelevated, and the ELB is not currently relevant for our policy decisions. But it is too soon\n9 A number of these topics were discussed in the analytical work supporting the 2019–20 framework\nreview; see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2020), “Review of Monetary Policy\nStrategy, Tools, and Communications,” webpage, https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review-\nof-monetary-policy-strategy-tools-and-communications.htm. For a discussion of the effect of the ELB on\nmonetary policy strategy, see Fernando Duarte, Benjamin K. Johannsen, Leonardo Melosi, and Taisuke\nNakata (2020), “Strengthening the FOMC’s Framework in View of the Effective Lower Bound and Some\nConsiderations Related to Time-Inconsistent Strategies,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2020-\n067 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, August),\nhttps://doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2020.067. For additional information about the efficacy and use of certain\npolicy tools in this environment, see Jonas Arias, Martin Bodenstein, Hess Chung, Thorsten Drautzburg,\nand Andrea Raffo (2020), “Alternative Strategies: How Do They Work? How Might They Help?” Finance\nand Economics Discussion Series 2020-068 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem, August), https://doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2020.068; Jeffrey Campbell, Thomas B.

We will\nbegin our next five-year review in the latter half of 2024 and announce the results about a\nyear later. Among the questions we will consider is the degree to which the structural\nfeatures of the economy that led to low interest rates in the pre-pandemic era will persist.\nWith time, we will continue to learn from the experience of the past few years, and what\nimplications it may hold for monetary policy.\nThese are just three of the many questions raised by these challenging times, and\nwe are far from a complete understanding of the answers. I appreciate the opportunity to\ndiscuss these issues with you today and look forward to our conversation.\n\nOpening Remarks\nJerome H.

    "text": "For release at\n1:00 p.m. EST\nNovember 20, 2015\nOpening Remarks by\nJerome H. Powell\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe 2015 Roundtable on Treasury Markets and Debt Management:\nEvolution of Treasury Market and Its Implications\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York\nNew York, N.Y.\nNovember 20, 2015\n\nIt’s been a month since the New York Fed hosted a very successful\nconference on Treasury market structure, and I’m eager to continue the\nconversation started there. I thought I’d start by discussing some of the main\npoints I took from the conference. There were certainly different points of view on\na variety of issues between broker dealers, proprietary trading firms (PTFs), end\nusers and others, but hearing a range of views was exactly the dynamic we were\nhoping for.\nThere was broad understanding that electronic and automated trading are\nhere to stay. Indeed, a wide range of firms are engaged in these trading practices\ntoday. Participants on the PTF panel viewed their relative speed and efficiency as\nallowing them to provide tighter spreads and greater liquidity. One expressed the\nbelief that his firm needed to be faster and more sophisticated because, unlike\nbroker-dealers, they have no direct view of customer order flows. For their part,\ndealers noted that they provide a key service in helping their customers execute\nlarger trades, and defended their internal matching of customer trades as a natural\nsearch for trading efficiencies.\nThere were differing views on the significance of what happened in Treasury\nmarkets on October 15, 2014. Many attendees voiced concern, but a number also\nexpressed the view that the market worked as it was supposed to, and even that\n1\n\nnothing extraordinary occurred that day. Although buy-side participants tended to\nbelieve that they were not directly affected given the short duration of the price\nswings that day, some noted that more frequent episodes of high volatility could\nlead them to demand larger risk premiums.\nFor my part, I do realize that a single 12-minute roundtrip episode may not\nmean that much in the end. But it isn’t satisfying to me to say that the market\nworked as it was intended to. The events of October 15 were unusual both in the\nsize and speed of the moves and in the absence of a fundamental driver. The real\nquestion is whether there are dynamics at play here that are likely to produce more\nepisodes of sudden, outsized volatility without any obvious cause. Further\nepisodes of this nature could cause more market participants to react in ways that\nreduce liquidity, and add to pressures for changes in market structure.\nThere were also areas of consensus. First, there was a general desire for\nmore publicly available market data, particularly in the dealer-to-customer\nsegment. It is striking that there is so little information on trading in this segment\nof our nation’s Treasury market. The staff who worked on the October 15 report\ndid a great job, but it took a mammoth effort on their part to gather detailed trade\ndata for just that single day. As Antonio Weiss will discuss today, the agencies\ninvolved in the Joint Staff Report on October 15 are assessing the adequacy of\n2\n\npublicly available information, and of the data available to the official sector for its\nown monitoring of these markets.1\nA number of participants also expressed interest in continuing to try out a\nrange of potential innovations to current market structures. Presenters at the\nacademic sessions of the conference argued that the combination of a central limit\norder book and high speed trading can lead to higher liquidity risk and a race for\nspeed. In the current structure, customer trades occur mainly off of public markets,\nexcept at times of market stress when dealers may be unable or unwilling to\ninternalize them. That approach does not seem likely to provide good, stable\nliquidity in changing market conditions. One presenter at the conference outlined\nhis idea that high frequency “batch auctions” -- auctions held every millisecond or\nso rather than trading continuously -- would increase market liquidity and limit the\nrace for speed. There are several related ideas that have been proposed. In fact,\ntrading platforms have already tried various innovations. For example, EBS has\ninstituted latency floors and random batching lengths for messaging in its FX\ntrading platform. I hope we will hear more about that today.\nThere may be other adaptations to the current market structure that could\nprovide greater or more stable liquidity. A good way to find out if there are better\n1 Joint Staff Report: The U.S. Treasury Market on October 15, 2014, http://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-\nreleases/Documents/Joint_Staff_Report_Treasury_10-15-2015.pdf\n3\n\nsolutions would be to try some of these ideas, at least on a small scale. Regulators\nare not necessarily well placed to dictate specific trading structures. I’d much\nrather see changes emerge from a process of experimentation and seeing what\nworks. We should have strong evidence that any change in structure represents an\nimprovement before implementing it on a wide scale.\nBut we will only be able to evaluate structural innovations if traders actually\nuse them. And the market would need to include both dealers and PTFs. I’d be\ninterested in hearing the panelists’ views on this and whether there are things that\nregulators could do to encourage a cooperative, industry-wide approach.\nTreasury repo markets are also undergoing structural changes, which brings\nme to the third area of consensus at the conference. The repo panel I moderated\nincluded an asset manager, a broker dealer and one of the triparty clearing banks.\nThere was agreement on the panel that expanded repo clearing would be positive\nfor the market. That said, there was also a consensus that the current private sector\ninitiatives in this area face demanding regulatory requirements related to capital\nand liquidity. We are carefully considering these proposals and are open to\nsolutions that would satisfy regulatory requirements while bringing the benefits of\ncentral clearing. I’d welcome panelists’ views on proposals for expanded repo\nclearing as well.\n4\n\nI look forward to the conversations today, and I hope we’ll keep having\nthem. Treasury markets are important to all of us. The financial market\nparticipants represented here have special reasons to care. As one of the panelists\nat the conference put it, we’ve built our entire prudential regulatory framework,\nindeed our entire financial framework, around the ability to quickly and efficiently\ntransform Treasury securities in to cash liquidity. These markets need to keep\nfunctioning at a high level, and we all have a stake in making sure that they do.\n5",

Powell\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe Global Finance Forum\nWashington, D.C.\nApril 20, 2017\n\nThank you for inviting me to speak here today.1 I will begin by looking back at the\nglobal financial crisis and the great recession, which were arriving on the horizon at about this\ntime 10 years ago. For the United States and many other countries, this would turn out to be the\nmost painful economic crisis since the Great Depression. The fact that we had a severe recession\nbut not another depression is a tribute to the aggressive response of those who were in a position\nto act at that time.2\nIn the event, the financial system avoided collapse but incurred severe damage and\nproved incapable, for a time, of performing its key functions. That was true of the largest\ninvestment and commercial banks, several of which either failed or required taxpayer support to\nsurvive. It was also true of the many pieces of the financial market infrastructure whose\nstructural weaknesses contributed to the crisis, such as the triparty repurchase agreement (repo)\nmarket, the over-the-counter derivative market, and prime money market funds.\nThe financial turmoil caused heavy damage to the real economy. Payroll employment\ndeclined by almost 9 million; over 7 million people lost their homes.3 Many young people\nentered a terrible job market; research shows that this may adversely affect their careers for\nmany years. Many experienced workers who lost their jobs may suffer permanently lower\nincome prospects.4\nThe nation faced two big tasks after the crisis. We had to get the economy growing again\nso people could get back to work and rebuild their financial lives. And we had to return the\n1 The views I express here are my own and not those of the Federal Reserve.\n2 Ben S. Bernanke, The Courage to Act: A Memoir of a Crisis and Its Aftermath (New York: Norton, 2015).\n3 Source: CoreLogic, completed foreclosures.\n4 See, for example, Lisa B. Kahn, “The Long-Term Labor Market Consequences of Graduating from College in a\nBad Economy,” Labour Economics 17(2) (April 2010): 303–16.\n\n- 2 -\nfinancial system to good health and address the many structural weaknesses that had become\napparent.\nToday, the first of those tasks is well along. We have gone eight years without a\nsubsequent recession--one of the longest recoveries on record. Employment is now almost 7\nmillion jobs higher than its pre-crisis peak, with all of the net gains coming from the private\nsector. And with unemployment at 4.5 percent, we are at or close to full employment.\nBut all is not well. Although job growth has been strong, gross domestic product has\nincreased only about 2 percent annually since the crisis, held down by the weakest sustained\nperiod of labor productivity growth since World War II. Labor productivity--the increase in\noutput per hour--has increased only ½ percent per year since 2011, about a quarter of its post-war\naverage. The productivity slowdown has profound implications for our national well-being.\nThis slowdown is a worldwide phenomenon, so it is likely that there are global forces at work.\nThe slowdown has been associated with weak investment and a decline in output gains from\ntechnological innovation.\nWe need a national focus on increasing the sustainable growth rate of our economy.5\nThat means investing in our workforce to give them the skills and aptitudes they need to compete\nin the global economy. It means policies that reward work, and policies that support investment\nand research. For the most part, these policies are not in the purview of the Federal Reserve.\nWhat about the second goal? As with the economy, we have made great progress toward\nour goals. Today, our financial system is without a doubt far stronger than it was before the\ncrisis. The largest financial institutions now hold much higher levels of higher-quality capital.\n5 Jerome H. Powell, “Recent Economic Developments and Longer-Run Challenges” (speech delivered at the\nEconomic Club of Indiana, Indianapolis, November 29, 2016),\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20161129a.htm.\n\n- 3 -\nThey hold higher levels of liquidity as well and are much less reliant on runnable short-term\nfunding. They are subject to rigorous, forward-looking capital stress tests that recognize the\ndynamic nature of financial risks. And they have submitted several rounds of resolution plans\nthat are helping to ensure that they could be safely reorganized should all these other safeguards\nprove insufficient.\nOur financial market infrastructures are also much stronger. The amount of intraday\ncredit extended in the triparty repo market has been drastically reduced. Last year, the Securities\nand Exchange Commission implemented reforms that address weaknesses in the structure of\nprime money funds. And about 75 percent of interest rate and credit default swaps are now\ncentrally cleared, which allows for greater transparency and more consistent risk management.6\nWhile the move to central clearing has made the system safer, we need to make sure that the\ncentral counterparties have the resources and risk-management practices to withstand plausible\nbut severe shocks.7\nMany of the statutory provisions and regulations put in place to effect these changes were\nnovel; it is not likely that we would have gotten everything exactly right on the first attempt.\nThis is a good time to step back and ask what changes have worked and where adjustments\nshould be made. Indeed, along with the other financial regulatory agencies, the Federal Reserve\nis contributing to just such an exercise by the Treasury Department. As I share some of my\nviews on these issues, I should emphasize that I speak for myself and not for my Board\ncolleagues or for the new colleagues who will soon join us.\n6 Timothy Massad, “Remarks before the 2016 P.R.I.M.E. Finance Annual Conference” (The Hague, the\nNetherlands, January 25, 2016), www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opamassad-38.\n7 The Alternative Reference Rates Committee is working to strengthen another key segment of the financial\ninfrastructure. The Committee will select its preferred alternative to U.S. dollar London Interbank Offered Rate (or,\nLIBOR) and is expected to complete its plans to promote the use of this rate this year.\n\n- 4 -\nA few themes can guide us in this next phase. First, after years of raising capital and\nliquidity standards, and of stress tests and living wills, our financial system is much stronger\nnow. We should protect these core reforms and avoid a return to the highly vulnerable system\nthat existed before the crisis. Second, in too many cases new regulation has been inappropriately\napplied to small and medium-sized institutions. We need to go back and broadly raise thresholds\nof applicability and look for other ways to reduce burden on smaller firms. Third, the new rule\nbook is excessively complex. We need to look for ways to simplify the rules so that they support\nour goals but also improve the efficiency of regulation. For example, we need to allow boards of\ndirectors and management to spend a smaller portion of their time on technical compliance\nexercises and more time focusing on the activities that support sustainable economic growth.\nFourth, we need to continue to strive to provide an appropriate level of transparency to\nsupervised firms and the public regarding our expectations.\nSome aspects of the new regulatory program are proving unnecessarily burdensome and\nshould be better tailored to meet our objectives. Some provisions may not be needed at all given\nthe broad scope of what we have put in place. I support adjustments designed to enhance the\nefficiency and effectiveness of regulation without sacrificing safety and soundness or\nundermining macroprudential goals.\nOne example where some adjustments are warranted is our supervisory relationship with\nthe boards of directors of banking firms. After the crisis, there was a broad increase in\nsupervisory expectations for these boards. But it is important to acknowledge that the board’s\nrole is one of oversight, not management. We need to ensure that directors are not distracted\nfrom conducting their key functions by an overly detailed checklist of supervisory process\nrequirements. Rather, boards of directors need to be able to focus on setting the overall strategic\n\n- 5 -\ndirection of the firm, while overseeing and holding senior management accountable for operating\nthe business profitably, but also safely, soundly, and in compliance with applicable laws. We are\ncurrently reassessing whether our supervisory expectations for boards need to change to ensure\nthat these principles, and not an ever-increasing checklist, are the basis of our supervisory work\nrelated to boards.\nI am sure that there are other areas where laws, regulations, and supervisory practices\ncould be adjusted in a way that preserves the gains in safety and soundness but helps financial\ninstitutions devote as much of their resources as possible to supporting economic growth. I look\nforward to our discussion.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n3:00 p.m. EST (2:00 p.m. CST)\nNovember 14, 2024\nEconomic Outlook\nRemarks by\nJerome H. Powell\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nDallas, Texas\nNovember 14, 2024\n\nGood afternoon. Thank you to the World Affairs Council, the Federal Reserve\nBank of Dallas, and the Dallas Regional Chamber for the kind invitation to be with you\ntoday. I will start with some brief comments on the economy and monetary policy.\nLooking back, the U.S. economy has weathered a global pandemic and its\naftermath and is now back to a good place. The economy has made significant progress\ntoward our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices. The labor\nmarket remains in solid condition. Inflation has eased substantially from its peak, and we\nbelieve it is on a sustainable path to our 2 percent goal. We are committed to maintaining\nour economy’s strength by returning inflation to our goal while supporting maximum\nemployment.\nRecent Economic Data\nEconomic growth\nThe recent performance of our economy has been remarkably good, by far the\nbest of any major economy in the world. Economic output grew by more than 3 percent\nlast year and is expanding at a stout 2.5 percent rate so far this year. Growth in consumer\nspending has remained strong, supported by increases in disposable income and solid\nhousehold balance sheets. Business investment in equipment and intangibles has\naccelerated over the past year. In contrast, activity in the housing sector has been weak.\nImproving supply conditions have supported this strong performance of the\neconomy. The labor force has expanded rapidly, and productivity has grown faster over\nthe past five years than its pace in the two decades before the pandemic, increasing the\nproductive capacity of the economy and allowing rapid economic growth without\noverheating.\n\n- 2 -\nThe labor market\nThe labor market remains in solid condition, having cooled off from the\nsignificantly overheated conditions of a couple of years ago, and is now by many metrics\nback to more normal levels that are consistent with our employment mandate. The\nnumber of job openings is now just slightly above the number of unemployed Americans\nseeking work. The rate at which workers quit their jobs is below the pre-pandemic pace,\nafter touching historic highs two years ago. Wages are still increasing, but at a more\nsustainable pace. Hiring has slowed from earlier in the year. The most recent jobs report\nfor October reflected significant effects from hurricanes and labor strikes, making it\ndifficult to get a clear signal. Finally, at 4.1 percent, the unemployment rate is notably\nhigher than a year ago but has flattened out in recent months and remains historically\nlow.\nInflation\nThe labor market has cooled to the point where it is no longer a source of\nsignificant inflationary pressures. This cooling and the substantial improvement in\nbroader supply conditions have brought inflation down significantly over the past two\nyears from its mid-2022 peak above 7 percent. Progress on inflation has been broad\nbased. Estimates based on the consumer price index and other data released this week\nindicate that total PCE prices rose 2.3 percent over the 12 months ending in October and\nthat, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.8 percent.\nCore measures of goods and services inflation, excluding housing, fell rapidly over the\npast two years and have returned to rates closer to those consistent with our goals. We\nexpect that these rates will continue to fluctuate in their recent ranges. We are watching\n\n- 3 -\ncarefully to be sure that they do, however, just as we are closely tracking the gradual\ndecline in housing services inflation, which has yet to fully normalize. Inflation is\nrunning much closer to our 2 percent longer-run goal, but it is not there yet. We are\ncommitted to finishing the job. With labor market conditions in rough balance and\ninflation expectations well anchored, I expect inflation to continue to come down toward\nour 2 percent objective, albeit on a sometimes-bumpy path.\nMonetary Policy\nGiven progress toward our inflation goal and the cooling of labor market\nconditions, last week my Federal Open Market Committee colleagues and I took another\nstep in reducing the degree of policy restraint by lowering our policy interest rate\n1/4 percentage point.\nWe are confident that with an appropriate recalibration of our policy stance,\nstrength in the economy and the labor market can be maintained, with inflation moving\nsustainably down to 2 percent. We see the risks to achieving our employment and\ninflation goals as being roughly in balance, and we are attentive to the risks to both sides.\nWe know that reducing policy restraint too quickly could hinder progress on inflation. At\nthe same time, reducing policy restraint too slowly could unduly weaken economic\nactivity and employment.\nWe are moving policy over time to a more neutral setting. But the path for\ngetting there is not preset. In considering additional adjustments to the target range for\nthe federal funds rate, we will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and\nthe balance of risks. The economy is not sending any signals that we need to be in a\nhurry to lower rates. The strength we are currently seeing in the economy gives us the\n\n- 4 -\nability to approach our decisions carefully. Ultimately, the path of the policy rate will\ndepend on how the incoming data and the economic outlook evolve.\nWe remain resolute in our commitment to the dual mandate given to us by\nCongress: maximum employment and price stability. Our aim has been to return\ninflation to our objective without the kind of painful rise in unemployment that has often\naccompanied past efforts to bring down high inflation. That would be a highly desirable\nresult for the communities, families, and businesses we serve. While the task is not\ncomplete, we have made a good deal of progress toward that outcome.\nThank you, and I look forward to our discussion.",

Powell\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“A Fed Listens Event: How Is COVID-19 Affecting Your Community?”\nsponsored by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nWashington, D.C.\nMay 21, 2020\n\nGood afternoon. I just want to say a few words of welcome and thank everyone\nfor being here—albeit in much different circumstances than would otherwise be\nexpected.\nWe’ve held many Fed Listens events over the past 16 months, and it’s important\nto note that these conversations aren’t just a nice way to talk to people from around the\ncountry, although they are that. What they provide—what you provide—is insight that\nwe just can’t get anywhere else. You add depth and definition to the flood of data that\nflows through the Fed each day. You give us perspective on the economic realities that\ndon’t show up on a spreadsheet. You help us see those complex sets of data that analyze\nthe American economy through the eyes of the people, businesses, and communities that\nmake up the American economy. And that information is very helpful to us as we make\nour policy decisions.\nSo this is a valuable exercise for us. And an enjoyable one as well, so we truly do\nappreciate it on a number of levels. The Reserve Banks are also continuing to host\nconversations in communities across the country to help capture economic realities on the\nground.\nWe are in the midst of an economic downturn without modern precedent. It was\nsudden, and it is severe. It has already erased the job gains of the past decade and has\ninflicted acute pain across the country. And while the burden is widespread, it is not\nevenly spread. Those taking the brunt of the fallout are those least able to bear it.\nThe pain of this downturn is compounded by the upending of normal life, along\nwith great uncertainty about the future. In the best of times, predicting the path of the\neconomy with any certainty is difficult. John Kenneth Galbraith famously said that\n\n- 2 -\neconomic forecasting exists to make astrology look respectable. We are now\nexperiencing a whole new level of uncertainty, as questions only the virus can answer\ncomplicate the outlook.\nPolicies that address the resumption of economic activity are the province of\nelected officials at all levels of government, in close consultation with public health and\nmedical professionals. But all of us have our own decisions to make as well, and those\ndecisions will depend on public confidence that it is again safe to undertake various\nactivities. From an economic perspective, we hope to learn a lot from your experiences\nand from what you’re hearing from your colleagues, customers, and communities: How\nthey’re coping with that uncertainty now, how they’re thinking about a future that’s\nharder to plan for, and what matters most as they navigate the path.\nThe feedback we get from our community and business contacts has always been\ncrucial in how we conduct monetary policy. In extraordinary times such as these, it takes\non even greater importance. I want to thank you again for providing that insight and look\nforward to the conversation.\nThank you.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n1:00 p.m. EDT (7:00 p.m. local time)\nJuly 16, 2019\nMonetary Policy in the Post-Crisis Era\nRemarks by\nJerome H. Powell\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Bretton Woods: 75 Years Later—Thinking about the Next 75,”\na conference organized by\nthe Banque de France and the French Ministry for the Economy and Finance\nParis, France\nJuly 16, 2019\n\nSeventy-five years ago this month, the foremost economic and policy minds of\ntheir generation gathered in a sleepy mountain town in New England. While World\nWar II still raged, they envisioned a new international monetary system with rules,\nprocedures, and institutions—including the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the\nWorld Bank—to promote recovery and stability in a war-ravaged world.\nToday we gather in Paris, the City of Light, to recognize their vision. The Bretton\nWoods institutions played a pivotal role after the war in rebuilding economies and in\nfacilitating the international economic relations that are essential to prosperity.\nGenerations later, the World Bank and the IMF continue to play important roles in\nfostering global monetary cooperation, financial stability, and international trade, as well\nas in promoting sustainable economic growth and reducing poverty.\nIn 1944, those who sat around the table at the Mount Washington Hotel knew that\nthe trauma and tragedy of the war and the Great Depression had fundamentally altered\nthe economic systems that preceded them. For us, around our dinner tables tonight, a\ndecade has passed since the Global Financial Crisis. Although in no way comparable to\nthe devastating events of the 1930s and 1940s, the crisis represents the deepest and\nbroadest financial upheaval since that era, and in many ways, we, too, are grappling with\na changed world.\nToday’s conference has looked at this post-crisis environment and the issues we\nnow face from many angles. I am grateful to the Banque de France for organizing this\nimportant event and to the outstanding speakers for their deep insights. Tonight I will\noffer some thoughts on this new environment. I will begin with a discussion of current\neconomic conditions in the United States, and then highlight some significant structural\n\n- 2 -\nchanges in the environment facing monetary policymakers in the post-crisis era. Finally,\nI will consider how these structural changes are affecting the framework in which we\nconduct monetary policy, highlighting the Federal Reserve System’s ongoing review of\nour monetary policy strategy, tools, and communications.\nThe U.S. economy is now in its 11th consecutive year of growth. Unemployment\nhas steadily declined from its 10 percent post-crisis peak and has now remained at or\nbelow 4 percent for more than a year, the longest stretch in a half century. A strong labor\nmarket with plentiful job openings has supported labor force participation. After rising\nonly grudgingly early in the recovery, wages have moved up the past few years. Some\ngroups, such as African Americans, Hispanics, and rural Americans, continue to face\nlong-standing challenges, but the benefits of this strong job market are increasingly\nwidely shared. At outreach events we are holding across the United States, we are\nhearing loud and clear that this long recovery is now benefiting low- and moderate-\nincome communities to a greater extent than has been felt for decades. Many people who\nhave struggled to stay in the workforce are now getting an opportunity to add new and\nbetter chapters to their life stories.\nSolid growth has sustained this strong labor market. Most recently, U.S. gross\ndomestic product (GDP) increased at an annual rate of just over 3 percent in the first\nquarter, similar to last year’s strong pace. But first-quarter growth was driven largely by\nnet exports and inventories—two volatile spending categories that are typically not\ndependable indicators of ongoing momentum. Indeed, overall growth in the second\nquarter appears to have moderated. Growth in consumer spending, which was soft in the\nfirst quarter, looks to have bounced back, but business fixed investment growth seems to\n\n- 3 -\nhave slowed notably. Moreover, the manufacturing sector has been weak since the\nbeginning of the year, in part weighed down by the softer business spending, weaker\ngrowth in the global economy, and, as our business contacts tell us, concerns about trade\ntensions.\nDespite low unemployment and solid overall growth, inflation pressures remain\nmuted. After running close to the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) symmetric\n2 percent objective over much of last year, both overall consumer price inflation and core\ninflation moved down earlier this year. We currently estimate that the change in the core\npersonal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index was 1.7 percent over the\n12 months ending in June.\nIn our baseline outlook, we expect growth in the United States to remain solid,\nlabor markets to stay strong, and inflation to move back up and run near 2 percent.\nUncertainties about this outlook have increased, however, particularly regarding trade\ndevelopments and global growth. In addition, issues such as the U.S. federal debt ceiling\nand Brexit remain unresolved. FOMC participants have also raised concerns about a\nmore prolonged shortfall in inflation below our 2 percent target. Market-based measures\nof inflation compensation have shifted down, and some survey-based expectations\nmeasures are near the bottom of their historical ranges.\nMany FOMC participants judged at the time of our most recent meeting in June\nthat the combination of these factors strengthens the case for a somewhat more\naccommodative stance of policy. We are carefully monitoring these developments and\nassessing their implications for the U.S economic outlook and inflation, and will act as\n\n- 4 -\nappropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market and inflation near its\nsymmetric 2 percent objective.\nWe will also assess these developments in the context of the broader structural\nchanges monetary policymakers have been facing since the Great Recession. I will focus\non three tonight: the changed macroeconomic backdrop, the expanded toolkit, and the\nheightened focus on communication and transparency.\nIn the United States, from the mid-1980s to right before the Great Recession, PCE\ninflation averaged 2.6 percent a year, GDP growth 3.4 percent, and the interest rate on a\n10-year Treasury note 6.5 percent. Since the trough of the Great Recession, average\ninflation and output growth are around 1 percentage point lower, and the 10-year\nTreasury rate has averaged 2.4 percent. These declines are not unique to the United\nStates. Average inflation rates for the other major advanced economies have declined by\nalmost half, while the inflation rates of major emerging market economies are less than\none-fifth of what they were. Indeed, with few exceptions, we are all facing lower rates of\ninterest, growth, and inflation. In a number of countries, including the United States,\nthese declines have been accompanied by strong labor markets and a much lower\nunemployment rate.\nSuch changes in the macroeconomic environment are significant because the\nlong-run normal levels of inflation, output, interest rates, and the unemployment rate are\nimportant structural features by which we guide policy. Standard estimates of the natural\nrate of unemployment—u*—and the neutral rate of interest—r*—have been declining\nfor 2 decades, and particularly since the crisis.\n\n- 5 -\nMany factors are contributing to these changes—well-anchored inflation\nexpectations in the context of improved monetary policy, demographics, globalization,\nslower productivity growth, greater demand for safe assets, and weaker links between\nunemployment and inflation. And these factors seem likely to persist. If that happens,\nthe neutral rate of interest will remain low, and policymakers will continue to operate in\nan environment in which the risk of hitting the effective lower bound is much higher than\nbefore the crisis. This proximity to the lower bound poses new complications for central\nbanks and calls for new ideas.\nIt is true that many of these features have been with us for some time. Trend\ninflation, productivity, and interest rates were declining well before the crisis. But, for\nmonetary policymakers in that era, the threat of high inflation felt proximate, the hard-\nfought battle to control high inflation having been just recently won. Technological\nprogress seemed likely to continue to sustain rapid increases in productivity—an outcome\nwe continue to await. And the effective lower bound for interest rates was mainly a\ntheoretical concern, except of course in Japan. The changes to the macroeconomic\nenvironment may have been in train earlier, but the crisis seems to have accelerated the\nprocess. The world in which policymakers are now operating is discretely different in\nimportant ways from the one before the Great Recession.\nI should also note, as is fitting given this event and this audience, that since the\ncrisis policymakers are even more keenly aware of the relevance of global factors to our\npolicies. The global nature of the financial crisis and the channels through which it\nspread sharply highlight the interconnectedness of our economic, financial, and policy\nenvironments. U.S. economic developments affect the rest of the world, and the reverse\n\n- 6 -\nis also true. For example, the stresses surrounding the euro crisis and, later, the China-\nrelated volatility events in 2015 and 2016 led to a general pullback in demand for risky\nassets that put downward pressure on U.S. interest rates and weighed on U.S. confidence\nand growth. In addition, we have seen how monetary policy in one country can influence\neconomic and financial conditions in others through financial markets, trade, and\nconfidence channels. Pursuing our domestic mandates in this new world requires that we\nunderstand the anticipated effects of these interconnections and incorporate them into our\npolicy decisionmaking.\nA second important feature of this new world is the tools central bankers now\nhave to fight recessions. In the face of the dramatic economic and financial collapse\nduring the crisis, policymakers quickly exhausted conventional monetary policy tools and\nemployed a range of unconventional measures to support their economies.\nIn the United States, these measures included new forms of forward guidance and\na range of balance sheet policies. Broadly across different economies, so-called\nunconventional monetary policies have generally been successful at lowering interest\nrates and supporting economic recovery, though cyclical and structural headwinds have\nmade achieving our inflation targets a challenge. A legacy of the crisis is that\npolicymakers now have a broader range of tested tools to turn to the next time the\neffective lower bound is reached. We must continue to assess additional strategies and\ntools to bolster our economies and meet our inflation and employment mandates.\nFinally, the crisis and Great Recession brought into stark relief the need for\ntransparency and accountability for central banks. Central bank communication is\nincreasingly important and increasingly challenging. It is important because clear,\n\n- 7 -\ntransparent communication about the economy, the risks, and our policy responses is\ncritical for the effectiveness of our tools and for our accountability to the public in a\ndemocratic society.\nIt is challenging, because we are operating in a changing macroeconomic\nenvironment with tools that, while no longer new, remain less familiar to the public.\nMoreover, our audience has become more varied, more attuned to our actions, and less\ntrusting of public institutions. Gone are the days when the Federal Reserve Chair could\njoke, as my predecessor Alan Greenspan did, “If I turn out to be particularly clear, you’ve\nprobably misunderstood what I said.” 1 Central banks must speak to Main Street, as well\nas Wall Street, in ways we have not in the past, and Main Street is listening and engaged.\nWhere does this leave us, and how should policymakers adapt to this new\nenvironment? Recognizing challenges posed by the changing structure of the economy,\nthe need for effective policy responses, and the importance of clear communication,\ncentral banks are taking a closer look at their strategies and the range of tools currently at\ntheir disposal. For example, the Bank of Canada examines its framework every five\nyears as part of the renewal of its inflation-control agreement with the federal\ngovernment. Canadian officials have announced the bank will “assess a broad range of\nmonetary policy frameworks ahead of the renewal in 2021” of this agreement.2 The\n1 See Alan Greenspan (1988), “Trade Deficit and Budget Deficit,” C-SPAN video of a speech delivered at\nthe Economic Club of New York, New York, June 14, https://www.c-span.org/video/?2992-1/trade-deficit-\nbudget-deficit&start=58 (quoted remark is 3 minutes, 20 seconds into the video).\n2 See Bank of Canada (2018), “Bank to Review the Monetary Policy Framework ahead of 2021 Renewal,\nSays Senior Deputy Governor Wilkins,” press release, November 20,\nhttps://www.bankofcanada.ca/2018/11/bank-review-monetary-policy-framework-ahead-2021 (quoted text\nis in paragraph 1); and Carolyn A.

These events have been live-streamed on the internet.\nLast month, we hosted a research conference at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago to\nexplore ways to more effectively and sustainably achieve our mandated goals.

    "text": "For release on delivery\n10:00 a.m. EDT (8:00 a.m. MDT)\nAugust 26, 2022\nMonetary Policy and Price Stability\nRemarks by\nJerome H. Powell\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Reassessing Constraints on the Economy and Policy,” an economic policy symposium\nsponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\nJackson Hole, Wyoming\nAugust 26, 2022\n\nThank you for the opportunity to speak here today.\nAt past Jackson Hole conferences, I have discussed broad topics such as the ever-\nchanging structure of the economy and the challenges of conducting monetary policy\nunder high uncertainty. Today, my remarks will be shorter, my focus narrower, and my\nmessage more direct.\nThe Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) overarching focus right now is\nto bring inflation back down to our 2 percent goal. Price stability is the responsibility of\nthe Federal Reserve and serves as the bedrock of our economy. Without price stability,\nthe economy does not work for anyone. In particular, without price stability, we will not\nachieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. The burdens\nof high inflation fall heaviest on those who are least able to bear them.\nRestoring price stability will take some time and requires using our tools\nforcefully to bring demand and supply into better balance. Reducing inflation is likely to\nrequire a sustained period of below-trend growth. Moreover, there will very likely be\nsome softening of labor market conditions. While higher interest rates, slower growth,\nand softer labor market conditions will bring down inflation, they will also bring some\npain to households and businesses. These are the unfortunate costs of reducing inflation.\nBut a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain.\nThe U.S. economy is clearly slowing from the historically high growth rates of\n2021, which reflected the reopening of the economy following the pandemic recession.\nWhile the latest economic data have been mixed, in my view our economy continues to\nshow strong underlying momentum. The labor market is particularly strong, but it is\nclearly out of balance, with demand for workers substantially exceeding the supply of\n\n- 2 -\navailable workers. Inflation is running well above 2 percent, and high inflation has\ncontinued to spread through the economy. While the lower inflation readings for July are\nwelcome, a single month’s improvement falls far short of what the Committee will need\nto see before we are confident that inflation is moving down.\nWe are moving our policy stance purposefully to a level that will be sufficiently\nrestrictive to return inflation to 2 percent. At our most recent meeting in July, the FOMC\nraised the target range for the federal funds rate to 2.25 to 2.5 percent, which is in the\nSummary of Economic Projection’s (SEP) range of estimates of where the federal funds\nrate is projected to settle in the longer run. In current circumstances, with inflation\nrunning far above 2 percent and the labor market extremely tight, estimates of longer-run\nneutral are not a place to stop or pause.\nJuly’s increase in the target range was the second 75 basis point increase in as\nmany meetings, and I said then that another unusually large increase could be appropriate\nat our next meeting. We are now about halfway through the intermeeting period. Our\ndecision at the September meeting will depend on the totality of the incoming data and\nthe evolving outlook. At some point, as the stance of monetary policy tightens further, it\nlikely will become appropriate to slow the pace of increases.\nRestoring price stability will likely require maintaining a restrictive policy stance\nfor some time. The historical record cautions strongly against prematurely loosening\npolicy. Committee participants’ most recent individual projections from the June SEP\nshowed the median federal funds rate running slightly below 4 percent through the end of\n2023. Participants will update their projections at the September meeting.\n\n- 3 -\nOur monetary policy deliberations and decisions build on what we have learned\nabout inflation dynamics both from the high and volatile inflation of the 1970s and\n1980s, and from the low and stable inflation of the past quarter-century. In particular, we\nare drawing on three important lessons.\nThe first lesson is that central banks can and should take responsibility for\ndelivering low and stable inflation. It may seem strange now that central bankers and\nothers once needed convincing on these two fronts, but as former Chairman Ben\nBernanke has shown, both propositions were widely questioned during the Great Inflation\nperiod.1 Today, we regard these questions as settled. Our responsibility to deliver price\nstability is unconditional. It is true that the current high inflation is a global phenomenon,\nand that many economies around the world face inflation as high or higher than seen here\nin the United States. It is also true, in my view, that the current high inflation in the\nUnited States is the product of strong demand and constrained supply, and that the Fed’s\ntools work principally on aggregate demand. None of this diminishes the Federal\nReserve’s responsibility to carry out our assigned task of achieving price stability. There\nis clearly a job to do in moderating demand to better align with supply. We are\ncommitted to doing that job.\nThe second lesson is that the public’s expectations about future inflation can play\nan important role in setting the path of inflation over time. Today, by many measures,\nlonger-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored. That is broadly true\nof surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, and of market-based measures as\n1 See Ben Bernanke (2004), “The Great Moderation,” speech delivered at the meetings of the Eastern\nEconomic Association, Washington, February 20,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2004/20040220; Ben Bernanke (2022), “Inflation Isn’t\nGoing to Bring Back the 1970s,” New York Times, June 14.\n\n- 4 -\nwell. But that is not grounds for complacency, with inflation having run well above our\ngoal for some time.\nIf the public expects that inflation will remain low and stable over time, then,\nabsent major shocks, it likely will. Unfortunately, the same is true of expectations of\nhigh and volatile inflation. During the 1970s, as inflation climbed, the anticipation of\nhigh inflation became entrenched in the economic decisionmaking of households and\nbusinesses. The more inflation rose, the more people came to expect it to remain high,\nand they built that belief into wage and pricing decisions. As former Chairman Paul\nVolcker put it at the height of the Great Inflation in 1979, “Inflation feeds in part on\nitself, so part of the job of returning to a more stable and more productive economy must\nbe to break the grip of inflationary expectations.”2\nOne useful insight into how actual inflation may affect expectations about its\nfuture path is based in the concept of “rational inattention.”3 When inflation is\npersistently high, households and businesses must pay close attention and incorporate\ninflation into their economic decisions. When inflation is low and stable, they are freer to\nfocus their attention elsewhere. Former Chairman Alan Greenspan put it this way: “For\nall practical purposes, price stability means that expected changes in the average price\nlevel are small enough and gradual enough that they do not materially enter business and\nhousehold financial decisions.”4\n2 See Paul A. Volcker (1979), “Statement before the Joint Economic Committee of the U.S.\nCongress, October 17, 1979,” Federal Reserve Bulletin, vol. 65 (November), p. 888,\nhttps://fraser.stlouisfed.org/title/federal-reserve-bulletin-62/november-1979-20459.\n3 A review of the applications of rational inattention in monetary economics appears in Christopher A. Sims\n(2010), “Rational Inattention and Monetary Economics,” in Benjamin M. Friedman and Michael\nWoodford, eds., Handbook of Monetary Economics, vol. 3 (Amsterdam: North-Holland), pp. 155–81.\n4 See Alan Greenspan (1989), “Statement before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs,\nU.S. Senate, February 21, 1989,” Federal Reserve Bulletin, vol. 75 (April), pp. 274–75,\nhttps://fraser.stlouisfed.org/title/federal-reserve-bulletin-62/april-1989-20803.\n\n- 5 -\nOf course, inflation has just about everyone’s attention right now, which\nhighlights a particular risk today: The longer the current bout of high inflation continues,\nthe greater the chance that expectations of higher inflation will become entrenched.\nThat brings me to the third lesson, which is that we must keep at it until the job is\ndone. History shows that the employment costs of bringing down inflation are likely to\nincrease with delay, as high inflation becomes more entrenched in wage and price setting.\nThe successful Volcker disinflation in the early 1980s followed multiple failed attempts\nto lower inflation over the previous 15 years. A lengthy period of very restrictive\nmonetary policy was ultimately needed to stem the high inflation and start the process of\ngetting inflation down to the low and stable levels that were the norm until the spring of\nlast year. Our aim is to avoid that outcome by acting with resolve now.\nThese lessons are guiding us as we use our tools to bring inflation down. We are\ntaking forceful and rapid steps to moderate demand so that it comes into better alignment\nwith supply, and to keep inflation expectations anchored. We will keep at it until we are\nconfident the job is done.",

Powell\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“CPBS 2016 Pacific Basin Research Conference,” sponsored by\nthe Center for Pacific Basin Studies at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nSan Francisco, California\nNovember 18, 2016\n\n-2-\nIt is a pleasure for me to return to the Center for Pacific Basin Studies here at the San\nFrancisco Fed. The global economy is at a critical juncture today. According to the\nInternational Monetary Fund’s latest World Economic Outlook, global gross domestic product\n(GDP) is set to grow at only 3.1 percent this year, the lowest rate of growth since the Global\nFinancial Crisis. Investment and productivity remain subdued, despite extremely low and even\nnegative interest rates in many economies.1 One key aspect of global weakness that is of\nparticular relevance to emerging Asian economies is the sharp slowdown in global trade. This\nslowdown represents a notable departure from the “normal” times of the past few decades, and is\nthe subject of my remarks today.2\nMore specifically, I will discuss four topics. First, I will review the main features of the\nglobal trade slowdown and summarize the evidence on its potential causes. Second, I will\nexamine the special role that structural changes in China appear to be playing in the trade\nslowdown. Third, I will turn to the implications of this slowdown for economic growth in the\nregion. And, finally, I will offer some views on how Asian economies can respond to the\nslowdown by rethinking their “export-led growth” paradigm.\n1 The World Economic Outlook’s headline growth numbers aggregate global growth, using PPP-based GDP weights.\nThey also compute growth using GDP weights based on market exchange rates, according to which global growth\nthis year is projected to be even lower, at 2.4 percent.\n2 The views I express here are my own.\n\n-3-\nDocumenting the Global Trade Slowdown and Its Likely Causes\nTo set the scene, I will review the main features of the recent global trade slowdown. As\nyou can see on the first slide, growth in world trade rebounded after the Great Recession but has\nslowed substantially since 2011. On a real inflation-adjusted basis, world imports have grown at\nan average annual rate of less than 3-1/2 percent since 2011, about half the 7 percent pace seen in\nthe eight years prior to the Global Financial Crisis.3 As illustrated in the next slide, trade is no\nlonger outpacing GDP growth. The share of real world imports in world GDP has been flat at\njust under 30 percent since 2011 after nearly doubling between 1985 and 2007.4 This sustained\nslowing of real trade relative to GDP is quite unusual: Since 1870, trade has generally grown\nfaster than production, outside of wartime and recessionary periods.\nTrade has been sluggish almost everywhere. Real trade growth has been lower over the\n2011-15 period compared with the 2000-07 period for every G-20 country outside of Japan,\nwhere trade growth was constant. The third slide shows that the fall in real import growth in\nemerging Asia has been particularly pronounced from over 10 percent in the first period to just\nabout 3 percent in the second. But import growth has declined in Latin America and the\nadvanced economies as well.\nThe next slide shows the differential between real import growth and real GDP growth\nfor the same two periods. For emerging Asia, the differential went from positive to substantially\nnegative, indicating that real import growth slowed to well below real GDP growth. In advanced\n3 In principle, data on either world exports or world imports could be used to study global trade, though the two\ndiffer in practice. My remarks here focus on import data, which are generally regarded as more reliable at the\ncountry level.\n4 The share of nominal world imports to nominal GDP has actually been declining since 2011, with a particularly\nsharp drop in 2015, reflecting steep declines in commodity prices.\n\n-4-\nforeign economies, the differential was just about zero in the more recent period, indicating that\nreal import growth barely kept pace with GDP growth. Trade relative to GDP has held up better,\nthough, in the United States and Latin America.\nIs the trade slowdown just another manifestation of slow growth, or is it an independent\nconcern? That depends on the reasons for the slowdown. Weak global growth is surely part of\nthe explanation, as emphasized by several recent empirical studies, including a special chapter on\nthe topic in the latest IMF World Economic Outlook.5 As can be seen in slide 5, global GDP\ngrowth has fallen from an average of 3.5 percent before the Global Financial Crisis to about\n2.5 percent since its end.\nBut weak global growth alone does not explain why trade has slowed to about the same\npace as GDP after growing faster than GDP for decades. Part of the reason could be that the\nparticular expenditure categories in which international trade flows are concentrated have\nbecome especially weak. A stark case in point is the Global Financial Crisis, when plummeting\ndemand for investment and durable goods--two highly traded expenditure categories--\ncontributed to the sharp 4 percentage point fall in the ratio of world trade to GDP. The special\nweakness in some components of demand has persisted beyond the crisis and could also explain\nsome of the recent sluggishness in trade relative to GDP. In particular, as you can see from the\nmiddle two bars of slide 5, the slowdown in world investment growth--from about 4.5 percent\ngrowth before the Global Financial Crisis to only about 3 percent growth since 2011--has been\n5 International Monetary Fund (2016a); see also Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (2016),\nEuropean Central Bank (2016), and Hoekman (2015).\n\n-5-\nmore pronounced than the slowdown in world GDP growth or in world consumption. But the\ndifferences are not huge, suggesting that this explanation can go only so far.\nIndeed, research suggests that other factors are also important in accounting for the\nslowdown in world trade.6 One such factor is the deceleration in the pace of trade liberalization\npolicies. From the early 1990s through the mid-2000s, trade barriers were coming down rapidly,\nincluding the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994, the 2001 entry of\nChina into the World Trade Organization, and the 2005 expiration of the multifibre agreement\nrestricting textile imports to the United States and European Union. These changes resulted in\nthe most rapid increases in the trade-to-GDP ratio since 1870. As the pace of trade liberalization\nhas slowed in recent years, perhaps reflecting limits to further gains from trade agreements, it is\nonly natural that the trade-to-GDP ratio should flatten out as well.\nAnother related factor is the maturation of global value chains. Increased fragmentation\nof production across international borders--a natural outgrowth of the gains from specialization--\nmeant more trade for any given value of final production, thus adding to the major expansion in\ngross trade flows in the 1990s and 2000s. As shown in the next slide, global value chain\nparticipation, as measured by the share of foreign value added in world exports, increased\nsubstantially during this period. It is quite plausible that the process of increased fragmentation\nof production across borders is subject to “diminishing returns” and has its natural limits.\nConsistent with this notion, the trend toward greater product fragmentation has slowed in recent\nyears.\n6 See, for example, European Central Bank (2016), Hoekman (2015), Organization for Economic Co-operation and\nDevelopment (2016), and Lewis and Monarch (2016).\n\n-6-\nFinally, of course, China looms large in any discussion of the global trade slowdown.\nNot only is China’s trade being affected by all of the factors just discussed, but on-going\nstructural changes within the Chinese economy, including rebalancing toward domestic demand,\nare exerting an independent effect on world trade flows. So, let’s look next at China in more\ndetail.7\nChina\nAfter years of rapid export-led growth, China is now among the world’s leaders in both\nexports and imports. China’s exports now account for 14 percent of the world’s total, compared\nwith only 4 percent 15 years ago. At the same time, China’s industrialization and export model\nhas greatly increased its own demand for imports of raw materials, intermediate inputs, and parts\nand components. In recent years, however, growth in both Chinese imports and Chinese exports\nhas slowed markedly. These developments have had a significant effect on global trade. One\nsimple way to measure that effect is to consider what would have happened if China’s trade had\nnot decelerated. As shown in slide 7, under a counterfactual in which China’s trade growth had\nnot slowed relative to its GDP since 2011, global trade would still be growing as a share of\nGDP.8\n7 Another explanation that has been put forward for much of the decline in world trade relative to world GDP is an\nincreased weight of EMEs in the contribution to global growth together with the property that EMEs have lower\nincome elasticities of trade than advanced economies do. (See European Central Bank, 2016.) However, more\nbroadly, the literature does not seem to suggest that income elasticities are significantly lower for EMEs (for\nexample, Lui and others, 2013). Also, while trade financing constraints—another potential explanation—played\nsome role during the severe trade slowdown during the Global Financial Crisis, trade financing does not appear to\nhave become more difficult since 2011 and likely has not been a significant factor in the slowdown in recent years.\n8 See Lewis and Monarch (2016) for more details.\n\n-7-\nChina has, of course, been subject to many of the forces I have already discussed. One\nnotable trend, shown by the black line in slide 8, is that Chinese processing exports--that is, re-\nexports from assembled imported parts and components--as a share of China’s total exports have\nbeen falling steadily for several years. This trend in part reflects weak global demand, as weaker\ndemand for final goods and services from the advanced economies should have led Chinese\nprocessing exports to fall disproportionately. It is also consistent with the deceleration of global\nsupply chain formation.\nAlthough global factors have undoubtedly played a role, however, the evidence suggests\nthat a substantial part of the slowdown in Chinese trade reflects developments that are specific to\nthe Chinese economy and that are likely to exert a lasting imprint on global trade.9 First, the\nrapid expansion of China’s manufacturing base over the past 15 years--made possible by vast\nreserves of cheap, rural labor--may simply be reaching its natural limit. Accordingly, we would\nexpect China’s manufacturing exports to slow.\nSecond, China is moving up the sophistication ladder by producing some higher value-\nadded parts and components itself, instead of importing them. One manifestation of this\nphenomenon is the higher domestic value-added in Chinese exports in recent years, shown by the\ngray bars in this slide, relative to the period before the Global Financial Crisis. Another\nmanifestation can be seen in slide 9, which shows the decline in the share of parts and\n9 A recent note from the Banque du France--Gaullier, Steingress, and Zignago (2016)--argues that the long run\nelasticity of world trade to income is unity, and that structural changes in China go a long way in explaining both the\nsharp rise in the elasticity in the years before the Global Financial Crisis and the subsequent decline in the post-crisis\nyears as China rebalances toward domestic demand.\n\n-8-\ncomponents in China’s total manufactured imports from about 65 percent in 2005 to under\n50 percent in 2014.10 These two pieces of evidence suggest that the shift away from parts and\ncomponents in Chinese imports is not just due to lower orders tied to weak import demand in the\nadvanced economies, but also due to the rising productivity and sophistication of the Chinese\nlabor force, which is enabling China to move to higher value-added exports.\nAs China moves up the sophistication ladder, you would also expect other countries to\ntake a greater role in the lower steps of the ladder. We do have evidence that some other\ncountries with cheaper labor, such as Vietnam and Bangladesh, are playing more of a role as\nexporters in the low-value added parts of the Asian supply chain. Anecdotal evidence suggests,\nthough, that some of this shift is also taking place within China, as low-value-added production\nshifts to low-wage areas in China’s interior.11\nThe third important structural change affecting Chinese trade is the progress China is\nmaking in moving away from its export-led model of economic growth and rebalancing its\neconomy toward domestic demand. As shown in slide 10, investment, which in much of the\npre-crisis period was supporting high exports, has been falling as a share of the economy in\nrecent years while the consumption share has been rising. Note, though, that the consumption\nshare remains well below its value in the early 2000s. In addition, as can be seen in slide 11, as\npart of its rebalancing, Chinese production has been shifting away from manufacturing to\n10 This share has been computed by updating the methodology followed in Haltmaier and others (2007), which, in\nturn, extended the methodology of Athukorala and Yamashita (2006).\n11 See, for example, The Economist (2015).\n\n-9-\nservices. Thanks in part to these developments, China’s current account surplus (not shown\nhere) has fallen sharply as a share of its GDP over the past several years.12\nThese are welcome developments as China’s huge trade surplus created an unsustainable\nsituation, contributing both to internal imbalances within the Chinese economy and to global\nimbalances. But the rebalancing toward domestic demand will likely put a damper on China’s\ntrade for some time as resources shift away from trade-intensive manufacturing. In principle,\nthis drag on China’s trade could be partly or even completely offset by stronger imports by\nChinese consumers. Evidence of a shift toward imports of consumer goods, however, is limited\nthus far, and further substantial progress depends on the Chinese authorities’ ability to remove\ndistortions that currently depress consumption and boost saving. It may well be, however, that\nthe rising power of the Chinese consumer will in time propel another long round of rapid\nincreases in world trade.\nImplications for Growth in the Region\nHaving examined developments in world and Chinese trade, let me turn to the\nimplications of these trends for economic growth in the emerging Asia region.\nThere is little doubt that for many years China and other emerging Asian economies have\nbenefited from rapid expansion of trade.13 Greater trade can provide a host of economic benefits,\nincluding enabling the pursuit of comparative advantage, fostering more competition (which\nleads to more efficiency), generating technological and knowledge spillovers, and facilitating\n12 Over the past couple of years, though, China’s current account surplus has turned up again, especially as a share\nof world GDP.\n13 See, for example, Glick and Moreno (1997), Page (1994), and World Bank (1993).\n\n-10-\nimport of key capital goods. These factors enhance productivity and growth and result in the\navailability of a greater variety of goods to consumers at lower prices. It is safe to say that over\nthe years, the Asian economies have benefited from their high degree of export orientation\nthrough all of these transmission mechanisms.14 A number of academic studies have found a\ncausal link between openness and growth.15 A simple scatter plot of economic growth across\ncountries over the period from 2000 to 2007 against their export orientation, presented in\nslide 12, is telling: More trade-intensive economies have grown significantly faster over this\nperiod, and the fast-growing emerging Asian economies shown by the red dots have generally\nbeen among the most export-oriented.\nHow did greater focus on trade develop in Asia? At first, increased export orientation in\nAsia was achieved by taking advantage of low-cost, low-skilled labor to produce low value-\nadded products for foreign markets. Over time, countries such as Japan and South Korea moved\nup to higher value-added exports, in part through technological and knowledge spillovers. Later,\nwith the rise of China, many emerging Asian economies became integrated into global supply\nchains, with China acting as the endpoint of a giant Asian assembly line.\nGiven that trade benefited the Asian economies on the way up, it seems natural that the\nslowdown in global trade, whatever its causes, could lead to some loss of dynamism and growth\nin the region. For China, the shift away from trade dependence is partly a reflection of policy\nchoice, with rebalancing seen as a way to sustain growth in the face of some exhaustion of the\n14 Some--Page (1994), for example--have argued that industrial policies favoring certain export industries have also\nplayed an important role in Asia’s success, but it seems to be generally agreed that industrial support was only\nmaintained conditional on successful performance on world markets.\n15 See, for example, Frankel and Romer (1999) and Baldwin (2004).\n\n-11-\nheavy export/investment model. But many other Asian economies’ fortunes are tied to those of\nChina, so developments in China will have important implications for growth in these\neconomies.\nOne natural question is how the rise in domestic content of Chinese exports is affecting\ncountries that rely heavily on supplying parts and components to China. To document this\nreliance, your next slide shows that the share of parts and components in other Asian economies’\nexports to China (the middle green bars) is much greater than their share in exports to the rest of\nthe world (the right blue bars). Over time, this share has fallen from about 70 percent in 2005 to\n60 percent in 2014, without the share of parts and components in exports to the rest of the world\nincreasing. This evidence, combined with the evidence I presented earlier on trends in Chinese\nprocessing exports, suggests that other economies in Asia are being adversely affected both by\nless final global demand for Chinese exports and by less use of imported parts and components\nby China in the production of any given amount of final goods exports.\nAnd the effects of these shifts in supply chains are being offset only very slowly and to\nonly a very limited extent by China importing more goods for domestic consumption.16\nAccordingly, it is doubtful that, at least so far, China is fully replacing advanced-economy\ndemand as an engine of growth for the rest of emerging Asia. One way to look more concretely\nat this issue is to estimate an equation for the growth for emerging Asia ex. China that separately\ncontrols for the effects of Chinese growth and advanced-economy growth. This approach lets us\n16 The arguments laid out here are consistent with the findings in the chapter on spillovers from China’s transition\npresented in the latest IMF World Economic Outlook (2016b). This chapter concludes that for many countries the\neffect of China’s transition and rebalancing toward a more sustainable growth model will entail short-run negative\nspillovers, but there will be potential gains to the global economy over the longer term.\n\n-12-\nsee the direct contribution of Chinese growth to that of its neighbors at the margin, apart from the\nindirect effect due to China’s exports to advanced economies.\nThe results of such an exercise, based on 10-year rolling regressions, are presented in\nslide 14. Note that in the first half of the 2000s, the effect of advanced-economy growth on\nemerging Asia ex. China (shown on the left) steadily rises from near zero to a one-to-one effect\nby 2005, whereas the coefficient on Chinese growth (on the right) hovers around 0.25 and is\nstatistically insignificant. These results suggest that the effect of the rise in China on the rest of\nemerging Asia in the 2000s mainly reflected China’s role as a “conduit” for trade with the\nadvanced economies. However, after the Global Financial Crisis, we see the coefficient on\nadvanced-economy growth move down some, whereas the coefficient on China’s growth rises to\n0.5 and becomes statistically significant. But the direct effect of advanced-economy growth is\nstill larger than the direct effect of Chinese growth, consistent with the idea that it is still early\ndays for the rebalancing of China’s economy and that China will only slowly supplant the role of\nadvanced economies as drivers of emerging Asian growth.\nRethinking the “Export-Led Growth” Paradigm\nThat brings me to the final topic of my remarks today, which is how emerging Asia can\nrespond to the global trade slowdown and the structural changes taking place in China. Some of\nthe structural changes I have discussed suggest that the recent deceleration of trade relative to\nGDP will likely persist and that we may expect global trade to grow perhaps about as fast as, but\nnot substantially faster than, global GDP growth for the foreseeable future. Under these\ncircumstances, emerging Asian countries may not be able to look to their export sectors as the\nkey source of dynamism for their economies.\n\n-13-\nSo what’s an Asian economy to do? I would argue that, instead of trying to restore\ngrowth through enhancing external surpluses, under the circumstances it makes more sense for\nemerging Asia to focus on domestic demand as an engine of its growth, and to allow their trade\nand current account surpluses to shrink. When looking at these economies in aggregate, as\nshown in your next slide, current account surpluses narrowed greatly after the Global Financial\nCrisis but rebounded substantially thereafter.17 However, as you can see in slide 16, we have\nseen some narrowing of current account balances as a share of GDP in several emerging Asian\neconomies, although in some others, such as South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand, the surpluses\nhave increased. Encouraging domestic demand and allowing for downward adjustment of these\nsurpluses in emerging Asia, with more balances turning into deficits, would provide a much-\nneeded injection of demand into the global economy and also support economic growth in the\nregion by providing another source of growth in place of the lessened impetus from external\ndemand.\nA shift toward external deficits in Asia would be advantageous, considering the low level\nof external financing costs at present. Many observers are raising the possibility of a “new\nnormal” for the global economy, in which moderate global demand, low productivity growth,\nand slow trade may persist for some time, keeping interest rates in the advanced economies “low\nfor long.” To be sure, bond yields have moved up recently, but they remain quite low by\nhistorical standards. Accordingly, the cost of external finance to Asian economies has fallen,\nwhich should support strong private capital flows to emerging markets. Normally, we would\n17 See Setster (2016) for a detailed discussion of the return of the East Asian savings glut.\n\n-14-\nworry about volatility of these flows and how they might exacerbate risks of financial instability,\nparticularly as U.S. monetary policy normalizes. But we should also bear in mind that many\nemerging market economies (EMEs), particularly in Asia, have improved their macroeconomic\nfundamentals over the past two decades; that they have built an adequate war chest of reserves,\nwith no pending need to further reserve accumulation for precautionary purposes; and that their\ncurrencies are much more flexible, which acts as an adjustment mechanism to shocks and also\nlessens the possibility of fluctuations in reserves due to currency intervention. These factors\nhave made the emerging Asian economies much less vulnerable.\nGiven all this, dare we imagine a world in which private capital inflows to EMEs could\nprove self-sustaining, are not offset by reverse flows of official capital, and would finance long-\nterm profitable investment that would help support growth in these economies while also\nsupporting global growth? In essence, these capital inflows would finance the shift from export-\nled growth to domestic-led growth required by the slowdown in global trade. And, with little or\nno official outflows, EMEs would have total capital net inflows as well, consistent with running\ncurrent account deficits instead of current account surpluses. As pointed out recently by former\nFed Chairman Ben Bernanke, the availability of profitable capital investments in one part of the\nworld can help defeat secular stagnation in another part.18\nOf course, these developments may take time. The point is that at this current juncture of\nthe global economy, it is all the more important for emerging Asian economies—and, indeed,\nemerging market economies more broadly—to enhance domestic demand while pursuing\n18 See Bernanke (2015).\n\n-15-\nprudent policies. It would be good to do this for the sake of the global economy, but emerging\nAsian economies should do this for their own sakes as well.\n(Thank you.

    "text": "For release on delivery\n10:00 a.m. EDT\nJuly 6, 2017\nThe Case for Housing Finance Reform\nRemarks by\nJerome H. Powell\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nthe American Enterprise Institute\nWashington, DC\nJuly 6, 2017\n\nGood morning. Thank you to the American Enterprise Institute and Steve Oliner for\ninviting me here to speak. My topic today is the urgent need for fundamental reform of our\nsystem of housing finance--the great unfinished business of post-financial crisis reform.1\nThe Federal Reserve is not charged with designing or evaluating proposals for housing\nfinance reform. But we are responsible for regulating and supervising banking institutions to\nensure their safety and soundness, and more broadly for the stability of the financial system. A\nrobust, well-capitalized, well-regulated housing finance system is vital to achieving those goals,\nand to the long-run health of our economy. We need a system that provides mortgage credit in\ngood times and bad to a broad range of creditworthy borrowers.\nWhile reforms have addressed some of the problems of the pre-crisis system, there is\nbroad agreement that the job is far from done. The status quo may feel comfortable today, but it\nis also unsustainable. Today, the federal government’s role in housing finance is even greater\nthan it was before the crisis. The overwhelming majority of new mortgages are issued with\ngovernment backing in a highly concentrated securitization market. That leaves us with both\npotential taxpayer liability and systemic risk. It is important to learn the right lessons from the\nfailure of the old system. We can also apply lessons from post-crisis banking reform. Above all,\nwe need to move to a system that attracts ample amounts of private capital to stand between\nhousing sector credit risk and taxpayers. We should also use market forces to increase\ncompetition and help to drive innovation.\n1 The views I express here are my own and not necessarily those of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem.\n\n- 2 -\nThe global financial crisis ended in 2009, and the economy has just completed its eighth\nconsecutive year of expansion. We are near full employment. The housing market is generally\nstrong, although it is still recovering in some regions. To preserve these gains, we must ensure\nthe stability of our financial system. With that goal in mind, we are near completion of a\ncomprehensive program to raise prudential standards for our most systemically important banks.\nBut fundamental housing finance reform--including reform to address the ultimate status of\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two systemically important government sponsored enterprises\n(GSEs)--remains on the “to do” list. As memories of the crisis fade, the next few years may\npresent our last best chance to finish these critical reforms. Failure to do so would risk repeating\nthe mistakes of the past.\nThe Pre-Crisis System\nCongress created Fannie Mae in 1938 and Freddie Mac in 1970. For many years, these\ninstitutions prudently pursued their core mission of enhancing the availability of credit for\nhousing. Beginning in the early 1980s, Fannie and Freddie helped to facilitate the development\nof the securitization market for home mortgages. They purchased and bundled mortgage loans,\nand sold the resulting mortgage-backed securities (MBS) to investors. Fannie and Freddie also\nguaranteed payment of principal and interest on the MBS. With this guarantee in place, MBS\ninvestors took the risk of changing interest rates, and the GSEs took the risk of default on the\nunderlying mortgages. Thanks to the growth in securitization, these two GSEs have dominated\nU.S. housing finance since the late 1980s.\nThe pre-crisis system did its job for many years. By promoting standardization,\nstructuring securities to meet a broad range of investor risk appetites, and issuing guaranteed\n\n- 3 -\nMBS, Fannie and Freddie brought greater liquidity to mortgage markets and made mortgages\nmore affordable. But the system ultimately failed due to fundamental flaws in its structure. In\nthe early days of securitization, the chance that either GSE would ever fail to honor its guarantee\nseemed remote. But the question always loomed in the background: Who would bear the credit\nrisk if a GSE became insolvent and could not perform? Would Congress really allow the GSE to\nfail to honor its obligations, given the devastating impact that would have on mortgage funding\nand the housing market? The law stated explicitly that the government did not stand behind the\nGSEs or their MBS, as Fannie and Freddie frequently pointed out in order to avoid tougher\nregulation. Nonetheless, investors understandably came to believe that the two GSEs were too-\nbig-to-fail, and priced in an implicit federal government guarantee behind GSE obligations. In\nthe end the investors were right, of course. The implicit government guarantee also meant that\ninvestors--including banks, the GSEs themselves, and investors around the world--did not do\ncareful due diligence on the underlying mortgage pools. Thus, securitization also enabled\ndeclining lending standards. This was not only a problem of the GSEs--private label\nsecuritizations also helped to enable lower underwriting standards.\nOver time, the system’s bad incentives caused the two GSEs to change their behavior and\ntake on ever greater risks. The GSEs became powerful advocates for their own bottom lines,\nproviding substantial financial support for political candidates who supported the GSE agenda.\nLegislative reforms in the 1990s and the public/private structure led managements to expand the\nGSEs’ balance sheets to enormous size, underpinned by wafer-thin slivers of capital, driving\nhigh shareholder returns and very high compensation for management. These factors and others\neventually led to extremely lax lending conditions. The early 2000s became the era of Alt-A,\n\n- 4 -\nlow doc, and no doc loans.2 These practices contributed to the catastrophic failure of the housing\nfinance system. Almost nine years ago, in September 2008, Fannie and Freddie were put into\n“temporary” conservatorship and received injections of taxpayer funds totaling $187.5 billion.\nIn the end, the system privatized the gains and socialized the losses.\nThe buildup of risks is clear in hindsight. But many officials and commentators raised\nconcerns long before the collapse.3 The long-standing internal structural weaknesses of the old\nsystem ultimately led to disastrous consequences for homeowners, taxpayers, the financial\nsystem, and the economy.\nReforms to Date\nBefore considering the path forward, it is important to acknowledge that today’s housing\nsector is healthier and in some respects safer than it was in 2005. Although there are significant\nregional differences, national data show that housing prices have fully recovered from their gut-\nwrenching 35 percent drop during the crisis. Mortgage default rates have returned to pre-crisis\nlevels. Mortgage credit is available and affordable for strong borrowers.\n2 See, for example, Markus K. Brunnermeier, “Deciphering the Liquidity and Credit Crunch 2007-2008,” The\nJournal of Economic Perspectives, Vol. 23, No. 1 (Winter 2009), pp. 77-100; Major Coleman IV, Michael LaCour-\nLittle, and Kerry D. Vandell, “Subprime Lending and the Housing Bubble: Tail Wags Dog?” Journal of Housing\nEconomics, Vol.17, Issue 4 (December 2008) pp. 272-290; Shiller, Robert J. (2012) The Subprime Solution: How\nToday’s Global Financial Crisis Happened, and What to Do about It, Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University\nPress; E. Pinto (2015), “Three Studies of Subprime and Alt-A loans in the U.S. Mortgage Market,” American\nEnterprise Institute (January 2015), www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Pinto-Government-Housing-Policies-\nin-the-Lead-up-to-the-Financial-Crisis-3-Studies-1.6.15.pdf.\n3 See, for example, Alan Greenspan, \"Government-Sponsored Enterprises,\" remarks delivered at the Conference on\nHousing, Mortgage Finance, and the Macroeconomy, Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, May 19 2005,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2005/default.htm; and Randal Quarles “Remarks Before the Women in\nHousing and Finance,” June 13, 2006.\n\n- 5 -\nThere has also been meaningful progress in reforming the old system. In 2008, Congress\nenacted the Housing and Economic Recovery Act, which, among other things, created the\nFederal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), modeled on and with similar powers to the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation. Under the FHFA’s oversight, the two GSEs’ retained portfolios\nhave declined to about half of their pre-crisis size, and are expected to continue on a downward\npath. The FHFA and the GSEs have also been working to develop a market for the GSEs to lay\noff their credit risk. These innovative transactions have raised about $50 billion in private capital\nthat now stands between taxpayers and mortgage credit risk in the GSEs’ portfolios. In addition,\nthe creation of a Common Securitization Platform should strengthen the GSEs’ securitization\ninfrastructure and facilitate further reforms with an eye toward enhancing competition.\nNew regulations have also been put in place since the crisis with the goal of encouraging\nsound underwriting of mortgage loans. Today, lenders must make a good faith effort to\ndetermine that the borrower has the ability to repay the mortgage. Moreover, if the lender\nprovides a “qualified mortgage” contract to the borrower, then the lender needs to meet certain\nother requirements.4 For example, some contract features such as an interest-only period or\nnegative amortization, where the loan balance increases even though the borrower is making\npayments, are taboo. Upfront points and fees are limited too.\n4 More specifics on the features required for qualified mortgage contracts are available at\nwww.consumerfinance.gov/askcfpb/1789/what-qualified-mortgage.html.\n\n- 6 -\nToday’s Challenges\nThese reforms represent movement in the right direction, but leave us well short of where\nwe need to be. Despite the GSEs’ significant role in this key market, there is no clarity about\ntheir future. When they were put into conservatorship, Treasury Secretary Paulson noted that\n“policymakers must view this next period as a ‘time out’ where we have stabilized the GSEs\nwhile we decide their future role and structure.”5 Almost nine years into this time out, the federal\ngovernment’s domination of the housing sector has grown and is actually greater than it was\nbefore the crisis. Fannie, Freddie, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and U.S.\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs have a combined market share of about 80 percent of the\npurchase mortgage market, with the remaining 20 percent held by private financial institutions.\nAfter reaching nearly 30 percent of the market before the crisis, private-label securitization has\ndwindled to almost nothing today.\nThe two GSEs remain in government conservatorship, with associated contingent\nliabilities to US taxpayers.6 Fannie and Freddie have remitted just over $270 billion of profits to\nthe Treasury, more than paying back the government’s initial investment. However, under\ncurrent terms of the contracts that govern their access to Treasury funds, their capital will decline\nto $0 by January 1, 2018. Today, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have more than $5 trillion of\nMBS and corporate debt outstanding, which is widely held and receives various forms of special\n5 Statement by Secretary Henry M. Paulson, Jr. on Treasury and Federal Housing Finance Agency Action to Protect\nFinancial Markets and Taxpayers, September 7, 2008, www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-\nreleases/Pages/hp1129.aspx.\n6 The size of these contingent liabilities is potentially quite large. FHFA’s stress test results published in August\n2016 found that under its severely adverse scenario the two GSEs could need to draw up to $125.8 billion from the\nU.S. Treasury. See www.fhfa.gov/AboutUs/Reports/ReportDocuments/2016_DFAST_Severely-Adverse-\nScenario.pdf.\n\n- 7 -\nregulatory treatment. And because of their scale, these enterprises continue to serve as important\nstandard-setters and significant counterparties to other firms.\nWhile mortgage credit is widely available to most traditional mortgage borrowers, those\nwith lower credit scores face significantly higher standards and lower credit availability than\nbefore the crisis. We can all agree that we do not want to go back to the poor underwriting\nstandards used by originators prior to the crisis. But it may also be that the current system is too\nrigid, and that a lack of innovation and product choice has limited mortgage credit availability to\nsome creditworthy households. According to a survey by the American Banker, in 2016 only\nnine percent of mortgage originations failed to meet the qualified mortgage contract criteria,\ndown from 16 percent in 2013.7 The same survey reported that almost one-third of U.S. banks\nmake only qualified mortgage loans, despite the fact that FHA- and GSE-eligible mortgages are\nexempt from the qualified mortgage requirements until January 2021 or until housing finance\nreform is enacted, whichever date comes first.\nApplying the Lessons of Banking Reform to Housing Finance\nThe post-crisis reform program for our largest banks presents an appropriate standard\nagainst which the housing finance giants should be judged. After eight years of reform, our\nlargest banking institutions are now far stronger and safer. Common equity capital held by the\neight U.S. global systemically important banks has more than doubled to $825 billion from about\n$300 billion before the crisis. After the crisis revealed significant underlying liquidity\nvulnerabilities, these institutions now hold $2.3 trillion in high-quality liquid assets, or 25\n7 American Bankers Association, “24th Annual ABA Residential Real Estate Survey Report,” (March 2017),\nwww.aba.com/Press/Documents/2017ABARealEstateLendingSurveyReport.pdf.\n\n- 8 -\npercent of their total assets. Under rigorous annual stress tests, they must demonstrate a high\nlevel of understanding of their risks and the ability to manage them, and must survive severely\nadverse economic scenarios with high levels of post-stress capital. And they must file regular\nresolution plans that have made them significantly more resolvable should they fail. These\nmeasures were implemented to reduce the risk that a future crisis will result in taxpayer support,\nand to help ensure that the financial system could continue to function even in the event that one\nof these banks were to default.\nIt is ironic that the housing finance system should escape fundamental reform efforts.\nThe housing bubble of the early 2000s was, after all, an essential proximate cause of the crisis.\nHousing is the single largest asset class in our financial system, with total outstanding residential\nreal estate owned by households of $24 trillion and roughly $10 trillion in single-family\nmortgage debt.8 While post-crisis regulation has addressed mortgage lending from a consumer\nprotection standpoint, the important risks to taxpayers and the broader economy and financial\nsystem have not been robustly addressed.\nThe most obvious and direct step forward would be to require ample amounts of private\ncapital to support housing finance activities, as we do in the banking system. We should also\nstrive for a system that can continue to function even in the event of a default of any firm. No\nsingle housing finance institution should be too big to fail.\nGreater amounts of private capital could come through a variety of sources, including\nthrough the entry of multiple private guarantors who would insure a portion of the credit risk,\n8 Based on information contained in the Financial Accounts of the United States available at\nwww.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/releases/mortoutstand/current.htm.\n\n- 9 -\nthrough risk-sharing agreements, or through expanded use of credit-risk transfers. Although\nprivate capital must surely be part of the reform effort, there may be limits to the amount of risk\nthat we can credibly expect the private sector to insure. It is extremely difficult to appropriately\nprice the insurance of catastrophic risk--the risk of a severe, widespread housing crisis. Both the\nprivate-sector insurance industry and government have struggled with this, particularly with how\nto smooth the consistent collection of premiums with the irregular payout of potentially\nenormous losses that may be needed only once or twice in a century. Furthermore, losses can be\ncorrelated across asset classes and geographies in these catastrophic events, rendering risk-\ndiversification strategies ineffective. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have successfully transferred\nsome credit risk to the private sector, but have thus far avoided selling off much of this\ncatastrophic credit risk, arguing that doing so is not economical.9\nPrinciples for Reform\nAfter promising legislative initiatives have moved forward but fallen short of enactment,\nthe air is again thick with housing finance reform proposals. As I mentioned at the outset,\nhousing finance reform has important implications for the Federal Reserve’s oversight of\nfinancial institutions, and for the U.S. economy and its financial stability. While I would not\npresume to judge these reform proposals, I will offer some principles for reform. These\n9 See “Overview of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Credit Risk Transfer Transactions,” FHFA (August 2015). The\noverview differentiates between expected loss (credit losses that would be projected to occur even under a stable\nbaseline), unexpected loss (losses that might occur under a stressful but plausible event such as recession) and\ncatastrophic loss (losses beyond those of an unexpected loss and that are deemed highly unlikely to occur). The\noverview notes that “ catastrophic risk events are deemed so unlikely, meaning they present so little risk, that the\nEnterprises have found it to be too costly (not economical) to transfer much of this risk to the private sector,”\nhttps://www.fhfa.gov/aboutus/reports/reportdocuments/crt-overview-8-21-2015.pdf.\n\n- 10 -\nprinciples are based on the lessons learned from the old system’s collapse, and from the\nexperience of post-crisis bank reform.\nFirst, we ought to do whatever we can to make the possibility of future housing bailouts\nas remote as possible. Housing can be a volatile sector, and housing is often found at the heart of\nfinancial crises.10 Our housing finance institutions were not--and are not--structured with that in\nmind. Extreme fluctuations in credit availability for housing hurt vulnerable households, reduce\naffordability and availability, and, as we have seen, can threaten financial stability. As with\nbanks, the goal should be to ensure that our housing finance system can continue to function\neven in the face of significant house price declines and severe economic conditions. Changing\nthe system to attract large amounts of private capital would be a major step toward that goal.\nThe question of the government’s role in the new system is a challenging one for\nCongress. Many of the well-known reform proposals include some role for government. Some\nargue that government cannot avoid bearing the deep-in-the-tail risk of a catastrophic housing\ncrisis. A number of proposals incorporate a government guarantee to cover this risk, to take\neffect after a significant stack of private capital is wiped out.\nThat brings me to my second principle: If Congress chooses to go in this direction, any\nsuch guarantee should be explicit and transparent, and should apply to securities, not to\n10 See for example Carmen M. Reinhart and Kenneth S. Rogoff, “The Aftermath of Financial Crises,” American\nEconomic Review, vol. 99 (May 2009) pp. 466-72; Òscar Jordà, Moritz Schularick, and Alan M. Taylor, “The Great\nMortgaging: Housing Finance, Crises, and Business Cycles,” NBER Working Paper No. 20501 (September 2014),\nwww.nber.org/papers/w20501; and the International Monetary Fund, “Housing Finance and Financial Stability –\nBack to Basics?” Global Financial Stability Report (April 2011),\nwww.imf.org/en/Publications/GFSR/Issues/2016/12/31/~/media/Websites/IMF/imported-flagship-\nissues/external/pubs/ft/GFSR/2011/01/pdf/_chap3pdf.ashx.\n\n- 11 -\ninstitutions. Reform should not leave us with any institutions that are so important as to be\ncandidates for too-big-to-fail.\nThird, we should promote greater competition in this market. The economics of\nsecuritization do not require a duopoly. Yet there is no way for private firms to acquire a GSE\ncharter and enter the industry. This is akin to having only two banks with federal deposit\ninsurance, which would make competition by other banks very difficult. Greater competition\nwould help to reduce the systemic importance of the GSEs, and spur more innovation. Greater\ncompetition also requires a level playing field, allowing secondary market access to a wide-range\nof lenders and thereby giving homebuyers a choice among many potential mortgage lenders and\nproducts.\nFourth, it is worth considering simple approaches that restructure and repurpose parts of\nthe existing architecture of our housing finance system. We know that housing reform is\ndifficult; completely redrawing the system may not be necessary and could complicate the search\nfor a solution. Using the existing architecture would allow for a continued smooth, gradual\ntransition.\nFifth and last, we need to identify and build upon areas of bipartisan agreement. In my\nview, at this late stage we should not be holding out for the perfect answer. We should be\nlooking for the best feasible plan to escape the unacceptable status quo.\nConclusion\nI see two reasons why this is a good time to address the housing finance system’s\nshortcomings. First, the economy and the housing sector are healthy. It would be far more\ndisruptive to implement fundamental structural changes during difficult economic times.\n\n- 12 -\nSecond, memories of the crisis are fading. If Congress does not enact reforms over the next few\nyears, we are at risk of settling for the status quo--a government-dominated mortgage market\nwith insufficient private capital to protect taxpayers, and insufficient competition to drive\ninnovation. There is a serious risk, if not a likelihood, that this state of affairs may persist\nindefinitely, leaving our housing finance system in a semi-permanent limbo. Fortunately, we are\nblessed with a growing menu of reform options available for public vetting. And there appear to\nbe areas of broad agreement among them. One of those plans, or a combination of different\nfeatures of various plans, might well suffice to move us to a better system. Housing finance\nreform will protect taxpayers from another bailout, be good for households and the economy, and\ngo some distance toward mitigating the systemic risk that the GSEs still pose.",

Powell\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\n41st Annual Central Banking Seminar, sponsored by\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of New York\nNew York, New York\nOctober 18, 2017\n\nWe live in a world defined by the rapid pace of technological change. Four of the\nfive largest U.S. companies by market capitalization are classified as “technology\ncompanies,” where the term describes the products that these companies sell and how\nthey operate. Thanks to decades of investment in information technology, especially in\nelectronic communication networks, consumers now expect services to be available\ninstantly at their fingertips. This statement is true for almost every industry and every\naspect of daily life, including financial transactions.\nThis evening, I will consider how technology is changing the delivery of retail\nbanking and payments services. I will discuss the roles of banks, fintech companies, and\nother stakeholders in moving the United States forward to a better payment system. I will\nalso review the Federal Reserve’s collaboration with these payment system stakeholders\nin pursuing that goal. I will argue that, for policymakers as well as the private sector, the\nchallenge is to embrace technology as a means of improving convenience and speed in\nthe delivery of financial services, while also assuring the security and privacy necessary\nto sustain the public’s trust. As always, the views I express here are my own.\nRetail Banking Innovation\nAs with so many sectors of the economy, technology is transforming the retail\nbanking sector. The banking industry has traditionally been characterized by physical\nbranches, privileged access to financial data, and distinct expertise in analyzing such\ndata.1 But in today’s world companies need not be bound by physical infrastructure and\nrelated overhead expenses. For example, companies can take advantage of an explosion\n1 See, e.g., Miklos Dietz, Somesh Khanna, Tunde Olanrewaju, and Kausik Rajgopal, “Cutting Through the\nNoise around Financial Technology,” McKinsey & Company, February, 2016,\nwww.mckinsey.com/industries/financialservices/our-insights/cutting-through-the-noise-around-financial-\ntechnology.\n\n- 2 -\nin available data, and leverage advances in computing power, via cloud computing,\nanalytical tools, and off-the-shelf machine learning tools, to make sense of those data.\nThe banking industry is adjusting to this world, and facing significant challenges to\ntraditional banking business models.\nFor example, today financial technology can support access to credit through\ninnovative approaches to gathering and analyzing data. Historically, a customer seeking\na loan has provided financial statements to a bank or other traditional lending institution.\nMore recently, the use of a fintech platform may allow a lender to quickly monitor and\nanalyze more up-to-date data from a broader range of sources, including those outside of\nthe traditional lending process, to verify an applicant’s identity and make inferences\nabout the applicant’s overall financial health. For example, a business loan applicant\ncould submit information such as shipping data or customer reviews as additional input to\nmore traditional data sources. With this additional information, the bank would have a\nmore complete picture of an applicant’s day-to-day activity and overall financial\ncapacity, and potentially a greater ability to provide credit to customers, including some\nwho might have been otherwise denied a loan based on traditional data.\nFintech firms are also finding ways to use banks’ data, in some cases without\nentering into an explicit partnership with the bank. With customers’ permission, fintech\nfirms have increasingly turned to data aggregators to “screen scrape” information from\nfinancial accounts. In such cases, data aggregators collect and store online banking\nlogins and passwords provided by the bank’s customers and use them to log directly into\nthe customer’s banking account. This information can be used to provide consumers with\n\n- 3 -\nconvenient real-time snapshots of their financial information across multiple banks and\naccounts.\nThese examples highlight that there is a balance that needs to be achieved in this\ninnovative environment.2 On the one hand, new technologies have enabled banks and\nother firms to find different ways of meeting consumers’ demand for speed and\nconvenience. On the other hand, these same technologies raise new considerations about\ndata security and safety, as well as consumer privacy and protection. Policymakers and\nthe financial industry must assure that enhanced convenience and speed in financial\nservices do not undermine the safety, security, and reliability of those services.\nRetail Payments Innovation\nTechnology is also shaping changes in retail payments. As with retail banking,\nretail payments will need to evolve to meet consumer expectations of constant\nconnectivity and instant access while assuring security and privacy.\nIt is not news that consumers’ lives, including the way they pay, are now\nintertwined with mobile phone usage. While the overall amount of time we spend on our\nphones continues to grow, the duration of individual phone sessions is actually shrinking.\nIn late 2015, Google estimated that the average mobile session lasts only 70 seconds, and\nmay be repeated dozens of times per day.3 As a result, payment innovators have had to\ncreate new ways to move money that are not only fast and mobile-focused, but also\n2 See Lael Brainard, “Where Do Banks Fit in the Fintech Stack?” (speech delivered at the Northwestern\nKellogg Public-Private Interface Conference on “New Developments in Consumer Finance: Research &\nPractice,” Evanston, Illinois, April 28, 2017),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20170428a.htm.\n3 “Your Guide to Winning the Shift to Mobile,” Google, Micro-Moments, September 2015,\nhttps://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-resources/micro-moments/micromoments-guide-pdf-\ndownload/.\n\n- 4 -\nsufficiently “frictionless” that consumers can now fit commerce into these brief\ninterludes.\nThis development has ushered in a world of multiple smartphone apps that allow\nfor “instant” payments. We can use a payments app to move funds instantly to anyone\nwho has that app.4 Some banks have similarly collaborated to build faster payments\napplications that leverage their deposit account systems. And we are already moving to a\nworld in which we need not open a special app or go to our bank’s website in order to\nsend money. Many people here will have taken an Uber or Lyft, and then paid your\ndriver without relaunching the app, much less reaching for your wallet. Similarly,\npayment providers can now leverage the application programming interfaces (APIs)—\nessentially the protocols—of smartphone messaging services to integrate their payment\ntools directly into messaging applications: Nowadays, consumers can simply “attach”\nmoney while messaging a friend.\nInnovation in retail payments can also offer tangible benefits to consumers\nbeyond convenience. Improvements in security, such as our ability to authenticate\nconsumers and detect fraudulent transactions, are also possible through innovation. For\ninstance, mobile payments introduce a wide array of ways to authenticate a consumer’s\nidentity, including two-factor authentication codes sent via text message to the phone;\nbiometrics, like a fingerprint or face scan; device identification information; IP address;\nand geolocation data. Similarly, increased access to transaction data and cloud\ncomputing resources means that we have smarter, faster computational processes—like\nenhanced neural networks—to detect payments that do not match a consumer’s spending\n4 Cashing the funds out of the app to use for other payments, however, has traditionally taken longer.\n\n- 5 -\npatterns and help prevent fraudulent transactions. Both security and convenience are\ncrucial elements for successful payments innovation. Consumers will not store their\nfunds in a system that is not secure and will not want to transfer funds out of an otherwise\nsecure system if the process is cumbersome.\nThe Role of Banks in Payments Innovation\nThe examples I have highlighted so far illustrate payments innovations from\nfintech firms and banks alike. I want to spend a moment highlighting the special role of\nbanks in the payments process, and how banks are needed in order to create innovations\nthat can be used broadly across the economy.\nThe traditional role of banks in the payments process has been to hold deposits\nand enable their transfer from one individual or business to another. A depositor might\nwithdraw cash from the bank’s ATM to pay a friend or write a check to make a payment.\nOver time, we have moved from ATMs and paper checks toward electronic payments and\nonline payments through banking platforms—payment methods for which banks are still\nperceived as essential. More recently, consumer-facing technology has become front and\ncenter. At times, the payments process is so seamlessly integrated that one can forget\nthat there is even a bank in the process, as with the Uber and Lyft example. But despite\nthis shift in focus, payments innovation is still fundamentally about how, when, and\nwhere an individual’s deposits can be held, transferred, and packaged with other\ninformation. And banks are still important players in making that happen. Even where\nthis reality is obscured by several layers of technology, there is almost always a bank\ninvolved in consumer transactions.\n\n- 6 -\nGiven their importance in holding and transferring funds, banks continue to have\na key role to play in the design and safety of more efficient retail payment systems.\nWithout bank participation, it would be difficult to change how funds are transferred in a\nway that brings pervasive benefits to consumers. For example, if the aim is to capture the\nspeed and continuous nature of today’s commerce in the payment system as a whole—as\nhas become a focus for many countries, including the United States—it would be difficult\nto do so without banks allowing the transfer of their deposits on a 24x7 real-time basis.\nOf course, individual payment systems are already doing this for consumers within their\nown network. But achieving these benefits on a broad scale would be challenging\nwithout the banking system’s participation, because of the large role banks have in\nholding and transferring funds.\nAll this is to say that we are at a critical juncture in the payment system’s\nevolution, where technology is rapidly changing many facets of the payments process.\nFintech firms and banks are seizing these technological changes in their own ways. But a\ncollective and collaborative effort by all payment stakeholders will also be important as\nthe United States works to achieve a payment system that has broad reach and can\nseamlessly integrate with other systems to transfer funds in a reliable, secure, and\nconvenient manner. When we pay with cash or write a check, we don’t spend a lot of\ntime worrying about who our recipient banks with; that universality seems an appropriate\nstandard for new payment options as well.\nStrategies for Improving the U.S. Payment System\nAt the Federal Reserve, we believe it is important to embrace opportunities\nprovided by technological change to improve the convenience and safety of the U.S.\n\n- 7 -\npayment system. About five years ago, we launched our payment system improvement\ninitiative, which committed the Federal Reserve to working with the full range of\npayments system stakeholders to achieve a faster, more secure payment system. We saw\nthat technology was transforming the nature of commerce and end-user expectations for\npayment services. We saw some players coming to market with innovative product\nofferings, but it was a fragmented approach. Meanwhile, other countries were advancing\non initiatives to improve the speed and safety of their payment systems, creating a gap\nbetween the U.S. payment system and those abroad.\nWhile the Federal Reserve does not have plenary authority over payment systems,\nas is the case in some other countries, we have often played an important role as a leader\nand catalyst for change. It was in this role that we issued a call to action asking\nstakeholders to come together in pursuit of a better payment system for the future—\nfocusing on speed, security, efficiency, international payments, and collaboration.5 I\nbelieve a collaborative approach ensures that change is designed by those whose\ncommitment and expertise are needed to improve the payment system.\nStakeholders – including banks, fintech companies, consumer groups, regulators,\nand others -- answered our call to action, signing up for two task forces convened by the\nFederal Reserve. More than 300 stakeholders joined the Faster Payments Task Force,\nand around 200 joined the Secure Payments Task Force. Let me first touch upon the\nFaster Payments Task Force, which has recently completed its work.6\n5 See Federal Reserve System, “Strategies for Improving the U.S. Payment System,” January 26, 2015,\nhttps://fedpaymentsimprovement.org/wp-content/uploads/strategies-improving-us-payment-system.pdf.\n6 See Faster Payments Task Force (2017), “The U.S. Path to Faster Payments, Final Report Part Two: A\nCall to Action,” https://fasterpaymentstaskforce.org/.\n\n- 8 -\nThe Faster Payments Task Force’s mission was to identify and assess alternative\napproaches for implementing a safe, ubiquitous, faster payments system in the United\nStates. The task force began its work by developing a set of effectiveness criteria laying\nout desirable attributes for faster payment solutions covering the broad categories of\nubiquity, efficiency, safety and security, speed, legal framework, and governance. While\nthe task force was focused on improving speed and convenience, it also underscored the\nimportance of safety and security by establishing 11 criteria of a total of 36 focused on\nthose objectives.\nThe task force encouraged its members to submit proposals for faster payment\nsolutions that would meet the criteria that its members had agreed upon. A diverse range\nof task force members rose to the challenge by submitting 16 proposals to be vetted\nagainst its criteria.7 These proposals represent a broad universe of creative and\ninnovative ways to deliver faster payments by embracing technology. They range in\nstructure from solutions that use a centralized clearing and settlement mechanism to\nothers that focus on distributed networks. Some are based on traditional assets held in\ntransaction accounts, and others depend on new asset forms like digital currencies. The\nrole of the task force process was not to recommend or implement a faster payment\nsolution, but rather to offer a range of ideas to move the United States further along the\npath to a better payment system. We believe that the task force has successfully carried\nout this role.\n7 The task force recommended establishing an external Qualified Independent Assessment Team to conduct\nobjective proposal assessments. On behalf of the task force, the Federal Reserve selected McKinsey &\nCompany to conduct a comprehensive assessment of each faster payment solution proposal against the task\nforce’s set of criteria.\n\n- 9 -\nWe are very grateful to the members of the Faster Payment Task Force for all of\ntheir work and for the collaborative spirit they brought to the job. But there is more to be\ndone to advance our collective vision of a ubiquitous, real-time, secure future payment\nsystem. Last month, the Federal Reserve reaffirmed its commitment to that vision in the\npaper, “Federal Reserve Next Steps in the Payments Improvement Journey,” which\noutlines refreshed strategies and tactics that we, in collaboration with the payment\nindustry, will employ to make further progress. 8 I will mention just a few.\nOne of the recommendations from the Faster Payments Task Force work was to\nestablish an industry governance framework for collaboration and decision-making on\nfaster payments. To move forward in creating this framework, the task force established\nthe Governance Framework Formation Team to develop, publish, and solicit public\ncomment on a proposal for a governance framework. This work group will carry out\nmany of the task force recommendations and the Federal Reserve, at the request of the\ntask force, is chairing and facilitating this effort.\nIn addition, the Federal Reserve is considering providing settlement services—a\ntraditional core function of a central bank—to address the future needs of a ubiquitous\nreal-time retail payments environment. We plan to actively engage with the industry and\nother stakeholders to further understand gaps and requirements for real-time retail\npayments settlement and assess alternative models that will support needs over the long\nterm. We also plan to explore and assess the need, if any, for other related Federal\nReserve services or capabilities. In carrying out this assessment, we will be guided by\n8 See Federal Reserve System, “Federal Reserve Next Steps in the Payments Improvement Journey,”\nSeptember 6, 2017, https://fedpaymentsimprovement.org/wp-content/uploads/next-step-payments-\njourney.pdf.\n\n- 10 -\ncurrent and potential market developments and challenges, as well as our long-\nestablished criteria for offering new products and services. These criteria include the\nneed to fully recover costs over the long term; the expectation that the new service will\nyield clear public benefit; and the expectation that other providers alone cannot be\nexpected to provide the service with a reasonable effectiveness, scope, and equity.9\nThe Federal Reserve will also continue to support the ongoing work of the Secure\nPayments Task Force. This task force has been working to educate stakeholders on\npayment security practices, risks, and actions that could enhance payment security.\nThese are challenging topics, because they require stakeholders to be open and\nforthcoming about potential vulnerabilities if there is to be substantial progress.\nThe Federal Reserve will also pursue two new efforts focused on security. Early\nin 2018, we plan to launch a study analyzing payment security vulnerabilities. This study\nis similar to other research efforts that the Federal Reserve has pursued to build\nfoundational and collective understanding of the U.S. payment system. We also plan to\nbuild upon the contributions of the Secure Payments Task Force to establish work groups\nfocused on approaches for reducing the cost and prevalence of specific payment security\nvulnerabilities. In a world of ever-escalating threats to the integrity of our payment\nsystem, this collective action is needed to sustain public confidence.\nThese were just a few of our new initiatives. The package of next steps the\nFederal Reserve outlined in its recent paper confirm that we remain steadfast in our\ncommitment to work with industry and other stakeholders to achieve a better payment\nsystem through both leadership and action.\n9 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Policies: The Federal Reserve in the Payments\nSystem,” revised 1990, https://www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/pfs_frpaysys.htm.\n\n- 11 -\nSummary\nRapidly changing technology is providing a historic opportunity to transform our\ndaily lives, including the way we pay. Fintech firms and banks are embracing this\nchange, as they strive to address consumer demands for more timely and convenient\npayments. A range of innovative products that seamlessly integrate with other services is\nnow available at our fingertips. It is essential, however, that this innovation not come at\nthe cost of a safe and secure payment system that retains the confidence of its end users.\nThe examples I have drawn upon today highlight that fintech firms and banks must each\nplay a role in assuring that enhancements to convenience and speed do not undermine\nsafety and security. More broadly, the Faster and Secure Payments Task Forces\ndemonstrate the importance of broad and diverse stakeholder input, which are essential if\nthe United States is to implement safe, ubiquitous real-time retail payments. Working\ntogether, we can achieve a safe and fast payments system that meets the evolving needs\nof consumers and our dynamic economy.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n10:05 a.m. EDT (8:05 a.m. MDT)\nAugust 25, 2023\nInflation: Progress and the Path Ahead\nRemarks by\nJerome H. Powell\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Structural Shifts in the Global Economy,” an economic policy symposium\nsponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\nJackson Hole, Wyoming\nAugust 25, 2023\n\nGood morning. At last year’s Jackson Hole symposium, I delivered a brief, direct\nmessage. My remarks this year will be a bit longer, but the message is the same: It is the\nFed’s job to bring inflation down to our 2 percent goal, and we will do so. We have\ntightened policy significantly over the past year. Although inflation has moved down\nfrom its peak—a welcome development—it remains too high. We are prepared to raise\nrates further if appropriate, and intend to hold policy at a restrictive level until we are\nconfident that inflation is moving sustainably down toward our objective.\nToday I will review our progress so far and discuss the outlook and the\nuncertainties we face as we pursue our dual mandate goals. I will conclude with a\nsummary of what this means for policy. Given how far we have come, at upcoming\nmeetings we are in a position to proceed carefully as we assess the incoming data and the\nevolving outlook and risks.\nThe Decline in Inflation So Far\nThe ongoing episode of high inflation initially emerged from a collision between\nvery strong demand and pandemic-constrained supply. By the time the Federal Open\nMarket Committee raised the policy rate in March 2022, it was clear that bringing down\ninflation would depend on both the unwinding of the unprecedented pandemic-related\ndemand and supply distortions and on our tightening of monetary policy, which would\nslow the growth of aggregate demand, allowing supply time to catch up. While these two\nforces are now working together to bring down inflation, the process still has a long way\nto go, even with the more favorable recent readings.\nOn a 12-month basis, U.S. total, or “headline,” PCE (personal consumption\nexpenditures) inflation peaked at 7 percent in June 2022 and declined to 3.3 percent as of\n\n- 2 -\nJuly, following a trajectory roughly in line with global trends (figure 1, panel A).1 The\neffects of Russia’s war against Ukraine have been a primary driver of the changes in\nheadline inflation around the world since early 2022. Headline inflation is what\nhouseholds and businesses experience most directly, so this decline is very good news.\nBut food and energy prices are influenced by global factors that remain volatile, and can\nprovide a misleading signal of where inflation is headed. In my remaining comments, I\nwill focus on core PCE inflation, which omits the food and energy components.\nOn a 12-month basis, core PCE inflation peaked at 5.4 percent in February 2022\nand declined gradually to 4.3 percent in July (figure 1, panel B). The lower monthly\nreadings for core inflation in June and July were welcome, but two months of good data\nare only the beginning of what it will take to build confidence that inflation is moving\ndown sustainably toward our goal. We can’t yet know the extent to which these lower\nreadings will continue or where underlying inflation will settle over coming quarters.\nTwelve-month core inflation is still elevated, and there is substantial further ground to\ncover to get back to price stability.\nTo understand the factors that will likely drive further progress, it is useful to\nseparately examine the three broad components of core PCE inflation—inflation for\ngoods, for housing services, and for all other services, sometimes referred to as\nnonhousing services (figure 2).\nCore goods inflation has fallen sharply, particularly for durable goods, as both\ntighter monetary policy and the slow unwinding of supply and demand dislocations are\n1 Descriptions of PCE inflation include Board staff estimates of the July 2023 values based on available\ninformation, including the July 2023 consumer price index and producer price index data. The July 2023\nPCE inflation data will be published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis on August 31, 2023.\n\n- 3 -\nbringing it down. The motor vehicle sector provides a good illustration. Earlier in the\npandemic, demand for vehicles rose sharply, supported by low interest rates, fiscal\ntransfers, curtailed spending on in-person services, and shifts in preference away from\nusing public transportation and from living in cities. But because of a shortage of\nsemiconductors, vehicle supply actually fell. Vehicle prices spiked, and a large pool of\npent-up demand emerged. As the pandemic and its effects have waned, production and\ninventories have grown, and supply has improved. At the same time, higher interest rates\nhave weighed on demand. Interest rates on auto loans have nearly doubled since early\nlast year, and customers report feeling the effect of higher rates on affordability.2 On net,\nmotor vehicle inflation has declined sharply because of the combined effects of these\nsupply and demand factors.\nSimilar dynamics are playing out for core goods inflation overall. As they do, the\neffects of monetary restraint should show through more fully over time. Core goods\nprices fell the past two months, but on a 12-month basis, core goods inflation remains\nwell above its pre-pandemic level. Sustained progress is needed, and restrictive monetary\npolicy is called for to achieve that progress.\nIn the highly interest-sensitive housing sector, the effects of monetary policy\nbecame apparent soon after liftoff. Mortgage rates doubled over the course of 2022,\ncausing housing starts and sales to fall and house price growth to plummet. Growth in\nmarket rents soon peaked and then steadily declined (figure 3).3\n2 For example, 25 percent of respondents to the most recent University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers\nreported that it is currently a bad time to buy a new vehicle because of higher interest rates and tighter\ncredit conditions, up from only 4 percent of respondents in 2021. For more information, see the\npreliminary results of the August 2023 survey, available on the University of Michigan’s website at\nhttp://www.sca.isr.umich.edu.\n3 This slowing in rent growth has likely occurred for a combination of reasons. Some of it likely reflects\nhigher interest rates and the softening in real household income growth over the past couple of years. But\n\n- 4 -\nMeasured housing services inflation lagged these changes, as is typical, but has\nrecently begun to fall. This inflation metric reflects rents paid by all tenants, as well as\nestimates of the equivalent rents that could be earned from homes that are owner\noccupied.4 Because leases turn over slowly, it takes time for a decline in market rent\ngrowth to work its way into the overall inflation measure. The market rent slowdown has\nonly recently begun to show through to that measure. The slowing growth in rents for\nnew leases over roughly the past year can be thought of as “in the pipeline” and will\naffect measured housing services inflation over the coming year. Going forward, if\nmarket rent growth settles near pre-pandemic levels, housing services inflation should\ndecline toward its pre-pandemic level as well. We will continue to watch the market rent\ndata closely for a signal of the upside and downside risks to housing services inflation.\nThe final category, nonhousing services, accounts for over half of the core PCE\nindex and includes a broad range of services, such as health care, food services,\ntransportation, and accommodations. Twelve-month inflation in this sector has moved\nsideways since liftoff. Inflation measured over the past three and six months has\ndeclined, however, which is encouraging. Part of the reason for the modest decline of\nnonhousing services inflation so far is that many of these services were less affected by\nthe normalization of dislocations due to the pandemic is likely playing a role here as well. For example, the\nshifts in housing preferences related to working from home likely contributed to the increase in housing\ndemand reflected in the sizable earlier increases in rents. As the price effects of that demand shift played\nout, the growth rate of rents would naturally decline toward its earlier trend. Finally, multifamily\nconstruction is quite high by historical standards, and that supply coming on line has likely also taken some\npressure off market rents.\n4 PCE prices for housing services include both the rents paid by tenants and an imputed rental value for\nowner-occupied dwellings (measured as the income the homeowner could have received if the house had\nbeen rented to a tenant). For additional details, see Bureau of Economic Analysis (2022), “Rental Income\nof Persons,” in NIPA Handbook: Concepts and Methods of the U.S. National Income and Product\nAccounts (Washington: BEA, December), pp. 12-1–12-15,\nhttps://www.bea.gov/resources/methodologies/nipa-handbook/pdf/chapter-12.pdf.\n\n- 5 -\nglobal supply chain bottlenecks and are generally thought to be less interest sensitive than\nother sectors such as housing or durable goods. Production of these services is also\nrelatively labor intensive, and the labor market remains tight. Given the size of this\nsector, some further progress here will be essential to restoring price stability. Over time,\nrestrictive monetary policy will help bring aggregate supply and demand back into better\nbalance, reducing inflationary pressures in this key sector.\nThe Outlook\nTurning to the outlook, although further unwinding of pandemic-related\ndistortions should continue to put some downward pressure on inflation, restrictive\nmonetary policy will likely play an increasingly important role. Getting inflation\nsustainably back down to 2 percent is expected to require a period of below-trend\neconomic growth as well as some softening in labor market conditions.\nEconomic growth\nRestrictive monetary policy has tightened financial conditions, supporting the\nexpectation of below-trend growth.5 Since last year’s symposium, the two-year real yield\nis up about 250 basis points, and longer-term real yields are higher as well—by nearly\n150 basis points.6 Beyond changes in interest rates, bank lending standards have\ntightened, and loan growth has slowed sharply.7 Such a tightening of broad financial\n5 For an example of how tighter financial conditions affect economic activity, see the Federal Reserve\nBoard staff’s new index measuring U.S. financial conditions through their effect on the outlook for growth;\nthe index is discussed in Andrea Ajello, Michele Cavallo, Giovanni Favara, William B. Peterman, John W.\nSchindler IV, and Nitish R. Sinha (2023), “A New Index to Measure U.S. Financial Conditions,” FEDS\nNotes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, June 30),\nhttps://doi.org/10.17016/2380-7172.3281.\n6 Changes in real yields cited in this sentence refer to changes in yields on 2- and 10-year Treasury\nInflation-Protected Securities.\n7 In addition, as the policy rate increased, nonbanking lending conditions changed as well. For example,\nbeginning in 2022 and continuing into the first half of this year, net issuance of riskier debt—such as\nleveraged loans and speculative-grade and unrated corporate bonds—in public credit markets declined.\n\n- 6 -\nconditions typically contributes to a slowing in the growth of economic activity, and there\nis evidence of that in this cycle as well. For example, growth in industrial production has\nslowed, and the amount spent on residential investment has declined in each of the past\nfive quarters (figure 4).\nBut we are attentive to signs that the economy may not be cooling as expected.\nSo far this year, GDP (gross domestic product) growth has come in above expectations\nand above its longer-run trend, and recent readings on consumer spending have been\nespecially robust. In addition, after decelerating sharply over the past 18 months, the\nhousing sector is showing signs of picking back up. Additional evidence of persistently\nabove-trend growth could put further progress on inflation at risk and could warrant\nfurther tightening of monetary policy.\nThe labor market\nThe rebalancing of the labor market has continued over the past year but remains\nincomplete. Labor supply has improved, driven by stronger participation among workers\naged 25 to 54 and by an increase in immigration back toward pre-pandemic levels.\nIndeed, the labor force participation rate of women in their prime working years reached\nan all-time high in June. Demand for labor has moderated as well. Job openings remain\nhigh but are trending lower. Payroll job growth has slowed significantly. Total hours\nworked has been flat over the past six months, and the average workweek has declined to\nthe lower end of its pre-pandemic range, reflecting a gradual normalization in labor\nmarket conditions (figure 5).\nThis rebalancing has eased wage pressures. Wage growth across a range of\nmeasures continues to slow, albeit gradually (figure 6). While nominal wage growth\n\n- 7 -\nmust ultimately slow to a rate that is consistent with 2 percent inflation, what matters for\nhouseholds is real wage growth. Even as nominal wage growth has slowed, real wage\ngrowth has been increasing as inflation has fallen.\nWe expect this labor market rebalancing to continue. Evidence that the tightness\nin the labor market is no longer easing could also call for a monetary policy response.\nUncertainty and Risk Management along the Path Forward\nTwo percent is and will remain our inflation target. We are committed to\nachieving and sustaining a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to\nbring inflation down to that level over time. It is challenging, of course, to know in real\ntime when such a stance has been achieved. There are some challenges that are common\nto all tightening cycles. For example, real interest rates are now positive and well above\nmainstream estimates of the neutral policy rate. We see the current stance of policy as\nrestrictive, putting downward pressure on economic activity, hiring, and inflation. But\nwe cannot identify with certainty the neutral rate of interest, and thus there is always\nuncertainty about the precise level of monetary policy restraint.\nThat assessment is further complicated by uncertainty about the duration of the\nlags with which monetary tightening affects economic activity and especially inflation.\nSince the symposium a year ago, the Committee has raised the policy rate by 300 basis\npoints, including 100 basis points over the past seven months. And we have substantially\nreduced the size of our securities holdings. The wide range of estimates of these lags\nsuggests that there may be significant further drag in the pipeline.\nBeyond these traditional sources of policy uncertainty, the supply and demand\ndislocations unique to this cycle raise further complications through their effects on\n\n- 8 -\ninflation and labor market dynamics. For example, so far, job openings have declined\nsubstantially without increasing unemployment—a highly welcome but historically\nunusual result that appears to reflect large excess demand for labor. In addition, there is\nevidence that inflation has become more responsive to labor market tightness than was\nthe case in recent decades.8 These changing dynamics may or may not persist, and this\nuncertainty underscores the need for agile policymaking.\nThese uncertainties, both old and new, complicate our task of balancing the risk\nof tightening monetary policy too much against the risk of tightening too little. Doing too\nlittle could allow above-target inflation to become entrenched and ultimately require\nmonetary policy to wring more persistent inflation from the economy at a high cost to\nemployment. Doing too much could also do unnecessary harm to the economy.\nConclusion\nAs is often the case, we are navigating by the stars under cloudy skies. In such\ncircumstances, risk-management considerations are critical. At upcoming meetings, we\nwill assess our progress based on the totality of the data and the evolving outlook and\nrisks. Based on this assessment, we will proceed carefully as we decide whether to\ntighten further or, instead, to hold the policy rate constant and await further data.\n8 The relationship between labor market slack and inflation, often called the Phillips curve relationship, is\nlikely nonlinear, steepening in a tight labor market. If the Phillips curve has steepened in this way, a small\nchange in labor market tightness could result in a more substantial change in inflation. It is difficult to\nknow with precision how steep that relationship is in real time or how it might evolve as labor market\ntightness changes. For more information on nonlinearities in this relationship, see Christoph E. Boehm and\nNitya Pandalai-Nayar (2022), “Convex Supply Curves,” American Economic Review, vol. 112 (December),\npp. 3941–69; Pierpaolo Benigno and Gauti B. Eggertsson (2023), “It’s Baaack: The Surge in Inflation in\nthe 2020s and the Return of the Non-Linear Phillips Curve,” NBER Working Paper Series 31197\n(Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic Research, April),\nhttps://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w31197/w31197.pdf; and Nicolas Petrosky-Nadeau, Lu\nZhang, and Lars-Alexander Kuehn (2018), “Endogenous Disasters,” American Economic Review, vol. 108\n(August), pp. 2212–45.\n\n- 9 -\nRestoring price stability is essential to achieving both sides of our dual mandate. We will\nneed price stability to achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that\nbenefit all.\nWe will keep at it until the job is done.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Powell\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n2019 SIEPR Economic Summit\nStanford Institute of Economic Policy Research\nStanford, California\nMarch 8, 2019\n\nThank you for the opportunity to speak here today at the Stanford Institute for\nEconomic Policy Research, a place dedicated to scholarship supporting policies to better\npeoples’ lives. As today is International Women’s Day, I would like to preface my\nremarks by commending the American Economic Association for highlighting the\ndiversity challenges of the economics profession and charting a way forward. Diversity\nis also a priority at the Fed: I want the Fed to be known within the economics profession\nas a great place for women, minorities, and others of diverse backgrounds to be\nrespected, listened to, and happy.\nJust over 10 years ago, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC, or the\nCommittee) lowered the federal funds rate close to zero, which we refer to as the\neffective lower bound, or ELB. Unable to lower rates further, the Committee turned to\ntwo novel tools to promote the recovery. The first was forward guidance, which is\ncommunication about the future path of interest rates. The second was large-scale\npurchases of longer-term securities, which became known as quantitative easing, or QE.\nThere is a range of views, but most studies have found that these tools provided\nsignificant support for the recovery. From the outset, the Committee viewed them as\nextraordinary measures to be unwound, or “normalized,” when conditions ultimately\nwarranted.\nToday I will explore some important features of normalization and then turn to\nwhat comes after. In some ways, we are returning to the pre-crisis normal. In other\nways, things will be different. The world has moved on in the last decade, and\nattempting to re-create the past would be neither practical nor wise. As normalization\nmoves into its later stages, my colleagues and I also believe that this is an important\n\n- 2 -\nmoment to take stock of issues raised by the remarkable experiences of the past decade.\nWe are therefore conducting a review of the Fed’s monetary policy strategy, tools, and\ncommunications practices. I will conclude with some thoughts on the review.\nBalance Sheet Normalization\nBetween December 2008 and October 2014, the Federal Reserve purchased\n$3.7 trillion in longer-term Treasury and agency securities in order to support the\neconomy both by easing dislocations in market functioning and by driving down longer-\nterm interest rates. Consistent with the Committee’s long-stated intention, in October\n2017 we started the process of balance sheet normalization. We began gradually\nreducing the reinvestment of payments received as assets matured or were prepaid,\nallowing our holdings to shrink. The process of reducing the size of the portfolio is now\nwell along.\nTo frame the discussion of the final stages of normalization of the size of the\nbalance sheet, it is useful to consider what the phrase “normal balance sheet” meant in the\ndecades before the crisis. During that period, the main monetary policy decision for the\nFOMC was choosing a target value for the federal funds rate. Subject to that choice, the\nFed allowed the demand for its liabilities to determine the size of the balance sheet. This\nis a feature of “normal” that we are returning to: After normalization, the size of the\nFed’s balance sheet will once again be driven by the demand for our liabilities.\nTo see what this means, consider figure 1, which shows the size of the Fed’s\nbalance sheet through time, as measured by total liabilities. The values are stated as a\npercentage of the dollar value of GDP, or gross domestic product.1 Liabilities began to\n1 The balance sheet had been steady at around 5 percent of GDP since about 1980, as currency slowly grew\nas a share of GDP, but the increase was offset by a decline in reserves.\n\n- 3 -\ngrow sharply at the end of 2008 and continued to increase until the end of 2014. Since\nthat time, liabilities relative to GDP have fallen appreciably. To understand these\nchanges, it is useful to focus on a snapshot of the balance sheet at three points in time:\nbefore the crisis, when the balance sheet was at its largest, and a rough projection for the\nend of this year (table 1).\nIn 2006, the dominant liability was currency held by the public, and the dominant\nasset was Treasury securities. The Fed’s asset purchase programs increased the balance\nsheet from just below 6 percent to nearly 25 percent of GDP by the end of 2014.2\nBalance sheets must balance, of course, and the Fed issued reserves as payment for the\nassets purchased. This action pushed reserves to nearly 15 percent of GDP.\nThe Committee has long said that the size of the balance sheet will be considered\nnormalized when the balance sheet is once again at the smallest level consistent with\nconducting monetary policy efficiently and effectively. Just how large that will be is\nuncertain, because we do not yet have a clear sense of the normal level of demand for our\nliabilities. Current estimates suggest, however, that something in the ballpark of the\n2019:Q4 projected values may be the new normal. The normalized balance sheet may be\nsmaller or larger than that estimate and will grow gradually over time as demand for\ncurrency rises with the economy. In all plausible cases, the balance sheet will be\nconsiderably larger than before the crisis.\nTo understand the differences between the new and old normal, consider the final\ncolumn in the table, which shows the change, measured in percentage points of GDP,\nbetween 2006:Q4 and the 2019:Q4 projection in the table. In this estimate, relative to\n2 This size is similar to that of the balance sheet relative to GDP in the wake of the Great Depression.\n\n- 4 -\nbefore the crisis, the balance sheet will have grown as a share of GDP by about\n10.6 percentage points. Bank reserves account for the biggest part of the growth, or\nabout 5.6 percent of GDP. The crisis revealed that banks, especially the largest and most\ncomplex, faced much more liquidity risk than had previously been thought. Because of\nboth new liquidity regulations and improved management, banks now hold much higher\nlevels of high-quality liquid assets than before the crisis. Many banks choose to hold\nreserves as an important part of their strong liquidity positions.\nThe rest of the increase in liabilities is accounted for by three other categories.\nFirst, public currency holdings will have grown by 2.4 percentage points as a share of\nGDP. Second, the U.S. Treasury maintains an account at the Fed, which has been\nrunning 1.4 percentage points higher as a share of GDP. And, third, other liabilities,\nwhich are mainly associated with the mechanics of the national and international\nfinancial system, will have grown by 1.1 percentage points.\nAs was the case before the crisis, the FOMC’s chosen operating regime for\ncontrolling short-term interest rates also plays a role in determining the appropriate\nquantity of reserves. In January, the Committee stated its intention to continue in our\ncurrent regime in which our main policy rate, the federal funds rate or possibly some\nsuccessor, is held within its target range by the interest rates we set on reserves and on the\novernight reverse repo facility.3 In this system, active management of the supply of\nreserves is not required. Thus, the supply of reserves must be “ample,” in the sense of\nbeing sufficient to satisfy reserve demands even in the face of volatility in factors\n3 As noted in the minutes of the November 2018 FOMC meeting (see\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20181108.htm), participants discussed costs\nand benefits of various alternatives to the federal funds rate, such as the overnight bank funding rate, and\nrecommended further study of the issue.\n\n- 5 -\naffecting the reserve market.4 Put another way, the quantity of reserves will equal the\ntypical reserve demands of depositories plus a buffer to allow for reserve market\nfluctuations.\nWhile the precise level of reserves that will prove ample is uncertain, standard\nprojections, such as those in the table, suggest we could be near that level later this year.\nAs we feel our way cautiously to this goal, we will move transparently and predictably in\norder to minimize needless market disruption and risks to our dual-mandate objectives.\nThe Committee is now well along in our discussions of a plan to conclude balance sheet\nrunoff later this year. Once balance sheet runoff ends, we may, if appropriate, hold the\nsize of the balance sheet constant for a time to allow reserves to very gradually decline to\nthe desired level as other liabilities, such as currency, increase. We expect to announce\nfurther details of this plan reasonably soon.\nThere is no real precedent for the balance sheet normalization process, and we\nhave adapted our approach along the way. In these final phases, we will adjust the details\nof our normalization plans if economic and financial conditions warrant. After decisions\nregarding the size of the balance sheet have been made, we will turn to remaining issues,\nsuch as the ultimate maturity composition of the portfolio. The Committee has long\nstated that it intends to return to a portfolio consisting primarily of Treasury securities.\nForward Guidance and the Normalization of Policy Communication\nThe Committee has also been normalizing communication about our policy after a\ndecade of forward guidance. Since December 2008, the FOMC’s postmeeting statement\nhad contained ever-evolving forms of guidance about keeping the federal funds rate at the\n4 Both supply and demand factors can show large fluctuations.\n\n- 6 -\nELB or about the gradual pace at which that rate would return to more normal levels. We\nremoved the last elements of this crisis-era guidance in January.5 The federal funds rate\nis now within the broad range of estimates of the neutral rate--the interest rate that tends\nneither to stimulate nor to restrain the economy. Committee participants generally agree\nthat this policy stance is appropriate to promote our dual mandate of maximum\nemployment and price stability. Future adjustments will depend on what incoming data\ntell us about the baseline outlook and risks to that outlook.\nPolicy communication will not simply revert to the ways of the early 2000s,\nhowever, for transparency advances have continued apace since then. The most\nsignificant change from the standpoint of forward guidance is that, since January 2012,\nthe FOMC’s quarterly Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) has included federal\nfunds rate projections reaching up to three years into the future--often referred to as the\n“dot plot.” Returning to a world of little or no explicit forward guidance in the FOMC’s\npostmeeting statement presents a challenge, for the dot plot has, on occasion, been a\nsource of confusion. Until now, forward guidance in the statement has been a main tool\nfor communicating committee intentions and minimizing that confusion.\nFor example, in early 2014, the Committee’s intentions were at odds with a\ncommon misreading of the dots, and Chair Yellen explained, “[O]ne should not look to\nthe dot plot, so to speak, as the primary way in which the Committee wants to or is\nspeaking about policy to the public at large. The FOMC statement is the device that the\n5 Of course, “patience” as used in the January FOMC statement (see\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20190130a.htm) might be seen as\nforward guidance. This type of guidance was used at times before the crisis and may play a role in the\nfuture. It is not, however, the explicit guidance about the medium-term level or direction of rates that\ndistinguished the crisis-era guidance.\n\n- 7 -\nCommittee as a policymaking group uses to express its opinions . . . about the likely path\nof rates.”6 If the Committee remains largely out of the business of explicit forward\nguidance, we will need to find other ways to address the collateral confusion that\nsometimes surrounds the dots.\nAs readers of the FOMC minutes will know, at our last meeting in January there\nwas an impromptu discussion among some participants of general concerns about the\ndots. My own view is that, if properly understood, the dot plot can be a constructive\nelement of comprehensive policy communication. Let me follow my two predecessors as\nChair in attempting to advance that proper understanding.\nEach participant’s dots reflect that participant’s view of the policy that would be\nappropriate in the scenario that he or she sees as most likely. As someone who has filled\nout an SEP projection 27 times over the last seven years, I can say that there are times\nwhen I feel that something like the “most likely” scenario I write down is, indeed,\nreasonably likely to happen. At other times, when uncertainty around the outlook is\nunusually high, I dutifully write down what I see as the appropriate funds rate path in the\nmost likely scenario, but I do so aware that this projection may be easily misinterpreted,\nfor what is “most likely” may not be particularly likely. Very different scenarios may be\nsimilarly likely. Further, at times downside risks may deserve significant weight in\npolicy deliberations. In short, as Chairman Bernanke explained, the SEP projections are\nmerely “inputs” to policy that do not convey “the risks, the uncertainties, all the things\nthat inform our collective judgment.”7\n6 See page 9 of Chair Yellen’s March 2014 press conference transcript, available at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/mediacenter/files/FOMCpresconf20140319.pdf.\n7 See page 6 of Chairman Bernanke’s April 2012 press conference transcript, available at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/mediacenter/files/FOMCpresconf20120425.pdf. Note that the SEP does\n\n- 8 -\nEffectively conveying our views about risks and their role in policy projections\ncan be challenging at times, and we are always looking for ways to improve our\ncommunications. I have asked the communications subcommittee of the FOMC to\nexplore ways in which we can more effectively communicate about the role of the rate\nprojections. For now, let me leave you with a cautionary tale about focusing too much on\ndots. Here is a picture composed of different colored dots (figure 2). The meaning of it\nis not clear, although if you stare at it long enough you might see a pattern. But let’s take\na step back (figure 3). As you can see, if you are too focused on a few dots, you may\nmiss the larger picture.\nDelivering on the FOMC’s intention to ultimately normalize policy continues to\nbe a major priority at the Fed. Normalization is far along, and, considering the\nunprecedented nature of the exercise, it is proceeding smoothly. I am confident that we\ncan effectively manage the remaining stages.\nBeyond Normalization\nWe live in a time of intense scrutiny and declining trust in public institutions\naround the world. At the Fed, we are committed to working hard to build and sustain the\npublic’s trust. The Fed has special responsibilities in this regard. Our monetary policy\nindependence allows us to serve the public without regard to short-term political\nconsiderations, which, as history has shown, is critical for sound monetary policymaking.\nBut that precious grant of independence brings with it a special obligation to be open and\ntransparent, welcoming scrutiny by the public and their elected representatives in\nCongress. Only in this way can the Fed maintain its legitimacy in our democratic system.\nprovide some general information about the balance of risks, but this information is far less complete than\nthe detail provided on the modal outlook.\n\n- 9 -\nAmong other initiatives, my colleagues and I on the FOMC are undertaking a\nyear-long review of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy strategy, tools, and\ncommunication practices. The review will involve a series of “Fed Listens” events\naround the country. These will include town-hall-style meetings and a conference where\nacademic and nonacademic experts will share their views. These events will inform staff\nwork and FOMC discussions as we plan for the future. While this is the first time the\nFed has opened itself up in this way, many central banks around the world have\nconducted similar reviews, and our approach builds on their experiences.\nWe believe that our existing framework for conducting monetary policy has\ngenerally served the public well, and the review may or may not produce major changes.\nConsistent with the experience of other central banks with these reviews, the process is\nmore likely to produce evolution rather than revolution. We seek no changes in law and\nwe are not considering fundamental changes in the structure of the Fed, or in the 2\npercent inflation objective. While there is a high bar for adopting fundamental change, it\nsimply seems like good institutional practice to engage broadly with the public as part of\na comprehensive approach to enhanced transparency and accountability.\nWithout ruling out other topics, we have highlighted three questions that seem\nparticularly important at present (figure 4):\n1. Can the Federal Reserve best meet its statutory objectives with its\nexisting monetary policy strategy, or should it consider strategies that aim to\nreverse past misses of the inflation objective?\n\n- 10 -\n2. Are the existing monetary policy tools adequate to achieve and\nmaintain maximum employment and price stability, or should the toolkit be\nexpanded?\n3. How can the FOMC’s communication of its policy framework and\nimplementation be improved?\nI would like to spend a few minutes discussing the first topic. Because interest\nrates around the world have steadily declined for several decades, rates in normal times\nnow tend to be much closer to zero than in the past (figure 5).8 Thus, when a recession\ncomes, the Fed is likely to have less capacity to cut interest rates to stimulate the\neconomy than in the past, suggesting that trips to the ELB may be more frequent. The\npost-crisis period has seen many economies around the world stuck for an extended\nperiod at the ELB, with slow growth and inflation well below target. Persistently weak\ninflation could lead inflation expectations to drift downward, which would imply still\nlower interest rates, leaving even less room for central banks to cut interest rates to\nsupport the economy during a downturn. It is therefore very important for central banks\nto find more effective ways to battle the low-inflation syndrome that seems to accompany\nproximity to the ELB.\nIn the late 1990s, motivated by the Japanese experience with deflation and\nsluggish economic performance, economists began developing the argument that a\ncentral bank might substantially reduce the economic costs of ELB spells by adopting a\nmakeup strategy.9 The simplest version goes like this: If a spell with interest rates near\n8 For evidence on the secular decline in interest rates in the United States and abroad, see King and Low\n(2014); Holston, Laubach, and Williams (2017); Rachel and Smith (2017); and Brand, Bielecki, and\nPenalver (2018).\n9 See Reifschneider and Williams (2000) and references therein.\n\n- 11 -\nthe ELB leads to a persistent shortfall of inflation relative to the central bank’s goal, once\nthe ELB spell ends, the central bank would deliberately make up for the lost inflation by\nstimulating the economy and temporarily pushing inflation modestly above the target. In\nstandard macroeconomic models, if households and businesses are confident that this\nfuture inflationary stimulus will be coming, that prospect will promote anticipatory\nconsumption and investment. This can substantially reduce the economic costs of ELB\nspells.10 Researchers have suggested many variations on makeup strategies.11 For\nexample, the central bank could target average inflation over time, implying that misses\non either side of the target would be offset.\nBy the time of the crisis, there was a well-established body of model-based\nresearch suggesting that some kind of makeup policy could be beneficial.12 In light of\nthis research, one might ask why the Fed and other major central banks chose not to\npursue such a policy.13 The answer lies in the uncertain distance between models and\nreality. For makeup strategies to achieve their stabilizing benefits, households and\nbusinesses must be quite confident that the “makeup stimulus” is really coming. This\nconfidence is what prompts them to raise spending and investment in the midst of a\ndownturn. In models, confidence in the policy is merely an assumption. In practice,\n10 Eggertsson and Woodford (2003), for example, show that optimal policy at the ELB entails a\ncommitment to reflate the price level during subsequent economic expansions. See also Wolman (2005)\nfor a discussion of the effectiveness of price-level targeting at the ELB. For a discussion of the relationship\nbetween price-level targeting and average-inflation targeting, see Nessén and Vestin (2005).\n11 The strategy in Reifschneider and Williams (2000), for instance, involves a central bank following a\nTaylor rule modified to make up for shortfalls in policy accommodation during ELB episodes. Kiley and\nRoberts (2017) study a strategy in which policymakers aim for inflation higher than 2 percent during\nnormal times to compensate for below-target inflation during ELB episodes. See also Bernanke (2017) for\na strategy in which low inflation is made up if it occurs when the federal funds rate is at or near the ELB.\n12 See, for example, English, López-Salido, and Tetlow (2015); Hebden and López-Salido (2018);\nBernanke, Kiley, and Roberts (2019); and Mertens and Williams (2019).\n13 The Bank of Japan (2016) came closest, announcing in September 2016 an “inflation-overshooting\ncommitment” (p. 1). The commitment did not, however, come with any explicit goal for a degree or\nduration of overshoot.\n\n- 12 -\nwhen policymakers considered these policies in the wake of the crisis, they had major\nquestions about whether a central bank’s promise of good times to come would have\nmoved the hearts, minds, and pocketbooks of the public. Part of the problem is that when\nthe time comes to deliver the inflationary stimulus, that policy is likely to be unpopular--\nwhat is known as the time consistency problem in economics.14\nExperience in the United States and around the world suggests that more frequent\nELB episodes could prove quite costly in the future. My FOMC colleagues and I believe\nthat we have a responsibility to the American people to consider policies that might\npromote significantly better economic outcomes. Makeup strategies are probably the\nmost prominent idea and deserve serious attention. They are largely untried, however,\nand we have reason to question how they would perform in practice. Before they could\nbe successfully implemented, there would have to be widespread societal understanding\nand acceptance--as I suggested, a high bar for any fundamental change. In this review,\nwe seek to start a discussion about makeup strategies and other policies that might\nbroadly benefit the American people.\nConclusion\nTonight I have focused on policy normalization and our efforts to engage the\npublic in what may come after. Before concluding, I will say a few words on current\nconditions and the outlook.\n14 Transcripts of FOMC discussions (see, for example, 2011 transcripts, available at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomchistorical2011.htm) reveal that some policymakers\nwere dubious about whether it would be appropriate or even feasible for a current FOMC to bind a future\nFOMC to a policy that it might find objectionable, which contributed to more general doubts over whether\nthe policy would be credible.\n\n- 13 -\nRight now, most measures of the health and strength of the labor market look as\nfavorable as they have in many decades. Inflation will probably run a bit below our\nobjective for a time due to declines in energy prices, but those effects are likely to prove\ntransitory. Core inflation, which is often a reliable indicator of where inflation is headed\nover time, is quite close to 2 percent. Despite this favorable picture, we have seen some\ncross-currents in recent months. With nothing in the outlook demanding an immediate\npolicy response and particularly given muted inflation pressures, the Committee has\nadopted a patient, wait-and-see approach to considering any alteration in the stance of\npolicy.\nConsidering monetary policy more broadly, we are inviting thorough public\nscrutiny and are hoping to foster conversation regarding how the Fed can best exercise\nthe precious monetary policy independence we have been granted. Our goal is to\nenhance the public’s trust in the Federal Reserve--our most valuable asset.\n\n- 14 -\nReferences\nBank of Japan (2016). “New Framework for Strengthening Monetary Easing:\n‘Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing with Yield Curve Control’,”\nannouncement, September 21,\nhttps://www.boj.or.jp/en/announcements/release_2016/k160921a.pdf.\nBernanke, Ben S.

    "text": "For release on delivery\n2:40 p.m. EDT\nMay 25, 2025\nBaccalaureate Remarks\nRemarks by\nJerome H. Powell\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nPrinceton University\nPrinceton, New Jersey\nMay 25, 2025\n\nThank you, President Eisgruber, for the opportunity to speak here today.\nCongratulations to the Princeton University class of 2025 on the tremendous achievement\nof earning your degree, and to the parents, family members, friends, and mentors whose\nsupport and encouragement made this day possible.\nFifty years ago, almost to the day, I was sitting where you are now, listening\nto…a speaker…deliver a speech…neither of which I can recall. What I plan to do today\nis to share some things with you that I believe would have been useful for me to hear\nback then.\nFor those of you who are fundamentally unsure about your path, I was you.\nRather than studying, I had spent my freshman year with fellow campus musicians\nplaying my Martin D-35 acoustic guitar. It was a high school graduation present, one\nthat my parents surely regretted.\nWhile I still play that guitar, my freshman grades said clearly that I needed to get\nmy act together academically, and by senior year I had done so. But I had no real plan\nfor life after Princeton. I grew up in Washington, D.C., and majored in politics. As you\nknow, Princeton graduates have a long and distinguished record of service to the nation\nand to humanity. That left me with a single thought, which was that I wanted to have a\nprivate sector career and also serve periodically in government. I was thinking of people\nlike Princeton’s George Shultz, a giant of that era. There are countless other examples\nacross the political spectrum, including presidents, senators, members of Congress,\ngovernors, and judges. Of course, most of those who serve are not public figures. I\ncould just as well point to classmates who devoted their working lives to teaching high\nschool kids—there is no higher calling.\n\n- 2 -\nMany of my classmates and friends went straight into prestigious graduate\nschools, politics, or Wall Street. Others went on to global capitals, the military, or the\nPeace Corps. I had brushed off my parents’ one academic suggestion, which was to\nmajor in economics, which struck me as boring and useless. After 13 years at the Fed, I\nadmit I was wrong about that!\nAfter graduation, I had no plan and no job, and wound up putting labels on\nshelves in a warehouse for six months. I didn’t feel great about that. One of my closest\nfriends was getting a master’s at Stanford, and I could only think—“Nice going, Jay.\nYou really nailed it.” In hindsight, that time in the warehouse was a blessing, and exactly\nwhat I needed. The next fall I entered law school, and for the first time I was highly\nresolved to make the most of the opportunity.\nYou know what? We all move at our own pace, and that’s ok. Fifty years later I\ncan tell you something I did not know then: The vast majority of what you need to know\nabout work, about relationships, about yourself, about life, you have yet to learn. And\nthat itself is a tremendous gift. Over the remainder of your life, you can—you must—\ncontinue to educate yourself and to grow as a person, becoming more focused on what\nreally matters, more widely knowledgeable, better read, more disciplined, and more\nstrategic. But also wiser, kinder, more empathetic, more generous, more loving, more\nforgiving of others and of yourself. Each of us is a work in progress. The possibilities\nfor self-improvement are limitless.\nAnother thing I have realized is that while hard work, determination, and\ncreativity matter a great deal to success in life, luck plays a big role too. All of us here\n\n- 3 -\nare tremendously lucky. I know that, at a handful of critical times in my life, I got really\nlucky—beginning at birth.\nMy parents were well educated. They gave the six Powell kids a safe, loving\nhome, and placed a high value on learning. They gave us everything we needed to thrive.\nThat bit of luck led to the good luck I share with all of you, the chance to earn a degree\nfrom America’s finest university.\nAnother thing I have learned along the way is that, as you strive in coming years\nto reach your full potential, you will need to take risks and make mistakes.\nEveryone makes mistakes. Take it from an expert! But the bigger mistake is to\navoid taking risks.\nIf you aren’t failing from time to time, you aren’t asking enough of yourself.\nSooner than you think, many of you will be asked to assume leadership roles. It is very\ncommon to feel, as I once did, that you are not ready. Just know that almost no one is\ntruly ready. All I can say is go for it! Throw yourself into the deep end of the pool.\nBelieve in yourself. Take risks. When you fall down, get up! Repeat cycle. And as you\ndo assume higher responsibility, understand that a big part of your job is to bring along\nthe people behind you. Be the leader that people can learn from, the one that people want\nto work for.\nMy next point is closely related. A little bit of initiative, at the right time, can\nmake all the difference. Initiative is the rocket fuel of life. I am no entrepreneur. I did\nnot start a major tech company. But as I look back, many of the most important\ndevelopments in my life trace back to a few occasions where I showed some initiative.\n\n- 4 -\nOne example out of many—when I was a very junior associate, the man who ran\nmy firm—Nicholas F. Brady—was a former U.S. senator whose career had spanned the\nprivate sector and public service. I wanted to meet him but realized that it was up to me\nto make that happen. One day I forced myself to walk up the stairs to his corner office. I\nasked for an audience and was ushered in. I was very nervous; the meeting was very\nbrief; and I walked down those stairs thinking “at least I tried.” To my surprise, two\nmonths later Nick Brady asked me to work on a project with him. A year or so after that\nhe became the Secretary of the United States Treasury, and in time he asked me to serve\nunder him as an Assistant Secretary of the Treasury. That enormously challenging role\nwhet my appetite for further public service and ultimately proved to be a gateway for my\nappointment to the Federal Reserve Board. If I had not forced myself to take that risky\nand potentially awkward step, I would not be here today.\nI can think of long-term friendships and one marriage, my own, that turned on a\nmoment’s initiative. On occasions like that we risk failure, awkwardness,\nembarrassment, and rejection. But that’s how we create the career opportunities, the\ngreat friendships, and the loves that make life worth living.\nThe combination of luck, the courage to make mistakes, and a little initiative can\nlead to much success. But know this: the world needs more from you than personal\nachievements and individual success. I strongly urge you to find time in your careers for\npublic service.\nSince the founding of this great democracy 250 years ago, generation upon\ngeneration have assumed the burden and the honor of moving us closer to the ideal that\nall are created equal. Now, it’s your turn. I ask you to take a minute and realize how the\n\n- 5 -\nquest for these values has led us to this point in our history. We lead the world in so\nmany ways, including in scientific innovation and economic dynamism. Our great\nuniversities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset. Look around you. I\nurge you to take none of this for granted. When you look back in 50 years, you will want\nto know that you have done whatever it takes to preserve and strengthen our democracy,\nand bring us ever closer to the Founders’ timeless ideals.\nThose of you who are not entering the military or other public service may\nwonder, what is so great about public service? I’ll give you a recent example. In my\nyears at the Fed, the global economy has experienced a fair amount of turbulence, and\none outright crisis—the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. With little warning,\neconomies around the world came to a hard stop. Critical financial markets were near\ncollapse. The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face.\nEveryone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first\nresponder. Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped\nforward and said, “We got this.” We took a range of aggressive measures to supply\ncredit to the economy—many of them unprecedented—while the financial sector\nrecovered. Others in government and the private sector did their part too. Through the\njoint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes. It is hard to imagine the pressure\npeople face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career\ncivil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve\nalongside them. That’s what public service is like.\n\n- 6 -\nWith that luck that I mentioned comes great responsibility. You may recognize\nthis from the Gospel of Luke: “From everyone who has been given much, much will be\ndemanded.”\nAs you navigate the world of bright possibilities that awaits you, I urge you to\ntake on the challenge and the opportunity to serve your fellow citizens. You will never\nregret that choice.\nA very last, and critical point. Your life matters—to the people you love and to\nthe broader world. Fifty years from now, you will want to be able to look in the mirror\nand know that you did what you thought was right, in every part of your life. At the end\nof the day, your integrity is all you have. Guard it carefully.\nThank you for your time. Congratulations to the Princeton class of 2025.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n2:30 p.m. EDT (12:30 p.m. local time)\nOctober 8, 2019\nData-Dependent Monetary Policy in an Evolving Economy\nRemarks by\nJerome H. Powell\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Trucks and Terabytes: Integrating the ‘Old’ and ‘New’ Economies”\n61st Annual Meeting of the National Association for Business Economics\nDenver, Colorado\nOctober 8, 2019\n\nThank you for this opportunity to speak at the 61st annual meeting of the National\nAssociation for Business Economics.\nAt the Fed, we like to say that monetary policy is data dependent. We say this to\nemphasize that policy is never on a preset course and will change as appropriate in\nresponse to incoming information. But that does not capture the breadth and depth of\nwhat data-dependent decisionmaking means to us. From its beginnings more than a\ncentury ago, the Federal Reserve has gone to great lengths to collect and rigorously\nanalyze the best information to make sound decisions for the public we serve.\nThe topic of this meeting, “Trucks and Terabytes: Integrating the ‘New’ and\n‘Old’ Economies,” captures the essence of a major challenge for data-dependent\npolicymaking. We must sort out in real time, as best we can, what the profound changes\nunderway in the economy mean for issues such as the functioning of labor markets, the\npace of productivity growth, and the forces driving inflation.\nOf course, issues like these have always been with us. Indeed, 100 years ago,\nsome of the first Fed policymakers recognized the need for more timely information on\nthe rapidly evolving state of industry and decided to create and publish production\nindexes for the United States. Today I will pay tribute to the 100 years of dedicated—\nand often behind the scenes—work of those tracking change in the industrial landscape.\nI will then turn to three challenges our dynamic economy is posing for policy at\npresent: First, what would the consequences of a sharp rise in the price of oil be for the\nU.S. economy? This question, which never seems far from relevance, is again drawing\nour attention after recent events in the Persian Gulf. While the question is familiar,\n\n- 2 -\ntechnological advances in the energy sector are rapidly changing our assessment of the\nanswer.\nSecond, with terabytes of data increasingly competing with truckloads of goods in\neconomic importance, what are the best ways to measure output and productivity? Put\nmore provocatively, might the recent productivity slowdown be an artifact of antiquated\nmeasurement?\nThird, how tight is the labor market? Given our mandate of maximum\nemployment and price stability, this question is at the very core of our work. But\nanswering it in real time in a dynamic economy as jobs are gained in one area but lost in\nothers is remarkably challenging. In August, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)\nannounced that job gains over the year through March were likely a half-million lower\nthan previously reported. I will discuss how we are using big data to improve our grasp\nof the job market in the face of such revisions.\nThese three quite varied questions highlight the broad range of issues that\ncurrently come under the simple heading “data dependent.” After exploring them, I will\ncomment briefly on recent developments in money markets and on monetary policy.\nA Century of Industrial Production\nOur story of data dependence in the face of change begins when the Fed opened\nfor business in 1914. World War I was breaking out in Europe, and over the next four\nyears the war would fuel profound growth and transformation in the U.S. economy.1 But\nyou could not have seen this change in the gross national product data; the Department of\nCommerce did not publish those until 1942. The Census Bureau had been running a\n1 Hugh Rockoff (2004) analyzes the change that accompanied a 44-month expansion starting in 1914.\n\n- 3 -\ncensus of manufactures since 1905, but that came only every five years—an eternity in\nthe rapidly changing economy. In need of more timely information, the Fed began\ncreating and publishing a series of industrial output reports that soon evolved into\nindustrial production indexes.2 The indexes initially comprised 22 basic commodities,\nchosen in part because they covered the major industrial groups, but also for the practical\nreason that data were available with less than a one-month lag. The Fed’s efforts were\namong the earliest in creating timely measures of aggregate production. Over the century\nof its existence, our industrial production team has remained at the frontier of economic\nmeasurement, using the most advanced techniques to monitor U.S. industry and nimbly\ntrack changes in production.\nWhat Are the Consequences of an Oil Price Spike?\nLet’s turn now to the first question of the consequences of an oil price spike.\nFigure 1 shows U.S. oil production since 1920. After rising fairly steadily through the\nearly 1970s, production began a long period of gradual decline. By 2005, production was\nat about the same level as it had been 50 years earlier. Since then, remarkable advances\nin the technology for finding and extracting oil have led to a rapid increase in production\nto levels higher than ever before.3 In 2018, the United States became the world’s largest\noil producer.4 Oil exports have surged, imports have fallen (figure 2), and the U.S.\n2 For more information on the history of industrial production reporting at the Board, see “Celebrating 100\nYears of the Industrial Production Index” at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g17/100_years_of_ip_data.htm.\n3 Decker, Flaaen, and Tito (2016) explore reasons for the resilience of production, even in light of declines\nin oil prices.\n4 Department of Energy (2018).\n\n- 4 -\nEnergy Information Administration projects that this month, for the first time in many\ndecades, the United States will be a net exporter of oil.5\nAs monetary policymakers, we closely monitor developments in oil markets\nbecause disruptions in these markets have played a role in several U.S. recessions and in\nthe Great Inflation of the 1960s and 1970s. Traditionally, we assessed that a sharp rise in\nthe price of oil would have a strong negative effect on consumers and businesses and,\nhence, on the U.S. economy. Today a higher oil price would still cause dislocations and\nhardship for many, but with exports and imports nearly balanced, the higher price paid by\nconsumers is roughly offset by higher earnings of workers and firms in the U.S. oil\nindustry. Moreover, because it is now easier to ramp up oil production, a sustained price\nrise can quickly boost output, providing a shock absorber in the face of supply\ndisruptions. Thus, setting aside the effects of geopolitical uncertainty that may\naccompany higher oil prices, we now judge that a price spike would likely have nearly\noffsetting effects on U.S. gross domestic product (GDP).\nHow Should We Measure Output and Productivity?\nLet’s now turn to the second question of how to best measure output and\nproductivity. While there are some subtleties in measuring oil output, we know how to\ncount barrels of oil. Measuring the overall level of goods and services produced in the\neconomy is fundamentally messier, because it requires adding apples and oranges—and\nautomobiles and myriad other goods and services. The hard-working statisticians\ncreating the official statistics regularly adapt the data sources and methods so that, insofar\n5 The Energy Information Administration’s Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO; available at\nhttps://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo), released on September 10, 2019, shows that the United States will\nbecome a net exporter of crude oil and liquid fuels by October 2019. A new STEO will be published today.\n\n- 5 -\nas possible, the measured data provide accurate indicators of the state of the economy.\nPeriods of rapid change present particular challenges, and it can take time for the\nmeasurement system to adapt to fully and accurately reflect the changes in the economy.\nThe advance of technology has long presented measurement challenges. In 1987,\nNobel Prize–winning economist Robert Solow quipped that “you can see the computer\nage everywhere but in the productivity statistics.”6 In the second half of the 1990s, this\nmeasurement puzzle was at the heart of monetary policymaking.7 Chairman Alan\nGreenspan famously argued that the United States was experiencing the dawn of a new\neconomy, and that potential and actual output were likely understated in official statistics.\nWhere others saw capacity constraints and incipient inflation, Greenspan saw a\nproductivity boom that would leave room for very low unemployment without inflation\npressures. In light of the uncertainty it faced, the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC) judged that the appropriate risk-management approach called for refraining\nfrom interest rate increases unless and until there were clearer signs of rising inflation.\nUnder this policy, unemployment fell near record lows without rising inflation, and later\nrevisions to GDP measurement showed appreciably faster productivity growth.8\nThis episode illustrates a key challenge to making data-dependent policy in real\ntime: Good decisions require good data, but the data in hand are seldom as good as we\nwould like. Sound decisionmaking therefore requires the application of good judgment\nand a healthy dose of risk management.\n6 Solow (1987).\n7 I discuss and document this episode more fully in Powell (2018).\n8 Revision and the role of high tech is described in Seskin (1999) and Jorgenson, Ho, and Stiroh (2008).\n\n- 6 -\nProductivity is again presenting a puzzle. Official statistics currently show\nproductivity growth slowing significantly in recent years, with the growth in output per\nhour worked falling from more than 3 percent a year from 1995 to 2003 to less than half\nthat pace since then.9 Analysts are actively debating three alternative explanations for\nthis apparent slowdown: First, the slowdown may be real and may persist indefinitely as\nproductivity growth returns to more-normal levels after a brief golden age.10 Second, the\nslowdown may instead be a pause of the sort that often accompanies fundamental\ntechnological change, so that productivity gains from recent technology advances will\nappear over time as society adjusts.11 Third, the slowdown may be overstated, perhaps\ngreatly, because of measurement issues akin to those at work in the 1990s.12 At this\npoint, we cannot know which of these views may gain widespread acceptance, and\nmonetary policy will play no significant role in how this puzzle is resolved. As in the late\n1990s, however, we are carefully assessing the implications of possibly mismeasured\nproductivity gains. Moreover, productivity growth seems to have moved up over the past\nyear after a long period at very low levels; we do not know whether that welcome trend\nwill be sustained.\nRecent research suggests that current official statistics may understate\nproductivity growth by missing a significant part of the growing value we derive from\nfast internet connections and smartphones. These technologies, which were just\nemerging 15 years ago, are now ubiquitous (figure 3). We can now be constantly\n9 Between 1995 and 2003, business-sector output per hour increased at an annual rate of 3.4 percent, and it\nhas risen only 1.4 percent since then. Fernald (2015) suggests 2003 as a break point for the beginning of\nthe productivity slowdown.\n10 See Gordon (2017) and Fernald (2018).\n11 Brynjolfsson, Rock, and Syverson (2018).\n12 Hatzius and others (2016).\n\n- 7 -\nconnected to the accumulated knowledge of humankind and receive near instantaneous\nupdates on the lives of friends far and wide. And, adding to the measurement challenge,\nmany of these services are free, which is to say, not explicitly priced. How should we\nvalue the luxury of never needing to ask for directions? Or the peace and tranquility\nafforded by speedy resolution of those contentious arguments over the trivia of the\nmoment?\nResearchers have tried to answer these questions in various ways.13 For example,\nFed researchers have recently proposed a novel approach to measuring the value of\nservices consumers derive from cellphones and other devices based on the volume of data\nflowing over those connections.14 Taking their accounting at face value, GDP growth\nwould have been about 1/2 percentage point higher since 2007, which is an appreciable\nchange and would be very good news. Growth over the previous couple of decades\nwould also have been about 1/4 percentage point higher as well, implying that\nmeasurement issues of this sort likely account for only part of the productivity slowdown\nin current statistics. Research in this area is at an early stage, but this example illustrates\nthe depth of analysis supporting our data-dependent decisionmaking.\nHow Tight Is the Labor Market?\nLet me now turn from the measurement issues raised by the information age to an\nissue that has long been at the center of monetary policymaking: How tight is the labor\nmarket? Answering this question is central to our outlook for both of our dual-mandate\ngoals of maximum employment and price stability. While this topic is always front and\n13 In the case of Facebook, Brynjolfsson, Collis, and Eggers (2019) found that the median user required\ncompensation of $48 to live without that social media platform for a month.\n14 Byrne and Corrado (2019).\n\n- 8 -\ncenter in our thinking, I am raising it today to illustrate how we are using big data to\ninform policymaking.\nUntil recently, the official data showed job gains over the year through March\n2019 of about 210,000 a month, which is far higher than necessary to absorb new entrants\ninto the labor force and thus hold the unemployment rate constant. In August, the BLS\npublicly previewed the benchmark data revision coming in February 2020, and the news\nwas that job gains over this period were more like 170,000 per month—a meaningfully\nlower number that itself remains subject to revision. The pace of job gains is hard to pin\ndown in real time largely because of the dynamism of our economy: Many new\nbusinesses open and others close every month, creating some jobs and ending others, and\ndefinitive data on this turnover arrive with a substantial lag. Thus, initial data are, in part,\nsophisticated guesses based on what is known as the birth–death model of firms.\nSeveral years ago, we began a collaboration with the payroll processing firm ADP\nto construct a measure of payroll employment from their data set, which covers about\n20 percent of the nation’s private workforce and is available to us with a roughly one-\nweek delay.15 As described in a recent research paper, we constructed a measure that\nprovides an independent read on payroll employment that complements the official\nstatistics.16 While experience is still limited with the new measure, we find promising\nevidence that it can refine our real-time picture of job gains. For example, in the first\neight months of 2008, as the Great Recession was getting underway, the official monthly\nemployment data showed total job losses of about 750,000 (figure 4). A later benchmark\n15 This share is comparable to that covered in the sample used by the BLS, but the BLS sample is designed\nto be representative, while the ADP sample is simply their customer base.\n16 Cajner and others (2019).\n\n- 9 -\nrevision told a much bleaker story, with declines of about 1.5 million. Our new measure,\nhad it been available in 2008, would have been much closer to the revised data, alerting\nus that the job situation might be considerably worse than the official data suggested.17\nWe believe that the new measure may help us better understand job market\nconditions in real time. The preview of the BLS benchmark revision leaves average job\ngains over the year through March solidly above the pace required to accommodate\ngrowth in the workforce over that time, but where we had seen a booming job market, we\nnow see more-moderate growth. The benchmark revision will not directly affect data for\njob gains since March, but experience with past revisions suggests that some part of the\nbenchmark will likely carry forward. Thus, the currently reported job gains of 157,000\nper month on average over the past three months may well be revised somewhat lower.\nBased on a range of data and analysis, including our new measure, we now judge that,\neven allowing for such a revision, job gains remain above the level required to provide\njobs for new entrants to the jobs market over time. Of course, the pace of job gains is\nonly one of many job market issues that figure into our assessment of how the economy\nis performing relative to our maximum-employment mandate and our assessment of any\ninflationary pressures arising in the job market.\nWhat Does Data Dependence Mean at Present?\nIn summary, data dependence is, and always has been, at the heart of\npolicymaking at the Federal Reserve. We are always seeking out new and better sources\n17 Any example about the details of data deserves detailed comment. Our ADP-based estimate showed job\nlosses of about 1 million over this period, considerably more than the real-time BLS data but well short of\nthe post-benchmark value. This episode motivated the BLS to revise their procedures in ways that will\nreduce the revisions in similar episodes in the future. See BLS (2019) for a technical note last updated in\nAugust and BLS (2010).\n\n- 10 -\nof information and refining our analysis of that information to keep us abreast of\nconditions as our economy constantly reinvents itself. Before wrapping up, I will discuss\nrecent developments in money markets and the current stance of monetary policy.\nOur influence on the financial conditions that affect employment and inflation is\nindirect. The Federal Reserve sets two overnight interest rates: the interest rate paid on\nbanks’ reserve balances and the rate on our reverse repurchase agreements. We use these\ntwo administered rates to keep a market-determined rate, the federal funds rate, within a\ntarget range set by the FOMC. We rely on financial markets to transmit these rates\nthrough a variety of channels to the rates paid by households and businesses—and to\nfinancial conditions more broadly.\nIn mid-September, an important channel in the transmission process—wholesale\nfunding markets—exhibited unexpectedly intense volatility. Payments to meet corporate\ntax obligations and to purchase Treasury securities triggered notable liquidity pressures in\nmoney markets. Overnight interest rates spiked, and the effective federal funds rate\nbriefly moved above the FOMC’s target range. To counter these pressures, we began\nconducting temporary open market operations. These operations have kept the federal\nfunds rate in the target range and alleviated money market strains more generally.\nWhile a range of factors may have contributed to these developments, it is clear\nthat without a sufficient quantity of reserves in the banking system, even routine\nincreases in funding pressures can lead to outsized movements in money market interest\nrates. This volatility can impede the effective implementation of monetary policy, and\nwe are addressing it. Indeed, my colleagues and I will soon announce measures to add to\nthe supply of reserves over time. Consistent with a decision we made in January, our\n\n- 11 -\ngoal is to provide an ample supply of reserves to ensure that control of the federal funds\nrate and other short-term interest rates is exercised primarily by setting our administered\nrates and not through frequent market interventions. Of course, we will not hesitate to\nconduct temporary operations if needed to foster trading in the federal funds market at\nrates within the target range.\nReserve balances are one among several items on the liability side of the Federal\nReserve’s balance sheet, and demand for these liabilities—notably, currency in\ncirculation—grows over time. Hence, increasing the supply of reserves or even\nmaintaining a given level over time requires us to increase the size of our balance sheet.\nAs we indicated in our March statement on balance sheet normalization, at some point,\nwe will begin increasing our securities holdings to maintain an appropriate level of\nreserves.18 That time is now upon us.\nI want to emphasize that growth of our balance sheet for reserve management\npurposes should in no way be confused with the large-scale asset purchase programs that\nwe deployed after the financial crisis. Neither the recent technical issues nor the\npurchases of Treasury bills we are contemplating to resolve them should materially affect\nthe stance of monetary policy, to which I now turn.\nOur goal in monetary policy is to promote maximum employment and stable\nprices, which we interpret as inflation running closely around our symmetric 2 percent\nobjective. At present, the jobs and inflation pictures are favorable. Many indicators\nshow a historically strong labor market, with solid job gains, the unemployment rate at\nhalf-century lows, and rising prime-age labor force participation. Wages are rising,\n18 See the Balance Sheet Normalization Principles and Plans, which are available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20190320c.htm.\n\n- 12 -\nespecially for those with lower-paying jobs. Inflation is somewhat below our symmetric\n2 percent objective but has been gradually firming over the past few months. FOMC\nparticipants continue to see a sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor\nmarket conditions, and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent objective as most likely.\nMany outside forecasters agree.\nBut there are risks to this favorable outlook, principally from global\ndevelopments. Growth around much of the world has weakened over the past year and a\nhalf, and uncertainties around trade, Brexit, and other issues pose risks to the outlook. As\nthose factors have evolved, my colleagues and I have shifted our views about appropriate\nmonetary policy toward a lower path for the federal funds rate and have lowered its target\nrange by 50 basis points. We believe that our policy actions are providing support for the\noutlook. Looking ahead, policy is not on a preset course. The next FOMC meeting is\nseveral weeks away, and we will be carefully monitoring incoming information. We will\nbe data dependent, assessing the outlook and risks to the outlook on a meeting-by-\nmeeting basis. Taking all that into account, we will act as appropriate to support\ncontinued growth, a strong job market, and inflation moving back to our symmetric 2\npercent objective.\n\n- 13 -\nReferences\nBrynjolfsson, Erik, Avinash Collis, and Felix Eggers (2019). “Using Massive Online\nChoice Experiments to Measure Changes in Well-Being,” Proceedings of the\nNational Academy of Sciences, vol. 116 (April), pp. 7250–55.\nBrynjolfsson, Erik, Daniel Rock, and Chad Syverson (2018).

Powell\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nFederal Reserve/Conference of State Bank Supervisors\nCommunity Banking Research Conference\nSt. Louis, Mo.\nSeptember 23, 2014\n\n- 2 -\nIt is a pleasure for me to join Jim Bullard and John Ryan in welcoming all of you to the\nsecond annual Community Banking Research and Policy Conference, co-sponsored by the\nFederal Reserve System and Conference of State Bank Supervisors. I had the privilege of\naddressing the inaugural community banking conference held here last year, and as chairman of\nthe Federal Reserve Board’s Subcommittee on Smaller Regional and Community Banking, I am\ndelighted to return to this venue to participate in this year’s event.1\nAs all of you surely know, community banks play a vital role in America’s financial\nsystem, providing essential services to households, small businesses, and small farms in\ncommunities throughout the country. Community banks differ from their larger cousins, not just\nin size, but in the fundamental focus of their business. Community bankers’ primary objective is\nto serve the members of their local communities, who are not only their customers but also their\nneighbors and friends. They have strong links to the people and businesses that reside in their\ncommunities, as well as direct knowledge of local economic conditions. These close ties give\ncommunity bankers a clear advantage in understanding local needs and tailoring their products\nand services to meet those needs. I will confess that I have never worked at a community bank;\nhowever, I have been a community bank customer, and in that role I have had personal\nexperience interacting with bankers whose mission is to provide high quality of service to every\ncustomer who walks in the door.\nDespite the advantages that I just mentioned, life is not always easy for community\nbankers. The number of community banks in the United States has declined sharply over the\npast three decades, due to a combination of failures and acquisitions.2 And many remaining\n1 For more information on the Board's committees, including membership, see\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/default.htm.\n2 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (2012), “FDIC Community Banking Study,” December,\nwww.fdic.gov/regulations/resources/cbi/report/cbi-full.pdf.\n\n- 3 -\ncommunity banks have struggled to survive, especially during the last five or six years.\nAlthough improving overall economic conditions have begun to provide some relief to these\nstruggling banks, they continue to face significant challenges. The burden of regulatory\ncompliance can be particularly daunting for small banks. And competition, from large banks and\ncredit unions as well as other nonbank financial service providers, is always a concern.\nMy colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board and I are committed to making sure that we\nunderstand the challenges faced by community banks. One way that we further our\nunderstanding is by talking to the bankers themselves. The entire Board of Governors meets\ntwice a year with the Community Depository Institutions Advisory Council, which includes\nrepresentatives of community banks, thrifts, and credit unions in each of the 12 Federal Reserve\nDistricts.3 Individual governors also take advantage of opportunities to meet with community\nbankers from time to time. During last year’s conference I met with a group of St. Louis area\ncommunity bankers to hear what was on their minds. I will conduct a nationwide webinar with\ncommunity bankers next month. In fact, I speak regularly to a number of bank executives,\nincluding those who run smaller institutions. I find these types of conversations--with people\nwho live and work in the world outside the Capital Beltway and far from Wall Street--to be\nparticularly enlightening. And, of course, this conference, which was conceived as the result of a\nsuccessful collaboration between the Federal Reserve System and the Conference of State Bank\nSupervisors, provides an annual opportunity for community bankers, bank regulators, and\nacademic researchers to come together to share ideas and insights surrounding the issues that\nmatter most to community bankers.\n3 For more information on the Community Depository Institutions Advisory Council, see\nwww.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/cdiac.htm.\n\n- 4 -\nThis year’s program includes presentations by the authors of a number of excellent\nacademic research papers, the unveiling of the results of a new survey of community banks\nconducted on behalf of the conference organizers, reactions by community bankers to the\nresearch and survey findings, and several compelling speeches.\nThe primary focus of today’s agenda is research. The response to the conference’s call\nfor papers was quite impressive, and the conference research committee faced the challenging\ntask of selecting the most relevant, interesting, and high-quality papers to be included in the\nprogram. The authors of these papers include academics and policymakers, with backgrounds in\nlaw, economics, and finance. The topics covered clearly demonstrate a desire, on the part of the\nresearchers, to promote a deeper understanding of what makes community banks tick and of how\na wide range of government policies affects the activities, profitability, and viability of\ncommunity banks.\nThe first session considers factors underlying community bank formation, behavior, and\nperformance. The first paper looks at characteristics of newly chartered banks--where they form,\nand how they fare over time. The second paper also focuses on newly chartered banks,\nconsidering possible explanations for the near absence of new bank charters over the past few\nyears. Those of us at the Fed pay a great deal of attention to this type of bank formation, because\nit is the primary source of new competition in the markets in which community banks compete.\nThe third paper in this session looks at how rivalry among banks affects their decisions to adopt\nnew technology, and the fourth seeks to explain the persistence of low net-interest income\namong community banks in recent years.\nThe second session addresses the effects, both intended and unintended, of specific\ngovernment policies on community bank behavior. One paper looks at how the 2006\n\n- 5 -\ncommercial real estate guidance for banks affected loan growth.4 Another paper examines the\neffect of the creation of the Small Business Lending Fund on community bank lending to small\nbusinesses. The third paper in this session focuses on what happens when banks perceive that\nexaminers have given them inappropriately negative evaluations.\nThe underlying theme of the third research session is how broad government policies\naffect community bank profitability and viability. The first paper provides an overview of the\neffects of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act on community\nbanks. The second paper considers whether a provision of the JOBS Act that modified the\nthreshold for Exchange Act reporting for unlisted banks and bank holding companies helped or\nhurt small banks. The third paper contrasts the thousands of small community banks operating in\nthe United States with the handful of very large financial institutions and proposes a new\napproach to regulation that recognizes the very different business models of these two types of\ninstitutions. The fourth and final paper takes a high-level look at the effects of regulatory policy\non the structure of the U.S. banking system and the viability of community banks.\nOn day two of the conference, you will learn about the results of a recently conducted\nsurvey that was completed by more than 1,000 community bankers from across the country, as\nwell as the feedback obtained from more than 1,300 bankers participating in town hall meetings\nhosted by state bank commissioners in 30 states. The presentation of these findings will be\nfollowed by a panel discussion by a select group of community banking experts.\n4 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency (2006), “Federal Banking Agencies Issue Final Guidance on Concentrations in\nCommercial Real Estate Lending,” press release, December 6,\nhttp://federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20061206a.htm.\n\n- 6 -\nI hope I have succeeded in whetting your appetite for the sessions that lie ahead, and I\nencourage you to make the most of this unique opportunity to interact with bankers, regulators,\nand researchers who share a common interest in the future of community banking.",

Powell\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nFireside Chat at the\nStanford Business, Government, and Society Forum\nStanford Graduate School of Business\nStanford, California\nApril 3, 2024\n\nIt is a pleasure to be here today. I will begin with the economy and the road\nahead for monetary policy before briefly discussing the Federal Reserve’s monetary\npolicy independence.\nOver the past year, inflation has come down significantly but is still running\nabove the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) 2 percent goal. In February,\nheadline inflation was 2.5 percent over the past 12 months based on the personal\nconsumption expenditures (PCE) index. A year earlier, it was 5.2 percent. Core\ninflation, which excludes the volatile food and energy components, stood at 2.8 percent; a\nyear ago, it was 4.8 percent. While this progress is welcome, the job of sustainably\nrestoring 2 percent inflation is not yet done.\nTight monetary policy continues to weigh on demand, particularly in interest-\nsensitive spending categories. Nonetheless, growth in economic activity and employment\nwas strong in 2023, as real gross domestic product expanded more than 3 percent and 3\nmillion jobs were created, even as inflation fell substantially. This combination of\noutcomes reflects significant improvements in supply that offset to some extent the\neffects on demand of tighter financial conditions. The healing of global supply chains\nhelped address pent-up demand for goods, particularly in sectors that had faced\nconsiderable shortages, such as autos. In addition, labor supply increased significantly,\nthanks to rising participation among 25-to-54-year-olds, as well as a strong pace of\nimmigration.\nRecent readings on both job gains and inflation have come in higher than\nexpected. The economy added an average of 265,000 jobs per month in the three months\nthrough February, a faster pace than we have seen since last June. And the higher\n\n- 2 -\ninflation data over January and February were above the low readings in the second half\nof last year.\nThe recent data do not, however, materially change the overall picture, which\ncontinues to be one of solid growth, a strong but rebalancing labor market, and inflation\nmoving down toward 2 percent on a sometimes bumpy path. Labor market rebalancing is\nevident in data on quits, job openings, surveys of employers and workers, and the\ncontinued gradual decline in wage growth. On inflation, it is too soon to say whether the\nrecent readings represent more than just a bump. We do not expect that it will be\nappropriate to lower our policy rate until we have greater confidence that inflation is\nmoving sustainably down toward 2 percent. Given the strength of the economy and\nprogress on inflation so far, we have time to let the incoming data guide our decisions on\npolicy.\nWe have held our policy rate at its current level since last July. As shown in the\nindividual projections the FOMC released two weeks ago, my colleagues and I continue\nto believe that the policy rate is likely at its peak for this tightening cycle. If the economy\nevolves broadly as we expect, most FOMC participants see it as likely to be appropriate\nto begin lowering the policy rate at some point this year.\nOf course, the outlook is still quite uncertain, and we face risks on both sides.\nReducing rates too soon or too much could result in a reversal of the progress we have\nseen on inflation and ultimately require even tighter policy to get inflation back to\n2 percent. But easing policy too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity\nand employment. As progress on inflation continues and labor market tightness eases,\nthese risks continue to move into better balance.\n\n- 3 -\nAs conditions evolve, monetary policy is well positioned to confront either of\nthese risks. We are making decisions meeting by meeting, and we will do everything we\ncan to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.\nThat brings me to my second topic. The Fed has been assigned two goals for\nmonetary policy—maximum employment and stable prices. Our success in delivering on\nthese goals matters a great deal to all Americans. To support our pursuit of those goals,\nCongress granted the Fed a substantial degree of independence in our conduct of\nmonetary policy. Fed policymakers serve long terms that are not synchronized with\nelection cycles. Our decisions are not subject to reversal by other parts of the\ngovernment, other than through legislation. This independence both enables and requires\nus to make our monetary policy decisions without consideration of short-term political\nmatters. Such independence for a federal agency is and should be rare. In the case of the\nFed, independence is essential to our ability to serve the public. The record shows that\nindependent central banks deliver better economic outcomes.1\nWe recognize that we need to continually earn this grant of independence, and we\ndo so by carrying out our work with technical competence and objectivity, in a\ntransparent and accountable manner, and by sticking to our knitting.\nBy technical competence, I mean that Fed policymakers use the most up-to-date\ninformation and research to deepen our understanding of the ever-evolving economy and\n1 See, for example, Alberto Alesina and Lawrence H. Summers (1993), “Central Bank Independence and\nMacroeconomic Performance: Some Comparative Evidence,” Journal of Money, Credit and Banking,\nvol. 25 (May), pp. 151–62; Christopher Crowe and Ellen E. Meade (2007), “The Evolution of Central Bank\nGovernance around the World,” Journal of Economic Perspectives, vol. 21 (Fall), pp. 69–90; Christopher\nCrowe and Ellen E.

We are supported by a highly capable staff.\nWe also draw on the insights and experiences of a wide array of business, academic,\ncommunity, and labor leaders, as well as others engaged in the economy. And by\nobjective, I mean that our analysis is free from any personal or political bias, in service to\nthe public. We will not always get it right—no one does. But our decisions will always\nreflect our painstaking assessment of what is best for our economy in the medium and\nlonger term—and nothing else.\nTransparency and accountability are fundamental for any government agency in a\ndemocracy but are especially important for one granted policy independence. The Fed\nhas a special obligation to explain ourselves clearly—to describe what we are doing and\nwhy we are doing it. We are always striving to improve on this communication, and it is\na job that is never complete. But we have come a long way. Before 1994, the FOMC did\nnot even announce our monetary policy decisions. Today we announce those decisions\nand explain the thinking behind them in our post meeting statement and press conference.\nWe publish detailed minutes of our deliberations and a quarterly summary of the\neconomic and policy projections of each FOMC participant. We publish a monetary\npolicy report twice a year, and the Chair appears before Congress to present that report\nand answer any and all questions that are on the minds of our oversight committee\nmembers. In 2020, we completed a yearlong public review of our monetary policy\nframework, and late this year, we will begin another such review.2 My colleagues and I\nexplain our views on the economic outlook and monetary policy in speeches like this one,\nand in visits to communities across the country, as part of extensive outreach in which we\n2 We expect to release the results of this review about a year after it begins.\n\n- 5 -\nseek input from individuals and groups throughout society. Transparency is an\naffirmative and proactive commitment to the public.\nTo maintain the public’s trust, we also need to avoid “mission creep.” Our nation\nfaces many challenges, some of which directly or indirectly involve the economy. Fed\npolicymakers are often pressed to take a position on issues that are arguably relevant to\nthe economy but are not within our mandate, such as particular tax and spending policies,\nimmigration policy, and trade policy. Climate change is another current example.\nPolicies to address climate change are the business of elected officials and those agencies\nthat they have charged with this responsibility. The Fed has received no such charge.\nWe do, however, have a narrow role that relates to our responsibilities as a bank\nsupervisor. The public will expect that the institutions we regulate and supervise will\nunderstand and be able to manage the material risks that they face, which, over time, are\nlikely to include climate-related financial risks. We will remain alert to the risk that there\nwill be pressure to expand that role over time. We are not, nor do we seek to be, climate\npolicymakers.\nIn short, doing our job well requires that we respect the limits of our mandate.\nThank you. I look forward to our discussion.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n4:00 p.m. EST\nNovember 14, 2014\nMonetary Policy Accommodation, Risk-Taking, and Spillovers\nRemarks by\nJerome H. Powell\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Global Research Forum on International Macroeconomics and Finance”\nSponsored by the European Central Bank, the Federal Reserve Board,\nand the Federal Reserve Bank of New York\nWashington, D.C.\nNovember 14, 2014\n\nOur panel’s topic--“Monetary Policy Spillovers and Cooperation in a Global\nEconomy”--is surely a timely one. I will offer brief introductory thoughts and then\ndiscuss some recent research by Federal Reserve Board economists that has bearing on\nthese matters.1\nThe Federal Reserve’s monetary policy is motivated by the dual mandate, which\ncalls upon us to achieve stable prices and maximum sustainable employment. While\nthese objectives are stated as domestic concerns, as a practical matter, economic and\nfinancial developments around the world can have significant effects on our own\neconomy and vice versa. Thus, the pursuit of our mandate requires that we understand\nand incorporate into our policy decision-making the anticipated effects of these\ninterconnections. And the dollar’s role as the world’s primary reserve, transaction, and\nfunding currency requires us to consider global developments to help ensure our own\nfinancial stability.\nSince the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve has pursued a highly\naccommodative monetary policy, which has had important effects on asset prices and\nglobal investment flows. With unconventional tools, the scale and scope of these effects\nwere difficult to predict ex ante. Nor is it possible to predict with confidence how\nmarkets will react day to day as policy returns to normal. The Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC) has gone to great lengths to provide transparency about its policy\nintentions. Yet, since Chairman Bernanke first discussed the end of the asset purchase\nprogram in mid-2013, volatility has surprised both on the upside (the “taper tantrum”)\nand on the downside (the actual taper and the low volatility throughout most of 2014). In\n1 The views expressed herein are my own and not necessarily those of other FOMC participants.\n\n- 2 -\nmy view, while market volatility will continue to ebb and flow, these fluctuations are not\nlikely to have important implications for policy. The path of policy will depend on the\nprogress of the economy toward fulfilment of the dual mandate.\nOverall, accommodative monetary policy seems to have provided significant\nsupport for U.S. growth. And, of course, a strong U.S. economy contributes to strong\ngrowth around the globe, particularly in the emerging market economies (EMEs). But\nwhat of the so-called spillovers in the form of flows into, and out of, EMEs, whose\nfinancial sectors are small compared with global investment flows? Such spillovers\ncould merely reflect investor responses to changing differentials between rates of return\nabroad and in the United States. But these spillovers could also reflect shifts in investor\npreferences for risk.\nBy design, accommodative monetary policy--whether conventional or\nunconventional--supports economic activity in part by creating incentives for investors to\ntake more risk. Such risk-taking can show up in domestic financial markets, in the\ninternational investments of U.S. investors, and even, ultimately, in general risk attitudes\ntoward foreign financial markets. Distinguishing between appropriate and excessive risk-\ntaking is difficult, however.\nI now turn to some recent research on whether there has been an increase in the\nriskiness of our investments abroad and whether such increases might be traced to the\ncurrent low-interest rate environment. Many studies of the pre-crisis period document\nthe pro-cyclical nature of bank lending and leverage, and the buildup of risk-taking and\n\n- 3 -\nleverage by banks.2 It is much harder to find evidence that low interest rates have led to\nincreased post-crisis risk-taking by U.S. banks. Growth in overall lending by U.S. banks\nhas been modest at best. However, some pockets of increased risk-taking by banks and\nother investors are observable in domestic markets, such as leveraged loans. And on the\ninternational front, there has been a notable increase in syndicated loan originations.\nRecent research by Board staff, using a database of loans primarily to U.S.\nborrowers but also to some foreign borrowers, suggests that lenders have indeed\noriginated an increased number of risky syndicated loans post-crisis, based on the\nassessed probability of default as reported to bank supervisors (figure 1).3 Regression\nresults confirm that the average probability of default is significantly inversely related to\nU.S. long-term interest rates. This increase in riskiness of syndicated loans post-crisis\nhas been accompanied by a shift in the composition of loan holders: An increasing share\nis now held not by banks but by hedge, pension, and other investment funds (figure 2).\nThese nonbank investors also tend to hold loans with higher average credit risk (figure 3).\nThese data suggest that a tougher regulatory environment may have made U.S.-based\nbank originators unable or unwilling to hold risky loans on their balance sheets. Related\nwork by the same researchers, using a database with more-extensive coverage of loans to\n2 See Tobias Adrian and Hyun Song Shin (2010), “Liquidity and Leverage,” Journal of Financial\nIntermediation, vol. 19 (July), pp. 418-37; Valentina Bruno and Hyun Song Shin (2013), “Capital Flows,\nCross-Border Banking, and Global Liquidity,” NBER Working Paper Series 19038 (Cambridge, Mass.:\nNational Bureau of Economic Research, May); and Valentina Bruno and Hyun Song Shin (2013), “Capital\nFlows and the Risk-Taking Channel of Monetary Policy,” NBER Working Paper Series 18942 (Cambridge,\nMass.: National Bureau of Economic Research, April).\n3 See Sirio Aramonte, Seung Jung Lee, and Viktors Stebunovs (2014), “Risk-Taking and Low Longer-\nTerm Interest Rates: Evidence from the U.S. Syndicated Loan Market,” paper presented at the 14th Annual\nBank Research Conference sponsored by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s Center for Financial\nResearch and the Journal of Financial Services Research, held in Arlington, Va., September 18-19,\nwww.fdic.gov/bank/analytical/cfr/STEBUNOVS%20DAY1_AM.PDF and Seung Jung Lee, Lucy Qian\nLiu, and Viktors Stebunovs (2014), “Risk-Taking and Interest Rates: Evidence from Decades in the Global\nSyndicated Loan Market,” unpublished paper, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n- 4 -\nforeign borrowers, shows a similar pattern of increased risky loan underwriting by\ninternational lenders, an increase that is also significantly inversely related to U.S.\ninterest rates. Together, these results suggest a potential spillover from accommodative\nU.S. monetary policy through increased risk-taking in syndicated loans globally, although\npreliminary results also indicate that investors still require extra return for this extra risk.\nAnother area in which to look for links between low interest rates and risk-taking\nis in cross-border securities purchases. The role of low interest rates in advanced\neconomies in encouraging capital flows to EMEs where returns are higher has been a\nfamiliar theme.4 And recent studies have found that asset prices in EMEs do respond\nsystematically to U.S. monetary policy shocks.5\nFor evidence of increased risk-taking in cross-border investment, let’s look at the\ncomposition of U.S. investors’ foreign bond portfolios. Although emerging market bonds\nremain a relatively small proportion of the aggregate U.S. cross-border bond portfolio\n(figure 4), within foreign government bonds, U.S. investors have modestly shifted their\nportfolio shares toward higher-yielding bonds of emerging market sovereigns (figure 5).\nEx post, these portfolio reallocations delivered a higher return to U.S. investors on this\npart of their portfolio relative to what they would have received if they had left portfolio\n4 See Jerome H. Powell (2013), “Advanced Economy Monetary Policy and Emerging Market Economies,”\nspeech delivered at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco 2013 Asia Economic Policy Conference,\nSan Francisco, November 4, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20131104a.htm.\n5 See Shaghil Ahmed and Andrei Zlate (2013), “Capital Flows to Emerging Market Economies: A Brave\nNew World?” International Finance Discussion Papers 1081 (Washington: Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System, June), www.federalreserve.gov/PubS/ifdp/2013/1081/default.htm; David\nBowman, Juan M.

Regression results confirm that in choosing among\nforeign government bonds, U.S. investors have put more weight on returns since the\ncrisis.6\nBut search for higher returns has not been the only motivation for international\ninvestors post-crisis: Demand for liquid high-grade “safe” or money-like assets has also\nincreased from foreign official investors for investment of foreign exchange reserves,\nfrom pension funds and other institutions who face portfolio allocation constraints or\nregulatory requirements, and from investment strategies requiring cash-like assets for\nmargining and other collateral purposes. Some shift to safe assets is also seen in U.S.\nportfolios: U.S. investors actively rebalanced their holdings of foreign financial sector\nbonds toward those with higher credit ratings, but at some cost in returns (figure 7; figure\n8).7\nTaken together, developments in U.S. bond portfolios do not indicate a worrisome\npickup in risk-taking in external investments. But it is important to recognize that\nportfolio reallocations that seem relatively small for U.S. investors can loom large from\nthe perspective of the foreign recipients of these flows. At roughly $400 billion at the\nend of 2012, emerging market bonds accounted for a tiny fraction of the roughly\n$25 trillion in bonds held by U.S. investors. But to the recipient countries, these holdings\ncan account for a large fraction of their bond markets. Even relatively small changes in\n6 See Carol Bertaut and Alexandra Tabova (2014), “Reach for Yield versus Search for Safety,” unpublished\npaper, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\n7 See Carol Bertaut, Alexandra Tabova, and Vivian Wong (2014), “The Replacement of Safe Assets:\nEvidence from the U.S. Bond Portfolio,” International Finance Discussion Papers 1123 (Washington:\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, October),\nwww.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/ifdp/2014/files/ifdp1123.pdf.\n\n- 6 -\nthese U.S. holdings can generate large asset price responses, as was certainly the case in\nthe summer of 2013. Likewise, a reassessment of risk-return tradeoffs could disrupt\nfinancing for projects that are dependent on the willingness of investors to participate in\nglobal syndicated loan markets.\nWe take the consequences of such spillovers seriously, and the Federal Reserve is\nintent on communicating its policy intentions as clearly as possible in order to reduce the\nlikelihood of future disruptions to markets. We will continue to monitor investor\nbehavior closely, both domestically and internationally.\n\nExhibit Chart 1 11-05-2014\nFigure 1\nTerm Loan Originations by Probability of Default (PD)\n$ billions\n400\nPD < 1%\n1% < PD < 5%\n5% < PD < 10% 350\nPD > 10%\n300\n250\n200\n150\n100\n50\n0\n2010 2011 2012 2013\nNote.

    "text": "For release on delivery\n2:30 a.m. EDT (8:30 a.m. local time)\nJune 29, 2023\nFinancial Stability and Economic Developments\nRemarks by\nJerome H. Powell\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nBanco de Espana Fourth Conference on Financial Stability\nMadrid, Spain\nJune 29, 2023\n\nToday I will briefly discuss the current economic situation and the stresses that\nemerged in the U.S. banking system earlier this year. I will then turn to the evolution of\nthe financial system since the Great Recession and conclude with a few general\nobservations. I will highlight how global efforts to boost resilience in the financial sector\nover the past decade have been an important success. I will also discuss how recent\ndevelopments have revealed residual vulnerabilities that we are going to address, and the\nneed to be vigilant for emerging risks.\nU.S. economic growth slowed significantly last year, and recent indicators\nsuggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a modest pace. Growth in\nconsumer spending has picked up this year, and some indicators in the housing market\nhave turned up recently. At the same time, activity in the housing sector remains far\nbelow its peak in early 2022, reflecting the effects of higher mortgage rates. Higher\ninterest rates and slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixed\ninvestment.\nThe labor market remains very tight. Over the past three months, payroll job\ngains have been robust. The unemployment rate has moved up but remains low. There\nare some signs that supply and demand in the labor market are coming into better\nbalance, including higher labor force participation, some easing in nominal wage growth,\nand declining vacancies. While the jobs-to-workers gap has declined, labor demand still\nsubstantially exceeds the supply of available workers.\nInflation, however, remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent. Over the\n12 months ending in May, total personal consumption expenditures (PCE) prices are\nestimated to have risen 3.9 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy categories,\n\n- 2 -\ncore PCE prices likely rose 4.7 percent. Inflation has moderated somewhat since the\nmiddle of last year. Nonetheless, inflation pressures continue to run high, and the process\nof getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go.\nSince early last year, we have raised our policy rate by 5 percentage points. We\nsee the effects of our policy tightening on demand in the most interest rate–sensitive\nsectors of the economy, particularly housing and investment. It will take time, however,\nfor the full effects of monetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation.\nThe economy is also facing headwinds from tighter credit conditions for\nhouseholds and businesses, which are likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and\ninflation. Tighter credit conditions are a natural result of tighter monetary policy. But\nthe bank stresses that emerged in March may well lead to a further tightening in credit\nconditions. The extent of these effects remains uncertain.\nAt our last meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decided to\nmaintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5 to 5¼ percent while continuing\nthe process of significantly reducing our securities holdings. We made this decision in\nlight of the distance we have come in tightening policy, the uncertain lags in monetary\npolicy, and the potential headwinds from credit tightening. As noted in the FOMC’s\nSummary of Economic Projections, a strong majority of Committee participants expect\nthat it will be appropriate to raise interest rates two or more times by the end of the year.1\nWhen bank stress emerged in March, we acted in concert with other government\nagencies to address it, enabling the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to resolve two\nfailed banks in a manner that protected all depositors. We also used our liquidity tools to\n1 The most recent Summary of Economic Projections is available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.\n\n- 3 -\nmake funding available to banks that might need it. In addition to our discount window,\nwe established a new facility under our emergency lending authorities, the Bank Term\nFunding Program. Our provision of liquidity through these tools supported the stability\nof the financial system without restricting the use of our monetary policy tools to firm the\nstance of policy as part of our efforts to reduce inflation. The banking system remains\nsound and resilient, deposit flows have stabilized, and strains have eased.\nEvolution of the System since the Great Recession\nA little more than a decade ago, the Global Financial Crisis required extraordinary\ninterventions by governments around the world. Stabilizing the U.S. financial system\nrequired coordinated efforts by all parts of the government, including $700 billion in\ntaxpayer funds to recapitalize banks, a suite of Fed emergency liquidity facilities, as well\nas government guarantees on bank transaction accounts and money market mutual funds.\nDespite these efforts, the Great Recession brought misery to countless millions.\nAs the crisis slowly receded, authorities in the U.S. and around the world\nimplemented a host of reforms. The goal was to build a system that could withstand\nsevere shocks, including unanticipated ones that might arrive from any direction. In\nother words, a financial system that would be a source of strength during stressful\nperiods.\nA key pillar was building resilience in the banking system. This effort was\nremarkably successful. Over the course of the decade, capital and liquidity at the largest\nU.S. banks more than doubled. We began a program of rigorous annual stress tests to\nensure the banking system was capitalized against severe recessions and financial market\nturmoil.\n\n- 4 -\nThe Great Recession also underscored the critical importance of the nonbank\nsector. Here, too, the authorities have undertaken a number of steps to build resilience,\nalthough much remains to be done.\nIn 2020 the financial system was again tested, facing a truly unprecedented shock\nas the pandemic brought the global economy to a standstill. Investors scrambled for\nsafety and liquidity during the “dash for cash.” Financial markets came under extreme\npressure. Ultimately, the authorities had to support financial markets again as part of the\nextremely forceful monetary and fiscal response to the public health emergency. The\nbanking system, however, was now far more resilient than it had been before the reforms\nand thus well positioned to absorb the shock.\nWe cannot take the resilience of the financial system for granted, however. The\nmultiple shocks we have seen over the past year or so—including the extreme volatility\nin commodity markets following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and, of course,\nsurprisingly high and persistent inflation as well as the associated increase in interest\nrates—stressed a range of bank and nonbank financial institutions.\nThree General Observations Stemming from the Recent Banking Turmoil\nGiven the efforts to build resilience in the banking system over the past decade\nand a half, two natural questions are, why did Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and two other\nsizable U.S. banks fail this spring, and why did Credit Suisse—a global systemically\nimportant bank (G-SIB)—require a government-supported rescue acquisition? We are\ncommitted to learning the lessons from the U.S. bank failures for our program of\nsupervision and regulation. I will offer three observations about the events.\n\n- 5 -\nThe first observation is that it is very difficult to resist the natural human tendency\nto fight the last war. In 2008 we saw banks come under stress from outsized credit losses\nand insufficient liquidity. Such losses appeared possible in the early days of the 2020\ncrisis, although they ultimately did not materialize. In our stress tests, we have\nconsidered severe stress scenarios that produced losses on banks’ books, including\noutsized credit losses. But, of course, SVB’s vulnerability came not from credit risk, but\nfrom excessive interest rate risk exposure and a business model that was vulnerable in\nways its management did not fully appreciate, including a heavy reliance on uninsured\ndeposits.\nThese events suggest a need to strengthen our supervision and regulation of\ninstitutions of the size of SVB. I look forward to evaluating proposals for such changes\nand implementing them where appropriate.2 Much will depend on getting the specifics\nright, and we should bear in mind that there are always tradeoffs in any financial\nregulation. In addition, the U.S. has benefited from its rich, multi-tiered banking\necosystem, and that diversity should be preserved.\nThe second observation is the value of forthrightly recognizing when a crisis is\nbuilding and responding decisively. When SVB failed it was clear that a number of\nstandard assumptions, even though they were informed by hard experience, were wrong.\nNotably, bank runs were no longer a matter of days or weeks—they could now be nearly\ninstantaneous. Fortunately, in concert with other parts of the government, we were able\nto act decisively to meet the liquidity needs of the banking system, protect depositors, and\nlimit contagion.\n2 Of course, any rule change will go through the standard rulemaking process, including public notice and\ncomment, and have appropriate phase-in and transition periods.\n\n- 6 -\nThe third observation is the value of having the very largest banks be highly\nresilient. Our regulatory system is much stronger for the substantial additional\nsafeguards we have built around the G-SIBs since the Great Recession. They are subject\nto capital surcharges, required to be highly liquid, and held to the highest supervisory\nstandards. The events of the past couple of months would have been much more difficult\nto manage had the largest banks been undercapitalized or illiquid.\nConclusion\nThe Great Recession was a watershed moment, demonstrating the terrible\nconsequences a fragile financial system can have on people’s lives. In response,\nregulators in the U.S. and around the globe set out to build a much more resilient\nfinancial system. And the ensuing experiences of the pandemic and the past few months\ndid much to validate this approach.\nThe bank runs and failures in 2023, however, were painful reminders that we\ncannot predict all of the stresses that will inevitably come with time and chance. We\ntherefore must not grow complacent about the financial system’s resilience. And\nbuilding and maintaining that resilience requires collaboration. The system was able to\nwithstand recent shocks because of the efforts by regulators and legislators, including\nour international counterparts in the globally interconnected financial system.\nWe will take these lessons on board, and we will keep learning, as we must,\nbecause the work of building and maintaining a resilient financial system is never done.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n12:15 p.m. EDT\nMay 26, 2016\nRecent Economic Developments, the Productive Potential of the Economy,\nand Monetary Policy\nRemarks by\nJerome H. Powell\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nPeterson Institute for International Economics\nWashington, D.C.\nMay 26, 2016\n\nThank you for the opportunity to speak here today. I will begin by reviewing\nrecent economic developments and then turn to supply-side considerations, such as the\nlevel of potential output and the potential growth of our economy. I will conclude with a\ndiscussion of monetary policy. As always, the views I express here today are mine alone.\nRecent Developments and the State of the Economy\nThe U.S. economy has improved steadily since the recovery began seven years\nago. Our economy is now 10 percent larger than at its previous peak in 2007.\nEmployment has surpassed its 2008 peak by 5 million workers, and the unemployment\nrate has fallen from 10 percent to 5 percent, close to the level that many observers\nassociate with full employment.\nLabor market developments remain healthy, with employers adding roughly\n200,000 jobs per month so far this year--a pace similar to that of the past several years\n(figure 1). Job growth continues to be substantially faster than the underlying growth of\nthe labor force, so the labor market continues to tighten. Despite the strong job gains, the\nunemployment rate has flattened out at 5 percent over the past six months thanks to a\nwelcome increase in the labor force participation rate. Meanwhile, there are tentative and\nencouraging signs of a firming in wages, seen most clearly in the data on average hourly\nearnings, which are rising faster than inflation and productivity. All told, labor market\nindicators show an economy on solid footing.\nRecent spending data have been less positive than the labor market data. Growth\nof personal consumption slowed noticeably in the first quarter. Business fixed\ninvestment has fallen for two consecutive quarters, mainly because of a steep decline in\nenergy-related capital expenditures. As a result, gross domestic product (GDP) growth\n\n- 2 -\nover the two quarters ending in March 2016 is estimated to have averaged only 1 percent\non an annualized basis. This estimate may continue to move around as more data come\nin.1 And there are good reasons to think that underlying growth is stronger than these\nrecent readings suggest. Labor market data generally provide a better real-time signal of\nthe underlying pace of economic activity.2 In addition, retail sales surged in April, as did\nconsumer confidence in May, suggesting that the pause in consumption may have been\ntransitory. Moreover, stronger demand would be more consistent with an environment\nthat remains quite supportive of growth, with low interest rates, low gasoline prices, solid\nreal income gains, a high ratio of household wealth to income, healthy levels of business\nand household confidence, and continuing strong job creation. Indeed, current forecasts\nfor second-quarter GDP growth are for a rebound to around 2-1/4 percent.3\nInflation remains below the 2 percent target of the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC), with total inflation as measured by the price index for personal\nconsumption expenditures at 3/4 percent over the 12 months ending in March and core\ninflation at 1-1/2 percent, both slightly higher than a year earlier. Core inflation has been\nheld down by falling import prices, owing in large part to the rise in the dollar, as well as\nthe indirect effects of lower oil prices on core prices. As the recent financial market\ntensions have eased, oil prices have increased and the dollar has weakened a bit on net. If\noil prices and the dollar remain broadly stable, inflation should move up further over time\nto our 2 percent objective. Inflation expectations seem to be under some downward\n1 For example, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, a 70 percent confidence band around the\nestimate of first-quarter GDP would extend from negative 0.7 percent to 1.7 percent, which implies that the\nspending data should be taken with a grain of salt.\n2 Analysis by Board staff finds that lagged employment growth provides a better signal of current-quarter\nGDP or employment growth than does lagged GDP growth.\n3 For example, the May Blue Chip forecast for second-quarter real GDP growth was 2.3 percent, and the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s GDPNow forecasting model predicted 2.5 percent, as of May 17.\n\n- 3 -\npressure. Some survey-based measures are at the low end of their recent historical\nranges. Market-based measures of longer-term breakevens have declined significantly\nsince mid-2014 and stand near all-time lows. While I see expectations as staying\nreasonably well anchored, it is essential that they remain so and that inflation return over\ntime to the 2 percent objective.\nThe easing in global financial conditions since mid-February and the associated\nwaning in downside risks are welcome, and in part reflect expectations that the FOMC\nwould move more slowly in removing monetary accommodation. However, underlying\nrisks will likely remain until global growth is on a stronger footing. Growth and inflation\nremain stubbornly low for most of our major trading partners. In China, stimulus\nmeasures should support growth in the near term but may also slow China’s necessary\ntransition away from its export- and investment-led business model. Meanwhile, the\nongoing buildup of debt there is notable. There is also some remaining uncertainty about\nChina’s exchange rate policy. Elsewhere, risks are posed by the upcoming “Brexit” vote,\nongoing pressures from refugee flows into Europe, and challenging conditions for\nemerging economies such as Brazil, Russia, and Venezuela.\nDespite these downside risks, I see U.S. demand growing at a moderate pace, the\nlabor market continuing to heal, and inflation returning over time to the FOMC’s\n2 percent objective. The economy is on track to attain the Committee’s dual mandate of\nstable prices and maximum employment.\nSupply-Side Considerations\nFor several years after the crisis, economic activity remained far below its\npotential, and the need for highly accommodative policy seemed clear. As the shortfall\n\n- 4 -\nof output from potential has narrowed, supply-side considerations such as the level and\ngrowth rate of potential output naturally begin to matter more for policy. I will turn now\nto a discussion of these issues.\nThe tension between labor market and spending data is not a recent phenomenon.\nThroughout the recovery period, forecasters have consistently overestimated both actual\nand potential GDP growth while underestimating the rate of job creation and the pace of\ndecline of the unemployment rate (table 1). For example, in 2007, the average\nexpectation for long-run GDP growth from the Blue Chip survey of 50 forecasters was\n2.9 percent (table 2). After successive reductions, the estimate now stands at 2.1 percent.\nBlue Chip forecasters also underestimated the decline in the unemployment rate. Other\nwell-known forecasts followed this same pattern, including those of the Congressional\nBudget Office, the Survey of Professional Forecasters, and, yes, FOMC participants. The\npattern suggests that forecasters have only gradually taken on board the decline in\npotential in the wake of the financial crisis.\nOutput growth can be decomposed into increases in hours worked and changes in\noutput per hour, or productivity growth. For the United States, much of the post-crisis\ndecline in estimates of potential output growth appears to reflect weak labor productivity\ngrowth rather than damage to labor supply. Labor productivity has increased only\n1/2 percent per year since 2010--the slowest five-year growth rate since World War II\nand about one-fourth of the average postwar rate (figure 2). For further perspective,\nproductivity growth averaged 1-1/2 percent during the so-called slow productivity period\nfrom 1974 to 1995 and 3 percent during the tech-boom decade from 1995 to 2005. The\nslowdown has been worldwide and is evident even in countries that were little affected by\n\n- 5 -\nthe crisis (figure 3). Given the global nature of the phenomenon, changes in factors\nspecific to the United States are probably not the main drivers.\nOne factor holding back productivity in recent years has been the meager growth\nin the business sector’s capital stock (figure 4). This weakness is consistent with the\nweak recovery in demand.4 Another important factor is the marked decline in total factor\nproductivity (TFP) growth (figure 5). TFP is that part of productivity that is not\nexplained by capital investment or labor quality; it is thought to be mainly a function of\ntechnological innovation.5 A broad decline in the dynamism in our economy may also be\ncontributing to lower TFP.6 There is strong evidence that the slowdown in TFP growth\nin the United States preceded the financial crisis, particularly in sectors that produce or\nuse information technologies.7\n4 See Eugenio Pinto and Stacey Tevlin (2014), “Perspectives on the Recent Weakness in Investment,”\nFEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, November 21),\nwww.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/notes/feds-notes/2014/perspectives-on-the-recent-weakness-in-\ninvestments-20140521.html. Their analysis indicates that investment growth over the expansion has been\nconsistent with a model using business output growth and the user cost of capital. In a second model, they\nshow that the modest increases in the capital stock are consistent with the increase in labor supply and TFP.\n5 Over long periods of time total factor productivity is primarily driven by innovation, knowledge and the\nefficiency with which inputs are put to use owing to the evolution of business practices as well as the\ninfluences of public capital stock, government regulations and other factors. Over shorter periods of time\nTFP will also capture the variations in the intensity of utilization of inputs, such as capacity utilization and\nhours per worker. Disentangling TFP from capital deepening and hours worked can be challenging.\n6 See, for example, Ryan Decker, John Haltiwanger, Ron Jarmin, and Javier Miranda (2014), “The Role of\nEntrepreneurship in U.S. Job Creation and Economic Dynamism,” Journal of Economic Perspectives,\nvol. 28 (Summer), pp. 3-24.\n7 See John Fernald (2014), “Productivity and Potential Output before, during, and after the Great\nRecession,” NBER Macroeconomics Annual, vol. 29, no. 1 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of\nEconomic Research). Some have argued that part of the TFP slowdown may actually be a measurement\nproblem, owing to the difficulty in measuring the productivity of health care, information technology, and\nother services. Others see the evidence for that claim as weak. For example, a recent paper finds little\nevidence that the slowdown arises from growing mismeasurement in information-technology-related goods\nand services. See David M. Byrne, John G. Fernald, and Marshall B. Reinsdorf (2016), “Does the United\nStates Have a Productivity Slowdown or a Measurement Problem?” Brookings Papers on Economic\nActivity, March 4, www.brookings.edu/about/projects/bpea/papers/2016/byrne-et-al-productivity-\nmeasurement.\n\n- 6 -\nThe range of opinions on the future path of productivity growth is wide, and the\nhistorical record provides ample grounds for humility.8 A middle-ground position that\nseems to underlie many current forecasts is that productivity is probably still being held\ndown by cyclical factors and lingering effects of the crisis. As those factors dissipate,\nlabor productivity growth should move up to 1-1/2 percent or so, the lower end of its\nlonger-run range.\nIn addition to productivity, the other principal factor in potential output is labor\nsupply, which is determined by the working-age population, the natural rate of\nunemployment, and the trend labor force participation rate. Both the natural rate of\nunemployment and labor force participation initially appeared to suffer crisis-related\ndamage. But more recent data are a bit more encouraging.\nThe natural rate of unemployment reflects the matching of characteristics that\nemployers are seeking with those of the unemployed. With the dramatic labor market\ndislocations of the crisis, it was not surprising to see measures of matching efficiency\ndeteriorate, and many observers raised their estimates of the natural rate accordingly. But\nthere are other factors, such as demographic change, that may have led to a decline in the\nnatural rate of unemployment.9 Blue Chip forecasters’ estimate of the natural rate have\nnow returned to around 5 percent, about the same as before the crisis, suggesting that\n8 On the pessimistic end of the spectrum are analysts such as Robert Gordon; among the optimists are Erik\nBrynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee. See Robert J. Gordon (2016), The Rise and Fall of American Growth:\nThe U.S. Standard of Living since the Civil War (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press); and Erik\nBrynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee (2014), The Second Machine Age: Work, Progress, and Prosperity in a\nTime of Brilliant Technologies (New York: W.W. Norton).\n9 For example, older labor force cohorts have lower participation but also lower unemployment rates.\n\n- 7 -\nthese factors are roughly offsetting. Of course, estimates of the natural rate are highly\nuncertain.10\nTrends in labor force participation add another element of uncertainty.\nParticipation has been declining since about 2000 and is estimated to have a trend rate of\ndecline of 20 to 30 basis points per year, driven by population aging and other longer-\nterm trends such as the decline in participation by prime-age males. But the participation\nrate fell sharply after the crisis, faster than its apparent trend. It has been important to\nunderstand how much of the post-crisis decline is cyclical, and thus amenable to repair by\nsupportive policies, and how much is secular, due either to longer-run trends or to\nirreversible crisis-related damage. It has been a relief to see the participation rate\nimprove over the past two years relative to estimates of its trend; indeed, participation is\nnow close to some such estimates.11 Still, despite this relative improvement, the\nperformance of the U.S. economy on this dimension has been poor relative to that of\nmost OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries. For\nexample, in the prime-age group of 25 to 54, the United States experienced a 2\n10 Confidence intervals around statistical estimates of the natural rate are routinely estimated to be quite\nwide, reflecting both uncertainty about the correct model specification and uncertainty about the parameter\nestimates given the model. The canonical paper by Staiger, Stock, and Watson puts the 95 percent\nconfidence interval at 1-1/2 percentage points on either side of the point estimate. See Douglas Staiger,\nJames H. Stock, and Mark W. Watson (1997), “How Precise Are Estimates of the Natural Rate of\nUnemployment?” in Christina D. Romer and David H. Romer, eds., Reducing Inflation: Motivation and\nStrategy (Chicago: University of Chicago Press).\n11 For example, a paper by Stephanie Aaronson and others estimates a trend below the current participation\nrate, while the Congressional Budget Office’s estimate is above the current rate. See Stephanie Aaronson,\nTomaz Cajner, Bruce Fallick, Felix Galbis-Reig, Christopher Smith, and William Wascher (2014), “Labor\nForce Participation: Recent Developments and Future Prospects,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity,\nFall, pp. 197-275, www.brookings.edu/~/media/Projects/BPEA/Fall-\n2014/Fall2014BPEA_Aaronson_et_al.pdf?la=en; and Congressional Budget Office (2016), The Budget and\nEconomic Outlook: 2016 to 2026 (Washington: CBO, January 25),\nhttps://www.cbo.gov/publication/51129. For the argument that most of the decline is related to the severity\nof the recession and is likely reversible, see Christopher J. Erceg and Andrew T. Levin (2013), “Labor\nForce Participation and Monetary Policy in the Wake of the Great Recession,” IMF Working Paper\nWP/13/245 (Washington: International Monetary Fund, July),\nhttps://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2013/wp13245.pdf.\n\n- 8 -\npercentage point decline in labor force participation from 2007 to 2014, while most\nOECD countries saw an increase (figure 6). The United States now stands at the low end\nof labor force participation for both men and women in this age group--above Italy, but\nwell below Germany, France, and Spain.12\nLower potential growth would likely translate into lower estimates of the level of\ninterest rates necessary to sustain stable prices and full employment. Estimates of the\nlong-run “neutral” federal funds rate have declined about 100 basis points since the end\nof the crisis. The real yield on the 10-year Treasury is currently close to zero, compared\nwith around 2 percent in the mid-2000s. Some of the decline in longer-term rates is\nexplained by lower estimates of potential growth, and some by other factors such as very\nlow term premiums.\nTo sum up so far, estimates of long-run potential growth of the U.S. economy\nhave dropped from about 3 percent to about 2 percent in the wake of the crisis, with much\nof the decline a function of slower productivity growth. The decline in realized\nproductivity growth seems to be driven both by low capital investment that is well\nexplained by weak demand and by lower TFP growth. Expectations of lower\nproductivity growth going forward are more a function of slower gains in TFP. Lower\npotential output growth would mean that interest rates will remain below their pre-crisis\nlevels even after the output gap is fully closed and inflation returns to 2 percent.\n12 Different countries use slightly different concepts for measuring labor force participation, and therefore\ncross-country comparisons may reflect some measurement issues. However, to the extent that these\ndifferences are constant over time, comparisons of the relative performances will be little\naffected. Accordingly, it is worth highlighting that the labor force participation rate in the 25-54 age group\nhas declined somewhat in the U.S. since 2008, while it has been relatively steady or even increased some in\nother major advanced economies.\n\n- 9 -\nOver time, our understanding of the relationship between recessions and supply-\nside factors has evolved.13 There is a growing body of work suggesting that recessions\ncan leave behind lasting damage--especially severe recessions associated with a financial\ncrisis. One recent analysis suggests that about one-third of the time, there is no\npermanent supply-side damage; about one-third of the time, there is a reduction in the\nlevel of potential output but not its subsequent growth rate; and about one-third of the\ntime, there is a reduction both in the level of output and in the growth rate.14\nUnfortunately, recent experience suggests that the United States is at risk of falling in the\nlast category (figure 7).\nIt goes without saying that economic policymakers should use all available tools\nto minimize supply-side damage from the crisis. We need policies that support labor\nforce participation and the development of skills, business hiring and investment, and\nproductivity growth--policies that are, for the most part, outside the remit of the Federal\nReserve. Monetary policy can contribute by continuing to support the expansion as long\nas inflation remains consistent with our 2 percent objective and inflation expectations\nremain stable.\n13 See, for example, Robert F. Martin, Teyanna Munyan, and Beth Anne Wilson (2014), “Potential Output\nand Recessions: Are We Fooling Ourselves?” IFDP Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System, November 12), www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/notes/ifdp-\nnotes/2014/potential-output-and-recessions-are-we-fooling-ourselves-20141112.html; and Olivier\nBlanchard, Eugenio Cerutti, and Lawrence Summers (2015), “Inflation and Activity--Two Explorations\nand Their Monetary Policy Implications,” IMF Working Paper WP/15/230 (Washington: International\nMonetary Fund, November), https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2015/wp15230.pdf.\n14 See Blanchard, Cerutti, and Summers, “Inflation and Activity,” in note 13. The authors argue that\ndamage from recessions may be caused by hysteresis or by supply shocks such as oil price spikes or\nfinancial crises. In some cases, the link between recessions and future growth may reflect “reverse\ncausation,” whereby the recession is caused by the realization that future growth will be lower than had\nbeen expected.\n\n- 10 -\nStrong labor markets do seem to be averting some of the damage that might\notherwise have become permanent. Improved matching is reducing the natural rate of\nunemployment. Potential workers are being pulled into the labor force by rising real\nwages and the recognition that jobs are becoming easier to find. Over a longer period,\nstronger demand should support increased investment, driving productivity higher.\nMoreover, as the economy tightens, firms will have rising incentives to get more out of\nevery dollar of capital and hour of work.\nReal-time estimates of potential output are highly uncertain; forecasts of potential\ngrowth even more so. We can estimate growth of the working-age population reasonably\nwell. Future levels of labor force participation are less certain. Least certain of all are\nforecasts of TFP. If the optimists are right, then there will eventually be another wave of\nhigh productivity growth driven by the truly remarkable evolution of technology. That\nwould mean higher potential growth, faster increases in living standards, and also a return\nto higher interest rates over time.\nWhat if the pessimists are right and productivity growth remains low for another\ndecade, or indefinitely? The consequences would include lower potential growth and\nrelatively lower living standards. Our longer-term fiscal challenges would be\nsignificantly greater.\nMonetary Policy\nThe implications for monetary policy of these supply-side issues have been\nlimited, but they begin to matter more as we near full employment.\nFor the near term, my baseline expectation is that our economy will continue on\nits path of growth at around 2 percent. To confirm that expectation, it will be important\n\n- 11 -\nto see a significant strengthening in growth in the second quarter after the apparent\nsoftness of the past two quarters. To support this growth narrative, I also expect the\nongoing healing process in labor markets to continue, with strong job growth, further\nreductions in headline unemployment and other measures of slack, and increases in wage\ninflation. As the economy tightens, I expect that inflation will continue to move over\ntime to the Committee’s 2 percent objective.\nIf incoming data continue to support those expectations, I would see it as\nappropriate to continue to gradually raise the federal funds rate. Depending on the\nincoming data and the evolving risks, another rate increase may be appropriate fairly\nsoon. Several factors suggest that the pace of rate increases should be gradual, including\nthe asymmetry of risks at the zero lower bound, downside risks from weak global\ndemand and geopolitical events, a lower long-run neutral federal funds rate, and the\napparently elevated sensitivity of financial conditions to monetary policy. Uncertainty\nabout the location of supply-side constraints provides another reason for gradualism.\nThere are potential concerns with such a gradual approach. It is possible that\nmonetary policy could push resource utilization too high, and that inflation would move\ntemporarily above target. In an era of anchored inflation expectations, undershooting the\nnatural rate of unemployment should result in only a small and temporary increase in the\ninflation rate.15 But running the economy above its potential growth rate for an extended\nperiod could involve significant risks even if inflation does not move meaningfully above\ntarget. A long period of very low interest rates could lead to excessive risk-taking and,\n15 See, for example, Laurence Ball and Sandeep Mazumder (2011), \"The Evolution of Inflation Dynamics\nand the Great Recession,\" Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, (Spring), pp. 337–381,\nwww.brookings.edu/about/projects/bpea/papers/2011/inflation-dynamics-and-the-great-recession-ball\nBlanchard, Cerutti, and Summers, “Inflation and Activity”, in note 13.\n\n- 12 -\nover time, to unsustainably high asset prices and credit growth. Macroprudential and\nother supervisory policies are designed to reduce both the likelihood of such an outcome\nand the severity of the consequences if it does occur. But it is not certain that these tools\nwould prove adequate in a financial system in which much intermediation takes place\noutside the regulated banking sector. Thus, developments along these lines could\nultimately present a difficult set of tradeoffs for monetary policy.16\nConclusion\nTo wrap up, with the support of monetary accommodation, our economy has\nmade substantial progress. My view is that a continued gradual return to more normal\nmonetary policy settings will give us the best chance to continue to make up lost ground.\n16 See for example, Jeremy C. Stein (2013), “Overheating in Credit Markets: Origins, Measurement, and\nPolicy Responses.” https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/stein20130207a.htm. Tobias\nAdrian and Adam B.

Stein (2011), “A Macroprudential Approach to\nFinancial Regulation,” Journal of Economic Perspectives vol. 25, no. 1, both note that macroprudential\ntools may not be sufficient to fully address risks rising outside of the regulated banking sector.\n\nRecent Economic Developments, the Productive\nPotential of the Economy, and Monetary Policy\nJerome H.

    "text": "For release on delivery\n1:00 p.m. EDT\nJune 25, 2019\nEconomic Outlook and Monetary Policy Review\nRemarks by\nJerome H. Powell\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nCouncil on Foreign Relations\nNew York, New York\nJune 25, 2019\n\nGood afternoon. It is a pleasure to speak at the Council on Foreign Relations. I\nwill begin with a progress report on the broad public review my Federal Reserve\ncolleagues and I are conducting of the strategy, tools, and communication practices we\nuse to achieve the objectives Congress has assigned to us by law—maximum\nemployment and price stability, or the dual mandate. Then I will discuss the outlook for\nthe U.S. economy and monetary policy. I look forward to the discussion that will follow.\nDuring our public review, we are seeking perspectives from people across the\nnation, and we are doing so through open public meetings live-streamed on the internet.\nLet me share some of the thinking behind this review, which is the first of its nature we\nhave undertaken. The Fed is insulated from short-term political pressures—what is often\nreferred to as our “independence.” Congress chose to insulate the Fed this way because it\nhad seen the damage that often arises when policy bends to short-term political interests.\nCentral banks in major democracies around the world have similar independence.\nAlong with this independence comes the obligation to explain clearly what we are\ndoing and why we are doing it, so that the public and their elected representatives in\nCongress can hold us accountable. But real accountability demands more of us than clear\nexplanation: We must listen. We must actively engage those we serve to understand\nhow we can more effectively and faithfully use the powers they have entrusted to us.\nThat is why we are formally and publicly opening our decisionmaking to suggestions,\nscrutiny, and critique. With unemployment low, the economy growing, and inflation near\nour symmetric 2 percent objective, this is a good time to undertake such a review.\nAnother factor motivating the review is that the challenges of monetary\npolicymaking have changed in a fundamental way in recent years. Interest rates are\n\n- 2 -\nlower than in the past, and likely to remain so. The persistence of lower rates means that,\nwhen the economy turns down, interest rates will more likely fall close to zero—their\neffective lower bound (ELB). Proximity to the ELB poses new problems to central banks\nand calls for new ideas. We hope to benefit from the best thinking on these issues.\nAt the heart of the review are our Fed Listens events, which include town hall–\nstyle meetings in all 12 Federal Reserve Districts. These meetings bring together people\nwith wide-ranging perspectives, interests, and expertise. We also want to benefit from\nthe insights of leading economic researchers. We recently held a conference at the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago that combined research presentations by top scholars\nwith roundtable discussions among leaders of organizations that serve union workers,\nlow- and moderate-income communities, small businesses, and people struggling to find\nwork.\nWe have been listening. What have we heard? Scholars at the Chicago event\noffered a range of views on how well our monetary policy tools have effectively\npromoted our dual mandate. We learned more about cutting-edge ways to measure job\nmarket conditions. We heard the latest perspectives on what financial and trade links\nwith the rest of the world mean for the conduct of monetary policy. We heard scholarly\nviews on the interplay between monetary policy and financial stability. And we heard a\nreview of the clarity and the efficacy of our communications.\nLike many others at the conference, I was particularly struck by two panels that\nincluded people who work every day in low- and middle-income communities. What we\nheard, loud and clear, was that today’s tight labor markets mean that the benefits of this\nlong recovery are now reaching these communities to a degree that has not been felt for\n\n- 3 -\nmany years. We heard of companies, communities, and schools working together to\nbring employers the productive workers they need—and of employers working creatively\nto structure jobs so that employees can do their jobs while coping with the demands of\nfamily and life beyond the workplace. We heard that many people who, in the past,\nstruggled to stay in the workforce are now getting an opportunity to add new and better\nchapters to their life stories. All of this underscores how important it is to sustain this\nexpansion.\nThe conference generated vibrant discussions. We heard that we are doing many\nthings well, that we have much we can improve, and that there are different views about\nwhich is which. That disagreement is neither surprising nor unwelcome. The questions\nwe are confronting about monetary policymaking and communication, particularly those\nrelating to the ELB, are difficult ones that have grown in urgency over the past two\ndecades. That is why it is so important that we actively seek opinions, ideas, and\ncritiques from people throughout the economy to refine our understanding of how best to\nuse the monetary policy powers Congress has granted us.\nBeginning soon, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will devote time at\nits regular meetings to assess the lessons from these events, supported by analysis by staff\nfrom around the Federal Reserve System. We will publicly report the conclusions of our\ndiscussions, likely during the first half of next year. In the meantime, anyone who is\ninterested in learning more can find information on the Federal Reserve Board’s\nwebsite.1\n1 More on Fed Listens events and related information is available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review-of-monetary-policy-strategy-tools-and-\ncommunications-fed-listens-events.htm.\n\n- 4 -\nLet me turn now from the longer-term issues that are the focus of the review to\nthe nearer-term outlook for the economy and for monetary policy. So far this year, the\neconomy has performed reasonably well. Solid fundamentals are supporting continued\ngrowth and strong job creation, keeping the unemployment rate near historic lows. Although\ninflation has been running somewhat below our symmetric 2 percent objective, we have\nexpected it to pick up, supported by solid growth and a strong job market. Along with this\nfavorable picture, we have been mindful of some ongoing crosscurrents, including trade\ndevelopments and concerns about global growth. When the FOMC met at the start of May,\ntentative evidence suggested these crosscurrents were moderating, and we saw no strong case\nfor adjusting our policy rate.\nSince then, the picture has changed. The crosscurrents have reemerged, with\napparent progress on trade turning to greater uncertainty and with incoming data raising\nrenewed concerns about the strength of the global economy. Our contacts in business\nand agriculture report heightened concerns over trade developments. These concerns\nmay have contributed to the drop in business confidence in some recent surveys and may\nbe starting to show through to incoming data. For example, the limited available\nevidence we have suggests that investment by businesses has slowed from the pace\nearlier in the year.\nAgainst the backdrop of heightened uncertainties, the baseline outlook of my\nFOMC colleagues, like that of many other forecasters, remains favorable, with\nunemployment remaining near historic lows. Inflation is expected to return to 2 percent\nover time, but at a somewhat slower pace than we foresaw earlier in the year. However,\nthe risks to this favorable baseline outlook appear to have grown.\n\n- 5 -\nLast week, my FOMC colleagues and I held our regular meeting to assess the\nstance of monetary policy. We did not change the setting for our main policy tool, the\ntarget range for the federal funds rate, but we did make significant changes in our policy\nstatement. Since the beginning of the year, we had been taking a patient stance toward\nassessing the need for any policy change. We now state that the Committee will closely\nmonitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as\nappropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market and inflation near its\nsymmetric 2 percent objective.\nThe question my colleagues and I are grappling with is whether these\nuncertainties will continue to weigh on the outlook and thus call for additional policy\naccommodation. Many FOMC participants judge that the case for somewhat more\naccommodative policy has strengthened. But we are also mindful that monetary policy\nshould not overreact to any individual data point or short-term swing in sentiment. Doing\nso would risk adding even more uncertainty to the outlook. We will closely monitor the\nimplications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as\nappropriate to sustain the expansion.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n9:00 a.m. EST (3:00 p.m. local time)\nJanuary 10, 2023\nPanel on “Central Bank Independence and the Mandate—Evolving Views”\nRemarks by\nJerome H. Powell\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nSymposium on Central Bank Independence\nSveriges Riksbank\nStockholm, Sweden\nJanuary 10, 2023\n\nI will address three main points. First, the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy\nindependence is an important and broadly supported institutional arrangement that has\nserved the American public well. Second, the Fed must continuously earn that\nindependence by using our tools to achieve our assigned goals of maximum employment\nand price stability, and by providing transparency to facilitate understanding and effective\noversight by the public and their elected representatives in Congress. Third, we should\n“stick to our knitting” and not wander off to pursue perceived social benefits that are not\ntightly linked to our statutory goals and authorities.\nCentral bank independence and transparency\nOn the first point, the case for monetary policy independence lies in the benefits\nof insulating monetary policy decisions from short-term political considerations.1 Price\nstability is the bedrock of a healthy economy and provides the public with immeasurable\nbenefits over time. But restoring price stability when inflation is high can require\nmeasures that are not popular in the short term as we raise interest rates to slow the\neconomy. The absence of direct political control over our decisions allows us to take\nthese necessary measures without considering short-term political factors. I believe that\nthe benefits of independent monetary policy in the U.S. context are well understood and\nbroadly accepted.2\n1 In the past several decades, support for arrangements in which central banks made monetary policy\ndecisions in pursuit of legislated goals of economic and price stability has been buttressed by theoretical\nand empirical research contributions, including by Kenneth Rogoff, on the benefits of central bank\nindependence. See Rogoff (1985) as well as the discussion below of the distinction between goal\nindependence and instrument independence. With regard to empirical evidence on the matter, see Alesina\nand Summers (1993) as well as the subsequent research literature of the past three decades, including\nCrowe and Meade (2008). Bernanke (2010) and Tucker (2018) provide overviews of the development of\ncentral bank independence.\n2 Our situation is different from that of the European Central Bank, whose independence is enumerated in\nArticle 130 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which is available from the European\nUnion at https://lexparency.org/eu/TFEU/ART_130.\n\n- 2 -\nIn a well-functioning democracy, important public policy decisions should be\nmade, in almost all cases, by the elected branches of government. Grants of\nindependence to agencies should be exceedingly rare, explicit, tightly circumscribed, and\nlimited to those issues that clearly warrant protection from short-term political\nconsiderations.\nWith independence comes the responsibility to provide the transparency that\nenables effective oversight by Congress, which, in turn, supports the Fed’s democratic\nlegitimacy. At the Fed, we treat this as an active, not passive, responsibility, and over the\npast several decades we have steadily broadened our efforts to provide meaningful\ntransparency about the basis for, and consequences of, the decisions we make in service\nto the American public. We are tightly focused on achieving our statutory mandate and\non providing useful and appropriate transparency.3\nSticking to our mandate\nIt is essential that we stick to our statutory goals and authorities, and that we resist\nthe temptation to broaden our scope to address other important social issues of the day.4\nTaking on new goals, however worthy, without a clear statutory mandate would\nundermine the case for our independence.\n3 We continue to strive to improve our transparency. Over my five years as Chair, I have pursued this aim\nby extending postmeeting press conferences to all FOMC meetings and instituting ongoing personal\ndialogue with legislators. This continuous dialogue goes well beyond the regular testimony, established by\nstatute, in which I report to the congressional committees that have oversight responsibilities regarding\nmonetary policy.\n4 Although the Federal Reserve has been independent since its inception in 1914, its dual mandate only\nbecame part of the law in 1977 (see Bernanke, 2010). The existence of the dual mandate reflects the fact\nthat the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy independence corresponds to operational, or instrument,\nindependence, rather than goal independence. See Debelle and Fischer (1994) for an analysis of the\ndistinction between types of independence.\n\n- 3 -\nIn the area of bank regulation, too, the Fed has a degree of independence, as do\nthe other federal bank regulators. Independence in this area helps ensure that the public\ncan be confident that our supervisory decisions are not influenced by political\nconsiderations.5 Today, some analysts ask whether incorporating into bank supervision\nthe perceived risks associated with climate change is appropriate, wise, and consistent\nwith our existing mandates.\nAddressing climate change seems likely to require policies that would have\nsignificant distributional and other effects on companies, industries, regions, and nations.\nDecisions about policies to directly address climate change should be made by the elected\nbranches of government and thus reflect the public’s will as expressed through elections.\nAt the same time, in my view, the Fed does have narrow, but important,\nresponsibilities regarding climate-related financial risks. These responsibilities are\ntightly linked to our responsibilities for bank supervision.6 The public reasonably\nexpects supervisors to require that banks understand, and appropriately manage, their\nmaterial risks, including the financial risks of climate change.\nBut without explicit congressional legislation, it would be inappropriate for us to\nuse our monetary policy or supervisory tools to promote a greener economy or to achieve\nother climate-based goals.7 We are not, and will not be, a “climate policymaker.”\n5 Like our monetary policy independence, our independence in this area comes with a high level of\ntransparency about our policies and procedures.\n6 For details, see Board of Governors (2022).\n7 While U.S. monetary policy has the dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability, some\nother central banks have somewhat more expansive mandates. The Bank of England and the European\nCentral Bank both have a primary mandate to maintain price stability but a secondary mandate to support\nthe economic policies of the U.K. government and the European Union, respectively; see the Bank of\nEngland Act 1998, part II(11), available from the U.K. National Archives at\nhttps://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/11/contents, and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European\nUnion, Article 127(1), available from the European Union at https://lexparency.org/eu/TFEU/ART_127.\n\n- 4 -\nReferences\nAlesina, Alberto, and Lawrence H.

Powell\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nEconomic Club of New York Luncheon\nNew York, New York\nOctober 19, 2023\n\nBefore our discussion, I will take a few minutes to discuss recent economic data\nand the outlook for monetary policy.\nRecent Economic Data\nIncoming data over recent months show ongoing progress toward both of our dual\nmandate goals—maximum employment and stable prices.\nInflation\nBy the time the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) raised rates in March\n2022, it was clear that restoring price stability would require both the unwinding of\npandemic-related distortions to supply and demand, and also restrictive monetary policy\nto cool strong demand and give supply time to catch up. These forces are now working\ntogether to bring inflation down.\nAfter peaking at 7.1 percent in June 2022, 12-month headline PCE (personal\nconsumption expenditure) inflation is estimated at 3.5 percent through September.1 Core\nPCE inflation, which omits the volatile food and energy components, provides a better\nindicator of where inflation is heading. Twelve-month core PCE inflation peaked at 5.6\npercent in February 2022 and is estimated at 3.7 percent through September.\nInflation readings turned lower over the summer, a very favorable development.\nThe September inflation data continued the downward trend but were somewhat less\nencouraging. Shorter-term measures of core inflation over the most recent three and six\nmonths are now running below 3 percent. But these shorter-term measures are often\nvolatile. In any case, inflation is still too high, and a few months of good data are only\n1 Descriptions of PCE inflation include Board staff estimates of the September 2023 values based on\navailable information, including the September 2023 consumer price index and producer price index data.\nThe September 2023 PCE inflation data will be published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis on October\n27, 2023.\n\n- 2 -\nthe beginning of what it will take to build confidence that inflation is moving down\nsustainably toward our goal. We cannot yet know how long these lower readings will\npersist, or where inflation will settle over coming quarters. While the path is likely to be\nbumpy and take some time, my colleagues and I are united in our commitment to\nbringing inflation down sustainably to 2 percent.\nThe labor market\nIn the labor market, strong job creation has met a welcome increase in the supply\nof workers, due to both higher participation and a rebound of immigration to pre-\npandemic levels.2 Many indicators suggest that, while conditions remain tight, the labor\nmarket is gradually cooling. Job openings have moved well down from their highs and\nare now only modestly above pre-pandemic levels. Quits are back to pre-pandemic\nlevels, and the same is true of the wage premium earned by those who change jobs.3\nSurveys of workers and employers show a return to pre-pandemic levels of tightness.4\nAnd indicators of wage growth show a gradual decline toward levels that would be\nconsistent with 2 percent inflation over time.5\n2 The labor force participation rate has increased by about one-half percentage point since the end of last\nyear.\n3 For example, according to the Atlanta Fed's Wage Growth Tracker, the median wage growth for job\nswitchers is now only slightly higher than that of job stayers. The size of this gap is now similar to what\nwas normal pre-pandemic after being elevated in recent years.\n4 A measure of job availability drawn from Conference Board data—showing the difference between the\nshare of consumers saying that jobs are plentiful and the share saying that jobs are hard to get—was\nelevated in 2021–22 but is now below its 2019 average. In data from the National Federation of\nIndependent Businesses, the share of small business owners reporting difficulty filling job openings has\nlikewise declined considerably in the last two years and is now only slightly above its 2019 average.\n5 One recent indicator, average hourly earnings, grew 0.2 percent in September, resulting in an annualized\n3-month growth rate of 3.4 percent and a 12-month growth rate of 4.2 percent. By comparison, 12-month\naverage hourly earnings growth peaked at 5.9 percent in early 2022.\n\n- 3 -\nGrowth\nTo date, declining inflation has not come at the cost of meaningfully higher\nunemployment—a highly welcome development, but a historically unusual one. Healing\nof supply chains in conjunction with the rebalancing of demand and supply in the labor\nmarket has allowed disinflation without substantially weaker economic activity. Indeed,\neconomic growth has consistently surprised to the upside this year, as most recently seen\nin the strong retail sales data released earlier this week. Forecasters generally expect\ngross domestic product to come in very strong for the third quarter before cooling off in\nthe fourth quarter and next year. Still, the record suggests that a sustainable return to our\n2 percent inflation goal is likely to require a period of below-trend growth and some\nfurther softening in labor market conditions.6\nGeopolitical tensions are highly elevated and pose important risks to global\neconomic activity. Our institutional role at the Federal Reserve is to monitor these\ndevelopments for their economic implications, which remain highly uncertain. Speaking\nfor myself, I found the attack on Israel horrifying, as is the prospect for more loss of\ninnocent lives.\nMonetary Policy\nTurning to monetary policy, the FOMC has tightened policy substantially over the\npast 18 months, increasing the federal funds rate by 525 basis points at a historically fast\npace and decreasing our securities holdings by roughly $1 trillion. The stance of policy is\n6 For example, the October Blue Chip consensus estimate for annualized real gross domestic product\n(GDP) growth in the third quarter is 3.5 percent. Some projections anticipate even stronger growth, such as\nGDPNow, which currently anticipates 5.4 percent annualized growth in the third quarter, additional\ninformation is available on the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s website at\nhttps://www.atlantafed.org/cqer/research/gdpnow. The Bureau of Economic Analysis will release its\nadvance estimate of third quarter real GDP on October 26.\n\n- 4 -\nrestrictive, meaning that tight policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity\nand inflation. Given the fast pace of the tightening, there may still be meaningful\ntightening in the pipeline.\nMy colleagues and I are committed to achieving a stance of policy that is\nsufficiently restrictive to bring inflation sustainably down to 2 percent over time, and to\nkeeping policy restrictive until we are confident that inflation is on a path to that\nobjective. We are attentive to recent data showing the resilience of economic growth and\ndemand for labor. Additional evidence of persistently above-trend growth, or that\ntightness in the labor market is no longer easing, could put further progress on inflation at\nrisk and could warrant further tightening of monetary policy.\nAlong with many other factors, actual and expected changes in the stance of\nmonetary policy affect broader financial conditions, which in turn affect economic\nactivity, employment and inflation. Financial conditions have tightened significantly in\nrecent months, and longer-term bond yields have been an important driving factor in this\ntightening. We remain attentive to these developments because persistent changes in\nfinancial conditions can have implications for the path of monetary policy.\nConclusion\nMy colleagues and I remain resolute in our commitment to returning inflation to 2\npercent over time. A range of uncertainties, both old and new, complicate our task of\nbalancing the risk of tightening monetary policy too much against the risk of tightening\ntoo little. Doing too little could allow above-target inflation to become entrenched and\nultimately require monetary policy to wring more persistent inflation from the economy\n\n- 5 -\nat a high cost to employment. Doing too much could also do unnecessary harm to the\neconomy.\nGiven the uncertainties and risks, and how far we have come, the Committee is\nproceeding carefully. We will make decisions about the extent of additional policy\nfirming and how long policy will remain restrictive based on the totality of the incoming\ndata, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.\nThank you. I look forward to our conversation.",

Powell\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Challenges for Monetary Policy,” a symposium\nsponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\nJackson Hole, Wyoming\nAugust 23, 2019\n\nThis year’s symposium topic is “Challenges for Monetary Policy,” and for the\nFederal Reserve those challenges flow from our mandate to foster maximum employment\nand price stability. From this perspective, our economy is now in a favorable place, and I\nwill describe how we are working to sustain these conditions in the face of significant\nrisks we have been monitoring.\nThe current U.S. expansion has entered its 11th year and is now the longest on\nrecord.1 The unemployment rate has fallen steadily throughout the expansion and has\nbeen near half-century lows since early 2018. But that rate alone does not fully capture\nthe benefits of this historically strong job market. Labor force participation by people in\ntheir prime working years has been rising. While unemployment for minorities generally\nremains higher than for the workforce as a whole, the rate for African Americans, at\n6 percent, is the lowest since the government began tracking it in 1972. For the past few\nyears, wages have been increasing the most for people at the lower end of the wage scale.\nPeople who live and work in low- and middle-income communities tell us that this job\nmarket is the best anyone can recall. We increasingly hear reports that employers are\ntraining workers who lack required skills, adapting jobs to the needs of employees with\nfamily responsibilities, and offering second chances to people who need one.\nInflation has been surprisingly stable during the expansion: not falling much\nwhen the economy was weak and not rising much as the expansion gained strength.\nInflation ran close to our symmetric 2 percent objective for most of last year but has been\nrunning somewhat below 2 percent this year.\n1 The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) has classified business cycle turning points back to\n1854 (see https://www.nber.org/cycles.html).\n\n- 2 -\nThus, after a decade of progress toward maximum employment and price\nstability, the economy is close to both goals. Our challenge now is to do what monetary\npolicy can do to sustain the expansion so that the benefits of the strong jobs market\nextend to more of those still left behind, and so that inflation is centered firmly around\n2 percent.\nToday I will explore what history tells us about sustaining long, steady\nexpansions. A good place to start is with the passage of the Employment Act of 1946,\nwhich stated that it is the “continuing policy and responsibility of the Federal\nGovernment . . . to promote maximum employment, production, and purchasing power.”2\nSome version of these goals has been in place ever since. I will divide the history since\nWorld War II into three eras organized around some well-known “Greats.” The first era\ncomprises the postwar years through the Great Inflation. The second era brought the\nGreat Moderation but ended in the Great Recession. The third era is still under way, and\ntime will tell what “Greats” may emerge.\nEach era presents a key question for the Fed and for society more generally. The\nfirst era raises the question whether a central bank can resist the temptations that led to\nthe Great Inflation. The second era raises the question whether long expansions\nsupported by better monetary policy inevitably lead to destabilizing financial excesses\nlike those seen in the Great Moderation. The third era confronts us with the question of\n2 See Declaration of Policy, section 2 of the Employment Act of 1946, Pub. L. 79-304, ch. 33, 60 Stat 23\n(1946), available at\nhttps://fraser.stlouisfed.org/scribd/?title_id=1099&filepath=/files/docs/historical/congressional/employment\n-act-1946.pdf.\nA modified version of those goals formally became the Fed’s dual mandate in 1977. For further\ndiscussion, see “Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978 (Humphrey-Hawkins)” on the\nBoard’s website at https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/humphrey_hawkins_act.\n\n- 3 -\nhow best to promote sustained prosperity in a world of slow global growth, low inflation,\nand low interest rates. Near the end of my remarks, I will discuss the current context, and\nthe ways these questions are shaping policy.\nEra I, 1950–1982: Policy Breeds Macroeconomic Instability and the Great Inflation\nThe late 1940s were a period of adjustment to a peacetime economy. As the\n1940s turned to the 1950s, the state of knowledge about how best to promote\nmacroeconomic stability was limited. The 1950s and early 1960s saw the economy\noscillating sharply between recession and growth above 6 percent (figure 1, panel A).\nThree expansions and contractions came in quick succession. With the benefit of\nhindsight, the lack of stability is generally attributed to “stop and go” stabilization policy,\nas monetary and fiscal authorities grappled with how best to modulate the use of their\nblunt but powerful tools.3\nBeginning in the mid-1960s, “stop and go” policy gave way to “too much go and\nnot enough stop”—not enough, that is, to quell rising inflation pressures. Both inflation\nand inflation expectations ratcheted upward through four expansions until the Fed, under\nChairman Paul Volcker, engineered a definitive stop in the early 1980s (figure 1,\npanel C). Each of the expansions in the Great Inflation period ended with monetary\npolicy tightening in response to rising inflation.\nPolicymakers came out of the Great Inflation era with a clear understanding that it\nwas essential to anchor inflation expectations at some low level. But many believed that\n3 Romer and Romer (2002) document that the Federal Open Market Committee understood the essence of\nsound policy. Nonetheless, as Nelson (2013) discusses, many authors argue that the way those principles\nwere applied contributed to the fluctuations of the time.\n\n- 4 -\ncentral bankers would find it difficult to ignore the temptation of short-term employment\ngains at the cost of higher inflation down the road.4\nEra II, 1983 through 2009: the Great Moderation and Great Recession\nAs the second era began, inflation was falling, and it continued to fall for about a\ndecade (figure 2, panel C). In 1993, core inflation, which omits the volatile food and\nenergy components, first fell below 2.5 percent, and has since remained in the narrow\nrange of 0.9 percent to 2.5 percent.5 Greater success on price stability came with greater\nsuccess on employment. Expansions in this era were longer and more stable than before\n(figure 2, panel A). The era saw two of the three longest U.S. expansions up to that point\nin history.6\nAnchored inflation expectations helped make this win-win outcome possible, by\ngiving the Fed latitude to support employment when necessary without destabilizing\ninflation. The Fed was cutting, not raising, rates in the months prior to the end of the first\ntwo expansions in this era, and the ensuing recessions were mild by historical standards.\nAnd twice during the long expansion of the 1990s, the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC) eased policy in response to threats to growth. In 1995, responding to evidence\n4 As discussed by Faust (1996), the structure of FOMC governance was motivated by the traditional view\nthat governments are tempted to resort to inflation in times of stress. With the post–World War II emphasis\non full employment and understanding the role of inflation expectations, this tendency was reformulated as\nseeking near-term gains on employment at the cost of long-term inflation (Kydland and Prescott, 1977;\nBarro and Gordon, 1983).\n5 Overall inflation, which is the subject of our symmetric 2 percent objective, has been somewhat more\nvolatile, but it is neither practical nor wise to try to smooth purely transitory inflation fluctuations. As such\ntransitory fluctuations are frequently driven by volatile food and energy prices, I am citing the stability of\ncore inflation on a four-quarter basis as a proxy for Fed performance in achieving the relevant sense of\nstability.\n6 Analysts debate the role that monetary policy and other factors, such as luck and structural change in the\neconomy, played in bringing about the Great Moderation. For example, Ahmed, Levin, and Wilson (2004)\nfind an important role for luck. Stock and Watson (2003) attribute much of the change to an unexplained\nimprovement in the tradeoff between inflation and output variability. Like Bernanke (2004), I believe that\nbetter policy was an important factor behind the better outcomes, perhaps allowing other factors to show\nthrough.\n\n- 5 -\nof slowing in the United States and abroad, the FOMC reduced the federal funds rate over\na few months. In 1998, the Russian debt default and the related collapse of the hedge\nfund Long-Term Capital Management rocked financial markets that were already fragile\nfrom the Asian financial crisis. Given the risks posed to the U.S. economy, the FOMC\nagain lowered the federal funds rate over a period of months until events quieted. The\n10-year expansion weathered both events with no discernible inflation cost.7\nBy the turn of the century, it was beginning to look like financial excesses and\nglobal events would pose the main threats to stability in this new era rather than\noverheating and rising inflation. The collapse of the tech stock bubble in 2000 and the\nSeptember 11, 2001, terrorist attacks played key roles in precipitating a slowdown that\nturned into a recession.8 And the next expansion, as we are all painfully aware, ended\nwith the collapse of a housing bubble and the Global Financial Crisis. Thus, this second\nera provided good reason for optimism about the Fed’s ability to deliver stable inflation,\nbut also raised a question about whether long expansions inevitably lead to destabilizing\nfinancial excesses.\nEra III, 2010 and After: Monetary Policy and the Emerging New Normal\nThe third era began in 2010 as the recovery from the Great Recession was taking\nhold. My focus in discussing this era will be on a “new normal” that is becoming\napparent in the wake of the crisis. I will fast-forward past the early years of the\nexpansion and pick up the story in December 2015.9 The unemployment rate had fallen\n7 Indeed, as I noted at this symposium last year, inflation ran surprisingly low in the second half of the\n1990s (Powell, 2018).\n8 This was an odd recession to classify. The collapse of the tech bubble was followed by several quarters of\ngenerally slow positive growth. Regarding declaring the 2001 recession, the NBER Business Cycle Dating\nCommittee stated, “Before the [September 11] attacks, it is possible that the decline in the economy would\nhave been too mild to qualify as a recession” (NBER, 2001, p. 8).\n9 Ben Bernanke (2012) surveyed the early years of the recovery at this symposium in 2012.\n\n- 6 -\nfrom a peak of 10 percent to 5 percent, roughly equal to the median FOMC participant’s\nestimate of the natural rate of unemployment at the time. At this point, the Committee\ndecided that it was prudent to begin gradually raising the federal funds rate based on the\nclosely monitored premise that the increasingly healthy economy called for more-normal\ninterest rates. The premise was generally borne out: Growth from the end of 2015 to the\nend of 2018 averaged 2.5 percent, a bit above the 2.2 percent rate over the previous five\nyears (figure 2, panel A). The unemployment rate fell below 4 percent, and inflation\nmoved up and remained close to our 2 percent objective through much of 2018 (figure 2,\npanels B and C).\nThat brings us to 2019. Before turning to issues occupying center stage at\npresent, I want to address a long-running issue that I discussed here last year: tracking\nthe “stars” that serve as guideposts for monetary policy.10 These include u*, the natural\nrate of unemployment, and r*, the neutral real rate of interest. Unlike celestial stars,\nthese stars move unpredictably and cannot be directly observed. We must judge their\nlocations as best we can based on incoming data and then add an element of risk\nmanagement to be able to use them as guides.\nSince 2012, declining unemployment has had surprisingly little effect on inflation,\nprompting a steady decline in estimates of u* (figure 3).11 Standard estimates of r* have\ndeclined between 2 and 3 percentage points over the past two decades. Some argue that\nthe effective decline is even larger.12 Incorporating a lower value of u* into policymaking\n10 Powell (2018).\n11 The fact that inflation did not react much to changing unemployment also led some to reassess other\nstructural features such as the slope of the Phillips curve.\n12 As discussed in Rachel and Summers (2019), many factors combine to determine the normal growth rate\nof the economy and r*. Persistent movements in longer-term interest rates in a stable inflation environment\nare one indicator of r* movements.\n\n- 7 -\ndoes not require a significant change in our approach. The significant fall in r*, however,\nmay demand more fundamental change. A lower r* combined with low inflation means\nthat interest rates will run, on average, significantly closer to their effective lower bound.\nThe key question raised by this era, then, is how we can best support maximum\nemployment and price stability in a world with a low neutral interest rate.\nCurrent Policy and the Three Key Questions\nLet me turn now to the current implications for monetary policy of the questions\nraised by these three eras. The first era raised the question of whether the Fed can avoid\nexcessive inflation. Inflation has averaged less than 2 percent over the past 25 years, and\nlow inflation has been the main concern for the past decade. Low inflation seems to be\nthe problem of this era, not high inflation. Nonetheless, in the unlikely event that signs of\ntoo-high inflation return, we have proven tools to address such a situation.\nThe second era’s question—whether long expansions inevitably breed financial\nexcesses—is a challenging and timely one. Hyman Minsky long argued that, as an\nexpansion continues and memories of the previous downturn fade, financial risk\nmanagement deteriorates and risks are increasingly underappreciated.13 This observation\nhas spurred much discussion. At the end of the day, we cannot prevent people from\nfinding ways to take excessive financial risks. But we can work to make sure that they\nbear the costs of their decisions, and that the financial system as a whole continues to\nfunction effectively. Since the crisis, Congress, the Fed, and other regulatory authorities\nhere and around the world have taken substantial steps to achieve these goals. Banks and\nother key institutions have significantly more capital and more stable funding than before\n13 See, for example, Minsky (1991).\n\n- 8 -\nthe crisis. We comprehensively review financial stability every quarter and release our\nassessments twice a year to highlight areas of concern and allow oversight of our efforts.\nWe have not seen unsustainable borrowing, financial booms, or other excesses of the sort\nthat occurred at times during the Great Moderation, and I continue to judge overall\nfinancial stability risks to be moderate. But we remain vigilant.\nThat leaves the third question of how, in this low r* world, the Fed can best\nsupport the economy. A low neutral interest rate presents both near-term and longer-term\nchallenges. I will begin with the current context. Because today’s setting is both\nchallenging and unique in many ways, it may be useful to lay out some general principles\nfor assessing and implementing appropriate policy and to describe how we have been\napplying those principles.\nThrough the FOMC’s setting of the federal funds rate target range and our\ncommunications about the likely path forward for policy and the economy, we seek to\ninfluence broader financial conditions to promote maximum employment and price\nstability. In forming judgments about the appropriate stance of policy, the Committee\ndigests a broad range of data and other information to assess the current state of the\neconomy, the most likely outlook for the future, and meaningful risks to that outlook.\nBecause the most important effects of monetary policy are felt with uncertain lags of a\nyear or more, the Committee must attempt to look through what may be passing\ndevelopments and focus on things that seem likely to affect the outlook over time or that\npose a material risk of doing so. Risk management enters our decisionmaking because of\nboth the uncertainty about the effects of recent developments and the uncertainty we face\nregarding structural aspects of the economy, including the natural rate of unemployment\n\n- 9 -\nand the neutral rate of interest. It will at times be appropriate for us to tilt policy one way\nor the other because of prominent risks. Finally, we have a responsibility to explain what\nwe are doing and why we are doing it so the American people and their elected\nrepresentatives in Congress can provide oversight and hold us accountable.\nWe have much experience in addressing typical macroeconomic developments\nunder this framework. But fitting trade policy uncertainty into this framework is a new\nchallenge. Setting trade policy is the business of Congress and the Administration, not\nthat of the Fed. Our assignment is to use monetary policy to foster our statutory goals. In\nprinciple, anything that affects the outlook for employment and inflation could also affect\nthe appropriate stance of monetary policy, and that could include uncertainty about trade\npolicy. There are, however, no recent precedents to guide any policy response to the\ncurrent situation. Moreover, while monetary policy is a powerful tool that works to\nsupport consumer spending, business investment, and public confidence, it cannot\nprovide a settled rulebook for international trade. We can, however, try to look through\nwhat may be passing events, focus on how trade developments are affecting the outlook,\nand adjust policy to promote our objectives.\nThis approach is illustrated by the way incoming data have shaped the likely path\nof policy this year. The outlook for the U.S. economy since the start of the year has\ncontinued to be a favorable one. Business investment and manufacturing have weakened,\nbut solid job growth and rising wages have been driving robust consumption and\nsupporting moderate growth overall.\nAs the year has progressed, we have been monitoring three factors that are\nweighing on this favorable outlook: slowing global growth, trade policy uncertainty, and\n\n- 10 -\nmuted inflation. The global growth outlook has been deteriorating since the middle of\nlast year. Trade policy uncertainty seems to be playing a role in the global slowdown and\nin weak manufacturing and capital spending in the United States. Inflation fell below our\nobjective at the start of the year. It appears to be moving back up closer to our\nsymmetric 2 percent objective, but there are concerns about a more prolonged shortfall.\nCommittee participants have generally reacted to these developments and the\nrisks they pose by shifting down their projections of the appropriate federal funds rate\npath. Along with July’s rate cut, the shifts in the anticipated path of policy have eased\nfinancial conditions and help explain why the outlook for inflation and employment\nremains largely favorable.\nTurning to the current context, we are carefully watching developments as we\nassess their implications for the U.S. outlook and the path of monetary policy. The three\nweeks since our July FOMC meeting have been eventful, beginning with the\nannouncement of new tariffs on imports from China. We have seen further evidence of a\nglobal slowdown, notably in Germany and China. Geopolitical events have been much in\nthe news, including the growing possibility of a hard Brexit, rising tensions in Hong\nKong, and the dissolution of the Italian government. Financial markets have reacted\nstrongly to this complex, turbulent picture. Equity markets have been volatile. Long-\nterm bond rates around the world have moved down sharply to near post-crisis lows.\nMeanwhile, the U.S. economy has continued to perform well overall, driven by consumer\nspending. Job creation has slowed from last year’s pace but is still above overall labor\nforce growth. Inflation seems to be moving up closer to 2 percent. Based on our\nassessment of the implications of these developments, we will act as appropriate to\n\n- 11 -\nsustain the expansion, with a strong labor market and inflation near its symmetric\n2 percent objective.\nThe Three Questions in the Longer Run\nLooking back over the three eras, monetary policy has evolved to address new\nchallenges as they have arisen. The inflation targeting regime that emerged after the\nGreat Inflation has led to vastly improved outcomes for employment and price stability\naround the world. One result has been much longer expansions, which often brought\nwith them the buildup of financial risk. This new pattern has led us to understand that\nassuring financial stability over time requires much greater resilience in our financial\nsystem, particularly for our largest, most complex banks.\nAs we look back over the decade since the end of the financial crisis, we can\nagain see fundamental economic changes that call for a reassessment of our policy\nframework. The current era has been characterized by much lower neutral interest rates,\ndisinflationary pressures, and slower growth. We face heightened risks of lengthy,\ndifficult-to-escape periods in which our policy interest rate is pinned near zero. To\naddress this new normal, we are conducting a public review of our monetary policy\nstrategy, tools, and communications—the first of its kind for the Federal Reserve. We\nare evaluating the pros and cons of strategies that aim to reverse past misses of our\ninflation objective. We are examining the monetary policy tools we have used both in\ncalm times and in crisis, and we are asking whether we should expand our toolkit. In\naddition, we are looking at how we might improve the communication of our policy\nframework.\n\n-12 -\nPublic engagement, unprecedented in scope for the Fed, is at the heart of this\neffort. Through Fed Listens events live-streamed on the internet, we are hearing a\ndiverse range of perspectives not only from academic experts, but also from\nrepresentatives of consumer, labor, business, community, and other groups. We have\nbegun a series of FOMC meetings at which we will discuss these questions. We will\ncontinue reporting on our discussions in the FOMC minutes and share our conclusions\nwhen we finish the review next year.\nI will conclude by saying that we are deeply committed to fulfilling our mandate\nin this challenging era, and I look forward to the valuable insights that will, I am\nconfident, be shared at this symposium.\n\n-13 -\nReferences\nAhmed, Shaghil, Andrew Levin, and Beth Anne Wilson (2004). “Recent U.S.\nMacroeconomic Stability: Good Policies, Good Practices, or Good Luck?”\nReview of Economics and Statistics, vol. 86 (August), pp. 824–32.\nBarro, Robert J., and David B.

    "text": "For release on delivery\n10:30 a.m. EDT\nMay 14, 2015\nRegulation and Supervision of Community Banks\nRemarks by\nJerome H. Powell\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nAnnual Community Bankers Conference sponsored by\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of New York\nNew York, New York\nMay 14, 2015\n\nGood morning. I am delighted to join you here today to discuss the state of\ncommunity banking and issues of importance to community banks like yours.1 New York\nmay be home to Wall Street, but, just like the rest of the country, most of the banks in the\nSecond District are community banks. There are more than 170 banking organizations\nhere with less than $10 billion in assets, serving millions of customers.\nCommunity banks play an essential role in our financial system, supporting the\neconomic health and vitality of the communities you serve. Unlike many of your larger\ncompetitors, community banks offer customers face-to-face interaction with a local banker\nwho has the authority to make the final decision on a loan--a banker with a long-term\ninvestment in the community who will not be moving to another branch in a new town\nwithin a few years. Community bankers benefit from local knowledge and relationships\nthat often lead to more successful and efficient lending decisions. These advantages have\nenabled many community banks in the Second District and around the country to maintain\nor increase their local market shares while competing with larger regional and money\ncenter banks, and I expect that they will continue to do so.\nNonetheless, community banks face significant challenges today. The number of\ncommunity banks has declined significantly over the past decade. The Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation’s “Problem List” of at-risk banks has declined from 888 at the peak\nof the financial crisis to 291 at the end of 2014, but that is still well above typical pre-\ncrisis levels of fewer than 100. There are several factors driving consolidation and\nelevating the number of problem banks, beyond the lasting effects of the recession. For\nstarters, community banks have been challenged in some of your traditional product lines\n1 The views I express here today are my own, and not necessarily those of any other person in the Federal\nReserve System.\n\n- 2 -\nby competition from larger financial institutions that can achieve lower costs through\neconomies of scale. At the same time, historically thin net interest margins have\nconstrained profitability, and, although not aimed at community banks, new post-crisis\nregulations meant to strengthen the financial system are coming into place that require\nadditional management attention.\nThe Federal Reserve recognizes the importance of a healthy community banking\nsector for our nation’s prosperity, and we are committed to understanding the challenges\nfaced by community banks and to carefully considering the effects of new regulations on\nthese institutions. Our mandate is to protect the safety and soundness of the nation’s\nfinancial system, and we aim to do so in a manner that promotes a level playing field for\nall institutions while taking into account the risks those institutions could pose to our\nfinancial system. As you know, the Federal Reserve tiers its regulations to be\ncommensurate with the risks presented by different institutions. The risks presented by an\ninstitution with $300 million in assets are very different from those presented by an\ninstitution with $300 billion in assets. Although the credit that a community bank extends\nto households and businesses within its local area may be difficult to replace, the failure of\na community bank would not cause a widespread contraction in credit or have any other\nsystemic consequences. For that reason, community banks are not subject to the same\nregulations that are applied to the most systemically important banking organizations.\nThe Federal Reserve’s 2013 capital guidelines are a good example of how we have\ntaken into account the effect of our regulations on community banks. The recession made\nit clear that strong capital positions are essential for banks of all sizes, including\ncommunity banks. After issuing our proposed guidelines, we received considerable input\n\n- 3 -\nfrom community bankers helping us to identify which portions of our original proposal\nwere, and were not, appropriate for community banks. Based on this input, we made some\nsignificant adjustments to the proposal to alter, for example, the risk-weighting of\nmortgage loans and the regulatory capital treatment of certain unrealized gains and losses\nand trust preferred securities for community banking organizations. Regulators also\ndeveloped a community bank guide, which outlined the relevant provisions for smaller,\nnoncomplex institutions and compared the new requirements to the previous standards.2\nIn addition, the Federal Reserve Board recently issued a final rule raising the limit\non the maximum size of banks covered by our Small Bank Holding Company Statement.3\nThis policy statement, originally issued in 1980, fosters local ownership of small\ncommunity banks. While the Board generally discourages the use of debt by bank holding\ncompanies to finance acquisitions, it recognizes that the limited access small institutions\nhave to equity funding means that such firms often must rely on acquisition debt to\naccomplish a transfer of ownership. The policy statement allows small, noncomplex bank\nholding companies to temporarily operate with higher levels of debt than would otherwise\nbe permitted. It also exempts them from the Board’s risk-based and leverage capital\nguidelines and eliminates some regulatory reporting requirements. Of course, regulatory\n2 The document New Capital Rule: Community Bank Guide, issued July 2013 by the Board of Governors\nof the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and Office of the Comptroller of\nthe Currency, is available at\nwww.federalreserve.gov/bankinforeg/basel/files/capital_rule_community_bank_guide_20130709.pdf; and\nthe table “Final Rule on Enhanced Regulatory Capital Standards--Implications for Community Banking\nOrganizations” is available at\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/commbankguide20130702.pdf.\n3 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2015), “Federal Reserve Board Issues Final Rule\nto Expand Applicability of Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement and Apply It to Certain\nSavings and Loan Holding Companies,” press release, April 9,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20150409a.htm.\n\n- 4 -\ncapital requirements will continue to apply to the depository institution subsidiaries of\nthese companies.\nThe policy statement originally applied only to qualifying holding companies with\nno more than $150 million in total consolidated assets. In 2006, the maximum asset size\nwas raised to $500 million. Significant changes in the structure of the banking industry\nsince 2006 led Board members to believe that a further increase in the limit to $1 billion in\nassets should be considered. However, because of limitations imposed by the Collins\nAmendment to the Dodd-Frank Act, the Board could not raise the limit without further\nstatutory action. We are very pleased that the Congress passed legislation in December\n2014 that enabled the Board to raise the limit. The policy statement now covers nearly 90\npercent of bank holding companies.\nThe Volcker rule and incentive compensation are two additional areas where I\nbelieve relief for smaller institutions would be helpful. The risks identified by the Dodd-\nFrank Act in these areas apply almost exclusively to larger financial institutions.\nCommunity banks rarely engage in any of the activities prohibited by the Volcker rule,\nand community banks generally do not face the adverse incentives of compensation\nagreements that may encourage executives and loan officers to maximize lending volume\nat the expense of safety and soundness. I believe community banks should not face\nsignificant burdens from complying with these requirements, so I support raising the asset\nthreshold for both the Volcker rule and incentive compensation rules, perhaps to\n$10 billion. In the event where the actions of a community bank might raise concerns in\neither of these areas, that could be addressed through our normal examination process.\n\n- 5 -\nThe Board has undertaken substantial efforts to tailor its supervisory practices to\nthe size of the bank examined. We supervise banks in four tiers, with requirements that\nare lowest for smaller, local institutions and increase with the size, complexity, and\ngeographic reach of firms. This system helps community banks by eliminating\nrequirements that are relevant only to large, geographically diversified banks. This tiered\napproach allows us to account for the differences in business models and risk levels\namong different types of banks. Our goal is not to develop one state-of-the-art approach\nto regulation and supervision, but instead multiple state-of-the-art approaches that are\nappropriate for each type of institution we oversee. Supervision of community banks is\nnot a watered-down version of supervision of larger banks, but a significantly different\nprocess tailored to the business model of smaller banks.\nFor community banks, the primary purpose of prudential regulation is to ensure the\nsafety and soundness of each individual institution, thereby protecting the deposit\ninsurance fund. The crisis showed that such a focus on individual institutions was\ninadequate to account for and contain the systemic threats posed by risks at larger, more\ncomplex institutions, and much of the improvement in oversight has been directed at\nsystemic risk. The Board is committed to making sure that new supervisory standards do\nnot trickle down to community banks when they may only be appropriate for larger\ninstitutions, whether they be systemically important institutions overseen by the Large\nInstitution Supervision Coordination Committee, other large banking organizations with\nmore than $50 billion in assets, or regional banking organizations with between\n$10 billion and $50 billion in assets.4\n4 More on the Large Institution Supervision Coordination Committee is available on the Board’s website at\nwww.federalreserve.gov/bankinforeg/large-institution-supervision.htm.\n\n- 6 -\nFor example, the Board has made it clear that capital stress tests and other aspects\nof the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review requirements do not apply to\ncommunity banks, either explicitly or implicitly. In addition to Board members making\nthis point in public speeches and in meetings with bankers, the Federal Reserve’s\nexaminer training emphasizes that these requirements, which were established under the\nDodd-Frank Act, will apply only to large banking organizations.\nThe Fed also made changes in 2014 to better tailor our program of consumer\ncompliance supervision of smaller institutions. Under the new approach, the intensity of\nbank examinations is based on our assessment of the risk profile of individual community\nbanks, including how each identifies and manages consumer compliance risk. Risk\nassessment begins before examiners arrive at the bank, allowing examiners to focus on\nhigher-risk concerns at the banks they supervise. We have also directed examiners to\nspend less time on those areas of consumer compliance where problems are uncommon,\nalthough we are ready to ramp up that scrutiny if we have concerns about practices at a\nparticular institution.\nSince making these changes 16 months ago, the average length of time for\nexaminations has dropped, and the feedback we have heard from you is mostly positive.\nBankers have told us that the examiners seem to have a better grasp of the key issues and\nthat exams are, as we intended, more closely tailored to the business characteristics and\nrisk profile of individual institutions. Examiners also tell us they sometimes see increased\nconsumer compliance risk at community banks that are expanding beyond their traditional\nproduct offerings, often using outside vendors to introduce new products such as prepaid\ncards or credit card add-ons. These products are often complex, and community banks\n\n- 7 -\nmay not always be familiar with the risks the products pose. Banks may not have\nsufficient expertise to thoroughly check out a vendor and monitor its performance.\nBeyond consumer compliance supervision, the Federal Reserve has expanded our\nability to conduct more of the work of bank examinations off site. If banks have\nelectronic loan records, it is possible for examiners to assess loan quality and underwriting\npractices remotely, spending much less time on site. This approach has the potential to\nimprove examination efficiency and to reduce the examination-related disruption to\nbanking operations. However, if banks prefer more face-to-face interaction with\nexaminers--and there are banks that do--we will continue the traditional on-site review.\nOur efforts to further tailor bank supervision at community banks continue. Staff\nmembers from the Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation are working through a major review of regulations\ncalled for in the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act (EGRPRA).\nWe are still in the midst of this effort, which is being conducted with a broad mandate to\nidentify and revise where possible outdated, unnecessary, or unduly burdensome\nregulations, including those that apply to community banks. The agencies are carefully\nconsidering public comments. Although some burden-reducing measures may require\ncongressional action, the agencies will act to implement regulatory relief when possible\nbefore the end of the EGRPRA review period. The results of our EGRPRA review will be\nincluded in the agencies’ joint report to the Congress.\nIn addition, the Federal Reserve System has expanded our economic research into\nissues of consequence to community banks and has worked to encourage similar research\nefforts at academic institutions. Several years ago, a group of economists from across the\n\n- 8 -\nSystem formed an informal working group to share ongoing research related to\ncommunity banking. Encouraging results from this internal forum led, in 2013, to an\ninaugural research and policy conference titled “Community Banking in the 21st\nCentury,” sponsored jointly by the Federal Reserve System and the Conference of State\nBank Supervisors. The conference provided a unique opportunity for researchers,\ncommunity bankers, and bank supervisors to come together to hear some of the latest\nresearch on topics related to community banking and discuss the practical implications of\nthis research. The 2013 conference was so successful that we decided to make it an\nannual event. The third annual conference will take place this coming fall at the Federal\nReserve Bank of St. Louis, and Chair Yellen is scheduled to provide opening remarks.\nI had the pleasure of participating in the first two conferences and found the\npresentations and conversations to be extremely enlightening. Many of the researchers\nwho presented at these conferences said that the feedback they received from bankers and\nbank supervisors was valuable in helping them shape their future research endeavors. The\nconference organizing committee has launched a new website with the URL\n“www.communitybanking.org,” which they hope will become a focal point for all who are\ninterested in community banking research. The website provides links to the papers and\npresentations from the previous conferences, news about future conference plans, and\nother information that might be of interest to community banking researchers.\nAlthough research is an important avenue for improving our understanding of the\ncommunity bank business model and the effects of changing market and regulatory\nconditions on the viability of that model, understanding is further enhanced through direct\n\n- 9 -\ninteractions between regulators and community bankers. For this reason, the Federal\nReserve System has taken a number of steps to expand its outreach to community banks.\nAs you probably know, in 2010 the Board created the Community Depository\nInstitutions Advisory Council, which includes representatives from community banks,\ncredit unions, and savings associations from each Federal Reserve District.5 The Board of\nGovernors meets twice each year to hear the council’s valuable insights into the most\npressing concerns of community bankers from across the country. There is also a council\nfor each of the 12 Reserve Banks, which meets regularly with its Reserve Bank leadership.\nWe have taken other steps to improve communications with community bankers so\nthat we may better explain our supervisory expectations for community banks and hear\nyour concerns as well. Our Reserve Banks have together developed a number of channels\nof communication with community banks over the years, and some of the most promising\nof those initiatives have been expanded nationwide. Two programs, Ask the Fed and\nOutlook Live, have become quite popular with community bankers who are interested in\nlearning more about timely financial or regulatory topics of interest to both bankers and\nsupervisors. Ask the Fed is a program for officials of state member banks, holding\ncompanies, and state bank commissioners. Outlook Live is a webinar series led by\nFederal Reserve staff that serves as a companion to our quarterly publication, Consumer\nCompliance Outlook.6 Last year I participated in a webinar hosted by the Federal Reserve\nBank of St. Louis and very much enjoyed hearing directly from community bankers.7\n5 More on the Community Depository Institutions Advisory Council is available on the Board’s website at\nwww.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/cdiac.htm.\n6 Current and past issues of Consumer Compliance Outlook are available at\nhttps://consumercomplianceoutlook.org.\n7 See Jerome H. Powell (2014), “Opening Remarks,” speech delivered at the Webinar on Community\nBanking, Washington, October 20, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20141020a.htm.\n\n- 10 -\nAnother effort to improve communication with community bankers is our new\nCommunity Banking Connections website and quarterly newsletter. These sources of\ninformation focus on safety-and-soundness issues that are of practical interest to\ncommunity bankers and bank board members. We have also launched a series of special-\npurpose publications called Fed Links that highlight key elements of specific supervisory\ntopics and discuss how examiners typically address the topic.8 The common goal of all of\nthese outreach efforts is building and sustaining an ongoing dialogue with community\nbankers.\nDespite the challenges that you face, I firmly believe that community banks are\nhere to stay. Banks of different sizes serve different functions, and both large and small\nbanks are needed to meet the funding needs of a healthy economy. The Federal Reserve\ndoes not use a one-size-fits-all approach to regulation and supervision and is committed to\ncontinually reevaluating and improving oversight to meet the complementary goals of\nbank soundness, financial stability, and economic growth. The risks and vulnerabilities of\ncommunity banks differ substantially from those of larger banks, and an explicit tailoring\nof regulation and supervision for community banks is appropriate.\nI look forward to our discussion.\n8 More information is available for Community Banking Connections at\nhttps://communitybankingconnections.org and for Fed Links at\nhttps://www.communitybankingconnections.org/fedlinks.",

Powell\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\n“Just Economy Conference”\nsponsored by the National Community Reinvestment Coalition\nWashington, D.C.\nMarch 11, 2019\n\nGood evening, and thank you for inviting me to speak to you today.\nThe National Community Reinvestment Coalition (NCRC) and its member\norganizations are at the forefront of an important conversation about how to ensure that\nlow- and moderate-income communities are fairly served by the banking industry. The\nwork that you do to promote access to basic banking services, affordable housing, and\nentrepreneurship opportunities supports the Federal Reserve and other agencies that\nenforce fair lending laws. The large number and variety of NCRC’s local member\norganizations allow the NCRC to draw a detailed picture of how the Federal Reserve’s\npolicies affect lower-income communities, and we deeply appreciate the information that\nyou share with us and the work that it represents.\nAs you know all too well, the current strength of the overall economy masks the\nstruggles many individuals and families face in lower-income urban and rural\ncommunities. Low- and moderate-income homeowners saw their wealth stripped away\nas home values dropped during the financial crisis and have not recovered as quickly or\ncompletely as others. Because home equity has been the main source of wealth among\nlow- and moderate-income people, the crisis dealt a particularly severe blow to these\nhouseholds. Most Americans rely on home equity to send their children to college, invest\nin their own education and training, or start or grow a business. These aspirations are the\nbasis upon which a strong economy is built. That is why your work as NCRC member\norganizations offering financial counseling, homeownership education, and technical\nassistance for small businesses is as important as ever.\n\n- 2 -\nWhen lower-income individuals and families struggle, it harms their health and\nwell-being and also weakens our economy. When people are connected to education,\ntraining, and other resources that help them secure good jobs and other opportunities,\nthey are better prepared to care for themselves and their families and contribute to a\nstrong economy.\nThe Federal Reserve has an extensive community development function, related\nto our responsibilities under the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), that promotes\npartnerships between banks and community organizations to address local community\nand economic development needs. As you know, the CRA requires federal banking\nregulators--the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation--to encourage banks to help meet the credit needs\nof the communities they are chartered to serve, including low- and moderate-income\nneighborhoods. To complement the work we do with the other regulators to write\nregulations and guidance implementing CRA, the Federal Reserve System’s community\ndevelopment staff help banks understand and meet their responsibilities under the law.\nFed staff members also act as liaisons between banks and community organizations to\nidentify local community development needs and solutions.\nI know that you all are very interested in the agencies’ activities related to\npossible revisions to the current CRA regulations. My colleague, Governor Brainard,\nwho represents the Board in our interagency CRA discussions, will be speaking to you\ntomorrow, so I will leave it to her to discuss our efforts in detail. But I do want to\nexpress my support for an interagency effort to revise the regulations to promote clarity\nand consistency in our evaluations of banks, particularly in light of the changes in the\n\n- 3 -\nway bank products and services are delivered. We value the CRA’s role in meeting the\ncredit needs of low- and moderate-income neighborhoods and want to be very careful\nthat any revisions serve to strengthen the CRA’s purpose.\nI commend your dedication to ensuring that all Americans have fair access to the\neconomic opportunities that our nation offers. I hope you have a productive conference,\nand I look forward to our ongoing conversation about how the Federal Reserve can help.",

Powell\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nSecond Thomas Laubach Research Conference, hosted by\nthe Federal Reserve Board\nWashington, D.C.\nMay 15, 2025\n\nGood morning. I am pleased to welcome everyone here today. Thomas\nLaubach’s research and support of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) helped\nus better understand monetary policy, and it is fitting that this work will continue today in\nhis name. Thank you to the authors of the papers, to the discussants, and to our panel\nparticipants. Thank you also to Trevor and his team for organizing this conference; a lot\nof work went into bringing us together.\nAs in our last review, the 2025 review consists of three key elements: this\nconference, Fed Listens events at Reserve Banks around the country, and policymaker\ndiscussions and deliberations, supported by staff analysis, at a series of FOMC meetings.\nIn the current review we will reconsider aspects of our strategic framework in light of the\nexperience of the last five years. We will also consider possible enhancements to the\nCommittee’s policy communication tools, regarding forecasts, uncertainty, and risks.\nThe Consensus Statement\nIn 2012, the FOMC first codified our monetary policy framework in a document\nentitled the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, which we\nrefer to as the consensus statement.1 The language in the opening paragraph, which has\nnever changed, articulates our commitment to fulfilling our congressional mandate and to\nexplaining clearly what we are doing and why (figure 1).2 That clarity reduces\n1 The full history of consensus statements is available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/historical-statements-on-longer-run-goals-and-monetary-\npolicy-strategy-2019-2020.htm.\n2 The first paragraph of the current consensus statement was the second paragraph of the initial statement in\n2012. That initial consensus statement began with the following language: “Following careful\ndeliberations at its recent meetings, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has reached broad\nagreement on the following principles regarding its longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy. The\nCommittee intends to reaffirm these principles and to make adjustments as appropriate at its annual\norganizational meeting each January.” In 2013, the first sentence of that preamble was deleted, and the\nsecond was moved to the end of the statement.\n\n- 2 -\nuncertainty, improves the effectiveness of our policy, and enhances transparency and\naccountability.\nAs Chair, Ben Bernanke led the Committee through the creation of that initial\nconsensus statement, adopting a 2 percent inflation target, and outlining our approach to\nachieving our congressionally assigned dual mandate. The framework laid out in that\ndocument broadly aligned with best practices for a flexible inflation-targeting central\nbank.\nThe structure of the economy evolves over time, and monetary policymakers’\nstrategies, tools, and communications need to evolve with it. The challenges presented\nby the Great Depression differ from those of the Great Inflation and the Great\nModeration, which in turn differ from the ones we face today.3 A framework should be\nrobust to a broad range of conditions, but also needs to be updated periodically as the\neconomy and our understanding of it evolve.\n2019–20 Review\nFrom 2012 to 2018, the FOMC voted at each January meeting to reaffirm the\nconsensus statement, in most years without substantive changes.4 In 2019, we changed\nthat practice, conducting our first-ever public review, and said that we would repeat such\nreviews at roughly five-year intervals. There is nothing magic about a five-year pace.\nWe believe that frequency is appropriate to reassess structural features of the economy\nand to engage with the public, practitioners, and academics on the performance of our\n3 See Jerome H. Powell (2019), “Challenges for Monetary Policy,” speech delivered at “Challenges for\nMonetary Policy,” a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, held in Jackson\nHole, Wyo., August 23, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190823a.htm.\n4 An exception was in January 2016, when the statement was amended to highlight the symmetric nature of\nthe Committee’s 2 percent longer-run objective by noting, among other small changes, that “the Committee\nwould be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or below this objective” (paragraph 3).\n\n- 3 -\nframework. Several of our global peers have adopted similar approaches to their\nframework reviews.\nAt the time of the last review, we had been living for about a decade in a new\nnormal characterized by proximity to the effective lower bound, with low interest rates,\nlow growth, low inflation, and a very flat Phillips curve. If I could capture that era with\none statistic, it would be that the policy rate had been stuck at the lower bound for seven\nlong years following the onset of the Global Financial Crisis in late 2008 (figure 2).\nAfter liftoff in December 2015, we were able to raise the policy rate only very gradually\nover a period of three years to a peak of just 2.4 percent. Seven months later, we began\nreducing it, leaving the rate at 1.6 percent in late 2019, where it would be when the\npandemic arrived a few months later. Policy rates in other major advanced economies\nwere even lower, in many cases below zero, and in all such economies, inflation regularly\nran below its target.\nThe sense at that time was that when the economy next experienced even a mild\ndownturn, we would be right back at the lower bound, probably for another extended\nperiod. The post–financial crisis decade had demonstrated the pain that could bring.\nInflation would likely decline in a weak economy, raising real interest rates as nominal\nrates are pinned at zero. Higher real rates would further weigh on job growth and\nreinforce the downward pressure on inflation and inflation expectations.\nReflecting these concerns, we adopted a policy to make up for persistent shortfalls\nfrom the inflation target, an approach that was common in the extensive literature on the\nrisks associated with the lower bound.5 Given the downside risks to employment and\n5 For further details on contemporaneous views at the time of the 2020 review, see Jerome H. Powell\n(2019), “Opening Remarks,” speech delivered at the “Conference on Monetary Policy Strategy, Tools, and\n\n- 4 -\ninflation from proximity to the lower bound and the need to anchor longer-term inflation\nexpectations at 2 percent, we said that following periods in which inflation has been\nrunning persistently below 2 percent, we would likely aim to achieve inflation\nmoderately above 2 percent for some time.\nWe also concluded that policy decisions would be informed by assessments of\n“shortfalls” rather than “deviations” from maximum employment. The change to\nshortfalls was not a commitment to permanently forswear preemption or to ignore labor\nmarket tightness.6 Rather, it signaled that apparent labor market tightness would not, in\nisolation, be enough to trigger a policy response, unless the Committee believed that, if\nleft unchecked, it would lead to unwelcome inflationary pressure.\nThis change reflected our experience with long expansions that featured\nhistorically low unemployment amid low and stable inflation, suggesting that a policy\napproach that carefully probed for the maximum level of employment could bring about\nthe benefits of a strong labor market without risking price stability. In the years just prior\nto the pandemic, for example, unemployment was at multidecade lows while inflation ran\nbelow 2 percent. By December 2019, estimates of the longer-run unemployment rate had\nCommunications Practices,” sponsored by the Federal Reserve, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago,\nChicago, June 4, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190604a.htm.

There was nothing intentional or\nmoderate about the inflation that arrived a few months after we announced our changes to\nthe consensus statement. I acknowledged as much publicly in 2021.9 We fell back on the\nrest of the framework, which called for traditional inflation targeting.\nThrough the end of 2021, FOMC participants continued to forecast that inflation\nwas likely to subside fairly quickly in 2022, with only a moderate increase in our policy\nrate. That projection was consistent with other central banks with different frameworks\nand the vast majority of forecasters (figure 4).10 When the evidence showed otherwise,\nwe hiked 525 basis points over a period of 16 months. The most recent data suggest that\n7 In the January 2012 Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), the range of estimates for the longer-run\nunemployment rate was 5 percent to 6 percent, and the median was 5.5 percent; by December 2019, that\nrange was 3.5 percent to 4.5 percent, and the median had declined to 4.1 percent.\n8 See Caldara and others, “Monetary Policy and Economic Performance” (in note 5), which discusses the\nstructural factors behind the slow evolution of changes in the natural rate of unemployment, trend\nproductivity growth, the natural rate of interest, and the slope of the Phillips curve.\n9 See, for example, Jerome H. Powell (2021), “Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference,”\nDecember 15, https://www.federalreserve.gov/mediacenter/files/FOMCpresconf20211215.pdf#page=16.\n10 In December 2021, the median SEP projection anticipated core inflation declining from 4.4 percent in\n2021 to 2.7 percent in 2022, while the federal funds rate projection for the end of 2022 was 0.9 percent,\nbelow its longer-run estimate of 2.5 percent. Similarly, the December 2021 Survey of Primary Dealers as\nwell as the December 2021 Blue Chip consensus anticipated core inflation in 2022 of 2.5 percent and\n2.6 percent, respectively, alongside average projections of short-term interest rates that remained below\n1 percent throughout 2022.\n\n- 6 -\n12-month PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation was 2.2 percent in April,\nfar below its 7.2 percent peak in 2022.11 In a welcome and historically unusual result,\nthis disinflation has come without the sharp increase in unemployment that has often\naccompanied a campaign of rate hikes to reduce inflation.\nThe economic environment has changed significantly since 2020, and our review\nwill reflect our assessment of those changes. Longer-term interest rates are a good deal\nhigher now, driven largely by real rates given the stability of longer-term inflation\nexpectations. Many estimates of the longer-run level of the policy rate have risen,\nincluding those in the Summary of Economic Projections (figure 5).12\nHigher real rates may also reflect the possibility that inflation could be more\nvolatile going forward than in the inter-crisis period of the 2010s. We may be entering a\nperiod of more frequent, and potentially more persistent, supply shocks—a difficult\nchallenge for the economy and for central banks.13\nWhile our policy rate is currently well above the lower bound, in recent decades\nwe have cut the rate by about 500 basis points when the economy is in recession.14\n11 The 12-month total PCE inflation estimate for April is based on information from the April 2025\nconsumer price index release.\n12 For example, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s March 2025 Survey of Market Expectations had a\nmedian estimate of the longer-run federal funds rate of 3.13 percent, up from 2.5 percent in the equivalent\nprimary dealer survey of December 2019. The median projection of the longer-run level of the federal\nfunds rate was 3.0 percent in the March 2025 SEP, up from 2.5 percent in the December 2019 SEP.\n13 See, for example, Agustín Carstens (2022), “Luncheon Address: A Story of Tailwinds and Headwinds:\nAggregate Supply and Macroeconomic Stabilization,” paper presented at “Reassessing Constraints on the\nEconomy and Policy,” a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, held in\nJackson Hole, Wyo., August 26,\nhttps://www.kansascityfed.org/Jackson%20Hole/documents/9668/JH2022_Carstens.pdf.\n14 See, for example, David Reifschneider (2016), “Gauging the Ability of the FOMC to Respond to Future\nRecessions,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2016-068 (Washington: Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System, August), http://dx.doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2016.068; and Michael Kiley (2020),\n“Monetary Policy Space in a Recession: Some Simple Interest Rate Arithmetic,” FEDS Notes\n(Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, January 8),\nhttps://doi.org/10.17016/2380-7172.2484.\n\n- 7 -\nAlthough getting stuck at the lower bound is no longer the base case, it is only prudent\nthat the framework continue to address that risk.\nWhile the framework must evolve, some elements of it are timeless.\nPolicymakers emerged from the Great Inflation with a clear understanding that it was\nessential to anchor inflation expectations at an appropriately low level. During the Great\nModeration, well-anchored inflation expectations allowed us to provide policy support to\nemployment without risking destabilizing inflation.15 Since the Great Inflation, the U.S.\neconomy has had three of its four longest expansions on record.16 Anchored expectations\nplayed a key role in facilitating these expansions. More recently, without that anchor, it\nwould not have been possible to achieve a roughly 5 percentage point disinflation without\na spike in unemployment.\nKeeping longer-run inflation expectations anchored was a driving force behind\nestablishing the 2 percent target in the 2012 framework. Maintaining that anchor was a\nmajor consideration behind the changes in 2020. Anchored expectations are critical to\neverything we do, and we remain fully committed to the 2 percent target today.\n2025 Review\nIn the current review, the Committee is engaged in discussions about what we\nhave learned from the experience of the past five years. We plan to complete\nconsideration of specific changes to the consensus statement in coming months. We are\n15 In a 2004 speech, Bernanke highlighted the role of monetary policy in the Great Moderation (see Ben S.\nBernanke (2004), “The Great Moderation,” speech delivered at the meetings of the Eastern Economic\nAssociation, Washington, February 20,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2004/20040220).\n16 The National Bureau of Economic Research’s business cycle dating indicates that the four longest\nexpansions since 1854 were those that ended in February 2020 (128 months), March 2001 (120 months),\nDecember 1969 (106 months), and July 1990 (92 months). See National Bureau of Economic Research\n(2023), “US Business Cycle Expansions and Contractions,” webpage,\nhttps://www.nber.org/research/data/us-business-cycle-expansions-and-contractions.\n\n- 8 -\npaying particular attention to the 2020 changes as we consider discrete but important\nupdates reflecting what we have learned about the economy, and the way those changes\nwere interpreted by the public. In our discussions so far, participants have indicated that\nthey thought it would be appropriate to reconsider the language around shortfalls. And at\nour meeting last week, we had a similar take on average inflation targeting. We will\nensure that our new consensus statement is robust to a wide range of economic\nenvironments and developments.\nIn addition to revising the consensus statement, we will also consider potential\nenhancements to our formal policy communications, particularly regarding the role of\nforecasts and uncertainty. As we have been reviewing assessments of the 2020\nframework and of policy decisions in recent years, a common observation is the need for\nclear communications as complex events unfold. While academics and market\nparticipants generally have viewed the FOMC’s communications as effective, there is\nalways room for improvement.17 Indeed, clear communication is an issue even in\nrelatively placid times. A critical question is how to foster a broader understanding of the\nuncertainty that the economy generally faces. In periods with larger, more frequent, or\nmore disparate shocks, effective communication requires that we convey the uncertainty\nthat surrounds our understanding of the economy and the outlook. We will examine\nways to improve along that dimension as we move forward.\n17 See, for example, the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy survey of private-sector and\nacademic economists that reviews Federal Reserve communications. The survey has been conducted every\nfour years since 2016, and the most recent survey results can be found on the Brookings Institution’s\nwebsite at https://www.brookings.edu/articles/grading-fed-communications-a-2024-survey-of-fed-\nwatchers.\n\n- 9 -\nLet me end by saying thank you again for being here. We have been looking\nforward to the conversations that will occur over the next two days. These discussions\nwill help broaden and deepen our thinking about these issues, and they are critical to the\nsuccess of these reviews.\n\nSecond Thomas Laubach Research Conference\nFederal Reserve Board, Washington, D.C.\nMay 15, 2025\nOpening Remarks\nJerome H.

Powell\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nHutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy\nBrookings Institution\nWashington, D.C.\nNovember 30, 2022\n\nToday I will offer a progress report on the Federal Open Market Committee’s\n(FOMC) efforts to restore price stability to the U.S. economy for the benefit of the\nAmerican people. The report must begin by acknowledging the reality that inflation\nremains far too high. My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation is\nimposing significant hardship, straining budgets and shrinking what paychecks will buy.\nThis is especially painful for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like\nfood, housing, and transportation. Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal\nReserve and serves as the bedrock of our economy. Without price stability, the economy\ndoes not work for anyone. In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a\nsustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.\nWe currently estimate that 12-month personal consumption expenditures (PCE)\ninflation through October ran at 6.0 percent (figure 1).1 While October inflation data\nreceived so far showed a welcome surprise to the downside, these are a single month’s\ndata, which followed upside surprises over the previous two months. As figure 1 makes\nclear, down months in the data have often been followed by renewed increases. It will\ntake substantially more evidence to give comfort that inflation is actually declining. By\nany standard, inflation remains much too high.\nFor purposes of this discussion, I will focus my comments on core PCE inflation,\nwhich omits the food and energy inflation components, which have been lower recently\nbut are quite volatile. Our inflation goal is for total inflation, of course, as food and\nenergy prices matter a great deal for household budgets. But core inflation often gives a\nmore accurate indicator of where overall inflation is headed. Twelve-month core PCE\n1 Throughout this discussion, PCE data for October are estimates based on the October consumer price\nindex and producer price index data.\n\n- 2 -\ninflation stands at 5.0 percent in our October estimate, approximately where it stood last\nDecember when policy tightening was in its early stages. Over 2022, core inflation rose\na few tenths above 5 percent and fell a few tenths below, but it mainly moved sideways.\nSo when will inflation come down?\nI could answer this question by pointing to the inflation forecasts of private-sector\nforecasters or of FOMC participants, which broadly show a significant decline over the\nnext year. But forecasts have been predicting just such a decline for more than a year,\nwhile inflation has moved stubbornly sideways. The truth is that the path ahead for\ninflation remains highly uncertain. For now, let’s put aside the forecasts and look instead\nto the macroeconomic conditions we think we need to see to bring inflation down to 2\npercent over time.\nFor starters, we need to raise interest rates to a level that is sufficiently restrictive\nto return inflation to 2 percent. There is considerable uncertainty about what rate will be\nsufficient, although there is no doubt that we have made substantial progress, raising our\ntarget range for the federal funds rate by 3.75 percentage points since March. As our last\npostmeeting statement indicates, we anticipate that ongoing increases will be appropriate.\nIt seems to me likely that the ultimate level of rates will need to be somewhat higher than\nthought at the time of the September meeting and Summary of Economic Projections. I\nwill return to policy at the end of my comments, but for now, I will simply say that we\nhave more ground to cover.\nWe are tightening the stance of policy in order to slow growth in aggregate\ndemand. Slowing demand growth should allow supply to catch up with demand and\n\n- 3 -\nrestore the balance that will yield stable prices over time. Restoring that balance is likely\nto require a sustained period of below-trend growth.\nLast year, the ongoing reopening of the economy boosted real gross domestic\nproduct (GDP) growth to a very strong 5.7 percent. This year, GDP was roughly flat\nthrough the first three quarters, and indicators point to modest growth this quarter, which\nseems likely to bring the year in with very modest growth overall. Several factors\ncontributed to this slowing growth, including the waning effects of reopening and of\npandemic fiscal support, the global implications of Russia’s war against Ukraine, and our\npolicy actions, which tightened financial conditions and are affecting economic activity,\nparticularly in interest-sensitive sectors such as housing. We can say that demand growth\nhas slowed, and we expect that this growth will need to remain at a slower pace for a\nsustained period.\nDespite the tighter policy and slower growth over the past year, we have not seen\nclear progress on slowing inflation. To assess what it will take to get inflation down, it is\nuseful to break core inflation into three component categories: core goods inflation,\nhousing services inflation, and inflation in core services other than housing (figure 2).\nCore goods inflation has moved down from very high levels over the course of\n2022, while housing services inflation has risen rapidly. Inflation in core services ex\nhousing has fluctuated but shown no clear trend. I will discuss each of these items in\nturn.\nEarly in the pandemic, goods prices began rising rapidly, as abnormally strong\ndemand was met by pandemic-hampered supply. Reports from businesses and many\nindicators suggest that supply chain issues are now easing. Both fuel and nonfuel import\n\n- 4 -\nprices have fallen in recent months, and indicators of prices paid by manufacturers have\nmoved down. While 12-month core goods inflation remains elevated at 4.6 percent, it\nhas fallen nearly 3 percentage points from earlier in the year. It is far too early to declare\ngoods inflation vanquished, but if current trends continue, goods prices should begin to\nexert downward pressure on overall inflation in coming months.\nHousing services inflation measures the rise in the price of all rents and the rise in\nthe rental-equivalent cost of owner-occupied housing. Unlike goods inflation, housing\nservices inflation has continued to rise and now stands at 7.1 percent over the past\n12 months. Housing inflation tends to lag other prices around inflation turning points,\nhowever, because of the slow rate at which the stock of rental leases turns over.2 The\nmarket rate on new leases is a timelier indicator of where overall housing inflation will\ngo over the next year or so. Measures of 12-month inflation in new leases rose to nearly\n20 percent during the pandemic but have been falling sharply since about midyear\n(figure 3).\nAs figure 3 shows, however, overall housing services inflation has continued to\nrise as existing leases turn over and jump in price to catch up with the higher level of\nrents for new leases. This is likely to continue well into next year. But as long as new\nlease inflation keeps falling, we would expect housing services inflation to begin falling\nsometime next year. Indeed, a decline in this inflation underlies most forecasts of\ndeclining inflation.\nFinally, we come to core services other than housing. This spending category\ncovers a wide range of services from health care and education to haircuts and\n2 Rental lease data are also the main input into the measurement of owner-occupied housing prices.\n\n- 5 -\nhospitality. This is the largest of our three categories, constituting more than half of the\ncore PCE index. Thus, this may be the most important category for understanding the\nfuture evolution of core inflation. Because wages make up the largest cost in delivering\nthese services, the labor market holds the key to understanding inflation in this category.\nIn the labor market, demand for workers far exceeds the supply of available\nworkers, and nominal wages have been growing at a pace well above what would be\nconsistent with 2 percent inflation over time.3 Thus, another condition we are looking for\nis the restoration of balance between supply and demand in the labor market.\nSigns of elevated labor market tightness emerged suddenly in mid-2021. The\nunemployment rate at the time was much higher than the 3.5 percent that had prevailed\nwithout major signs of tightness before the pandemic. Employment was still millions\nbelow its level on the eve of the pandemic. Looking back, we can see that a significant\nand persistent labor supply shortfall opened up during the pandemic—a shortfall that\nappears unlikely to fully close anytime soon.\nComparing the current labor force with the Congressional Budget Office’s pre-\npandemic forecast of labor force growth reveals a current labor force shortfall of roughly\n3-1/2 million people (figure 4, left panel).4 This shortfall reflects both lower-than-\nexpected population growth and a lower labor force participation rate (figure 4, right\npanel). Participation dropped sharply at the onset of the pandemic because of many\nfactors, including sickness, caregiving, and fear of infection. Many forecasters expected\n3 The pace of wage inflation affects all sectors of the economy, but wages are a particularly large share of\ncosts in core services ex housing and, thus, particularly important for inflation in this category.\n4 See Congressional Budget Office (2020). To account for the effect of population controls on the level of\nthe labor force, the shortfall is calculated by appending the Congressional Budget Office’s January 2020\nprojected labor force growth over the years 2020–22 onto the level of the labor force in 2019:Q4 that is\nadjusted for population controls.\n\n- 6 -\nthat participation would move back up fairly quickly as the pandemic faded. And for\nworkers in their prime working years, it mostly has. Overall participation, however,\nremains well below pre-pandemic trends.\nSome of the participation gap reflects workers who are still out of the labor force\nbecause they are sick with COVID-19 or continue to suffer lingering symptoms from\nprevious COVID infections (“long COVID”).5 But recent research by Fed economists\nfinds that the participation gap is now mostly due to excess retirements—that is,\nretirements in excess of what would have been expected from population aging alone.6\nThese excess retirements might now account for more than 2 million of the 3-1/2 million\nshortfall in the labor force.7\nWhat explains these excess retirements? Health issues have surely played a role,\nas COVID has posed a particularly large threat to the lives and health of the elderly.8 In\naddition, many older workers lost their jobs in the early stages of the pandemic, when\nlayoffs were historically high. The cost of finding new employment may have appeared\nparticularly large for these workers, given pandemic-related disruptions to the work\nenvironment and health concerns.9 Also, gains in the stock market and rising house\n5 Recent research suggests that long COVID may be keeping 280,000 to 680,000 individuals aged 16 to 64\nout of the labor force (Sheiner and Salwati, 2022), and long COVID may explain why the percentage of\nthose aged 18 to 64 not in the labor force due to a disability has stalled over the past two years rather than\ncontinuing its pre-pandemic decline (see also Price, 2022).\n6 See Montes, Smith, and Dajon (2022).\n7 This analysis adjusts for population controls to the Current Population Survey. This adjustment is\nimportant, because while the unadjusted data show a marked decline in the retired share in January 2022,\nthis drop is entirely an artifact of new population controls introduced in January. A proper assessment of\nthe effects of retirements since the start of the pandemic needs to adjust the historical data for the effects of\nthese population controls. See Montes, Smith, and Dajon (2022).\n8 For example, see Goda and Soltas (2022).\n9 Displaced workers aged 65 and over had markedly lower reemployment rates and markedly higher rates\nof labor force exit than did similarly aged displaced workers in the years just before the pandemic. See\nBureau of Labor Statistics (2022).\n\n- 7 -\nprices in the first two years of the pandemic contributed to an increase in wealth that\nlikely facilitated early retirement for some people.\nThe data so far do not suggest that excess retirements are likely to unwind\nbecause of retirees returning to the labor force. Older workers are still retiring at higher\nrates, and retirees do not appear to be returning to the labor force in sufficient numbers to\nmeaningfully reduce the total number of excess retirees.10\nThe second factor contributing to the labor supply shortfall is slower growth in\nthe working-age population. The combination of a plunge in net immigration and a surge\nin deaths during the pandemic probably accounts for about 1-1/2 million missing\nworkers.11\nPolicies to support labor supply are not the domain of the Fed: Our tools work\nprincipally on demand. Without advocating any particular policy, however, I will say\nthat policies to support labor force participation could, over time, bring benefits to the\n10 Among those 55 and over, transitions into retirement are currently well above the average rate in the\nthree years before the pandemic (after adjusting for population controls). At the same time, retirees are\nreturning to the labor force at a rate similar to that before the pandemic.\n11 First, due primarily to COVID, mortality over the past few years has far exceeded what had been\nexpected before the pandemic. This channel accounts for about 400,000 of the labor force shortfall. Total\ndeaths due to COVID are much larger—about 1 million people. However, the effect on the labor force is\nsmaller than this because COVID deaths have mostly been among older people, who participate in the labor\nforce at lower rates than younger people.\nSecond, due, at least in part, to pandemic-related restrictions on entry into the United States, total\nimmigration has slowed substantially since the start of the pandemic, lowering the labor force by about\n1 million people relative to pre-pandemic trends. While lawful, nonpermanent immigration (for example,\nH-1B and H-2B visa holders) has bounced back considerably since earlier in the pandemic, these categories\nof immigration are generally still below 2019 levels. Meanwhile, lawful permanent immigration (that is,\nnew green card holders) is also somewhat lower than in 2019 and well below levels that prevailed earlier in\nthe 2010s. Regarding undocumented immigration, while migrant encounters at the U.S.–Mexico border\nhave been high lately, some estimates suggest the number of undocumented immigrants in the United\nStates is not much different than in 2019. (For data on legal immigration, see U.S. Department of\nHomeland Security, 2022; for data on border encounters, see U.S. Customs and Border Protection, 2022;\nfor estimates of the number of undocumented immigrants, see Camarota and Zeigler, 2022.)\ni.

Such policies\nwould take time to implement and have their effects, however. For the near term, a\nmoderation of labor demand growth will be required to restore balance to the labor\nmarket.\nCurrently, the unemployment rate is at 3.7 percent, near 50-year lows, and job\nopenings exceed available workers by about 4 million—that is about 1.7 job openings for\nevery person looking for work (figure 5). So far, we have seen only tentative signs of\nmoderation of labor demand. With slower GDP growth this year, job gains have stepped\ndown from more than 450,000 per month over the first seven months of the year to about\n290,000 per month over the past three months. But this job growth remains far in excess\nof the pace needed to accommodate population growth over time—about 100,000 per\nmonth by many estimates. Job openings have fallen by about 1.5 million this year but\nremain higher than at any time before the pandemic.\nWage growth, too, shows only tentative signs of returning to balance. Some\nmeasures of wage growth have ticked down recently (figure 6). But the declines are very\nmodest so far relative to earlier increases and still leave wage growth well above levels\nconsistent with 2 percent inflation over time. To be clear, strong wage growth is a good\nthing. But for wage growth to be sustainable, it needs to be consistent with 2 percent\ninflation.\nLet’s sum up this review of economic conditions that we think we need to see to\nbring inflation down to 2 percent. Growth in economic activity has slowed to well below\nits longer-run trend, and this needs to be sustained. Bottlenecks in goods production are\neasing and goods price inflation appears to be easing as well, and this, too, must continue.\n\n- 9 -\nHousing services inflation will probably keep rising well into next year, but if inflation\non new leases continues to fall, we will likely see housing services inflation begin to fall\nlater next year. Finally, the labor market, which is especially important for inflation in\ncore services ex housing, shows only tentative signs of rebalancing, and wage growth\nremains well above levels that would be consistent with 2 percent inflation over time.\nDespite some promising developments, we have a long way to go in restoring price\nstability.\nReturning to monetary policy, my FOMC colleagues and I are strongly committed\nto restoring price stability. After our November meeting, we noted that we anticipated\nthat ongoing rate increases will be appropriate in order to attain a policy stance that is\nsufficiently restrictive to move inflation down to 2 percent over time.\nMonetary policy affects the economy and inflation with uncertain lags, and the\nfull effects of our rapid tightening so far are yet to be felt. Thus, it makes sense to\nmoderate the pace of our rate increases as we approach the level of restraint that will be\nsufficient to bring inflation down. The time for moderating the pace of rate increases\nmay come as soon as the December meeting. Given our progress in tightening policy, the\ntiming of that moderation is far less significant than the questions of how much further\nwe will need to raise rates to control inflation, and the length of time it will be necessary\nto hold policy at a restrictive level. It is likely that restoring price stability will require\nholding policy at a restrictive level for some time. History cautions strongly against\nprematurely loosening policy. We will stay the course until the job is done.\n\n- 10 -\nReferences\nBureau of Labor Statistics (2022). “Worker Displacement: 2019–2021,” press release,\nAugust 26, https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/disp.pdf.\nCamarota, Steven A., and Karen Zeigler (2022).

Powell\nChairman\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Challenges for Monetary Policy and the GFSN in an Evolving Global Economy”\nEighth High-Level Conference on the International Monetary System\nsponsored by the International Monetary Fund and Swiss National Bank\nZurich, Switzerland\nMay 8, 2018\n\nThank you for inviting me to join you today as part of this distinguished panel.\nOur subject is the relationship between “center country” monetary policy and\nglobal financial conditions, and the policy implications of that relationship both for the\ncenter country and for other countries affected. This broad topic has been the subject of a\ngreat deal of research and discussion in recent years. Today I will focus in particular on\nthe role of U.S. monetary policy in driving global financial conditions and capital flows.\nTo preview my conclusions, I will argue that, while global factors play an important role\nin influencing domestic financial conditions, the role of U.S. monetary policy is often\nexaggerated. And while financial globalization does pose some challenges for monetary\npolicy, efforts to build stronger and more transparent policy frameworks and a more\nresilient financial system can reduce the adverse consequences of external shocks.\nThe well-known Mundell-Fleming “trilemma” states that it is not possible to have\nall three of the following things: free capital mobility, a fixed exchange rate, and the\nability to pursue an independent monetary policy. The trilemma does not say that a\nflexible exchange rate will always fully insulate domestic economic conditions from\nexternal shocks.1 And, indeed, that is not the case. We have seen that integration of\nglobal capital markets can make for difficult tradeoffs for some economies, whether they\nhave fixed or floating exchange rate regimes.\nSince the Fed is the central bank of the world’s largest economy and issuer of the\nworld’s most widely used reserve currency, it is to be expected that the Fed’s policy\nactions will spill over to other economies. To illustrate this point, the scatterplot on the\nleft side of figure 1 focuses on movements in interest rates and exchange rates following\n1 See, for example, Klein and Shambaugh (2013) and Obstfeld (2015).\n\n- 2 -\nFederal Reserve policy announcements. As you can see, changes in U.S. interest rates\nafter Fed policy actions (shown on the horizontal axis) lead to corresponding changes in\nthe value of the dollar (shown on the vertical axis). And because of the dollar’s\nwidespread use around the world, these changes in the dollar affect financial conditions\nabroad. Fed policy-related movements in U.S. bond yields also tend to spill over to bond\nyields abroad, such as the German yields shown in the scatterplot on the right. Such\nspillovers are to be expected in a world of highly integrated financial markets.2 As figure\n2 shows, bond yields (left) and equity prices (right) around the world typically move\ntogether fairly closely.\nBut the influence of U.S. monetary policy on global financial conditions should\nnot be overstated. The Federal Reserve is not the only central bank whose actions affect\nglobal financial markets. In fact, the United States is the recipient as well as the\noriginator of monetary policy spillovers. For example, as seen in figure 3, changes in\nGerman yields after European Central Bank policy decisions also pass through to U.S.\nyields.3 More broadly, it is notable that although the Fed has raised its target interest rate\nsix times since December 2015 and has begun to shrink its balance sheet, overall U.S.\ndomestic financial conditions have gotten looser, in part due to improving global\nconditions and central bank policy abroad.\nMuch of the discussion of the spillovers of U.S. monetary policy focuses on their\neffects on financial conditions in emerging market economies (EMEs). Some observers\n2 See, for example, Adrian and others (2017) and the IMF’s most recent Global Financial Stability Report\n(2018) for discussion of the transmission of global risk shocks to domestic macroeconomic conditions.\n3 Curcuru, De Pooter, and Eckerd (2018) find that about half of the movement in German bund yields in a\nwindow following ECB monetary policy announcements spills over to U.S. Treasury yields, roughly the\nsame magnitude as the spillover of movements in U.S Treasury yields to German bund yields following\nFederal Reserve policy announcements.\n\n- 3 -\nhave attributed the movements in international capital flowing to EMEs since the Global\nFinancial Crisis primarily to monetary stimulus by the Fed and other advanced-economy\ncentral banks.4 The data do not seem to me to fit this narrative particularly well. As\nillustrated by the blue dashed line in the left panel of figure 4, capital flows to EMEs\nwere already very strong before the Global Financial Crisis, when the federal funds rate\nwas comparatively high. The subsequent surge in capital flows in 2009, as the crisis was\nabating, largely reflects a rebound from the capital flow interruption during the crisis\nitself, though highly accommodative monetary policies in advanced economies doubtless\nalso played a role. Moreover, capital flows to EMEs started to ease after 2011, a period\nwhen the Federal Reserve continued to add accommodation and reduce yields through\nincreases in its balance sheet, as shown in the right panel. And, more recently, capital\nflows to EMEs have picked up again despite the fact that the Fed has been removing\naccommodation since 2015.\nIf U.S. monetary policy is not the major determinant, what other factors have been\ndriving EME capital flows? One prominent factor has been growth differentials between\nEMEs and advanced economies. In figure 5, the left panel shows that capital inflows to\nEMEs picked up post-crisis, in line with the widening of this growth differential, while\nthe slowdown in inflows after 2011 coincides with its narrowing. Another related\ndeterminant has been commodity prices, as shown in the right panel. The pickup in both\nglobal growth and commodity prices over the past couple of years explains a good part of\nthe recent recovery of capital flows to EMEs.5\n4 See, for example, Wheatley and Garnham (2010) and Rajan (2014).\n5 Studies looking at the determinants of EME capital flows include Chari and others (2017), Clark and\nothers (2016), Bems and others (2016), Koepke (2015), Ahmed and Zlate (2014), Fratzscher (2012), and\n\n- 4 -\nMonetary stimulus by the Fed and other advanced-economy central banks played\na relatively limited role in the surge of capital flows to EMEs in recent years. There is\ngood reason to think that the normalization of monetary policies in advanced economies\nshould continue to prove manageable for EMEs. Fed policy normalization has proceeded\nwithout disruption to financial markets, and market participants’ expectations for policy\n(the red symbols in figure 6) seem reasonably well aligned with policymakers’\nexpectations in the Summary of Economic Projections (the black dots), suggesting that\nmarkets should not be surprised by our actions if the economy evolves in line with\nexpectations.\nIt also bears emphasizing that the EMEs themselves have made considerable\nprogress in reducing vulnerabilities since the crisis-prone 1980s and 1990s. Many EMEs\nhave substantially improved their fiscal and monetary policy frameworks while adopting\nmore flexible exchange rates, a policy that recent research shows provides better\ninsulation from external financial shocks.6 Corporate debt at risk--the debt of firms with\nlimited debt service capacity--has been rising in EMEs, as shown in figure 7.7 But this\nrise has been relatively limited outside of China and has begun to reverse as stronger\nglobal growth has pushed up earnings.\nGhosh and others (2012). These papers generally conclude that many factors, including both “pull” and\n“push,” affect EME capital flows.\n6 See, for example, Obstfeld, Ostry, and Qureshi (2017). The results in IMF (2017) also indicate that while\nglobal financial conditions explain a significant portion of countries’ domestic financial conditions,\ndomestic monetary policy changes also play an important role in economies with flexible exchange rates.\n7 The interest coverage ratio (ICR) is the ratio of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and\namortization to interest expense. A value of 2 or less is typically associated with an increased likelihood of\ndistress. For example, just before the Asian financial crisis, firms in Korea, Thailand, and Indonesia had an\naverage ICR of 2; see Pomerleano (1998).\nFor more on evolution of EME debt at risk and vulnerabilities, see Powell (2017).\n\n- 5 -\nAll that said, I do not dismiss the prospective risks emanating from global policy\nnormalization. Some investors and institutions may not be well positioned for a rise in\ninterest rates, even one that markets broadly anticipate. And, of course, future economic\nconditions may surprise us, as they often do.\nMoreover, the linkages among monetary policy, asset prices, and the mood of\nglobal financial markets are not fully understood. Some observers have argued that U.S.\nmonetary policy also influences capital flows through its effects on global risk sentiment,\nwith looser policy leading to more positive sentiment in markets and tighter policy\ndepressing sentiment.8 While those channels may well operate, research at both the Fed\nand the IMF suggests that actions by major central banks account for only a relatively\nsmall fraction of global financial volatility and capital flow movements.9\nNevertheless, risk sentiment will bear close watching as normalization proceeds\naround the world. What can the Federal Reserve do to foster continued financial stability\nand economic growth as normalization proceeds? We will communicate our policy\nstrategy as clearly and transparently as possible to help align expectations and avoid\nmarket disruptions. And we will continue to help build resilience in the financial system\nand support global efforts to do the same.\n8 Rey (2015); Miranda-Agrippino and Rey (2015).\n9 For example, Londono and Wilson (2018) find that U.S. monetary policy variables account for only\nroughly 10 percent of the six-month ahead forecast error variance of the VIX. In fact, in their study, non-\nU.S. global factors (non-U.S industrial production, a global Economic Policy Uncertainty Index, and the\nexpected probability of recessions outside of the United States) explain nearly as much of the VIX forecast\nerror variance as U.S. monetary policy and other U.S. variables combined. In addition, Cerutti, Claessens,\nand Rose (2017) find that directly observed variables in “center” countries (including VIX), as well as\nunobserved common dynamic factors extracted from actual capital flows, together rarely explain more than\none-fourth of the variation in most types of capital flows.\n\n- 6 -\nReferences\nAdrian, Tobias, Daniel Stackman, and Erik Vogt (2017). “Global Price of Risk and\nStabilization Policies,” paper presented at “Eighteenth Jacques Polak Annual\nResearch Conference: The Global Financial Cycle,” sponsored by the\nInternational Monetary Fund, Washington, November 2-3.

There is no greater honor than public service, as\nRandy, Lael and all of our colleagues here at the Fed would agree.\nThe Congress has assigned the Federal Reserve the goals of stable prices and\nmaximum employment. Price stability means that businesses and households can make\nimportant decisions without concern for high or volatile inflation. Maximum\nemployment means that those who want a job either have one or can find one reasonably\nquickly. We also have important responsibilities for the stability of the financial system\nand for the regulation and supervision of financial institutions, including our largest\nbanks. Through regulation that is both effective and efficient, we seek to ensure that\ncredit, which is vital for a healthy economy, will be available to families and businesses\nthroughout the business cycle, so they can invest in a brighter future.\nThese are awesome responsibilities, and the Congress has wisely entrusted us\nwith an important degree of independence so that we can pursue our monetary policy\ngoals without concern for short-term political pressures. As a public institution, we must\nbe transparent about our actions so that the public, through its elected representatives, can\nhold us accountable. Over the past 25 years, the Fed has been a leader among central\nbanks in improving transparency. Today, we are open and accountable. We strive to\nexplain our actions in a way that enhances the public’s understanding of our goals and\n1 On Monday, February 5, 2018, Jerome Powell officially took the oath of office as Chairman of the Board\nof Governors of the Federal Reserve System (for more information, see the Board’s press release available\nat https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20180205a.htm).

We will continue to pursue ways to improve transparency both in monetary\npolicy and in regulation.\nWhen I joined the Board of Governors in 2012, unemployment was 8.2 percent.\nMany millions of Americans were still suffering from the ravages of the crisis. Since\nthen, monetary policy has continued to support a full recovery in labor markets and a\nreturn to our inflation target; we have made great progress in moving much closer to\nthose statutory objectives. In addition, the financial system is incomparably stronger and\nsafer, with much higher capital and liquidity, better risk management, and other\nimprovements.\nMuch credit for these results should go to Chairman Bernanke and Chair Yellen.\nI am grateful for their leadership and for their example and advice as colleagues. But\nthere is more to the story than successful leadership. The success of our institution is\nreally the result of the way all of us carry out our responsibilities. We approach every\nissue through a rigorous evaluation of the facts, theory, empirical analysis and relevant\nresearch. We consider a range of external and internal views; our unique institutional\nstructure, with a Board of Governors in Washington and 12 Reserve Banks around the\ncountry, ensures that we will have a diversity of perspectives at all times. We explain our\nactions to the public. We listen to feedback and give serious consideration to the\npossibility that we might be getting something wrong. There is great value in having\nthoughtful, well-informed critics.\nWhile the challenges we face are always evolving, the Fed’s approach will remain\nthe same.

I believe that the way we approach our work, the strong values we hold, and\nthe dedication to public service I see throughout the Federal Reserve have been the keys\nto our success. As Chairman, I will uphold these values and do my very best to further\nour pursuit of something we all seek--an economy that works for all Americans.",

Powell\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nConversation with the Chair: A Teacher Town Hall Meeting\nWashington, D.C. (and by webcast)\nSeptember 28, 2023\n\nThank you, Sarah, thank you to those in Fed Education who helped put together\nthis event, and thank you to the teachers here and online who have put aside some of their\nplanning time to listen and, I hope, also participate. If I were doing the grading, credit\nwould always be granted for participation.\nWe have scheduled this discussion with teachers well into the school year, partly\nto highlight the beginning, on October 1, of Economic Education Month. At the Fed,\nevery month is Economic Education Month, and we are glad to join in the celebration.\nIt is, fortunately, a very different time for teachers than the one we faced in\nAugust 2021, the last time we held this discussion with educators. In the crisis of the\npandemic, teachers were on the front lines. I know how overwhelming this challenge\nwas for many of you, and the extent of your sacrifice, for which I thank you.\nAnd the crisis in many ways continues, as research confirms the educational\ndeficits that students still suffer from the pandemic. In addition to the challenges they\nface, there are likely to be consequences for the economy and for society, in a generation\nof young people who may lack some of what they need to be well-informed and engaged\nparticipants in our economy and our democracy. Addressing this legacy of the pandemic\nis a major public policy challenge, so now more than ever, teachers are crucial to\nAmerica’s future.\nA large majority of you are economic educators, a role that is of particular\nimportance. As many of you know, the Fed’s ability to influence the economy depends\nto some extent on influencing the public’s view of current and future economic\nconditions. When my colleagues and I publish our projections for the most likely path\nfor the economy and interest rates, as we did a couple of weeks ago, one of our goals is to\n\n- 2 -\ninfluence spending and investment decisions today and in the months ahead. That will\nonly be the case if people understand what we are saying and what it means for their own\nfinances.\nThat’s where you come in. By educating students about economics, not only are\nyou providing them with valuable skills to manage their finances, and to improve their\nchances for future success in any number of occupations that draw on economic thinking.\nYou are also giving them the knowledge that they need to understand the macroeconomy,\nincluding the implications of decisions that the Fed makes. Economic educators impart\nknowledge that is instrumental in how the Federal Reserve promotes a healthy economy.\nIn a way, when you are teaching students, you are also conducting monetary policy.\nBut you do a lot more than that. Teachers illuminate the world for us. They help\nus to see the limitless possibilities in life, and as much as that, also in ourselves. At a\nwonderful but also very vulnerable time in each of our lives, teachers like you are there to\nhelp us understand the world, especially when it is hard to understand. I will leave you\nwith one of the many examples I could cite from my time in school. I can clearly recall\none November day, in fifth grade, at Blessed Sacrament School here in Washington, D.C.\nMy teacher Mrs. Keller was called away from class. I adored Mrs. Keller, and when she\nreturned to the room, I think every student was as upset as I was to see her tear-streaked\nface. And then we got the news—President John F. Kennedy had been shot and killed in\nDallas. This was something that was very hard for my classmates and me to understand,\nbut Mrs. Keller pulled herself together and convinced us that, somehow, everything was\ngoing to be all right. Teachers are there for all of us, when we need your knowledge,\nyour example, your encouragement, and your care. Thank you for playing the\n\n- 3 -\nindispensable role you do in our lives, and in our children’s lives. And now, I would be\nvery happy to respond to your questions.",

Powell\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“The New International Financial System: Analyzing the Cumulative Impact of\nRegulatory Reform”\n17th Annual International Banking Conference\nSponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and the Bank of England\nChicago, Illinois\nNovember 6, 2014\n\nThank you for the opportunity to address the important topic of how the financial\nsystem and its regulation have evolved in response to the global financial crisis. I will\nfocus my remarks on the global initiative to expand central clearing of over-the-counter\n(OTC) derivatives. While we have made significant progress in enlisting central clearing\nto reduce systemic risks, I will argue that there is a good deal more to do to ensure that\nthe reforms achieve their potential and minimize the possibility of unintended and\nundesirable consequences.1\nPrior to the crisis, the then highly opaque market for OTC derivatives grew at an\nastonishing and unsustainable pace of nearly 25 percent per annum in a context of\nrelatively light regulation and bilateral clearing.2 With the benefit of hindsight, we know\nthat along with this torrid growth came an unmeasured and underappreciated buildup of\nrisk. The spectacular losses suffered by American International Group, Inc., or AIG, on\nits derivatives positions, and the resulting concerns about the potential effect of AIG’s\nfailure on its major derivatives counterparties, serve as particularly apt reminders of the\nwider failures and weaknesses that were revealed by the crisis.\nThe threats posed were global, and the response was global as well. In September\n2009, the Group of Twenty (G-20) mandated that all sufficiently standardized derivatives\nshould be centrally cleared--a sea change in the functioning and regulation of these\nmarkets. And in the five intervening years, substantial progress has been made in the\nUnited States and abroad to implement this reform and begin to reduce systemic risk in\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily shared by other members of the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 According to the Bank for International Settlements, the notional amount of OTC derivatives outstanding\ngrew from $80.3 trillion in December 1998 to $598.1 trillion in December 2008, which corresponds to an\nannual growth rate of 22.2 percent per year. For more information, see Bank for International Settlements,\n“Derivatives Statistics,” webpage, www.bis.org/statistics/derstats.htm.\n\n- 2 -\nthese markets. According to public data, roughly 20 percent of all credit derivatives and\n45 percent of all interest rate derivatives are now centrally cleared--amounts that have\ngrown substantially since 2009, when central clearing of credit derivatives began and the\namount of cleared interest rate derivatives was at roughly one-half of its current level.3\nThese amounts should continue to grow over time as central clearing and, especially,\nclient clearing requirements take effect in more jurisdictions.\nGiven the global nature of derivatives markets, the success of the reform agenda\ndepends critically on international coordination. Thus, to support the move to central\nclearing and address other lessons from the financial crisis, regulators developed the new\nPrinciples for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMIs) for the infrastructures that clear\nderivatives, securities, and payments.4 The PFMIs are comprehensive international\nstandards for the governance, risk management, and operation of central counterparties\n(CCPs) and other financial market infrastructures. Such standards are essential given\nthat, in the interest of transparency and improved risk management, policymakers have\nencouraged the concentration of activities at these key nodes. And it is particularly\nimportant that the standards be promulgated globally, given the potential for OTC\nderivatives to span multiple jurisdictions and to migrate to jurisdictions where standards\nand risk management are less robust. Regulators are now engaged in the important work\nof translating these principles into national regulations. Only when these strong\n3 Financial Stability Board (2014), OTC Derivatives Market Reforms: Seventh Progress Report on\nImplementation (Basel, Switzerland: FSB, April),\nwww.financialstabilityboard.org/publications/r_140408.pdf.\n4 See Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems and Technical Committee of the International\nOrganization of Securities Commissions (2012), Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (Basel,\nSwitzerland: Bank for International Settlements and International Organization of Securities Commissions,\nApril), www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d101a.pdf.\n\n- 3 -\ninternational standards have been implemented at CCPs around the world can the risk\nreduction promised by the global clearing mandate be fully realized.\nFurther Challenges Facing Central Clearing\nThe task is far from complete. We must consider how central clearing and CCPs\nfit into the rest of the financial system. From this systemwide perspective, central\nclearing raises a number of important issues that should be kept in mind as its use\nincreases. I will now consider several of those issues and associated challenges in some\ndetail.\nA number of commentators have argued that the move to central clearing will\nfurther concentrate risk in the financial system. There is some truth in that assertion.\nMoving a significant share of the $700 trillion OTC derivatives market to central clearing\nwill concentrate risk at CCPs. But the intent is not simply to concentrate risk, but also to\nreduce it--through netting of positions, greater transparency, better and more uniform\nrisk-management practices, and more comprehensive regulation. This strategy places a\nheavy burden on CCPs, market participants, and regulators alike to build a strong market\nand regulatory infrastructure and to get it right the first time.\nIt has also been frequently observed that central clearing simplifies and makes the\nfinancial system more transparent. That, too, has an element of truth to it, but let’s take a\ncloser look. Charts similar to the ones shown in figure 1 are frequently offered to\nillustrate the point that, as a CCP becomes a buyer to every seller and a seller to every\nbuyer, it causes risks to be netted and simplifies the network of counterparties. The\ndizzying and opaque constellation of exposures that exists in a purely bilateral market,\nillustrated in the chart on the left, is replaced by a neat hub-and-spoke network that is\n\n- 4 -\nboth known and more comprehensible, illustrated in the chart on the right. The CCP and\nits regulators are then in a position to observe the CCP’s entire network, which can be\nimportant in the event that one or more clearing members become impaired. CCPs may\nalso be able to coordinate a response to problems in their markets in ways that individual\nclearing members would find very difficult.\nFigure 2 shows that, at the same time, in the real world CCPs bring with them\ntheir own complexities. As the figure shows, we do not live in a simple world with only\none CCP. We do not even live in a world with one CCP per product class, since some\nproducts are cleared by multiple, large CCPs.5 Also, significant clearing members are\noften members of multiple CCPs in different jurisdictions. The disruption of a single\nmember can have far-reaching effects. Accordingly, while CCPs simplify some aspects\nof the financial system, in reality, the overall system supporting the OTC derivatives\nmarkets remains quite complex.\nTo carry out their critical functions, CCPs rely on a wide variety of financial\nservices from other financial firms, such as custody, clearing, and settlement. Many of\nthese services are provided by the same global financial institutions that are also the\nlargest clearing members of the CCPs. The failure of a large clearing member that is also\na key service provider could disrupt the smooth and efficient operation of one or multiple\nCCPs, and vice versa. In the event of disorderly CCP failures, the netting benefits and\nother efficiencies that CCPs offer would be lost at a point when the financial system is\nalready under significant stress. Ultimately, the system as a whole is only as strong as its\nweakest link.\n5 As an example, both the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Intercontinental Exchange clear credit\ndefault swaps.\n\n- 5 -\nPeople often think of these relationships between CCPs and clearing members in\nterms of credit exposures, but there are also important interconnections in the need for\nand use of liquidity. Historically, some CCPs viewed liquidity in terms of daily\noperational needs. From a macroprudential perspective, this view of liquidity is far too\nnarrow. If a CCP is to act as a buffer against the transmission of liquidity shocks from a\nclearing member’s default, the CCP itself must have a buffer of liquidity it can draw on\nto make its payments on time even during periods of market stress. The PFMIs\nintroduced a new liquidity standard that requires CCPs to cover, at a minimum, the\nliquidity needs of the CCP on the failure of the single clearing member and its affiliates\nwith the largest aggregate position, in extreme but plausible market conditions. Liquidity\nneeds are to be met with a predefined list of liquid resources, starting with cash.\nMoreover, the largest clearing members participate in many CCPs around the\nworld. Cash management at these clearing members, particularly intraday cash\nmanagement, involves interconnected cash flows to and from a clearing member’s\nvarious CCPs, other market infrastructures, and other financial institutions. If a clearing\nmember were to default, cash flows and needed financial services could be disrupted\nsimultaneously at several CCPs. Failure of one or more CCPs to pay margin or settle\nobligations as promised could impair the ability of a clearing member to meet other\nobligations and transmit liquidity risk to others in the financial system. Accordingly,\nCCPs require a liquidity profile that will allow them to absorb rather than amplify the\nliquidity shocks that are likely to materialize during a period of financial stress following\na member’s default.\n\n- 6 -\nOf course, clearinghouses have been around for quite some time and have\ngenerally stood up well even in severe crises.6 But let’s look a little deeper at the risks.\nDuring the global financial crisis, governments around the world took extraordinary\nactions to shore up many of the large financial institutions that are also large clearing\nmembers. While it is not possible to say with confidence what would have happened if\nthese measures had not been taken, it is surely the case that whatever pressures CCPs\nfaced would have been many times greater, and the potential consequences much greater\nas well. Moreover, as CCPs grow into their enhanced role in the financial system, they\nwill represent an ever larger locus for systemic risk. It is therefore important not to be\nlulled into a false sense of security that past performance is a guarantee of future CCP\nsuccess.\nAfter the crisis, governments firmly resolved that even the largest financial\ninstitutions must be allowed to fail and be resolved without taxpayer support and without\nthreatening the broader financial system or the economy. CCPs therefore need to adapt\nto a world in which their largest clearing members will be allowed to fail and to be\nresolved without taxpayer support. And, as I will discuss a little later, the same is true of\nCCPs--they, too, should have no expectation of taxpayer support if they fail. To say it as\nplainly as possible, the purpose of all of this new infrastructure and regulation is not to\nfacilitate the orderly bailout of a CCP in the next crisis. Quite to the contrary, CCPs and\n6 See, for example, Jerome H. Powell (2013), “OTC Market Infrastructure Reform: Opportunities and\nChallenges,” speech delivered at the Clearing House 2013 annual meeting, New York, November 21,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20131121a.htm; and Ben S. Bernanke (2011),\n“Clearinghouses, Financial Stability, and Financial Reform,” speech delivered at the 2011 Financial\nMarkets Conference, a meeting sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, held in Stone Mountain,\nGa., April 4, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20110404a.htm.\n\n- 7 -\ntheir members must plan to stand on their own and continue to provide critical services to\nthe financial system, without support from the taxpayer.\nThe Road Ahead: Meeting the Challenges\nAs you can see, central clearing represents the confluence of critical market\ninfrastructure and systemic financial institutions. As a result, the regulation and\nsupervision of CCPs present particular challenges. What matters most is the stability of\nthe entire system, not that of one sector or another. In the United States, CCPs are\nprimarily regulated by either the Commodity Futures Trading Commission or the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission. Under authority provided by the Dodd-Frank\nWall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the Federal Reserve also plays\na role in supervising and regulating systemically important CCPs and other financial\nmarket utilities.7 In addition, the Federal Reserve is the holding company supervisor of a\nnumber of the largest clearing members. The challenge is to ensure that regulation and\nsupervision take into account the broad implications of derivatives trading for CCPs, their\nmembers, and the broader financial system. Close collaboration between regulators--both\ndomestically and internationally--will be necessary to ensure that central clearing can\npromote the kind of financial system resiliency that will be required when another severe\ncrisis threatens.\nWhile central clearing and CCPs do present a number of complex and unique\nchallenges, these challenges are not insurmountable. Several measures should be\nconsidered in the near term to further strengthen the market and regulatory infrastructure\n7 The Federal Reserve Board’s authority to supervise systemically important CCPs is provided in title VIII\nof the Dodd-Frank Act.\n\n- 8 -\nrelating to liquidity, transparency, stress testing, “skin in the game,” and recovery and\nresolution.\nLiquidity\nThe adoption of the PFMIs around the world is driving improvements in CCP\nliquidity.8 Ultimately, CCPs and their supervisors will need to maintain vigilance to\nensure that liquid resources are sufficient to withstand the kinds of liquidity shocks that\nwould likely accompany a member’s default. In addition, it is crucial that liquidity\nscenario analysis be a regular part of a CCP’s stress-testing program to help ensure that\nappropriate liquidity planning does not suffer from a lack of vision or imagination.\nTransparency\nEnhanced transparency is central to the reform agenda, and there has been some\nprogress in this area. But CCPs need to provide still greater transparency to their clearing\nmembers and to the public. The G-20’s central clearing mandate shifted a significant\namount of activity and control away from dealers to CCPs. With this shift, CCPs took on\nthe responsibility of managing risks in a way that is transparent to the clearing members\nwho are subject to the decisions of the CCP. Clearing members need a full and detailed\nunderstanding of their risk exposure to CCPs, which means that clearing members must\nhave detailed and appropriate information on stress-test results, the specification and\napplication of margin models, and the sizing of default funds to cover losses. Without a\nclear picture of a CCP’s risk profile, clearing members cannot make informed decisions\n8 In the United States, these standards were implemented by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission\nfor derivative-clearing organizations in November 2013 and by the Federal Reserve for certain financial\nmarket utilities that are designated as systemically important by the Financial Stability Oversight Council\nin October 2014.\n\n- 9 -\nabout whether to clear with a particular CCP or how to judge their exposures to it. All\nmajor stakeholders--clearing members, clients, regulators, and the broader market--\nshould be aware of the risks involved so that they can take appropriate steps to mitigate\nthem.\nStress testing\nThe disclosure of CCP stress-test results to clearing members is important so that\nclearing members can have a full understanding of a CCP’s risk profile. This disclosure,\nhowever, would be of little help if the stress tests themselves were insufficiently\ncomprehensive and robust. For example, consider a case in which a bank belongs to two\nCCPs that clear similar products but the disclosed stress tests for the CCPs are based on\nmaterially different scenarios. This state of affairs could easily result in more confusion\nthan clarity.\nIt is time for domestic and international regulators to consider steps to strengthen\ncredit and liquidity stress testing conducted by CCPs. Currently, most major CCPs\nengage in some form of stress testing. However, both clearing members and regulators\nneed a more systematic view of what stress tests are performed, at what frequency, with\nwhat assumptions, and with what results. Aside from these issues involving individual\nstress tests, there are also important questions about the comparability of stress scenarios,\nassumptions, and results across similar and different types of CCPs. A related issue is\nwhether regulators should consider some sort of standardized approach to supervisory\nstress testing. Not all CCPs are alike. But there may be approaches that could bring\nsome of the benefits of standardization while allowing tailoring of some scenarios to the\nactivities of particular CCPs or groups of CCPs. Clearly, a greater degree of uniformity\n\n- 10 -\nwould be helpful to clearing members that are comparing test results across several CCPs\nand to regulators that are considering systemwide stability. For example, there are likely\nsome financial market stresses, such as rapid and significant increases in market\nvolatility, that would be expected to have broad effects across financial markets and\nparticipants. Coordinated stress tests could also help us better understand the\nmacroprudential risks around liquidity that I discussed earlier. Understanding the effect\nof such correlated stresses on a wide array of CCPs will be important for ensuring overall\nsystem resiliency. Going forward, regulators will need to work collaboratively to ensure\nthat stress tests are robust, informative, and appropriately comparable.\nSkin in the game\nA number of commentators have urged U.S. authorities to consider requiring\nCCPs to place significant amounts of their own loss-absorbing resources in front of the\nmutualized clearing fund or other financial resources provided by clearing members.\nThese skin-in-the-game requirements are intended to create incentives for the owners of\nCCPs for careful consideration of new products for clearing, for conservative modeling\nof risks, and for robust default waterfalls and other resources to meet such risks as may\nmaterialize.9 The issue is a complex one, however, and a number of factors would need\nto be considered in formulating such a requirement.\nRecovery and resolution\nI have focused so far on what we can do to ensure that CCPs do not fail: more\ntransparency, enhanced stress testing, more robust capital and default waterfalls, stronger\n9 See, for example, the related discussion in Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (2010),\nMarket Structure Developments in the Clearing Industry: Implications for Financial Stability (Basel,\nSwitzerland: Bank for International Settlements, November), www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d92.pdf.\n\n- 11 -\nliquidity, and increased incentives to appropriately manage risks. I will conclude my\nremarks today by discussing what happens when all of these efforts encounter a severe\nstress event. Try as we might to prevent the buildup of excessive risk, we need to be\nprepared for the possibility that a CCP may fail or approach failure in the future. When\nand if such a crisis materializes, CCPs will be called on to stand on their own. CCPs and\nregulators need to develop clear and detailed CCP recovery and resolution strategies that\nare well designed to minimize transmission of the CCP’s distress to its clearing members\nand beyond.\nRecovery and resolution planning is a matter of intense focus among regulators\nand industry participants. Just last month, the Committee on Payments and Market\nInfrastructures and the Board of the International Organization of Securities\nCommissions released their final report on the recovery of financial market\ninfrastructures.10 The report is part of an ongoing effort to provide guidance on\nimplementing the PFMI requirements for recovery planning. On the same day, the\nFinancial Stability Board released a new report on the resolution of financial market\ninfrastructures and their participants to supplement its earlier work on the report Key\nAttributes of Effective Resolution Regimes for Financial Institutions.11\nThese reports stress that CCPs must adopt plans and tools that will help them\nrecover from financial shocks and continue to provide their critical services without\ngovernment assistance. It has been a challenge for some market participants to confront\n10 See Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures and Board of the International Organization of\nSecurities Commissions (2014), Recovery of Financial Market Infrastructures (Basel, Switzerland: Bank\nfor International Settlements and International Organization of Securities Commissions, October),\nwww.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d121.pdf.\n11 See Financial Stability Board (2014), Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes for Financial\nInstitutions (Basel, Switzerland: FSB, October),\nwww.financialstabilityboard.org/publications/r_141015.pdf.\n\n- 12 -\nthe fact that risks and losses, however well managed, do not simply disappear within a\nCCP but are ultimately allocated in some way to the various stakeholders in the\norganization--even if the risk of loss is quite remote. This realization has generated a\nhealthy debate among CCPs, members, and members’ clients and regulators that has\nprovided fertile ground for new thinking about risk design, risk-management tools, and\nrecovery planning. To ensure that CCPs do not themselves become too-big-to-fail\nentities, we need transparent, actionable, and effective plans for dealing with financial\nshocks that do not leave either an explicit or implicit role for the government.\nConclusion: Realizing the Promise of Central Clearing\nA key question posed at this conference is whether the reforms instituted in\nresponse to the crisis have improved the strength and stability of the financial system. In\nmy view, the answer for OTC derivatives reform--and central clearing, in particular--is a\npositive one. But final pronouncements are premature. Post-crisis reforms and the rise of\ncentral clearing have started us down a path toward greater financial stability. At the\nsame time, central clearing brings with it a number of complexities that relate to the\ninteraction between CCPs and the rest of the financial system, especially the global\nsystemically important financial institutions that represent many of their largest clearing\nmembers. Given the increasingly prominent role that central clearing will play in the\nfinancial system going forward, it is critical that we collectively get central clearing right.\nTo do so, I have argued that it is imperative that we consider central clearing from a\nsystemwide perspective, and that regulators will need to continue to work collaboratively\nwith each other, both domestically and internationally.\n\nFigure 1.

Powell\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nvia prerecorded video\nto\n“Stress Testing: A Discussion and Review,” a research conference\nat the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston\nBoston, Massachusetts\nJuly 9, 2019\n\nGood morning everyone and thank you to President Rosengren and the Boston\nFed for hosting this conference.\nThe Federal Reserve is strongly committed to stress testing as a cornerstone of\nour bank supervisory and financial stability missions. Stress testing is perhaps the most\nsuccessful supervisory innovation of the post-crisis era. But if stress tests are to\ncontinue to serve their critical function, they will need to evolve in the years ahead to\nkeep pace with the ever-changing financial system, as they have since the first round of\ntests in 2009.\nBefore looking to the future, let me recall a bit of history. A little more than\n10 years ago, the United States and the world teetered on the brink of economic\ncatastrophe. What was urgently needed was a way to restore confidence in the financial\nsystem—a daunting challenge. Neither the banks, nor the regulators, nor the public had a\nreliable sense of the strength and resilience of our major banks. The announcement of\nforward-looking stress-testing results in May 2009 helped restore confidence and\nstabilize banks by providing a credible and independent picture of their finances.1 These\noriginal stress tests evolved into the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, or\nCCAR, program, which has served to institutionalize capital planning by firms, and\nsupervision by the Fed, as a forward-looking endeavor.\n1 The stress tests were announced in February 2009, and the results were released in May 2009. See,\nrespectively, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation,\nOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency, and Office of Thrift Supervision (2009), “Agencies to Begin\nForward-Looking Economic Assessments,” joint press release, February 25,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20090225a.htm; and Board of Governors\n(2009), “Federal Reserve, OCC, and FDIC Release Results of the Supervisory Capital Assessment\nProgram,” press release, May 7,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20090507a.htm.\n\n- 2 -\nSince 2009, large banks have added more than $800 billion in common equity\ncapital, giving them a much thicker cushion to deal with losses. Banks have gotten much\nbetter at assessing and managing their risks, effectively tracking commitments across\ntheir organizations, anticipating capital needs, and planning for different scenarios.\nThe stress tests of the future—5 and 10 years from now—will need to continue to\nensure that banks remain able, even in a severe downturn, to provide the credit that\nhouseholds and businesses depend on. As financial institutions and the financial system\nevolve, stress testing will need to keep up. When the next episode of financial instability\npresents itself, it may do so in a messy and unexpected way. Banks will need to be ready\nnot just for expected risks, but for unexpected ones. Thus, the tests will need to vary\nfrom year to year, and to explore even quite unlikely scenarios.\nIf the stress tests do not evolve, they risk becoming a compliance exercise,\nbreeding complacency from both supervisors and banks. We might also, inadvertently,\nencourage the development of a banking system where, over time, all banks would look\nmuch alike rather than the banking system we want and need, one with diverse\ninstitutions with different business models. We simply can’t let these things happen.\nThe purpose of today’s gathering is to help us think about how to ensure the tests\ncontinue to foster a dynamic banking system, financial stability, and a healthy and\ngrowing economy. We have invited a wide range participants—fellow regulators,\nbankers, analysts, academics, and community groups—with diverse perspectives.\nBecause we do not claim a monopoly on knowledge or wisdom, we have invited many\nwho have disagreed with us in the past. I strongly believe that diverse perspectives and\nhealthy debate will sharpen our thinking and lead us to better answers.\n\n- 3 -\nI’m sorry I’m not able to be with you today. And I want to particularly thank all\nof the speakers, discussants, and other participants for helping us grapple with the\nchallenges of ensuring that tomorrow’s stress tests remain as effective and vigorous as\nthey are today. Thank you.",

Powell\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“International Roles of the U.S. Dollar,” a research conference sponsored by\nthe Federal Reserve Board\nWashington, DC\nJune 17, 2022\n\nGood morning, and welcome to the inaugural conference on the International\nRoles of the U.S. Dollar. Thank you all for participating and for lending your expertise\non this important topic. This conference marks the first use of our new Martin\nConference Center, which I hope you enjoy.\nThe international financial and monetary system that emerged after World War II\nhas been defined by the centrality of the dollar. It is the world’s reserve currency and the\nmost widely used for payments and investments. As outlined in recent work by Board\nstaff, this global preeminence has been supported by the depth and liquidity of U.S.\nfinancial markets, the size and strength of the U.S. economy, its stability and openness to\ntrade and capital flows, and international trust in U.S. institutions and the rule of law.1\nProfessor Barry Eichengreen will expand on some of these themes later this morning.\nThe dollar’s international role holds multiple benefits. For the United States, it\nlowers transaction fees and borrowing costs for U.S. households, businesses, and the\ngovernment. Its ubiquity helps contain uncertainty and, relatedly, the cost of hedging for\ndomestic households and businesses. For foreign economies, the wide use of the dollar\nallows borrowers to have access to a broad pool of lenders and investors, which reduces\ntheir funding and transaction costs. The benefits of the dollar as the dominant reserve\ncurrency have generated an extensive academic literature. Yesterday’s paper on the\nTreasury market by Alexandra Tabova and Frank Warnock extends that work in\nmeaningful ways.\n1 See Carol Bertaut, Bastian von Beschwitz, and Stephanie Curcuru (2021), “The International Role of the\nU.S. Dollar,” FEDS Note (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, October 6),\nhttps://doi.org/10.17016/2380-7172.2998.\n\n- 2 -\nThe Federal Reserve’s strong commitment to our price stability mandate\ncontributes to the widespread confidence in the dollar as a store of value. To that end,\nmy colleagues and I are acutely focused on returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.\nMeeting our dual mandate also depends on maintaining financial stability. The Fed’s\ncommitment to both our dual mandate and financial stability encourages the international\ncommunity to hold and use dollars.\nThe wide use of the dollar globally can also pose financial stability challenges\nthat can materially affect households, businesses, and markets. For that reason, the\nFederal Reserve has played a key role in promoting financial stability and supporting the\nuse of dollars internationally through our liquidity facilities. The central bank liquidity\nswap lines provide foreign central banks with the capacity to deliver U.S. dollar funding\nto institutions in their jurisdictions. And the Foreign and International Monetary\nAuthorities (FIMA) Repo Facility allows approved FIMA account holders the option to\ntemporarily exchange their U.S. Treasury securities held by the Federal Reserve for U.S.\ndollars. These facilities serve as liquidity backstops so that holders of dollar assets and\nparticipants in dollar funding markets can be confident that strains will be eased when\nthese markets come under stress. That assurance, in turn, mitigates the effect of such\nstrains on the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. Both facilities enhance\nthe standing of the dollar as the dominant global currency.\nThe swap lines were extensively used during the Global Financial Crisis, the 2011\neuro-area debt crisis, and the financial turmoil at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic\nin 2020. The paper on central bank swap lines presented yesterday by Gerardo Ferrara,\nPhilippe Mueller, Ganesh Viswanath-Natraj, and Junxuan Wang provides novel micro-\n\n- 3 -\nlevel evidence on the usefulness of swap lines in providing cross-border liquidity to\nsupport the real economy.\nLooking forward, rapid changes are taking place in the global monetary system\nthat may affect the international role of the dollar in the future. Most major economies\nalready have or are in the process of developing instant, 24/7 payments. Our own\nFedNow service will be coming online in 2023. And in light of the tremendous growth in\ncrypto-assets and stablecoins, the Federal Reserve is examining whether a U.S. central\nbank digital currency (CBDC) would improve on an already safe and efficient domestic\npayments system. As the Fed’s white paper on this topic notes, a U.S. CBDC could also\npotentially help maintain the dollar’s international standing.2 As we consider feedback\nfrom the paper, we will be thinking not just about the current state of the world, but also\nhow the global financial system might evolve over the next 5 to 10 years. The paper by\nJiakai Chen and Asani Sarkar, which is on today’s program, and our distinguished\npanelists on this topic this afternoon, will provide important insights on this issue.\nTo summarize, I would like to stress the importance of the dollar to the U.S. and\nglobal economies and financial markets. It is critical that we understand the channels,\nconnections, and effects of the role of the dollar.\nIn closing, I want to thank you all for taking the time to join our discussion on the\ndollar’s international roles. This conference brings together world-class researchers,\npractitioners, and policymakers dedicated to understanding and addressing these vital\nissues. I look forward to their insights and I hope you enjoy the conference.\n2 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2021), Money and Payments: The U.S.\nDollar in the Age of Digital Transformation (Washington: Board of Governors, January),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/money-and-payments-20220120.pdf.",

Powell\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\n77th Annual Meeting of the American Finance Association\nChicago, Illinois\nJanuary 7, 2017\n\nThank you for this invitation to discuss low interest rates and the financial system.\nThe framing of this topic raises the question of whether low interest rates have somehow\nundermined the stability and functioning of the financial system. I will argue that “low\nfor long” interest rates have supported slow but steady progress to full employment and\nstable prices, which has in turn supported financial stability. Indeed, by many measures\nthe U.S. financial system is much stronger than before the crisis. That said, there are\ndifficult tradeoffs to manage. Over time, low rates can put pressure on the business\nmodels of financial institutions. And low rates can lead to excessive leverage and\nbroadly unsustainable asset prices--things that we watch carefully for and do not observe\nat this point. I will begin by focusing briefly on the macroeconomic effects of low\ninterest rates. I will then turn to the condition of the financial system--in particular, its\ninterplay with low rates. As always, the views I express here today are mine alone.\nHighly Accommodative Monetary Policy\nThe financial crisis and the Great Recession posed the most significant\nmacroeconomic challenges for the United States in a half-century, leaving behind high\nunemployment and below-target inflation and calling for highly accommodative\nmonetary policies. Isolating the effects of these policies is challenging, but studies\ngenerally show that they lowered rates across the curve and moved other asset prices as\nwell.1 It is even more challenging to evaluate their effects on aggregate demand. Low\nrates and higher asset prices should support household and business spending and\n1 Williams (2014) compiles the results from a range of studies estimating the effect of the Federal\nReserve’s large-scale asset purchases (LSAPs). While the exact numbers vary and are subject to\nsubstantial uncertainty, typical estimates of the effect of a representative $600 billion in Treasury LSAPs\non long-term yields are in the range of 15 to 25 basis points, an effect roughly equivalent to that of three or\nfour rate cuts of 25 basis points.\n\n- 2 -\ninvestment through various channels. But low rates may also perversely induce some\nhouseholds to save more in order to meet their targets for retirement. And low rates have\nclearly not produced a boom in corporate investment, although standard accelerator\nmodels suggest that investment has largely been consistent with the weak pace of\neconomic growth. Nonetheless, there is good reason to think that low rates have\nprovided significant support for demand, and my view is that they have done so.2 As you\ncan see in slide 1, we are now close to meeting our dual mandate--a reasonable summary\nstatistic for the effects of policy. While growth has been frustratingly slow, employment\ngains have been solid. This is a reasonably good outcome considering the scope of the\ncrisis and the relatively poorer performance of other major advanced economies.\nOther Factors Are Holding Down Rates\nThere are also many factors other than monetary policy that are holding down\nlong-term interest rates. Long-term nominal and real rates have been declining for over\n30 years. The next slide decomposes long-term nominal yields into expected future\nshort-term real rates, expected future inflation, and a term premium. These estimates are\nbased on one of the Board’s workhorse term structure models.3 All three components\nhave contributed to the downward trend in long-term nominal yields.\nThe downward trend in nominal term premiums likely reflects both lower\ninflation risk and the fact that, with inflation expectations anchored, nominal bonds have\nbecome an increasingly good hedge against market risk. That has made bonds a more\n2 See Engen, Laubach, and Reifschneider (2015). The most interest rate sensitive sectors of the economy,\nsuch as consumer durables and residential investment, have exhibited higher growth than other sectors\nsince the second round of quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve. And, for example, Mian, Rao, and\nSufi (2013) conclude that the decline in house prices during the recession had a substantial effect on\nconsumption; by the same argument, if low rates supported house prices, then they would have supported\nconsumer spending as well.\n3 See D’Amico, Kim, and Wei (forthcoming).\n\n- 3 -\nattractive investment and reduced the term premium.4 As shown in the next slide, a\nregression of the 10-year term premium on measures of 10-year inflation expectations\nand a rolling beta of Treasury returns with respect to equity returns (to proxy for the\nhedging value of bonds) shows that these two factors can account for a large part of the\ndecline in the term premium.\nRegulations now require many financial institutions to hold more safe, high-\nquality liquid assets, which likely has pushed down term premiums further. Global\nfactors may have put downward pressure on term premiums because of anxiety about the\nforeign outlook, which may have increased demand for U.S. assets, or because low rates\nabroad have depressed U.S. term premiums through a global portfolio balance channel.5\nAnd real rates are quite low globally, reflecting the step-down of productivity growth\nover the past 10 years as well as shifts in savings and investment demand due to\ndemographic change.6\nThe Core of the Financial System Is Much Stronger\nBefore turning to the interplay between low rates and the financial system, I will\nsimply point out that both improved risk management at the largest, most systemically\nimportant financial institutions (SIFIs) and stronger regulation have made the core of\nthe system much stronger and more resilient than before the crisis.7 The SIFIs have more\n4 The changing risk profile of nominal Treasury bonds can be seen from its capital asset pricing model (or\nCAPM) beta, a measure of the co-movement between returns on longer-term Treasury securities and the\nequity market. Figure A.1 shows that the estimated rolling beta of the 10-year Treasury note with respect\nto the S&P 500 turned from positive to negative around 2000, indicating that Treasury bonds are now likely\nto act as a safe haven, performing well when equity markets do poorly.\n5\nFigure A.2 shows the response in daily changes in 10-year U.S. Treasury yields to changes in 10-year\nGerman bund yields around European Central Bank (ECB) monetary policy decisions since 2010. The\nsignificantly positive regression coefficient is evidence of substantial spillovers from ECB monetary policy\nto U.S. long-term yields.\n6 See Rachel and Smith (2015) and Gagnon, Johannsen, and Lopez-Salido (2016).\n7 See Powell (2015).\n\n- 4 -\nstable funding, hold much more capital and liquidity, are more conscious of their risks,\nand are far more resolvable should they fail. Many aspects of our financial market\ninfrastructure, including the triparty repurchase agreement (or repo) market, central\ncounterparties (CCPs), and money market funds, are more robust as well.\nLow Rates Can Mean Tradeoffs\nSo far, I have argued that low rates have supported aggregate demand and brought\nus very close to full employment and 2 percent inflation; that forces other than monetary\npolicy have been pushing rates lower for more than 30 years; and that the core of the\nfinancial system is now much stronger and more resilient than before the crisis. All of\nthat said, I would also agree that monetary policy may sometimes face tradeoffs between\nmacroeconomic objectives and financial stability. Indeed, it would be a divine\ncoincidence if that were not the case. There are times when all of these objectives are\naligned. For example, the Fed’s initial unconventional policies supported both market\nfunctioning and aggregate demand. More broadly, post-crisis monetary policy supported\nasset values, reduced interest payments, and increased both employment and income. All\nof these effects are likely to have limited defaults and foreclosures and bolstered the\nbalance sheets of households, businesses, and financial intermediaries, leaving the system\nmore robust.\nBut at times there will be tradeoffs. Low-for-long interest rates can have adverse\neffects on financial institutions and markets through a number of plausible channels, as\nlisted on the next slide.8 After all, low interest rates are intended to encourage some risk-\n8 See Adrian and Liang (2014).\n\n- 5 -\ntaking.9 The question is whether low rates have encouraged excessive risk-taking\nthrough the buildup of leverage or unsustainably high asset prices or through\nmisallocation of capital. That question is particularly important today. Historically,\nrecessions often occurred when the Fed tightened to control inflation. More recently,\nwith inflation under control, overheating has shown up in the form of financial excess.\nCore PCE inflation remained close to or below 2 percent during both the late-1990s stock\nmarket bubble and the mid-2000s housing bubble that led to the financial crisis. Real\nshort- and long-term rates were relatively high in the late 1990s, so financial excess can\nalso arise without a low-rate environment. Nonetheless, the current extended period of\nvery low nominal rates calls for a high degree of vigilance against the buildup of risks to\nthe stability of the financial system.\nIf we look at the channels listed here, the picture is mixed, but the bottom line is\nthat there has not been an excessive buildup of leverage, maturity transformation, or\nbroadly unsustainable asset prices.\nLow long-term interest rates have weighed on profitability in the financial sector,\nalthough firms have so far coped with those pressures. As shown in the next slide, net\ninterest margins (NIMs) for most banks have held up surprisingly well. NIMs have\nmoved down for the largest banks. Return on assets, shown to the right for both groups,\nhas recovered but remains below pre-crisis levels. Life insurers have substantially\nunderperformed the broader equity market since 2007, suggesting that investors see the\nlow-rate environment as a drag on profitability for the industry. Even so, data on asset\n9 See Dell’Ariccia, Laeven, and Suarez (forthcoming), which finds evidence for a risk-taking channel of\nmonetary policy based on supervisory ratings of U.S. bank loans. Bekaert, Hoerova, and Lo Duca (2013)\nfind that accommodative monetary policy shocks lead to a decline in the VIX, a measure of implied\nvolatility, by lowering both expected volatility and the risk premium.\n\n- 6 -\nportfolios do not suggest that life insurers have increased risk-taking. The same is true\nfor banks. Both the regulatory environment and banks’ own attitudes toward risk\nfollowing the financial crisis have helped ensure that the largest banks have not taken on\nexcessive credit or duration risks relative to their capital cushions.\nLow rates have provided support for asset valuations--indeed, that is part of their\ndesign. But I do not see valuations as significantly out of line with historical experience.\nEquity prices have recently increased considerably, pushing the forward price-earnings\nratio further above its historical median (slide). And equity premiums (right)--the\nexpected return above the risk-free rate for taking equity risk--have declined but are not\nout of line with historical experience.\nIn the nonfinancial sector, valuation pressures are most concerning when leverage\nis high, particularly in real estate markets. Residential real estate valuations have been in\nline with rents and household incomes in recent years, and the ratio of mortgage debt to\nincome is well below its pre-crisis peak and still declining. In contrast, valuations in\ncommercial real estate are high in some markets.10 And in the nonfinancial corporate\nsector, gross leverage is high by historical standards. Low long-term rates have\nencouraged corporate debt issuance at the same time that some regulations, particularly\nthe Volcker rule, have discouraged banks from holding and making markets in such debt.\nHigh-risk corporate debt (the sum of high-yield bonds and leveraged loans) grew rapidly\nin 2013 and 2014 (slide), although growth has declined sharply since then.11 However,\n10 The Federal Reserve, along with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation, issued guidance regarding prudent management of risks from loans secured by\ncommercial real estate (CRE) in late 2015. Of course, the annual stress tests typically feature significant\ndeclines in CRE prices, suggesting that banks are capitalized against a deterioration in this sector.\n11 Gilchrist and Zakrajšek’s (2012) measure of the corporate bond spread, shown in figure A.3, is at about\nits average level, but their estimate of the risk premium in this market is low, so, by this measure, at least\npricing is rich.\n\n- 7 -\nfirms also are holding high levels of liquid assets, so net leverage is not elevated. Firms\nhave also lengthened their maturity profiles, and interest coverage ratios are high. As the\nnext slide shows, Greenwood and Hanson’s measure of the share of high-yield debt in\noverall issuance is at a relatively low level.12 And this debt is now held more by\nunlevered investors. Overall, I do not see leveraged finance markets as posing undue\nfinancial stability risks. And if risk-taking does not threaten financial stability, it is not\nthe Fed’s job to stop people from losing (or making) money.\nAs I said, a mixed picture. Low interest rates have encouraged risk-taking and\nhigher leverage in some sectors and have weighed on profitability in others, but the areas\nwhere there are signs of excess are isolated.\nConclusion\nTo sum up, low interest rates have supported economic activity and gradually\nbrought us back to full employment and 2 percent inflation. Better regulation and risk\nmanagement have so far minimized the tradeoffs between our macroeconomic objectives,\non the one hand, and financial stability, on the other. Still, a period of low rates for a\nlong time could present significant challenges for monetary policy. It could also put\npressure on the business models of some financial institutions. Ultimately, the only way\nto get sustainably higher interest rates is to improve the broader environment for growth,\nby adopting policies designed to increase productivity and potential output over the long\nterm--policies that are mainly outside the scope of our work at the Federal Reserve.13\n12 See Greenwood and Hanson (2013).\n13 See Powell (2016) and Yellen (2016).\n\n- 8 -\nReferences\nAdrian, Tobias, and Nellie Liang (2014). “Monetary Policy, Financial Conditions, and\nFinancial Stability,” Federal Reserve Bank of New York Staff Reports 690.

Powell\nChairman\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Rural Places, Rural Spaces: Closing Financial Services Gaps in Persistent Poverty\nAmerica,” a policy forum sponsored by Hope Enterprise Corporation\nMississippi Valley State University\nItta Bena, Mississippi\nFebruary 12, 2019\n\nThank you for that kind introduction. I also want to thank Hope Enterprise\nCorporation for inviting me to speak and Mississippi Valley State University (MVSU) for\nhosting us on its lovely campus.\nIt is a great pleasure to visit the Mississippi Delta. This region gave America the\npriceless musical heritage of the Blues. It was also the site of some of the watershed\nevents of the civil rights movement. But the Delta, like many rural areas, has long\nconfronted the challenge of poverty. Today I’ll speak about three areas of opportunity\nfor addressing the challenges of rural poverty--education and workforce development,\nentrepreneurship and small business development, as well as access to financial services--\nthe topic of this conference.\nMVSU’s mission, providing young people an affordable college education, is\nitself a very powerful antipoverty program--for its graduates, of course, but also for other\ncommunities that are touched by the university. MVSU opened its doors in 1950 as\nMississippi Vocational College. The vocation of every member of its first class of 200\nstudents was teaching. And even as it added other programs and became a full-fledged\nuniversity, MVSU has continued to train many of the teachers who enrich, inspire, and\nspark the imagination of children who grow up in the Delta.\nMVSU and other historically black colleges and universities, or HBCUs, play a\ncrucial role in their communities. For much of the 20th century, HBCUs were the\nprimary means for black men and women to obtain the education needed for middle class\nor professional jobs. Larger percentages of HBCU students, compared with students at\npredominantly white institutions, come from lower-income families and are the first in\ntheir families to attend college. This university and other HBCUs support intellectual\n\n- 2 -\nleadership, creativity, and innovation. I want to honor you for this proud history and for\nyour continuing commitment to a better future for your students and for the region where\nmany of your students were born and will build their lives and raise their families.1\nChallenges and Opportunities in Poor Rural Communities\nToday, data at the national level show a strong economy. Unemployment is near\na half-century low, and economic output is growing at a solid pace. But we know that\nprosperity has not been felt as much in some areas, including many rural places. The\nFederal Reserve can help by carrying out our monetary policy mission of supporting\nmaximum employment and price stability. We also support strong communities by\nconducting research, promoting community development, and enforcing laws like the\nCommunity Reinvestment Act, which helps ensure that people have adequate access to\nfinancial services wherever they live. We not only work with communities, we are in\ncommunities, through the presence of our 12 regional Reserve Banks.\nPoverty remains a challenge in many rural communities. Indeed, 70 percent of\nthe 473 “persistent poverty” counties in the United States are rural.2 Unemployment and\nmortality rates remain high in these communities. Along with lower incomes and wealth,\nthe rate of business start-ups in these areas is lower. And their residents have less access\n1 For a history of the role of HBCUs, see, for example, Todd Greene and Ashley Bozarth (2018), “The\nCritical Role of Historically Black Colleges and Universities in Workforce Development,” in Stuart\nAndreason, Todd Greene, Heath Prince, and Carl E. Van Horn, eds., Investing in America’s Workforce,\nvol. 1: Investing in Workers (Kalamazoo, Mich.: W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research),\npp. 189-94; and Ronald A. Johnson (2018), “HBCUs as Pipelines for Diversified Intellect, Creativity, and\nInnovation,” in Stuart Andreason, Todd Greene, Heath Prince, and Carl E. Van Horn, eds., Investing in\nAmerica’s Workforce, vol. 1: Investing in Workers (Kalamazoo, Mich.: W.E. Upjohn Institute for\nEmployment Research), pp. 195-204.\n2 As defined in PL 115-31 as counties where 20 percent or more of the population live in poverty as\nmeasured by the U.S. Census Bureau in the 1990 and 2000 decennial censuses (for more information, see\nhttps://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/saipe/guidance/model-input-data/decennial.html) and the\n2011-2015 American Community Survey (https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-\ndocumentation/table-and-geography-changes/2015/5-year.html).\n\n- 3 -\nto financial services. Many of these disparities have existed for generations, and in some\nplaces have roots in a history of discrimination.\nThese areas also generally lack diverse industries and employment options and\noften have suffered from a decline in a traditional industry. In Appalachia for instance,\ntimber, coal mining, tobacco, and textiles have long been in decline.3 Likewise, the\nnumber of jobs in agriculture and low-skilled manufacturing, mainstays of the Delta’s\neconomy, is decreasing as a result of automation and outsourcing.4\nEducation and Workforce Development\nHigh-quality education and training play a crucial role in extending opportunity in\nrural areas, starting with early childhood education.5 But in many rural communities,\naccess to high-quality preschool education is limited. Mississippi is one of several\nmostly rural states where nearly half of residents lack access to good quality childcare,\nwhich is the main source of early childhood education.6 Many decades of research also\n3 See, for example, Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta (2012), “From Textiles to Turnaround: A Tale of Two\nCities,” Economic Development Podcast, July, https://www.frbatlanta.org/podcasts/transcripts/economic-\ndevelopment/120718-textiles-to-turnaround-tale-of-two-cities.aspx; Karl Rhodes (2013), “The Future of\nCoal,” Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Econ Focus, vol. 17 (fourth quarter), pp. 28-31,\nhttps://www.richmondfed.org/~/media/richmondfedorg/publications/research/econ_focus/2013/q4/pdf/featu\nre4.pdf.\n4 See, for example, Sungki Hong and Hannah G.

Rural areas where traditional industries are\ndeclining and where new employers may be moving in often experience a mismatch\nbetween the skills of local workers and those demanded by the new employers. Training\nand retraining programs tend to be centralized and concentrated in areas with a higher\npopulation density, which puts many rural areas at a disadvantage.8\nEducation benefits both the student and the community. It is true that some\nyoung people leave their hometowns to seek greater opportunity. However, it is also true\nthat young families, drawn back home by family and social ties, are the largest source of\nin-migration in many rural communities. Young families are more likely to come if they\nbelieve their children will get a good education. Returnees often bring back important\nskills and experiences and make meaningful contributions to the local economy.9\nAn excellent example is Tim Lampkin, an MVSU graduate. Tim grew up and\ngraduated from high school in Clarksdale. After graduating from MVSU, he moved to\n7 See, for example, Raj Chetty, Nathaniel Hendren, Patrick Kline, and Emmanuel Saez (2014), “Where Is\nthe Land of Opportunity?

He wasn’t gone long, though, before he felt called to return to make his\nhome here in the Delta. Since moving back, Tim has founded several businesses, as well\nas a nonprofit that helps people of color start and grow their own businesses.\nEntrepreneurship and Small Business Development\nAs with Tim and his clients, entrepreneurship opportunities can motivate residents\nwho have left rural communities to return home--or to keep them from moving away in\nthe first place. Business ownership represents an important source of income and wealth\nfor both owners and their employees. Recognizing this fact, successful communities find\nways to help residents turn what they know and do best, including skills they may have\ngained from industries in decline, into profitable small businesses.10 One example of a\ncommunity taking this approach is Clarksdale, Mississippi.\nAbout 10 years ago, civic and business leaders assessed what made Clarksdale\nspecial and how those characteristics could help the community thrive. Since Clarksdale\ncalls itself “Home of the Blues,” attracting tourists using the local Blues culture seemed\npromising. Over the years, Clarksdale has created new jobs by investing to improve its\ndowntown, and has supported local businesses that cater to tourists interested in the\ncommunity’s musical heritage.\nThis growth is also creating new businesses not directly related to tourism--\nbusinesses such as Urgent and Primary Care of Clarksdale. Dr. Mary Williams opened\nher urgent care facility last spring, partly in response to the closure of nearby Quitman\n10 Such support systems generally include consistent and easily accessible ways for potential business\nowners to find the advice, financing, and education they need to be successful. See Federal Reserve Bank\nof Kansas City (2015), Grow Your Own: Entrepreneurship-Based Economic Development for Local\nCommunities (Kansas City, Mo.: FRB Kansas City),\nhttps://www.kansascityfed.org/~/media/files/publicat/community/gyo/entrepreneurship-econ-dev-local-\ncommunities.pdf.\n\n- 6 -\nCounty Hospital. Dr. Williams worked with local organizations to develop a business\nplan and obtain the financing needed to open a business that is critical to the community.\nDeWitt, Arkansas, is another rural community where entrepreneurship is sparking\na local revival. DeWitt is a town of about 3,000 people. Like Itta Bena and many small\ntowns, it has seen a steady decline in population over the past few decades. The economy\nthere is a mix of manufacturing and agriculture, and many families have farmed the land\nfor generations, such as the family of Tami and Troy Hornbeck.\nThe Hornbecks grew up in DeWitt, starting and eventually selling a successful\nbusiness built on a new soybean varietal that grows well in the South. More recently,\nthey have been helping lead a new industry in their community using waste vegetable oil\nfrom local restaurants and oil pressed from camelina, a crop farmers are beginning to\ngrow locally. This cooperative effort involves a partnership between a community\ncollege, a university, the local government, farmers and restaurants, and a Community\nDevelopment Financial Institution, or CDFI, among others.11 While still in the early\nstages, it has led to the creation of several new businesses and imbued the town with a\nnew sense of what is possible.\nEntrepreneurs such as the Hornbecks and Dr. Williams need support to succeed,\nthe kind of support HBCUs and other institutions of higher education have long provided.\nMVSU itself is supporting rural minority entrepreneurs through its participation in the\nHBCU Entrepreneurial Ecosystem Initiative, which teaches students how to start and\ngrow a business.\n11 CDFI Certification is a designation given by the CDFI Fund of the U.S. Department of the Treasury to\nspecialized organizations that provide financial services in low-income communities and to people who\nlack access to financing. CDFIs include regulated institutions, such as community development banks and\ncredit unions, and nonregulated institutions, like loan and venture capital funds.\n\n- 7 -\nBut inspiring stories like these are not as common as they could be.\nEntrepreneurship has the potential to play a greater role in poor rural areas, particularly in\nareas whose residents are predominantly black and other people of color. Recent surveys\nhave found relatively high levels of interest in owning businesses among young people of\ncolor.12 Indeed, nationwide, black women represent one of the fastest growing groups of\nentrepreneurs.13 Yet research by the Federal Reserve suggests people of color experience\ngreater challenges in gaining access to credit to start or expand businesses, which leads\nme to my last topic and the focus of this forum: access to financial services.14\nAccess to Financial Services\nAccess to safe and affordable financial services is vital, especially among families\nwith limited wealth--whether they are looking to invest in education, start a business, or\nsimply manage the ups and downs of life. Family income and savings represent the\nlargest source of funding for students’ education. However, more than half of students or\ntheir families also borrow to finance their studies. And racial wealth disparities make\nblack students more likely than white students to borrow for their education.15 Similarly,\n12 See FRB Kansas City, Grow Your Own, in note 10.\n13 See Walker’s Legacy (2016), Black Women Entrepreneurs: Past and Present Conditions of Black\nWomen’s Business Ownership (Washington: Walker’s Legacy, October),\nhttps://www.walkerslegacy.com/new-report-highlights-struggles-faced-by-black-women-entrepreneurs-\noffers-roadmap-for-solving-toughest-issues.\n14 Alicia Robb, Mels de Zeeuw, and Brett Barkley (2018), “Mind the Gap: How Do Credit Market\nExperiences and Borrowing Patterns Differ for Minority-Owned Firms?” Community and Economic\nDevelopment Discussion Paper 03-18 (Atlanta: Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, September),\nhttps://www.frbatlanta.org/community-development/publications/discussion-papers/2018/03-mind-the-gap-\nfinancing-minority-owned-firms-2018-09-14.\n15 Judith Scott-Clayton and Jing Li (2016), “Black-White Disparity in Student Loan Debt More Than\nTriples after Graduation,” Evidence Speaks Reports, vol. 2 (3) (Washington: Brookings Institution,\nOctober), https://www.brookings.edu/research/black-white-disparity-in-student-loan-debt-more-than-\ntriples-after-graduation.\nSee, for example, See, for example, Robert Kelchen (2015), “Financial Need and Aid Volatility among\nStudents with Zero Expected Family Contribution,” Journal of Student Financial Aid, vol. 44 (January),\npp. 179-201, http://publications.nasfaa.org/jsfa/vol44/iss3/2; and Fenaba R.

Banks\noften consider credit scores when evaluating loan requests, however, and high-poverty\nregions tend to have a larger percentage of people with no established credit rating or a\nlow credit score. This combination of low wealth and low credit scores limits access to\ncredit or causes borrowers to turn to higher-cost credit.\nFortunately, CDFIs are helping potential borrowers improve their\ncreditworthiness and providing them with safe and affordable credit. While CDFIs fill a\ncritical gap in some communities, most consumers use other banks and credit unions. In\nrural areas, this often means a community bank.16 Industry consolidation has led to a\nlong-term decline in the number of community banks. While most rural communities\ncontinue to be relatively well served, that is less often the case in communities with high-\npoverty rates.17\nIn 2018, Federal Reserve staff members met with leaders in rural areas across the\ncountry that had recently experienced a bank branch closure.

At the Fed, we have renewed our efforts\nto avoid unnecessary regulatory burden on community banks, which provide essential\ncredit in their local communities.\nAnother means to address the issue of branch closures is the Community\nReinvestment Act, or CRA, which encourages banks to help meet the credit needs of the\ncommunities they are chartered to serve. The CRA has been an important tool for\nstrengthening local communities. The trend toward fewer branches and increased use of\ntechnology to deliver financial services presents a particular challenge to our current\napproach to CRA evaluations. Specifically, the current regulations use a bank’s branches\nto define its assessment area, the area for which it is evaluated for CRA purposes. To the\nextent that banks serve much broader areas using online or other non-branch delivery\nsystems, or have so many assessment areas that examiners cannot do a thorough\nevaluation in each, the financial needs of many rural communities may be overlooked.\n18 These findings are broadly consistent with the literature, which identifies adverse effects of branch\nclosures for small business borrowers, in particular, as well as for low-income communities.

They need support for their aspirations to own their own businesses.\nAnd they need access to safe and affordable credit.\nI will conclude where I began, by applauding both MVSU and Hope for their\nlong-standing contribution toward bettering the lives of the people of Itta Bena and\nsimilar rural communities.\n19 See Lael Brainard (2018), “Keeping Community at the Heart of the Community Reinvestment Act,”\nspeech delivered at the Association of Neighborhood and Housing Development Eighth Annual\nCommunity Development Conference, New York, May 18,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20180518a.htm.",

Powell\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nHutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy\nThe Brookings Institution\nWashington, D.C.\nApril 9, 2020\n\nGood morning. The challenge we face today is different in scope and character\nfrom those we have faced before. The coronavirus has spread quickly around the world,\nleaving a tragic and growing toll of illness and lost lives. This is first and foremost a\npublic health crisis, and the most important response is coming from those on the front\nlines in hospitals, emergency services, and care facilities. We watch in collective awe\nand gratitude as these dedicated individuals put themselves at risk in service to others and\nto our nation.\nLike other countries, we are taking forceful measures to control the spread of the\nvirus. Businesses have shuttered, workers are staying home, and we have suspended\nmany basic social interactions. People have been asked to put their lives and livelihoods\non hold, at significant economic and personal cost. We are moving with alarming speed\nfrom 50-year lows in unemployment to what will likely be very high, although\ntemporary, levels.\nAll of us are affected, but the burdens are falling most heavily on those least able\nto carry them. It is worth remembering that the measures we are taking to contain the\nvirus represent an essential investment in our individual and collective health. As a\nsociety, we should do everything we can to provide relief to those who are suffering for\nthe public good.\nThe recently passed Cares Act is an important step in honoring that commitment,\nproviding $2.2 trillion in relief to those who have lost their jobs, to low- and middle-\nincome households, to employers of all sizes, to hospitals and health-care providers, and\nto state and local governments. And there are reports of additional legislation in the\nworks. The critical task of delivering financial support directly to those most affected\n\n- 2 -\nfalls to elected officials, who use their powers of taxation and spending to make decisions\nabout where we, as a society, should direct our collective resources.\nThe Fed can also contribute in important ways: by providing a measure of relief\nand stability during this period of constrained economic activity, and by using our tools\nto ensure that the eventual recovery is as vigorous as possible.\nTo those ends, we have lowered interest rates to near zero in order to bring down\nborrowing costs. We have also committed to keeping rates at this low level until we are\nconfident that the economy has weathered the storm and is on track to achieve our\nmaximum-employment and price-stability goals.\nEven more importantly, we have acted to safeguard financial markets in order to\nprovide stability to the financial system and support the flow of credit in the economy.\nAs a result of the economic dislocations caused by the virus, some essential financial\nmarkets had begun to sink into dysfunction, and many channels that households,\nbusinesses, and state and local governments rely on for credit had simply stopped\nworking. We acted forcefully to get our markets working again, and, as a result, market\nconditions have generally improved.\nMany of the programs we are undertaking to support the flow of credit rely on\nemergency lending powers that are available only in very unusual circumstances—such\nas those we find ourselves in today—and only with the consent of the Secretary of the\nTreasury. We are deploying these lending powers to an unprecedented extent, enabled in\nlarge part by the financial backing from Congress and the Treasury. We will continue to\nuse these powers forcefully, proactively, and aggressively until we are confident that we\nare solidly on the road to recovery.\n\n- 3 -\nI would stress that these are lending powers, not spending powers. The Fed is not\nauthorized to grant money to particular beneficiaries. The Fed can only make secured\nloans to solvent entities with the expectation that the loans will be fully repaid. In the\nsituation we face today, many borrowers will benefit from these programs, as will the\noverall economy. But there will also be entities of various kinds that need direct fiscal\nsupport rather than a loan they would struggle to repay.\nOur emergency measures are reserved for truly rare circumstances, such as those\nwe face today. When the economy is well on its way back to recovery, and private\nmarkets and institutions are once again able to perform their vital functions of channeling\ncredit and supporting economic growth, we will put these emergency tools away.\nNone of us has the luxury of choosing our challenges; fate and history provide\nthem for us. Our job is to meet the tests we are presented. At the Fed, we are doing all\nwe can to help shepherd the economy through this difficult time. When the spread of the\nvirus is under control, businesses will reopen, and people will come back to work. There\nis every reason to believe that the economic rebound, when it comes, can be robust. We\nentered this turbulent period on a strong economic footing, and that should help support\nthe recovery. In the meantime, we are using our tools to help build a bridge from the\nsolid economic foundation on which we entered this crisis to a position of regained\neconomic strength on the other side.\nI want to close by thanking the millions on the front lines: those working in\nhealth care, sanitation, transportation, grocery stores, warehouses, deliveries, security—\nincluding our own team at the Federal Reserve—and countless others. Day after day, you\n\n- 4 -\nhave put yourselves in harm’s way for others: to care for us, to ensure we have access to\nthe things we need, and to help us through this difficult time.",

Powell\nChairman\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Changing Market Structure and Implications for Monetary Policy,” a symposium\nsponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\nJackson Hole, Wyoming\nAugust 24, 2018\n\nThank you for the opportunity to speak here today. Fifteen years ago, during the\nperiod now referred to as the Great Moderation, the topic of this symposium was\n“Adapting to a Changing Economy.” In opening the proceedings, then-Chairman Alan\nGreenspan famously declared that “uncertainty is not just an important feature of the\nmonetary policy landscape; it is the defining characteristic of that landscape.”1 On the\ndoorstep of the period now referred to as the Global Financial Crisis, surely few, if any,\nat that symposium would have imagined how shockingly different the next 15 years\nwould be from the 15 years that preceded it.\nOver the course of a long recovery, the U.S. economy has strengthened\nsubstantially. The unemployment rate has declined steadily for almost nine years and, at\n3.9 percent, is now near a 20-year low. Most people who want jobs can find\nthem. Inflation has moved up and is now near the Federal Open Market Committee’s\n(FOMC) objective of 2 percent after running generally below that level for six\nyears. With solid household and business confidence, healthy levels of job creation,\nrising incomes, and fiscal stimulus arriving, there is good reason to expect that this strong\nperformance will continue.\nAs the economy has strengthened, the FOMC has gradually raised the federal\nfunds rate from its crisis-era low near zero toward more normal levels. We are also\nallowing our securities holdings--assets acquired to support the economy during the deep\nrecession and the long recovery--to decline gradually as these securities are paid off. I\nwill explain today why the Committee’s consensus view is that this gradual process of\nnormalization remains appropriate. As always, there are risk factors abroad and at home\n1 See Greenspan (2003), p. 1.\n\n- 2 -\nthat, in time, could demand a different policy response, but today I will step back from\nthese.\nIn keeping with the spirit of this year’s symposium topic--the changing structures\nof the economy--I would also note briefly that the U.S. economy faces a number of\nlonger-term structural challenges that are mostly beyond the reach of monetary\npolicy. For example, real wages, particularly for medium- and low-income workers, have\ngrown quite slowly in recent decades. Economic mobility in the United States has\ndeclined and is now lower than in most other advanced economies.2 Addressing the\nfederal budget deficit, which has long been on an unsustainable path, becomes\nincreasingly important as a larger share of the population retires. Finally, it is difficult to\nsay when or whether the economy will break out of its low-productivity mode of the past\ndecade or more, as it must if incomes are to rise meaningfully over time.\nMy FOMC colleagues and I believe that we can best support progress on these\nlonger-term issues by pursuing the Federal Reserve’s mandate and supporting continued\neconomic growth, a strong labor market, and inflation near 2 percent. The topic of\nmanaging uncertainty in policymaking remains particularly salient. I will focus today on\none of the many facets of uncertainty discussed at the 2003 symposium--uncertainty\naround the location of important macroeconomic variables such as the natural rate of\nunemployment. A good place to start is with two opposing questions that regularly arise\nin discussions of monetary policy both inside and outside the Fed:\n2 See Chetty and others (2014) and Chetty and others (2017).\n\n- 3 -\n1. With the unemployment rate well below estimates of its longer-term normal\nlevel, why isn’t the FOMC tightening monetary policy more sharply to head off\noverheating and inflation?\n2. With no clear sign of an inflation problem, why is the FOMC tightening policy\nat all, at the risk of choking off job growth and continued expansion?\nThese questions strike me as representing the two errors that the Committee is\nalways seeking to avoid as expansions continue--moving too fast and needlessly\nshortening the expansion, versus moving too slowly and risking a destabilizing\noverheating. As I will discuss, the job of avoiding these errors is made challenging today\nbecause the economy has been changing in ways that are difficult to detect and measure\nin real time. I will first lay out a standard view of a handful of basic relationships that are\nthought to reflect key aspects of the underlying structure of the economy. I will then use\nthat framework to explain the role that structural change plays in our current policy\ndeliberations, focusing on how that role has been shaped by two historical episodes.\nConventional Views of Macroeconomic Structure\nIn conventional models of the economy, major economic quantities such as\ninflation, unemployment, and the growth rate of gross domestic product (GDP) fluctuate\naround values that are considered “normal,” or “natural,” or “desired.” The FOMC has\nchosen a 2 percent inflation objective as one of these desired values. The other values are\nnot directly observed, nor can they be chosen by anyone. Instead, these values result\nfrom myriad interactions throughout the economy. In the FOMC’s quarterly Summary of\nEconomic Projections (SEP), participants state their individual views on the longer-run\n\n- 4 -\nnormal values for the growth rate of GDP, the unemployment rate, and the federal funds\nrate.\nThese fundamental structural features of the economy are also known by more\nfamiliar names such as the “natural rate of unemployment” and “potential output\ngrowth.” The longer-run federal funds rate minus long-run inflation is the “neutral real\ninterest rate.” At the Fed and elsewhere, analysts talk about these values so often that\nthey have acquired shorthand names. For example, u* (pronounced “u star”) is the\nnatural rate of unemployment, r* (“r star”) is the neutral real rate of interest, and π* (“pi\nstar”) is the inflation objective. According to the conventional thinking, policymakers\nshould navigate by these stars.3 In that sense, they are very much akin to celestial stars.\nFor example, the famous Taylor rule calls for setting the federal funds rate based\non where inflation and unemployment stand in relation to the stars.4 If inflation is higher\nthan π*, raise the real federal funds rate relative to r*. The higher real interest rate will,\nthrough various channels, tend to moderate spending by businesses and households,\nwhich will reduce upward pressure on prices and wages as the economy cools off. In\ncontrast, if the unemployment rate is above u*, lower the real federal funds rate relative\nto r*, which will stimulate spending and raise employment.\nNavigating by the stars can sound straightforward. Guiding policy by the stars in\npractice, however, has been quite challenging of late because our best assessments of the\nlocation of the stars have been changing significantly.\n3 In this talk, I will sidestep the issue of navigating by short-run versus long-run versions of the stars. The\nchallenges that I will highlight are, in my view, made more difficult, and the case for a careful risk-\nmanagement approach made stronger, by the need to consider both short-run and long-run versions of the\nstars.\n4 The original Taylor rule (Taylor, 1993) uses output relative to potential in place of unemployment relative\nto its natural rate. Both forms are now known as Taylor rules.\n\n- 5 -\nShifting Stars during Normalization\nIn December 2013, the FOMC began winding down the final crisis-era asset\npurchase program. Asset purchases declined to zero over 2014, and in December 2015,\nthe FOMC began the gradual normalization of interest rates that continues to this day. As\nnormalization has proceeded, FOMC participants and many other private- and public-\nsector analysts regularly adjusted their assessments of the stars (figure 1). Many\nprojections of the natural rate of unemployment fell roughly 1 full percentage point, as\ndid assessments of the neutral interest rate. Estimates of the potential growth rate of GDP\nslipped about 1/2 percentage point.\nThese changing assessments have big implications. For example, the 1\npercentage point fall in the neutral interest rate implies that the federal funds rate was\nconsiderably closer to its longer-run normal and, hence, that policy was less\naccommodative than thought at the beginning of normalization. The 1 percentage point\nfall in the natural rate of unemployment implies at present that about 1.6 million more\npeople would have jobs when unemployment is at its longer-run level. These shifts in the\nstars generally reflect analysts’ attempts to square their estimates with arriving\nmacroeconomic data. For example, as the unemployment rate fell toward, and then\nbelow, estimates of its natural rate, many expected inflation to move up. When inflation\ninstead moved sideways, a reasonable inference was that the natural rate was lower than\npreviously thought. Further, over this period, GDP growth was slower than one might\nhave expected based on the rapid decline in unemployment and the well-known\nrelationship between output and unemployment known as Okun’s law. Put another way,\nlabor productivity growth consistently disappointed, which raised the question of whether\n\n- 6 -\nthat shortfall was temporary--perhaps due to headwinds from the crisis--or was part of a\nnew normal.\nThese assessments of the values of the stars are imprecise and subject to further\nrevision. To return to the nautical metaphor, the FOMC has been navigating between the\nshoals of overheating and premature tightening with only a hazy view of what seem to be\nshifting navigational guides. Our approach to this challenge has been shaped by two\nmuch discussed historical episodes--the Great Inflation of the 1960s and 1970s and the\n“new economy” period of the late 1990s.\nShifting Stars and the Great Inflation\nWhile the crisis and its aftermath have been extraordinary in many ways, the\nshifting of the stars is not one of them. Figure 2 illustrates the Congressional Budget\nOffice’s (CBO) current estimate of movements in the natural rate of unemployment and\npotential GDP growth from 1960 to 2000.5 Viewed against the ups and downs observed\nover these four decades, the recent shifts in longer-run values are not all that dramatic.\nOf course, these CBO estimates benefit from many years of hindsight, whereas monetary\npolicy must be based on assessments made in real time. The Great Inflation period\nvividly illustrates the difficulties this difference raises.\nAround 1965, the United States entered a period of high and volatile inflation that\nended with inflation in double digits in the early 1980s. Multiple factors, including\nmonetary policy errors, contributed to the Great Inflation. Many researchers have\nconcluded that a key mistake was that monetary policymakers placed too much emphasis\n5 I am using the CBO’s estimates to reflect a conventional view over that time span since the SEP longer-\nrun values have only been reported since 2009.\n\n- 7 -\non imprecise--and, as it turns out, overly optimistic--real-time estimates of the natural\nrate of unemployment.6\nFigure 3 compares the CBO’s current view of the natural rate of unemployment in\nthat era with an estimate by Athanasios Orphanides and John Williams of the rate as\npolicymakers perceived it in real time. From 1965 to the early 1980s, this real-time\nestimate of u* was well below where hindsight now places it. The unemployment rate\nover this period was generally well above the real-time natural rate, and contemporary\ndocuments reveal that policymakers were wary of pushing the unemployment rate even\nfurther above u* (figure 4, top panel).7 With the benefit of hindsight, we now think that,\nexcept for a few years in the mid-1970s, the labor market was tight and contributing to\ninflation’s rise (figure 4, lower panel).\nIt is now clear that the FOMC had placed too much emphasis on its imprecise\nestimates of u* and too little emphasis on evidence of rising inflation expectations. The\nGreat Inflation did, however, prompt an “expectations revolution” in macroeconomic\nthinking, with one overwhelmingly important lesson for monetary policymakers:\nAnchoring longer-term inflation expectations is a vital precondition for reaching all other\nmonetary policy goals.8\nWhen longer-term inflation expectations are anchored, unanticipated\ndevelopments may push inflation up or down, but people expect that inflation will return\nfairly promptly to the desired value. This is the key insight at the heart of the widespread\n6 See, for example, Burns (1979), Orphanides and Williams (2013), and the sources therein. Romer and\nRomer (2002) and Sargent (2002) debate additional factors that may have played a role. There is no\ndispute, however, that policymakers did misperceive the natural unemployment rate, and Orphanides and\nWilliams show that misperception of the natural rate of unemployment alone would have been sufficient on\nits own to generate outcomes like the Great Inflation.\n7 See the discussion in note 6.\n8 Many central bankers have made this case; see, for example, Bernanke (2007) and Yellen (2015).\n\n- 8 -\nadoption of inflation targeting by central banks in the wake of the Great Inflation.\nAnchored expectations give a central bank greater flexibility to stabilize both\nunemployment and inflation. When a central bank acts to stimulate the economy to bring\ndown unemployment, inflation might push above the bank’s inflation target. With\nexpectations anchored, people expect the central bank to pursue policies that bring\ninflation back down, and longer-term inflation expectations do not rise. Thus, policy can\nbe a bit more accommodative than if policymakers had to offset a rise in longer-term\nexpectations.\nShifting Stars and the “New Economy” of the Late 1990s\nThe second half of the 1990s confronted policymakers with a situation that was in\nsome ways the flipside of that in the Great Inflation. In mid-1996, the unemployment\nrate was below the natural rate as perceived in real time, and many FOMC participants\nand others were forecasting growth above the economy’s potential. Sentiment was\nbuilding on the FOMC to raise the federal funds rate to head off the risk of rising\ninflation.9 But Chairman Greenspan had a hunch that the United States was experiencing\nthe wonders of a “new economy” in which improved productivity growth would allow\nfaster output growth and lower unemployment, without serious inflation risks.\nGreenspan argued that the FOMC should hold off on rate increases.\nOver the next two years, thanks to his considerable fortitude, Greenspan\nprevailed, and the FOMC raised the federal funds rate only once from mid-1996 through\n9 This account is drawn from several accounts of the period: Blinder and Yellen (2001), Blinder and Reis\n(2005), Meyer (1996), Meyer (2004), and the Federal Reserve’s Bluebook documents from June 1996\nthrough December 1998 (Board of Governors, various years).\n\n- 9 -\nlate 1998.10 Starting in 1996, the economy boomed and the unemployment rate fell, but,\ncontrary to conventional wisdom at the time, inflation fell.11\nOnce again, shifting stars help explain the performance of inflation, which many\nhad seen as a puzzle. Whereas during the Great Inflation period the real-time natural rate\nof unemployment had been well below our current-day assessment, in the new-economy\nperiod, this relation was reversed (figure 3). The labor market looked to be tight and\ngetting tighter in real time, but in retrospect, we estimate that there was slack in the labor\nmarket in 1996 and early 1997, and the labor market only tightened appreciably through\n1998 (figure 4). Greenspan was also right that the potential growth rate had shifted up.\nWith hindsight, we recognize today that higher potential growth could accommodate the\nvery strong growth that actually materialized, let alone the moderate growth\npolicymakers were forecasting.12\nThe FOMC thus avoided the Great-Inflation-era mistake of overemphasizing\nimprecise estimates of the stars. Under Chairman Greenspan’s leadership, the Committee\nconverged on a risk-management strategy that can be distilled into a simple request:\nLet’s wait one more meeting; if there are clearer signs of inflation, we will commence\ntightening.13 Meeting after meeting, the Committee held off on rate increases while\n10 In the second half of 1998, a Russian debt default and other ongoing financial instability in Asia\nintervened, and the FOMC rapidly lowered the federal funds rate 3/4 percentage point.\n11 By current data, over the eight quarters starting in 1996:Q3, core PCE (personal consumption\nexpenditures) inflation fell from 1.8 percent to 1.3 percent.\n12 During this period, FOMC participants submitted six-quarter forecasts each July as part of the Fed’s\nsemiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress. Each July from 1996 through 1998, the FOMC\nforecast growth very close to or above the real-time estimates of potential growth. The forecast growth is\nwell below current estimates of potential output growth. For the forecasts, see Board of Governors (1996,\n1997, 1998).\n13 For a more complete discussion of the greatly distilled account here, see the sources in note 9.\n\n- 10 -\nbelieving that signs of rising inflation would soon appear. And meeting after meeting,\ninflation gradually declined.\nIn retrospect, it may seem odd that it took great fortitude to defend “let’s wait one\nmore meeting,” given that inflation was low and falling. Conventional wisdom at the\ntime, however, still urged policymakers to respond preemptively to inflation risk--even\nwhen that risk was gleaned mainly from hazy, real-time assessments of the stars. With\nthe experience in the new-economy period, policymakers were beginning to appreciate\nthat, with inflation expectations much better anchored than before, there was a smaller\nrisk that an inflation uptick under Greenspan’s “wait and see” approach would become a\nsignificant problem.\nRisk Management in the Face of Shifting Stars\nGiven what the economy has shown us over the past 15 years, the need for the\nsort of risk-management approach that originated in the new-economy era is clearer than\never before. That approach continues to evolve based on experience and the growing\nliterature on monetary policy and structural uncertainty.\nExperience has revealed two realities about the relation between inflation and\nunemployment, and these bear directly on the two questions I started with. First, the stars\nare sometimes far from where we perceive them to be. In particular, we now know that\nthe level of the unemployment rate relative to our real-time estimate of u* will sometimes\nbe a misleading indicator of the state of the economy or of future inflation. Second, the\nreverse also seems to be true: Inflation may no longer be the first or best indicator of a\ntight labor market and rising pressures on resource utilization. Part of the reason inflation\nsends a weaker signal is undoubtedly the achievement of anchored inflation expectations\n\n- 11 -\nand the related flattening of the Phillips curve.14 Whatever the cause, in the run-up to the\npast two recessions, destabilizing excesses appeared mainly in financial markets rather\nthan in inflation. Thus, risk management suggests looking beyond inflation for signs of\nexcesses.\nThese two realities present challenges. The literature on uncertainty reviewed at\nthe 2003 symposium--and much refined since then--provides important advice for how\npolicy should respond, although not yet, in my view, an explicit recipe or rule that a\nprudent central bank should follow.15 The literature on robust rules, such as so-called\ndifference rules, for example, supports the idea of putting less emphasis on the level of\nunemployment relative to u*.16 The FOMC’s practice of looking at a broad range of\nindicators when assessing the state of the labor market has explicitly been part of the\nFOMC’s Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy since its\ninception in 2012.17 We have greatly expanded the scope of our surveillance for signs of\nlabor market tightness and of destabilizing excesses more generally.\nThe risks from misperceiving the stars also now play a prominent role in the\nFOMC’s deliberations. A paper by Federal Reserve Board staff is a recent example of a\nrange of research that helps FOMC participants visualize and manage these risks.18 The\nresearch reports simulations of the economic outcomes that might result under various\n14 Kiley (2015) reviews the literature on this point.\n15 The literature was reviewed by Walsh at the 2003 symposium; see Walsh (2003). Also from the same\nsymposium, see, for example, Greenspan (2003), Feldstein (2003), Fischer (2003), and Yellen (2003). For\na more recent perspective, see Wilkins (2017).\n16 See Taylor and Williams (2011). Note that the robust rules literature does not suggest ignoring the\ngeneral notion of labor market tightness or of resource utilization more generally. Indeed, robust rules\noften reflect tightness through the change in the unemployment rate. Instead, the issue is about how best to\ntake account of labor market tightness when the best estimates of u* are very imprecise. See also Erceg\nand others (2018).\n17 See Board of Governors (2018).\n18 See Erceg and others (2018).\n\n- 12 -\npolicy rules and policymaker misperceptions about the economy. One general finding is\nthat no single, simple approach to monetary policy is likely to be appropriate across a\nbroad range of plausible scenarios.19 More concretely, simulations like these inform our\nrisk management by assessing the likelihood that misperception would lead to adverse\noutcomes, such as inflation falling below zero or rising above 5 percent.\nFinally, the literature on structural uncertainty suggests some broader insights.\nThis literature started with the work of William Brainard and the well-known Brainard\nprinciple, which recommends that when you are uncertain about the effects of your\nactions, you should move conservatively.20 In other words, when unsure of the potency\nof a medicine, start with a somewhat smaller dose. As Brainard made clear, this is not a\nuniversal truth, and recent research highlights two particularly important cases in which\ndoing too little comes with higher costs than doing too much. The first case is when\nattempting to avoid severely adverse events such as a financial crisis or an extended\nperiod with interest rates at the effective lower bound.21 In such situations, the famous\nwords “We will do whatever it takes” will likely be more effective than “We will take\ncautious steps toward doing whatever it takes.” The second case is when inflation\nexpectations threaten to become unanchored. If expectations were to begin to drift, the\nreality or expectation of a weak initial response could exacerbate the problem.22 I am\nconfident that the FOMC would resolutely “do whatever it takes” should inflation\nexpectations drift materially up or down or should crisis again threaten. In addition, a\n19 The paper illustrates that some standard intuitions do not hold up in all circumstances. When following a\nstandard Taylor rule and facing a very flat Phillips curve, for example, it is not always good advice to lower\nthe weight on the gap between unemployment and u* and to raise the weight on inflation in making policy.\nSee Erceg and others (2018).\n20 See Brainard (1967).\n21 See Reifschneider and Williams (2000).\n22 See Söderström (2002).\n\n- 13 -\ndecade of regulatory reforms and private-sector advances have greatly increased the\nstrength and resilience of the financial system, with the aim of reducing the likelihood\nthat the inevitable financial shocks will become crises.\nThe Current Situation\nLet me conclude by returning to the matter of navigating between the two risks I\nidentified--moving too fast and needlessly shortening the expansion, versus moving too\nslowly and risking a destabilizing overheating. Readers of the minutes of FOMC\nmeetings and other communications will know that our discussions focus keenly on the\nrelative salience of these risks. The diversity of views on the FOMC is one of the great\nvirtues of our system. Despite differing views on these questions and others, we have a\nlong institutional tradition of finding common ground in coalescing around a policy\nstance.\nI see the current path of gradually raising interest rates as the FOMC’s approach\nto taking seriously both of these risks. While the unemployment rate is below the\nCommittee’s estimate of the longer-run natural rate, estimates of this rate are quite\nuncertain. The same is true of estimates of the neutral interest rate. We therefore refer to\nmany indicators when judging the degree of slack in the economy or the degree of\naccommodation in the current policy stance. We are also aware that, over time, inflation\nhas become much less responsive to changes in resource utilization.\nWhile inflation has recently moved up near 2 percent, we have seen no clear sign\nof an acceleration above 2 percent, and there does not seem to be an elevated risk of\noverheating. This is good news, and we believe that this good news results in part from\nthe ongoing normalization process, which has moved the stance of policy gradually\n\n- 14 -\ncloser to the FOMC’s rough assessment of neutral as the expansion has continued. As\nthe most recent FOMC statement indicates, if the strong growth in income and jobs\ncontinues, further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will\nlikely be appropriate.\nThe economy is strong. Inflation is near our 2 percent objective, and most people\nwho want a job are finding one. My colleagues and I are carefully monitoring incoming\ndata, and we are setting policy to do what monetary policy can do to support continued\ngrowth, a strong labor market, and inflation near 2 percent.\n\n- 15 -\nReferences\nBernanke, Ben S.

Powell\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Conference\nThe Puzzle of Payments Security:\nFitting the Pieces Together to Protect the Retail Payments System\nKansas City, Missouri\nJune 25, 2015\n\nThank you for the opportunity to speak to you today. I especially want to thank\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City President Esther George for her leadership in the\ninitiative that has brought us all together here today to discuss improvements to the U.S.\npayments system. We have a diverse group of professionals participating in this\nconference, from industry, academia, and government. It takes all of us, working\ntogether, to maintain and enhance a safe and secure payment system.\nThe payment system touches our daily lives, whether it’s a consumer paying a\nbill, a company deciding to upgrade its point-of-sale terminals, a technology startup\ndeveloping a new peer-to-peer payment app, or the government issuing tax refunds.\nAmericans make more than 120 billion noncash payments each year.1 But it’s only when\nsomething goes wrong, like a data breach at a major retailer or bank, that the typical end\nuser takes notice of the payments process.\nAs the central bank of the United States, the Federal Reserve plays many roles in\nthe payment system, including payment system operator, supervisor of financial\ninstitutions and systemically important financial market utilities, regulator, researcher,\nand catalyst for improvement. Most of you are aware of our current efforts to improve\nthe speed, efficiency, and security of our payment system. I’d like to discuss that project\nfor a few minutes, and then talk about four things that we should all be doing to enhance\npayment security.\nFor some years, members of the public have told us with increasing frequency and\nintensity that they see the United States falling behind other nations in the speed and\n1 Federal Reserve System (2014), “The 2013 Federal Reserve Payments Study: Summary Report and Initial\nData Release,”\nwww.frbservices.org/files/communications/pdf/general/2013_fed_res_paymt_study_summary_rpt.pdf.\n\n- 2 -\nsecurity of our payment system. We hear all the time that the Federal Reserve should do\nsomething about this. But, despite our multiple roles, the Federal Reserve does not have\nbroad authority to simply restructure or redesign the payment system. So, two years ago,\nthe Fed published a consultation paper that sought public input on ways to make the U.S.\npayment system safer, more accessible, faster, and more efficient from end-to-end.2 As\nwe evaluated the substantial volume of public comment in response to the paper, the Fed\nalso conducted research; met with a wide set of stakeholders, including banks, merchants,\ntechnology companies, consumer organizations, and others; and worked to enhance our\nown payment services.\nBuilding on this work, we released a second paper earlier this year, entitled\n“Strategies for Improving the U.S. Payment System.”3 This paper synthesizes a range of\nviews and presents a multifaceted plan for collaborating with payment system\nstakeholders to enhance the speed, safety, and efficiency of the U.S. payment system.\nThe paper emphasizes the need for a secure payment system that has the public’s\nconfidence and that keeps pace with the rapidly evolving and expanding threat\nenvironment.\nTo facilitate cooperation among the many stakeholders, under the leadership of\nEsther George, we have established two task forces: one for faster payments and one for\npayment security. These task forces will work both independently and in concert. The\nsecurity experts on the secure payments task force will advise members of the faster\n2 See Federal Reserve Banks (2013), “Payment System Improvement—Public Consultation Paper,”\nfedpaymentsimprovement.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Payment_System_Improvement-\nPublic_Consultation_Paper.pdf.\n3 See Federal Reserve System (2015), “Strategies for Improving the U.S. Payment System,”\nfedpaymentsimprovement.org/wp-content/uploads/strategies-improving-us-payment-system.pdf.\n\n- 3 -\npayments task force as they identify effective approaches for implementing faster\npayment capabilities. The secure payments task force also will advise the Fed on\npayment security matters, and determine areas of focus and priorities for future action to\nadvance payment system safety, security, and resiliency.\nI am pleased to report that we are off to a great start in the months since the\n“Strategies for Improving the U.S. Payment System” paper was released. More than 300\nparticipants from a range of stakeholders signed up to be part of the faster payments task\nforce, and more than 200 joined the secure payments task force. These task forces have\nchosen, or are in the process of choosing, members to serve on their respective steering\ncommittees, which will help guide the task forces’ efforts.\nEarlier this month, the faster payments steering committee met to begin\ndeveloping timelines, processes, and criteria--including criteria related to security--that\nwill be used to evaluate potential approaches to improving the speed of the payment\nsystem. Last week, the full task force met to continue the work. I am told that they had a\ngreat meeting--everyone was interested, engaged, and eager to get to work. The secure\npayments task force conducted its first organizing call earlier this month and, in mid-July,\nits steering committee will meet for the first time. Momentum is growing. By the end of\nnext year, the plan is for the faster payments task force, with input from the secure\npayments task force, to have laid out its detailed thinking on the most effective\napproaches for implementing faster payments in the United States. Then, it will be up to\nthe industry to implement these approaches.\n\n- 4 -\nBut, before we reach the finish line, the task forces will have to wrestle with some\ntough issues related to payment security. I would now like to talk about building a safer\npayment system. I’ll start with two brief stories.\nFirst, let me take you back to the 1960s, when paper checks were the dominant\nnoncash payment method and were sent by plane or truck to be cleared. A man walks into\na bank with a payroll check. A teller cashes the check. A few days later, the man returns.\nThe teller recognizes him, and is happy to cash more checks. The checks are fraudulent,\nbut the teller doesn’t know that. The man knows that the string of numbers encoded on\nthe bottom of the check determine the geographic area where the check will be drawn. So\nhe creates a fake check with a routing number that will send that paper check across the\ncountry. Because the teller recognizes the man when he comes back, the teller feels\ncomfortable cashing the second round of checks because the first check has not yet been\nreturned. By the time the bank realizes the checks are fraudulent, the man is gone. Some\nof you will recognize that man as Frank Abagnale, former con artist and now a security\nconsultant.\nNow, fast-forward 50 years to 2013. A man walks up to an ATM with a prepaid\ndebit card. He types in a PIN and withdraws a large amount of cash. But it’s not just one\nman: there are many individuals doing the same thing at thousands of ATMs in dozens\nof countries. The cards are counterfeit, but no one has detected that yet. Over the course\nof ten hours, the individuals withdraw $40 million in cash. How does this happen?\nBefore the thieves walk up to the ATMs, hackers break into a payment processor’s\ndatabase, steal a small number of prepaid card account numbers, and raise the cards’\n\n- 5 -\nwithdrawal limits. They then distribute counterfeit cards to “cashing crews” around the\nworld who make the withdrawals.\nThese well-known payment fraud schemes were perpetrated in different eras, and\njuxtaposing them highlights how the payment security landscape has changed. Frank\nAbagnale relied on the slow speed of the paper check-clearing system and in-person\nsocial engineering. In contrast, the ATM thieves relied on rapid transmission of data to\nremotely steal account information and alter withdrawal limits, all without interacting\nwith bank employees. Today, fraud can be executed quickly, perpetrated on a massive\nscale, and carried out remotely.\nIn light of this new environment, I will suggest four things that all of us ought to\nbe doing with respect to payment security. Some are already being done. Too often,\nthough, such efforts are overlooked or inconsistently applied.\n1. Safe Innovation\nThis is an exciting time for the payment system. Technology companies are\ncreating new methods to pay with mobile phones and even wearable devices. Banks are\nbuilding faster payment capabilities into their deposit account systems. Banks, payment\ncard networks, and merchants are rolling out Europay, MasterCard, and Visa (EMV) chip\ncards and using compatible point-of-sale terminals. Many of the newest products in the\nmarket are impressive, incorporating new technologies like biometrics and tokenization.\nEnd users and the media have taken notice.\nHistory shows that we should embrace innovation. Technological innovation has\ncontinually pushed the payment system forward. Payment cards, both credit and debit,\nare an example. Thirty years ago, everyone carried cash. Today, young adults\n\n- 6 -\nincreasingly prefer to rely on cards and mobile phones. Payment cards have improved\nconvenience and security in certain ways, like reducing the impact of a stolen wallet.\nBut history has also shown that new technologies must be adopted in a prudent\nfashion. Technological innovations can provide substantial benefits to payment system\nefficiency and security in the long run, but they often introduce new, unanticipated risks.\nFor example, although payments cards reduced the impact of a stolen wallet, they’ve also\nintroduced new risks, like counterfeit card fraud. It is important that we identify and\naddress the unanticipated risks that inevitably result when we try new things. These risks\nmay be tolerable in the short run, so long as we work to identify, prevent, and mitigate\nthem early on in the design and implementation process. In the case of payment cards,\nover time, technologies have been broadly implemented to mitigate many of the risks.\nFor instance, computer algorithms now analyze transactions in real time and can prevent\nthe same card number from being used to make purchases in Washington, D.C. and in\nKansas City five minutes apart.\nWe also need to consider the complexity of the payment system. It is a vast\nnetwork with millions of endpoints and a wide variety of participants. Many innovators\ndo a good job of incorporating advanced security features into their individual products.\nBut new products also need to be securely integrated into the payment system as a whole.\nTo innovate safely, payment system participants must work together by\nparticipating in coordinated efforts to improve the payment system. At a minimum,\nbanks, merchants, and other institutions that process or store sensitive financial\ninformation need to keep their hardware and software current to the latest industry\nstandards. Network operators and standards-setting bodies play an important role by\n\n- 7 -\nidentifying these standards and coordinating their adoption among network participants.\nThe EMV rollout that is taking place right now is a good example.\nThe market should be the primary driver of change, and government should avoid\nstifling healthy innovation. But policymakers can play a role by actively listening to\nconcerns from the public regarding barriers or gaps in regulatory regimes that may create\ndisincentives for developing new, safe products. Policymakers can also bring industry\nparticipants together. The task forces that were created as part of the Fed’s payment\nsystem improvement effort bring together a wide range of payment system participants to\nsit at the drafting table to create a blueprint for a safer and more efficient payment\nsystem.\nComplacency is everyone’s enemy. Unfortunately, the firms involved in the\npayment system are not the only ones innovating: criminals have an ever-increasing\narsenal of cyberweapons at their disposal. That brings me to my second point.\n2. Prevention\nYou will be attacked. Criminals today are often motivated, intelligent, well-\norganized and well-funded. They also have varied interests: some seek financial gain,\nwhile others hope to disrupt our nation’s financial institutions and payment system. What\nshould we be doing to prepare? One clear area of focus needs to be on implementing\npreventive tools, or simply put, defensive tactics. You won’t survive the game if you\ndon’t play good defense.\nThe deployment of EMV chip cards in the United States represents an important\nstep forward. But we should not stop there. For many years, traditional authentication\nmethods like signatures and static passwords have been used to verify that an individual\n\n- 8 -\nis authorized to initiate a payment. New approaches to authentication increasingly offer\ngreater assurance and protection. Given the current technologies that we have at our\ndisposal, we should assess the continued use of signatures as a means of authenticating\ncard transactions.\nIt is important to layer security tools and procedures. Methods to devalue\npayment data, like tokenization and encryption for data at rest, in use, and in transit,\nmitigate the effect of a data breach. Analytics can identify and prevent fraudulent\ntransactions. Firewalls and segmentation of technology supporting critical functions can\nprotect networks from outside attacks.\nAlso, remember that people inside your organization and organizations that you\nwork with can pose a significant risk. One study found that more than 20 percent of\nsecurity incidents could be attributed to insiders.4 Segregation of duties, background\nchecks, and monitoring for anomalies help reduce the risk of insider threats. Strong\nvendor-management programs can reduce risks from an institution’s partners and service\nproviders.\n3. Planning\nAs crucial as they are, we should keep in mind that these prevention tools cannot\nstand alone. Even with stronger authentication methods, robust network security, and\nother approaches in place, preventive measures aren’t sufficient to manage security risks.\nSuch measures are designed to protect against known risks. But those looking to exploit\nthe system will continue to devise new methods of attack. In some of the recent high-\nprofile data breaches, companies have scrambled to deal with the aftermath. This brings\n4 Verizon (2015), “2015 Data Breach Investigations Report,” www.verizonenterprise.com/DBIR/2015.\n\n- 9 -\nme to my third point. We need a comprehensive way to think about planning. The\nNational Institute of Standards and Technology’s cybersecurity framework is one of\nmany voluntary cybersecurity frameworks that provide a holistic, risk-based approach to\nplanning.5 In addition to preventive measures, the framework identifies four additional\ncore functions: identify, detect, respond, and recover. We can apply these four functions\nto securing the payment system.\nAn important first step is to identify internal business processes and assets, as well\nas external threats. You can’t protect yourself unless you understand how your business\nis structured. This sounds simple enough, but an organization’s computer systems are\noften unexpectedly interconnected. Some of the largest point-of-sale data breaches, for\nexample, originate outside payment card systems.6 You should also keep up to date on\ncyber developments and gather information about threats from information sharing\nforums, including FS-ISAC, US-CERT, and the FBI’s InfraGard.\nRegardless of how well we identify and protect, we also need to plan for a\npotential attack. To address this, the NIST framework calls for plans to detect, respond,\nand recover. Victims are often not aware that they’ve been breached. Did you know that\nlast year the median amount of time it took to discover a breach was about 200 days?7\nPlans need to include methods to detect attacks. You also need to have a response plan.\nIf your point-of-sale system is compromised or your account records are stolen, do you\nknow which law enforcement agencies you should work with? You will be more\n5 See National Institute of Standards and Technology (2014), “Framework for Improving Critical\nInfrastructure Cybersecurity,” www.nist.gov/cyberframework/upload/cybersecurity-framework-\n021214.pdf.\n6 Verizon (2015), “2015 Data Breach Investigations Report,” www.verizonenterprise.com/DBIR/2015.\n7 Mandiant (2014), “M-Trends 2015: A View from the Front Lines,”\nwww2.fireeye.com/rs/fireye/images/rpt-m-trends-2015.pdf.\n\n- 10 -\neffective containing the impact if you have thought through the necessary responses\nbeforehand. Finally, you need to have plans in place to recover business functions. This\nmay include investments in new tools and approaches to aid in rapid recovery. I would\nalso advise that you participate in industry-led tabletop exercises to help you think\nthrough how to respond and recover from cybersecurity events.\n4. Education\nWe’ve talked a lot about fostering the security of the payment system, but we\nshould also talk about the public’s perceptions. Even if we have a comprehensive, well-\nimplemented security plan, one high-profile breach can shake public confidence.\nResearch suggests that the way consumers feel about a particular payment mechanism\naffects the way they choose to pay. For example, the Federal Reserve’s most recent\nreport on consumers’ use of mobile financial services notes that security concerns are a\nmain impediment to the adoption of mobile financial services.8 Education is a way to\nenhance both payment system security and public confidence.\nMy fourth point is that, collectively, we could do more to empower consumers to\nuse financial products safely by educating them on the risks they face and the steps they\ncan take to protect themselves. For example, financial institutions can provide and help\ncustomers understand online banking tools like credit card transaction alerts that can help\nconsumers spot or stop fraud. We also need to be prepared, to the extent possible, to\nrespond to a security incident in a transparent and timely manner so that consumers\nunderstand the implications of the event. Policymakers can also provide facts and data to\npaint a realistic picture of the threats that exist in the payment system. One example is\n8 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2015), “Consumers and Mobile Financial Services\n2015,” www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/consumers-and-mobile-financial-services-report-201503.pdf.\n\n- 11 -\nthe Federal Reserve’s triennial payments study, which presents statistics on fraud for the\nlargest retail payment systems that could be used by companies and the media when\nexplaining risks to consumers.9\nKnowledge is power. Education is critical to fostering the security of the payment\nsystem and, ultimately, to maintaining public confidence.\nConclusion\nThe things I’ve discussed today apply to all payment system participants. Each of\nus has an important role to play in building a safer payment system. Given the payment\nsystem’s complexity, it’s important to keep in mind that we all need to work together\nwhen we innovate, prevent, plan, and educate.\nI want to close by asking for your support. With our payment system\nimprovement effort in full swing, now is the perfect time for payment system participants\nto come together to build a safer and more efficient payment system. If you’ve joined\none of our task forces, I hope that you will maintain a high level of engagement. If you\nhaven’t, I encourage you to do so, or at least to follow their progress. We will continue\nto seek input and provide updates through live and virtual forums, surveys, industry- and\nFederal Reserve-sponsored groups and events, and online feedback mechanisms. Thank\nyou to the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City for organizing this conference and to all\nof you for participating.\n9 See Federal Reserve System (2014), “The 2013 Federal Reserve Payments Study: Detailed Report and\nUpdated Data Release,”\nwww.frbservices.org/files/communications/pdf/general/2013_fed_res_paymt_study_detailed_rpt.pdf.",

Powell\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat a\nFireside Chat at Spelman College\nAtlanta, Georgia\nDecember 1, 2023\n\nThank you, President Gayle, and thank you for the invitation to visit today. I am\nfortunate to have been accompanied from Washington by a very distinguished graduate\nof Spelman College, Class of 1986 and member of Delta Sigma Theta, my Federal\nReserve colleague Governor Lisa Cook. There is no greater testament to Spelman’s\nhistoric legacy than the achievements of outstanding women like Governor Cook. One\npart of that legacy is Spelman's tradition of promoting education in STEM (science,\ntechnology, engineering, and mathematics). Governor Cook’s research highlights the key\nrole of such education in preparing individuals to be inventors and innovators who can\ngenerate ideas that will add to our body of knowledge, increase productivity, and\ngenerate higher living standards.1 Her work is just one example of how Spelman women\ncontinue to make historic contributions in science, the arts, technology, medicine, and\nother fields.\nI look forward to our conversation, and I thought I might frame it by talking about\nthe Federal Reserve’s actions to promote a healthy economy, and how those actions relate\nto questions students in this audience may be asking about the future. For example, I am\nsure that students are wondering what kind of a job market and economy you will be\nentering when you complete your education.\nCongress assigned the Fed the dual mandate goals of maximum employment and\nprice stability. Both goals are essential aspects of a healthy economy. Congress also\ngave the Fed a precious grant of independence from direct political control to allow us to\n1 See, for example Lisa D. Cook, Janet Gerson, and Jennifer Kuan (2021), “Closing the Innovation Gap in\nPink and Black,” NBER Working Paper Series 29354 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic\nResearch, October), https://www.nber.org/papers/w29354; and Lisa D. Cook (2020), “Policies to Broaden\nParticipation in the Innovation Process,” Policy Proposal 2020-11 (Washington: Brookings Institution, The\nHamilton Project, August), https://www.hamiltonproject.org/assets/files/Cook_PP_LO_8.13.pdf.\n\n- 2 -\npursue those goals without consideration of political matters. Other major central banks\nin democratic societies have similar grants of independence, and this institutional\narrangement has a strong track record of producing better policy outcomes for the benefit\nof the public.\nTo begin with our maximum employment goal, I am glad to say that, by many\nmeasures, conditions in the labor market are very strong. A couple of years ago, as the\npandemic receded and the economy reopened, the number of job openings grew to\ngreatly exceed the supply of people available to work, leaving a widespread shortage of\nworkers. Today, labor market conditions remain very strong, and the economy is\nreturning to a better balance between the demand for and supply of workers. The pace at\nwhich the economy is creating new jobs remains strong, and has been slowing toward a\nmore sustainable level. That gradual slowing has come in part due to the efforts of the\nFed to slow the growth of the economy to help reduce inflation. After declining sharply\nduring the pandemic, the supply of workers has bounced back, as people have come back\ninto the labor force and as immigration has returned to pre-pandemic levels. Partly\nbecause of that labor force growth, the unemployment rate has edged up over the second\nhalf of the year, though it remains historically low at 3.9 percent. The increase in\nparticipation has been particularly strong among women in the prime working ages of 25\nto 54, which surged to an all-time high earlier this year, and which remains well above\npre-pandemic levels. Wage growth remains high but has been gradually moving toward\nlevels that would be more consistent with 2 percent price inflation over time, and real\nwages are growing again as inflation declines.\n\n- 3 -\nAs for price stability, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has a longer-\nrun goal of 2 percent inflation.2 After running below 2 percent for over a decade,\ninflation increased sharply in 2021, in the United States and in many other countries\naround the world. High inflation imposes a significant hardship on all households and is\nespecially painful for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food,\nhousing, and transportation. Beginning in early 2022, we reacted forcefully, raising our\npolicy interest rate and decreasing the size of our balance sheet to help slow the economy\nand bring down inflation. Inflation has declined to 3 percent over the 12 months ending\nin October, but after factoring out energy and food prices, which tend to be volatile, what\nwe call “core” inflation is still 3.5 percent, well above our 2 percent objective.\nOver the six months ending in October, core inflation ran at an annual rate of 2.5\npercent, and while the lower inflation readings of the past few months are welcome, that\nprogress must continue if we are to reach our 2 percent objective. High inflation initially\nemerged from a collision between very strong demand and pandemic-constrained supply.\nThe normalization of supply and demand conditions has played a critical role in the\ndisinflation so far, as has the substantial tightening of monetary policy and overall\nfinancial conditions over the past two years.3 The strong actions we have taken have\n2 The FOMC judges that inflation at the rate of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the price\nindex for personal consumption expenditures, is most consistent over the longer run with the Federal\nReserve’s statutory mandate. For additional information, see the Committee’s Statement on Longer-Run\nGoals and Monetary Policy Strategy, available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals.pdf.\n3 While the target range for the policy rate was not increased until March, the anticipated tapering and\ncessation of asset purchases, along with the signals sent in Committee communications, began tightening\nfinancial conditions during the fourth quarter of 2021. According to the Federal Reserve Board staff's\nindex measuring U.S. financial conditions through their effect on the outlook for growth, financial\nconditions went from providing a 1.7 percentage point boost to future real gross domestic product growth\nin October 2021 to creating a 0.9 percentage point drag in October 2023; updated data and a description of\nthe index is provided in Andrea Ajello, Michele Cavallo, Giovanni Favara, William B. Peterman, John W.\nSchindler IV, and Nitish R. Sinha (2023), \"A New Index to Measure U.S. Financial Conditions,\" FEDS\n\n- 4 -\nmoved our policy rate well into restrictive territory, meaning that tight monetary policy is\nputting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation. Monetary policy is\nthought to affect economic conditions with a lag, and the full effects of our tightening\nhave likely not yet been felt. The forcefulness of our response to inflation also helped\nmaintain the Fed’s hard-won credibility, ensuring that the public’s expectations of future\ninflation remain well-anchored. Having come so far so quickly, the FOMC is moving\nforward carefully, as the risks of under- and over-tightening are becoming more\nbalanced.4\nAs the demand- and supply-related effects of the pandemic continue to unwind,\nuncertainty about the outlook for the economy is unusually elevated. Like most\nforecasters, my colleagues and I anticipate that growth in spending and output will slow\nover the next year, as the effects of the pandemic and the reopening fade and as\nrestrictive monetary policy weighs on aggregate demand.5 The FOMC is strongly\ncommitted to bringing inflation down to 2 percent over time, and to keeping policy\nrestrictive until we are confident that inflation is on a path to that objective. It would be\npremature to conclude with confidence that we have achieved a sufficiently restrictive\nstance, or to speculate on when policy might ease. We are prepared to tighten policy\nfurther if it becomes appropriate to do so.\nNotes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, June 30),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/a-new-index-to-measure-us-financial-conditions-\n20230630.html.\n4 Beyond the uncertainty in the economic outlook, we face uncertainty about the precise level of monetary\npolicy restraint and the duration of the lags with which monetary tightening affects economic activity and\nespecially inflation; for further discussion see Jerome H. Powell (2023), “Inflation: Progress and the Path\nAhead,” speech delivered at “Structural Shifts in the Global Economy,” an economic policy symposium\nsponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Jackson Hole, Wyo., August 25,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20230825a.htm.\n5 For example, the November 2023 Blue Chip consensus forecast is for Q4-over-Q4 real GDP growth to\ndrop from 2.5 percent in 2023 to 0.8 percent in 2024.\n\n- 5 -\nWe are making decisions meeting by meeting, based on the totality of the\nincoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation,\nas well as the balance of risks.\nThat is an overview of what my colleagues and I at the Fed are trying to\naccomplish. The bottom line, if you are a student, is that we have made considerable\nprogress in reducing high inflation while maintaining a strong labor market, with a lot of\nopportunity for new graduates. The unemployment rate has risen a bit, but it is still very\nlow by historical standards, and by many measures it is a great time to start your career.\nYou will face challenging decisions soon about what professions to enter, and what\ncompanies and institutions to work for. Some of you will become entrepreneurs. You\nhave already made one really good decision, and that is coming to Spelman. Whatever\nopportunities and challenges emerge, education will continue to be a key to success.\nHigher education is an investment, and not just of money. You are investing your time\nand great effort to gain knowledge and skills that are preparing you for successful\ncareers. Your success will make for a stronger economy. For our part, at the Fed we are\ndoing our best to foster an economy that gives you the best opportunity to succeed. With\nthat, I will hand it back to you, President Gayle.",

Powell\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Labor Markets in Transition: Demographics, Productivity, and Macroeconomic Policy,”\nan economic symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\nJackson Hole, Wyoming\nAugust 22, 2025\n\nOver the course of this year, the U.S. economy has shown resilience in a context\nof sweeping changes in economic policy. In terms of the Fed’s dual-mandate goals, the\nlabor market remains near maximum employment, and inflation, though still somewhat\nelevated, has come down a great deal from its post-pandemic highs. At the same time,\nthe balance of risks appears to be shifting.\nIn my remarks today, I will first address the current economic situation and the\nnear-term outlook for monetary policy. I will then turn to the results of our second public\nreview of our monetary policy framework, as captured in the revised Statement on\nLonger-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy that we released today.\nCurrent Economic Conditions and Near-Term Outlook\nWhen I appeared at this podium one year ago, the economy was at an inflection\npoint. Our policy rate had stood at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent for more than a year. That\nrestrictive policy stance was appropriate to help bring down inflation and to foster a\nsustainable balance between aggregate demand and supply. Inflation had moved much\ncloser to our objective, and the labor market had cooled from its formerly overheated\nstate. Upside risks to inflation had diminished. But the unemployment rate had increased\nby almost a full percentage point, a development that historically has not occurred outside\nof recessions.1 Over the subsequent three Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)\nmeetings, we recalibrated our policy stance, setting the stage for the labor market to\nremain in balance near maximum employment over the past year (figure 1).\n1 For example, after the July 2024 employment report, the 3-month average of the unemployment rate had\nincreased more than 0.5 percentage point above its lowest value over the previous 12 months. For more\ninformation, see Claudia Sahm (2019), “Direct Stimulus Payments to Individuals,” in Heather Boushey,\nRyan Nunn, and Jay Shambaugh, eds., Recession Ready: Fiscal Policies to Stabilize the American\nEconomy (Washington: Hamilton Project and Washington Center for Equitable Growth, May), pp. 67–92,\nhttps://www.brookings.edu/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/05/AutomaticStabilizers_FullBook_web_20190508.pdf.\n\n- 2 -\nThis year, the economy has faced new challenges. Significantly higher tariffs\nacross our trading partners are remaking the global trading system. Tighter immigration\npolicy has led to an abrupt slowdown in labor force growth. Over the longer run, changes\nin tax, spending, and regulatory policies may also have important implications for\neconomic growth and productivity. There is significant uncertainty about where all of\nthese polices will eventually settle and what their lasting effects on the economy will be.\nChanges in trade and immigration policies are affecting both demand and supply.\nIn this environment, distinguishing cyclical developments from trend, or structural,\ndevelopments is difficult. This distinction is critical because monetary policy can work\nto stabilize cyclical fluctuations but can do little to alter structural changes.\nThe labor market is a case in point. The July employment report released earlier\nthis month showed that payroll job growth slowed to an average pace of only 35,000 per\nmonth over the past three months, down from 168,000 per month during 2024 (figure 2).2\nThis slowdown is much larger than assessed just a month ago, as the earlier figures for\nMay and June were revised down substantially.3 But it does not appear that the\nslowdown in job growth has opened up a large margin of slack in the labor market—an\noutcome we want to avoid. The unemployment rate, while edging up in July, stands at a\nhistorically low level of 4.2 percent and has been broadly stable over the past year. Other\nindicators of labor market conditions are also little changed or have softened only\n2 In early September, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will publish a preliminary estimate of benchmark\nrevisions to the level of nonfarm payrolls as of March 2025, based on data from the Quarterly Census of\nEmployment and Wages. Data available to date suggest that the level of nonfarm payrolls will be revised\ndown materially. The final benchmark revision will be incorporated into the monthly employment data in\nFebruary 2026.\n3 The total downward revision of 258,000 between May and June was spread across private-sector\nindustries as well as state and local government employment, particularly education, and reflected both\nadditional information from surveyed establishments and the re-estimation of seasonal factors.\n\n- 3 -\nmodestly, including quits, layoffs, the ratio of vacancies to unemployment, and nominal\nwage growth. Labor supply has softened in line with demand, sharply lowering the\n“breakeven” rate of job creation needed to hold the unemployment rate constant. Indeed,\nlabor force growth has slowed considerably this year with the sharp falloff in\nimmigration, and the labor force participation rate has edged down in recent months.\nOverall, while the labor market appears to be in balance, it is a curious kind of\nbalance that results from a marked slowing in both the supply of and demand for workers.\nThis unusual situation suggests that downside risks to employment are rising. And if\nthose risks materialize, they can do so quickly in the form of sharply higher layoffs and\nrising unemployment.\nAt the same time, GDP growth has slowed notably in the first half of this year to a\npace of 1.2 percent, roughly half the 2.5 percent pace in 2024 (figure 3). The decline in\ngrowth has largely reflected a slowdown in consumer spending. As with the labor\nmarket, some of the slowing in GDP likely reflects slower growth of supply or potential\noutput.\nTurning to inflation, higher tariffs have begun to push up prices in some\ncategories of goods. Estimates based on the latest available data indicate that total PCE\nprices rose 2.6 percent over the 12 months ending in July. Excluding the volatile food\nand energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.9 percent, above their level a year ago.\nWithin core, prices of goods increased 1.1 percent over the past 12 months, a notable\nshift from the modest decline seen over the course of 2024. In contrast, housing services\ninflation remains on a downward trend, and nonhousing services inflation is still running\n\n- 4 -\nat a level a bit above what has been historically consistent with 2 percent inflation (figure\n4).4\nThe effects of tariffs on consumer prices are now clearly visible. We expect those\neffects to accumulate over coming months, with high uncertainty about timing and\namounts. The question that matters for monetary policy is whether these price increases\nare likely to materially raise the risk of an ongoing inflation problem. A reasonable base\ncase is that the effects will be relatively short lived—a one-time shift in the price level.\nOf course, “one-time” does not mean “all at once.” It will continue to take time for tariff\nincreases to work their way through supply chains and distribution networks. Moreover,\ntariff rates continue to evolve, potentially prolonging the adjustment process.\nIt is also possible, however, that the upward pressure on prices from tariffs could\nspur a more lasting inflation dynamic, and that is a risk to be assessed and managed. One\npossibility is that workers, who see their real incomes decline because of higher prices,\ndemand and get higher wages from employers, setting off adverse wage–price dynamics.\nGiven that the labor market is not particularly tight and faces increasing downside risks,\nthat outcome does not seem likely.\nAnother possibility is that inflation expectations could move up, dragging actual\ninflation with them. Inflation has been above our target for more than four years and\nremains a prominent concern for households and businesses. Measures of longer-term\ninflation expectations, however, as reflected in market- and survey-based measures,\n4 Using the consumer price index and other information, an estimate of the contribution of housing services\nto 12-month core PCE inflation in July was 0.7 percentage point, while core services excluding housing\ncontributed 2.0 percentage points. The contribution from each of these categories remains slightly above\nits average during the 2002–07 period, during which core PCE inflation averaged about 2 percent. In\ncontrast, the contribution of core goods to 12-month core PCE inflation in July was about 0.25 percentage\npoint, compared with the 2002–07 average of −0.25 percentage point.\n\n- 5 -\nappear to remain well anchored and consistent with our longer-run inflation objective of\n2 percent.\nOf course, we cannot take the stability of inflation expectations for granted.\nCome what may, we will not allow a one-time increase in the price level to become an\nongoing inflation problem.\nPutting the pieces together, what are the implications for monetary policy? In the\nnear term, risks to inflation are tilted to the upside, and risks to employment to the\ndownside—a challenging situation. When our goals are in tension like this, our\nframework calls for us to balance both sides of our dual mandate. Our policy rate is now\n100 basis points closer to neutral than it was a year ago, and the stability of the\nunemployment rate and other labor market measures allows us to proceed carefully as we\nconsider changes to our policy stance. Nonetheless, with policy in restrictive territory,\nthe baseline outlook and the shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy\nstance.\nMonetary policy is not on a preset course. FOMC members will make these\ndecisions, based solely on their assessment of the data and its implications for the\neconomic outlook and the balance of risks. We will never deviate from that approach.\nEvolution of Monetary Policy Framework\nTurning to my second topic, our monetary policy framework is built on the\nunchanging foundation of our mandate from Congress to foster maximum employment\nand stable prices for the American people. We remain fully committed to fulfilling our\nstatutory mandate, and the revisions to our framework will support that mission across a\nbroad range of economic conditions. Our revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and\n\n- 6 -\nMonetary Policy Strategy, which we refer to as our consensus statement, describes how\nwe pursue our dual-mandate goals. It is designed to give the public a clear sense of how\nwe think about monetary policy, and that understanding is important both for\ntransparency and accountability, and for making monetary policy more effective.\nThe changes we made in this review are a natural progression, grounded in our\never-evolving understanding of our economy. We continue to build upon the initial\nconsensus statement adopted in 2012 under Chair Ben Bernanke’s leadership. Today’s\nrevised statement is the outcome of the second public review of our framework, which\nwe conduct at five-year intervals. This year’s review included three elements: Fed\nListens events at Reserve Banks around the country, a flagship research conference, and\npolicymaker discussions and deliberations, supported by staff analysis, at a series of\nFOMC meetings.5\nIn approaching this year’s review, a key objective has been to make sure that our\nframework is suitable across a broad range of economic conditions. At the same time,\nthe framework needs to evolve with changes in the structure of the economy and our\nunderstanding of those changes. The Great Depression presented different challenges\nfrom those of the Great Inflation and the Great Moderation, which in turn are different\nfrom the ones we face today.6\nAt the time of the last review, we were living in a new normal, characterized by\nthe proximity of interest rates to the effective lower bound (ELB), along with low growth,\n5 For more details, see the information available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review-of-monetary-policy-strategy-tools-and-\ncommunications-2025.htm.\n6 See Jerome H. Powell (2019), “Challenges for Monetary Policy,” speech delivered at “Challenges for\nMonetary Policy,” a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, held in Jackson\nHole, Wyo., August 23, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190823a.htm.\n\n- 7 -\nlow inflation, and a very flat Phillips curve—meaning that inflation was not very\nresponsive to slack in the economy.7 To me, a statistic that captures that era is that our\npolicy rate was stuck at the ELB for seven long years following the onset of the Global\nFinancial Crisis (GFC) in late 2008. Many here will recall the sluggish growth and\npainfully slow recovery of that era. It appeared highly likely that if the economy\nexperienced even a mild downturn, our policy rate would be back at the ELB very\nquickly, probably for another extended period. Inflation and inflation expectations could\nthen decline in a weak economy, raising real interest rates as nominal rates were pinned\nnear zero. Higher real rates would further weigh on job growth and reinforce the\ndownward pressure on inflation and inflation expectations, triggering an adverse\ndynamic.\nThe economic conditions that brought the policy rate to the ELB and drove the\n2020 framework changes were thought to be rooted in slow-moving global factors that\nwould persist for an extended period—and might well have done so, if not for the\npandemic.8 The 2020 consensus statement included several features that addressed the\nELB-related risks that had become increasingly prominent over the preceding two\ndecades. We emphasized the importance of anchored longer-term inflation expectations\nto support both our price-stability and maximum-employment goals. Drawing on an\n7 See François Gourio, Benjamin K.

Like most other\ncentral banks and private-sector analysts, through year-end 2021 we thought that inflation\nwould subside fairly quickly without a sharp tightening in our policy stance (figure 5).10\nWhen it became clear that this was not the case, we responded forcefully, raising our\npolicy rate by 5.25 percentage points over 16 months. That action, combined with the\nunwinding of pandemic supply disruptions, contributed to inflation moving much closer\nto our target without the painful rise in unemployment that has accompanied previous\nefforts to counter high inflation.\n9 See David Reifschneider and John C.

During this period, we saw that the inflation situation can change rapidly\nin the face of large shocks. In addition, interest rates are now substantially higher than\nwas the case during the era between the GFC and the pandemic. With inflation above\ntarget, our policy rate is restrictive—modestly so, in my view. We cannot say for certain\nwhere rates will settle out over the longer run, but their neutral level may now be higher\nthan during the 2010s, reflecting changes in productivity, demographics, fiscal policy,\nand other factors that affect the balance between saving and investment\n(figure 6). During the review, we discussed how the 2020 statement’s focus on the ELB\nmay have complicated communications about our response to high inflation. We\nconcluded that the emphasis on an overly specific set of economic conditions may have\nled to some confusion, and, as a result, we made several important changes to the\nconsensus statement to reflect that insight.\nFirst, we removed language indicating that the ELB was a defining feature of the\neconomic landscape. Instead, we noted that our “monetary policy strategy is designed to\npromote maximum employment and stable prices across a broad range of economic\nconditions.” The difficulty of operating near the ELB remains a potential concern, but it\nis not our primary focus. The revised statement reiterates that the Committee is prepared\nto use its full range of tools to achieve its maximum-employment and price-stability\ngoals, particularly if the federal funds rate is constrained by the ELB.\nSecond, we returned to a framework of flexible inflation targeting and eliminated\nthe “makeup” strategy. As it turned out, the idea of an intentional, moderate inflation\n\n- 10 -\novershoot had proved irrelevant. There was nothing intentional or moderate about the\ninflation that arrived a few months after we announced our 2020 changes to the\nconsensus statement, as I acknowledged publicly in 2021.11\nWell-anchored inflation expectations were critical to our success in bringing\ndown inflation without a sharp increase in unemployment. Anchored expectations\npromote the return of inflation to target when adverse shocks drive inflation higher, and\nlimit the risk of deflation when the economy weakens.12 Further, they allow monetary\npolicy to support maximum employment in economic downturns without compromising\nprice stability. Our revised statement emphasizes our commitment to act forcefully to\nensure that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored, to the benefit of\nboth sides of our dual mandate. It also notes that “price stability is essential for a sound\nand stable economy and supports the well-being of all Americans.” This theme came\nthrough loud and clear at our Fed Listens events.13 The past five years have been a\npainful reminder of the hardship that high inflation imposes, especially on those least able\nto meet the higher costs of necessities.\nThird, our 2020 statement said that we would mitigate “shortfalls,” rather than\n“deviations,” from maximum employment. The use of “shortfalls” reflected the insight\nthat our real-time assessments of the natural rate of unemployment—and hence of\n11 See Ina Hajdini, Adam Shapiro, A.

In the absence of inflationary pressures, it might not be necessary to\ntighten policy based solely on uncertain real-time estimates of the natural rate of\nunemployment.15\nWe still have that view, but our use of the term “shortfalls” was not always\ninterpreted as intended, raising communications challenges. In particular, the use of\n“shortfalls” was not intended as a commitment to permanently forswear preemption or to\nignore labor market tightness. Accordingly, we removed “shortfalls” from our statement.\nInstead, the revised document now states more precisely that “the Committee recognizes\nthat employment may at times run above real-time assessments of maximum employment\nwithout necessarily creating risks to price stability.” Of course, preemptive action would\nlikely be warranted if tightness in the labor market or other factors pose risks to price\nstability.\nThe revised statement also notes that maximum employment is “the highest level\nof employment that can be achieved on a sustained basis in a context of price stability.”\nThis focus on promoting a strong labor market underscores the principle that “durably\nachieving maximum employment fosters broad-based economic opportunities and\nbenefits for all Americans.” The feedback we received at Fed Listens events reinforced\n14 See Christopher Foote, Shigeru Fujita, Amanda Michaud, and Joshua Montes (2025), “Assessing\nMaximum Employment,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2025-067 (Washington: Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System, August), https://doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2025.067.\n15 See Brent Bundick, Isabel Cairó, and Nicolas Petrosky-Nadeau (2025), “Labor Market Dynamics,\nMonetary Policy Tradeoffs, and a Shortfalls Approach to Pursuing Maximum Employment,” Finance and\nEconomics Discussion Series 2025-068 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,\nAugust), https://doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2025.068.\n\n- 12 -\nthe value of a strong labor market for American households, employers, and\ncommunities.\nFourth, consistent with the removal of “shortfalls,” we made changes to clarify\nour approach in periods when our employment and inflation objectives are not\ncomplementary. In those circumstances, we will follow a balanced approach in\npromoting them. The revised statement now more closely aligns with the original 2012\nlanguage. We take into account the extent of departures from our goals and the\npotentially different time horizons over which each is projected to return to a level\nconsistent with our dual mandate. These principles guide our policy decisions today, as\nthey did over the 2022–24 period, when the departure from our 2 percent inflation target\nwas the overriding concern.\nIn addition to these changes, there is a great deal of continuity with past\nstatements. The document continues to explain how we interpret the mandate Congress\nhas given us and describes the policy framework that we believe will best promote\nmaximum employment and price stability. We continue to believe that monetary policy\nmust be forward looking and consider the lags in its effects on the economy. For this\nreason, our policy actions depend on the economic outlook and the balance of risks to\nthat outlook. We continue to believe that setting a numerical goal for employment is\nunwise, because the maximum level of employment is not directly measurable and\nchanges over time for reasons unrelated to monetary policy.\nWe also continue to view a longer-run inflation rate of 2 percent as most\nconsistent with our dual-mandate goals. We believe that our commitment to this target is\na key factor helping keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored. Experience\n\n- 13 -\nhas shown that 2 percent inflation is low enough to ensure that inflation is not a concern\nin household and business decisionmaking while also providing a central bank with some\npolicy flexibility to provide accommodation during economic downturns.\nFinally, the revised consensus statement retained our commitment to conduct a\npublic review roughly every five years. There is nothing magic about a five-year pace.\nThat frequency allows policymakers to reassess structural features of the economy and to\nengage with the public, practitioners, and academics on the performance of our\nframework. It is also consistent with several global peers.\nConclusion\nIn closing, I want to thank President Schmid and all his staff who work so\ndiligently to host this outstanding event annually. Counting a couple of virtual\nappearances during the pandemic, this is the eighth time I have had the honor to speak\nfrom this podium. Each year, this symposium offers the opportunity for Federal Reserve\nleaders to hear ideas from leading economic thinkers and focus on the challenges we\nface. The Kansas City Fed was wise to lure Chair Volcker to this national park more than\n40 years ago, and I am proud to be part of that tradition.\n\nMonetary Policy and the Fed’s Framework Review| Jackson Hole Economic Symposium | August 22, 2025\nJackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City,\nJackson Hole, Wyoming\nAugust 22, 2025\nMonetary Policy and the Fed’s\nFramework Review\nJerome H.

    "text": "For release on delivery\n1:55 p.m. EDT (12:55 p.m. CDT)\nSeptember 30, 2024\nEconomic Outlook\nRemarks by\nJerome H. Powell\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nNational Association for Business Economics Annual Meeting\nNashville, Tennessee\nSeptember 30, 2024\n\nI have some brief comments on the economy and monetary policy and look\nforward to our discussion.\nOur economy is strong overall and has made significant progress over the past\ntwo years toward achieving our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable\nprices. Labor market conditions are solid, having cooled from their previously\noverheated state. Inflation has eased, and my Federal Open Market Committee\ncolleagues and I have greater confidence that it is on a sustainable path to 2 percent. At\nour meeting earlier this month, we reduced the level of policy restraint by lowering the\ntarget range of the federal funds rate by 1/2 percentage point. That decision reflects our\ngrowing confidence that, with an appropriate recalibration of our policy stance, strength\nin the labor market can be maintained in an environment of moderate economic growth\nand inflation moving sustainably down to our objective.\nRecent Economic Data\nThe labor market\nMany indicators show the labor market is solid. To mention just a few, the\nunemployment rate is well within the range of estimates of its natural rate. Layoffs are\nlow. The labor force participation rate of individuals aged 25 to 54 (so-called prime age)\nis near its historic high, and the prime-age women’s participation rate has continued to\nreach new all-time highs. Real wages are increasing at a solid pace, broadly in line with\ngains in productivity. The ratio of job openings to unemployed workers has moved down\nsteadily but remains just above 1—so that there are still more open positions than there\nare people seeking work. Prior to 2019, that was rarely the case.\n\n- 2 -\nStill, labor market conditions have clearly cooled over the past year. Workers\nnow view jobs as somewhat less available than they were in 2019. The moderation in job\ngrowth and the increase in labor supply have led the unemployment rate to increase to 4.2\npercent, still low by historical standards. We do not believe that we need to see further\ncooling in labor market conditions to achieve 2 percent inflation.\nInflation\nOver the most recent 12 months, headline and core inflation were 2.2 percent and\n2.7 percent, respectively. Disinflation has been broad based, and recent data indicate\nfurther progress toward a sustained return to 2 percent. Core goods prices have fallen\n0.5 percent over the past year, close to their pre-pandemic pace, as supply bottlenecks\nhave eased. Outside of housing, core services inflation is also close to its pre-pandemic\npace. Housing services inflation continues to decline, but sluggishly. The growth rate in\nrents charged to new tenants remains low. As long as that remains the case, housing\nservices inflation will continue to decline.\nBroader economic conditions also set the table for further disinflation. The labor\nmarket is now roughly in balance. Longer-run inflation expectations remain well\nanchored.\nMonetary Policy\nOver the past year, we have continued to see solid growth and healthy gains in the\nlabor force and productivity. Our goal all along has been to restore price stability without\nthe kind of painful rise in unemployment that has frequently accompanied efforts to bring\ndown high inflation. That would be a highly desirable result for the communities,\n\n- 3 -\nfamilies, and businesses we serve. While the task is not complete, we have made a good\ndeal of progress toward that outcome.\nFor much of the past three years, inflation ran well above our goal, and the labor\nmarket was extremely tight. Appropriately, our focus was on bringing down inflation.\nBy keeping monetary policy restrictive, we helped restore the balance between overall\nsupply and demand in the economy. That patient approach has paid dividends: Inflation\nis now much closer to our 2 percent objective. Today, we see the risks to achieving our\nemployment and inflation goals as roughly in balance.\nOur policy rate had been at a two-decade high since the July 2023 meeting. At\nthe time of that meeting, core inflation was above 4 percent, well above our target, and\nunemployment was 3.5 percent, near a 50-year low. In the 14 months since, inflation has\nmoved down, and unemployment has moved up, in both cases significantly. It was time\nfor a recalibration of our policy stance to reflect progress toward our goals as well as the\nchanged balance of risks.\nAs I mentioned, our decision to reduce our policy rate by 50 basis points reflects\nour growing confidence that, with an appropriate recalibration of our policy stance,\nstrength in the labor market can be maintained in a context of moderate economic growth\nand inflation moving sustainably down to 2 percent.\nLooking forward, if the economy evolves broadly as expected, policy will move\nover time toward a more neutral stance. But we are not on any preset course. The risks\nare two-sided, and we will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting. As we\nconsider additional policy adjustments, we will carefully assess incoming data, the\n\n- 4 -\nevolving outlook, and the balance of risks. Overall, the economy is in solid shape; we\nintend to use our tools to keep it there.\nWe remain resolute in our commitment to our maximum-employment and price-\nstability mandates. Everything we do is in service to our public mission.\nThank you. I look forward to our conversation.",
