Waller\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nInstitute for Monetary and Financial Stability Distinguished Lecture\nGoethe University\nFrankfurt, Germany\nMay 30, 2022\n\nThank you, Professor Wieland, for the introduction, and thank you to the Institute\nfor Monetary and Financial Stability for the opportunity to speak to you today.1 I come\nhere at a moment of great challenge for Germany and Europe, and a moment in which it\nhas never been more evident that the interests of Europe and the United States are closely\naligned. America stands with Europe in defending Ukraine because we all understand\nthat an assault on democracy in Europe is a threat to democracy everywhere. We also\nface the common challenge of excessive inflation, which is no coincidence, since\nGermany and other countries are dealing with many of the same forces driving up\ninflation in the United States.\nFortunately, in response to this moment of common challenges and interests,\nEurope and the United States have strengthened our ties and I believe we are more\nunified today than we have been for decades. We see that in the deepening and possible\nbroadening of our security commitments, and we also see it in the strong commitment\nthat central banks in Europe and elsewhere have made to fight inflation.\nIn today’s distinguished lecture I will deal with two distinct topics, both of which\nI believe will be of interest. First, I will provide my outlook for the U.S. economy and\nhow the Federal Reserve plans to reduce inflation and achieve our 2 percent target. Then\nI will pivot to a more academic discussion of the labor market and the possibility of a soft\nlanding in which taming inflation does not harm employment.\nLet me start with the economic outlook for the United States. Despite a pause\nearly this year in the growth of real gross domestic product (GDP), the U.S. economy\n1 I am grateful to Andrew Figura for assistance in preparing the Beveridge curve material. These remarks\nrepresent my own views and not any position of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market\nCommittee.\n\n- 2 -\ncontinues to power along at a healthy pace. The contraction in output reported in the first\nquarter was due to swings in two volatile categories, inventories and net exports, and I\ndon’t expect them to be repeated. Consumer spending and business investment, which\nare the bedrock of GDP, were both strong, and more recent data point toward solid\ndemand and continuing momentum in the economy that will sustain output growth in the\nmonths ahead.\nAnother sign of strength is the labor market, which has created 2 million jobs in\nthe first four months of 2022 at a remarkably steady pace that is down only slightly from\nthe 562,000 a month last year. Unemployment is near a 50-year low, and both the low\nnumbers of people filing for unemployment benefits and the high number of job openings\nindicate that the slowdown in the economy from the fast pace of last year isn’t yet\nweighing on the job market. Some look at labor force participation, which is below its\npre-COVID-19 level, as leaving a lot of room for improvement. However, there are\nunderlying factors that explain why participation is depressed, including early retirements\nand individual choices associated with COVID concerns. Whatever the cause, low\nparticipation has contributed to the fact that there are two job vacancies for every one\nperson counted looking for a job, a record high. Before the pandemic, when the labor\nmarket was in very solid shape, there was one vacancy for every two unemployed people.\nAs I will explain, this very tight labor market has implications for inflation and the Fed’s\nplans for reducing inflation. But on its own terms, we need to recognize that robust job\ncreation is an underlying strength of the U.S. economy, which is expanding its productive\ncapacity and supporting personal income and ongoing economic growth, in the face of\nother challenges.\n\n- 3 -\nLet me turn now to the outlook for the Fed’s top priority, inflation. I said in\nDecember that inflation was alarmingly high, and it has remained so. The April\nconsumer price index (CPI) was up 8.3 percent year over year. This headline number\nwas a slight decline from 8.5 percent in March but primarily due to a drop in volatile\ngasoline prices that we know surged again this month. Twelve-month “core” inflation,\nwhich strips out volatile food and energy prices, was also down slightly to 6.2 percent in\nApril, from 6.5 percent the month before, but the 0.6 percent monthly increase from\nMarch was an acceleration from the February to March rate and still too high.\nMeanwhile, the Fed’s preferred measure based on personal consumption expenditures\n(PCE) recorded headline inflation of 6.3 percent and core of 4.9 percent. These lower\nreadings relative to CPI reflect differences in the weights of various categories across\nthese indexes. No matter which measure is considered, however, headline inflation has\ncome in above 4 percent for about a year and core inflation is not coming down enough\nto meet the Fed’s target anytime soon. Inflation this high affects everyone but is\nespecially painful for lower- and middle-income households that spend a large share of\ntheir income on shelter, groceries, gasoline, and other necessities. It is the FOMC’s job\nto meet our price stability mandate and get inflation down, and we are determined to do\nso.\nThe forces driving inflation today are the same ones that emerged a year ago. The\ncombination of strong consumer demand and supply constraints—both bottlenecks and a\nshortage of workers relative to labor demand—is generating very high inflation. We can\nargue about whether supply or demand is a greater factor, but the details have no bearing\non the fact that we are not meeting the FOMC’s price stability mandate. What I care\n\n- 4 -\nabout is getting inflation down so that we avoid a lasting escalation in the public’s\nexpectations of future inflation. Once inflation expectations become unanchored in this\nway, it is very difficult and economically painful to lower them.\nWhile it is not surprising that inflation expectations for the next year are up, since\ncurrent inflation is high, what I focus on is longer-term inflation expectations. Recent\ndata that try to measure longer-term expectations are mixed. Overall, my assessment is\nthat longer-range inflation expectations have moved up from a level that was consistent\nwith trend inflation below 2 percent to a level that’s consistent with underlying inflation a\nlittle above 2 percent. I will be watching that these expectations do not continue to rise\nbecause longer-term inflation expectations influence near term inflation, as well as our\nability to achieve our 2 percent target. When they are anchored, they influence spending\ndecisions today in a way that helps inflation move toward our target. To ensure these\nlonger-term expectations do not move up broadly, the Federal Reserve has tools to reduce\ndemand, which should ease inflation pressures. And, over time, supply constraints will\nresolve to help rein in price increases as well, although we don’t know how soon.\nI cannot emphasize enough that my FOMC colleagues and I are united in our\ncommitment to do what it takes to bring inflation down and achieve the Fed’s 2 percent\ntarget. Since the start of this year, the FOMC has raised the target range for the federal\nfunds rate by 75 basis points, with 50 basis points of that increase coming at our meeting\nearlier this month. We also issued forward guidance about the likely path of policy. The\nMay FOMC statement said the Committee “anticipates that ongoing increases in the\ntarget range will be appropriate.”\n\n- 5 -\nI support tightening policy by another 50 basis points for several meetings. In\nparticular, I am not taking 50 basis-point hikes off the table until I see inflation coming\ndown closer to our 2 percent target. And, by the end of this year, I support having the\npolicy rate at a level above neutral so that it is reducing demand for products and labor,\nbringing it more in line with supply and thus helping rein in inflation. This is my\nprojection today, given where we stand and how I expect the economy to evolve. Of\ncourse, my future decisions will depend on incoming data. In the next couple of weeks,\nfor example, the May employment and CPI reports will be released. Those are two key\npieces of data I will be watching to get information about the continuing strength of the\nlabor market and about the momentum in price increases. Over a longer period, we will\nlearn more about how monetary policy is affecting demand and how supply constraints\nare evolving. If the data suggest that inflation is stubbornly high, I am prepared to do\nmore.\nMy plan for rate hikes is roughly in line with the expectations of financial\nmarkets. As seen in slide 1, federal funds futures are pricing in roughly 50 basis point\nhikes at the FOMC’s next two meetings and expecting the year-end policy rate to be\naround 2.65 percent. So, in total, markets expect about 2.5 percentage points of\ntightening this year. This expectation represents a significant degree of policy tightening,\nconsistent with the FOMC’s commitment to get inflation back under control and, if we\nneed to do more, we will.\nThese current and anticipated policy actions have already resulted in a significant\ntightening of financial conditions. The benchmark 10-year Treasury security began the\nyear at a yield of around 1.5 percent and has risen to around 2.8 percent. Rates for home\n\n- 6 -\nmortgages are up 200 basis points, and other credit financing costs have followed suit.\nHigher rates make it more expensive to finance spending and investment which should\nhelp reduce demand and contribute to lower inflation.\nIn addition to raising rates, the FOMC further tightened monetary policy by\nending asset purchases in March and then agreeing to start reducing our holdings of\nsecurities, a process that begins June 1. By allowing securities to mature without\nreinvesting them, the Fed’s balance sheet will shrink. We will phase in the amount of\nredemptions over three months. By September, we anticipate having up to $95 billion of\nsecurities rolling off the Fed’s portfolio each month. This pace will reduce the Fed’s\nsecurities holdings by about $1 trillion over the next year, and the reductions will\ncontinue until securities holdings are deemed close to the ample levels needed to\nimplement policy efficiently and effectively. Although estimates are highly uncertain,\nusing a variety of models and assumptions, the overall reduction in the balance sheet is\nestimated to be equivalent to a couple of 25-basis-point rate hikes.\nAll these actions have the goal of bringing inflation down toward the FOMC’s 2\npercent target. Increased rates and a smaller balance sheet raise the cost of borrowing\nand thus reduce household and business demand. On top of this, I also hope that over\ntime supply problems resolve and help lower inflation. But the Fed isn’t waiting for\nthese supply constraints to resolve. We have the tools and the will to make substantial\nprogress toward our target.\nThe United States is not alone in facing excessive inflation, and other central\nbanks also are responding. There is a global shift toward monetary tightening. In the\neuro area, headline inflation continued to edge up in April, to 7.5 percent, while its\n\n- 7 -\nversion of core inflation increased from 2.9 percent to 3.5 percent. Based on this\nbroadening of price pressures, communication by the European Central Bank (ECB) is\nwidely interpreted as signaling that it will likely start raising its policy rate this summer\nand that it could raise rates a few times before year-end. Policy tightening started last\nyear, as emerging markets including Mexico and Brazil increased rates substantially amid\nexpectations of accelerating inflation. Several advanced-economy central banks,\nincluding the Bank of England, began raising interest rates in the second half of last year.\nLike the Fed, the Bank of Canada lifted off in March and, also like the Fed, picked up the\npace of tightening with a rate hike of 50 basis points at its most recent meeting. Central\nbanks in Australia and Sweden pivoted sharply to hike rates at their most recent meetings\nafter previously saying that such moves were not likely anytime soon.\nSlide 2 shows the similarly timed policy responses across advanced and emerging\neconomy central banks in terms of actual and anticipated increases in their policy rates.\nEmerging market economies started the year with a policy rate that averaged around 3.5\npercent, and they are expected to end the year averaging a bit over 5 percent. Advanced\nforeign economies started a bit below zero and at this point are expected to move up, on\naverage, by around 1 percentage point. This worldwide increase in policy rates,\nunfortunately, reflects the fact that high inflation is a global problem, which central banks\naround the world recognize must be addressed.\nFinally, like the Fed, many other advanced-economy central banks that expanded\ntheir balance sheets over the past two years are now reversing course. In recent months,\nas shown in slide 3, the Bank of Canada and Bank of England have begun to shrink their\nbalance sheets by stopping full reinvestment of maturing assets, similar to what the Fed\n\n- 8 -\nwill commence in June. Although the ECB has committed to reinvesting maturing assets\nfor quite some time, it has tapered net purchases substantially since last year and has\nindicated it will likely end those purchases early in the third quarter.\nSome have expressed concern that the Fed cannot raise interest rates to arrest\ninflation while also avoiding a sharp slowdown in economic growth and significant\ndamage to the labor market. One argument in this regard warns that policy tightening\nwill reduce the current high level of job vacancies and push up unemployment\nsubstantially, based on the historical relationship between these two pieces of data, which\nis depicted by something called the Beveridge curve. Because I am now among fellow\nstudents of economics, I wanted to take a moment to show why this statement may not be\ncorrect in current circumstances.\nFirst, a little background. The relationship between vacancies and the\nunemployment rate is shown in slide 4. The blue dots in the figure show observations of\nthe vacancy rate and the unemployment rate between 2000 and 2018. The black curve is\nthe fitted relationship between the log of vacancies and the log of unemployment over\nthis period. It has a somewhat flat, downward slope. From this, the argument goes,\npolicy to slow demand and push down vacancies requires moving along this curve and\nincreasing the unemployment rate substantially.\nBut there’s another perspective about what a reduction in vacancies implies for\nunemployment that is just as plausible, if not more so. Slide 5 shows the same\nobservations as slide 4 but also adds observations from the pandemic. The two larger red\ndots show the most recent observation, March 2022, and January 2019, when the vacancy\nrate had achieved its highest rate before the pandemic. These two dots suggest that the\n\n- 9 -\nvacancy rate can be reduced substantially, from the current level to the January 2019\nlevel, while still leaving the level of vacancies consistent with a strong labor market and\nwith a low level of unemployment, such as we had in 2019. To see why this is a\nplausible outcome, I first need to digress a bit to discuss the important determinants of\nunemployment.\nMany factors influence the unemployment rate, and vacancies are just one. Thus,\nto understand how a lower vacancy rate would influence unemployment going forward,\nwe need to separate the direct effect of vacancies on the unemployment rate from other\nfactors. To do that, we first need to review the factors that account for unemployment\nmovements.\nThere are two broad determinants of unemployment: separations from\nemployment (including layoffs and quits), which raise unemployment, and job finding by\nthe unemployed, which lowers unemployment.2 Separations consist largely of layoffs,\nwhich are typically cyclical, surging in recessions and falling during booms. Job finding\nis also highly cyclical, rising as the labor market tightens and falling in recessions.\nTo see how separations and job finding affect the unemployment rate, it’s helpful\nto start with equation (1) on slide 6, which states that in a steady state (that is, when the\nunemployment rate is constant), flows into unemployment, the left side of equation (1),\nmust equal flows out of unemployment, the right side. Flows into unemployment equal\nthe separations rate, , times the level of employment. For simplicity, I’ve normalized\nthe labor force to 1, s𝑠𝑠o that employment equals 1 minus unemployment, . Flows out of\nunemployment, the right side of the equation, equal the rate of job findin𝑈𝑈g, , times the\n𝑓𝑓\n2 For simplicity, I am ignoring flows into and out of the labor force, which can also influence the\nunemployment rate; see Elsby, Hobijn and Sahin (2015).\n\n- 10 -\nnumber of unemployed. Rearranging this equation yields an expression for the steady-\nstate unemployment rate, equation (2).3 Because flows into and out of unemployment are\nquite high, the actual unemployment rate converges to the steady-state unemployment\nrate quickly, and the steady-state unemployment rate typically tracks the actual rate\nclosely.4 So, going forward, I’m going to think of the steady-state unemployment rate as\na good approximation of the actual unemployment rate.\nNow let me focus on job finding, which is often thought to depend on the number\nof job vacancies relative to the number of unemployed workers. To see why, start with\nequation (3) on slide 7, which states that the number of hires is an increasing function of\nboth the number of job vacancies and the number of unemployed individuals searching\nfor jobs: The more firms there are looking for workers and the more workers there are\nlooking for jobs, the more matches, or hires, there will be. For convenience, I’m\nassuming a mathematical representation of this matching function takes a Cobb-Douglas\nform. If we divide both sides of equation (3) by unemployment, we get equation (4),\nwhich expresses the job-finding rate as a function of the ratio of vacancies to\nunemployment, or labor market tightness.\nBecause we have data for both the left and right sides of equation (4), we can\nestimate it and obtain parameter values for the elasticity of job finding with respect to\nlabor market tightness, sigma, and matching efficiency, mu.5 Matching efficiency\nrepresents factors that can increase (or decrease) job findings without changes in labor\n3 If the labor force is allowed to vary, then the expression is similar but somewhat more complicated.\n4 For more on decomposing unemployment rate movements, see Shimer (2012); Elsby, Michaels and Solon\n(2009); Fujita and Ramey (2009); and Ahn and Crane (2020).\n5 I will assume levels of and that are consistent with regressions of on using data on\nℎ 𝑉𝑉\nunemployment, JOLTS job openings, and transitions from unemployment into employment from 2009 to\n𝜇𝜇 𝜎𝜎 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙�𝑈𝑈� 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙�𝑈𝑈�\n2019. Specifically, I assume that , and .\n𝜇𝜇 =0.27 𝜎𝜎 =0.3.\n\n- 11 -\nmarket tightness. On the one hand, if the workers searching for jobs are well suited for\nthe jobs that are available, matching efficiency will be high; on the other hand, if many\nsearching workers are not well suited for the available jobs, matching efficiency will be\nlow.6\nThe last step is to plug our expression for job finding into equation (2), the steady-\nstate unemployment rate, yielding equation (5). Equation (5) shows how vacancies affect\nthe unemployment rate. To illustrate this relationship, I solve equation (5) for different\nvalues of and , holding the matching efficiency parameters constant. That is, I pick a\nseparation𝑉𝑉 rate a𝑠𝑠t some level and trace out what happens to the unemployment rate as the\nvacancy rate changes. Then I pick a different separation rate and again trace out the\neffect of vacancies on unemployment. The result is shown on slide 8, which plots four\ncurves showing the effect of vacancies on unemployment for four different separation\nrates. Each curve is convex; as the number of vacancies increases relative to the number\nof individuals looking for work, it becomes harder for firms to fill jobs with suitable\nworkers, and more jobs remain vacant. This is exactly the situation many employers are\nnow experiencing. Because more vacancies generate fewer and fewer hires, they result in\nsmaller and smaller reductions in unemployment. But large numbers of vacancies are, of\ncourse, a hallmark of tight labor markets and additional vacancies continue to strongly\nboost wage growth and quits.\nThe curve farthest to the right, labeled s=2.5, represents a situation when the\nseparations rate is 2.5 percent, a historically high level. This rate is approximately the\nlevel seen in the middle of 2020, just after the onset of the pandemic. You can see that\n6 For more on the effect of matching efficiency on unemployment and the Beveridge curve, see Barnichon\nand Figura (2015); Elsby, Michaels, and Ratner (2015); and Ahn and Hamilton (2020).\n\n- 12 -\nwhen the separations rate is this high, the unemployment rate is also going to be high, no\nmatter the level of vacancies.\nNow let’s think about what happens as the economy recovers, as it has over the\npast two years. In an expansion, layoffs fall, pushing down separations and moving the\ncurve to the left. At the same time, greater labor demand increases vacancies, causing the\nlabor market to move up the steep curves. The combination of these movements is\nshown in slide 9 as the black fitted curve, which I’ve reproduced from slide 4. As you\nrecall, the black curve fits the actual observations on unemployment and vacancies we\nsaw before the pandemic. And we now can see that these observations are produced by a\ncombination of changes in vacancies and separations (as well as other influences on\nunemployment). Decreases in the separations rate reduce the unemployment rate without\nchanging vacancies, imparting a flatness to the fitted curve relative to the steeper curves\nthat only reflect the effect of vacancies. If we want to just focus on the effect of\nvacancies, then we should be looking at the steep curves, especially when the labor\nmarket is tight, as it is now.\nWhat does all this suggest about what will happen to the labor market when, as I\nexpect, a tightening of financial conditions and fading fiscal stimulus start to cool labor\ndemand? Slide 10 focuses on the Beveridge curve (the relationship produced by the\ndirect effect of changes in vacancies on unemployment) when the separations rate is low,\nas it is now.7 The March 2022 observation lies at the top of the curve and is labeled point\nA. If there is cooling in aggregate demand spurred by monetary policy tightening that\ntempers labor demand, then vacancies should fall substantially. Suppose they decrease\n7 Specifically, I set the separations rate equal to 1.23 percent, a little above current levels.\n\n- 13 -\nfrom the current level of 7 percent to 4.6 percent, the rate prevailing in January 2019,\nwhen the labor market was still quite strong. Then we should travel down the curve from\npoint A to point B.8 The unemployment rate will increase, but only somewhat because\nlabor demand is still strong—just not as strong—and because when the labor market is\nvery tight, as it is now, vacancies generate relatively few hires. Indeed, hires per vacancy\nare currently at historically low levels. Thus, reducing vacancies from an extremely high\nlevel to a lower (but still strong) level has a relatively limited effect on hiring and on\nunemployment.\nNow, I also show the January 2019 observation of vacancies and unemployment.\nRecall, this is also where the economy was over the year prior to the pandemic. As you\ncan see, moving from the March 2022 observation to the January 2019 observation is not\nthat different from the change in the unemployment rate predicted by my estimated\nBeveridge curve, which suggests the predicted small increase in unemployment is a\nplausible outcome to policy tightening.\nIf labor demand cools, will separations increase and shift the curve outward,\nincreasing unemployment further? I don’t think so. As shown on slide 11, outside of\nrecessions, layoffs don’t change much. Instead, changes in labor demand appear to be\nreflected primarily in changes in vacancies.\nNow, it’s certainly possible, even probable, that influences on the unemployment\nrate other than vacancies will change going forward. In terms of the equations we have\nbeen discussing, layoffs could increase somewhat, instead of staying constant. Matching\nefficiency could also improve or deteriorate. The vacancy rate could also change more or\n8 The unemployment rate found on the slide is not a prediction and simply an illustrative example.\n\n- 14 -\nless than I have assumed. Thus, I’m not arguing that the unemployment rate will end up\nexactly as the Beveridge curve I’ve drawn suggests. But I do think it quite plausible that\nthe unemployment rate will end up in the vicinity of what the Beveridge curve currently\npredicts.\nAnother consideration is that non-linear dynamics could take hold if the\nunemployment rate increases by a certain amount, as suggested by the Sahm rule, which\nholds that recessions have in the past occurred whenever the three-month moving average\nof the unemployment rate rises 0.5 percentage point over its minimum rate over the\nprevious 12 months.9 We certainly need to be alert to this possibility, but the past is not\nalways prescriptive of the future. The current situation is unique. We’ve never seen a\nvacancy rate of 7 percent before. Reducing the vacancy rate by 2.5 percentage points\nwould still leave it at a level seen at the end of the last expansion, whereas in previous\nexpansions a reduction of 2.5 percent would have left vacancies at or below 2 percent, a\nlevel only seen in extremely weak labor markets.\nTo sum up, the relationship between vacancies and unemployment gives me\nreason to hope that policy tightening in current circumstances can tame inflation without\ncausing a sharp increase in unemployment. Of course, the path of the economy depends\non many factors, including how the Ukraine war and COVID-19 evolve. From this\ndiscussion, I am left optimistic that the strong labor market can handle higher rates\nwithout a significant increase in unemployment.\nIn closing, I want to again thank the institute for the invitation to address you\ntoday, at a time of considerable challenge for Germany and the United States. It’s not the\n9 For more information on the Sahm rule, see Sahm (2019).\n\n- 15 -\nfirst time we have faced such moments together. Just south of the Frankfurt Airport is a\nsurprising sight—a couple of antique military cargo planes, parked on the side of the\nAutobahn. They were built by Douglas Aircraft, nearly 80 years ago, and stand today as\nmonuments to one of the greatest achievements of cooperation between the freedom-\nloving people of Europe and those of the United States.\nFor 11 months, these two planes, and many others, took off and landed in\nperpetual motion, delivering 2.3 million tons of food, fuel, and other essentials to the\npeople of Berlin, who were surrounded and besieged by Soviet forces. The commitment\nand ultimate triumph of this improbable airlift was in many ways the beginning of an\nalliance that has included ongoing economic cooperation that has strengthened both our\ndemocracies. In that spirit, I am certain we can both overcome the economic challenges\nthat lie ahead.\n\n- 16 -\nReferences\nAhn, Hie Joo, and Leland Crane (2020). “Dynamic Beveridge Curve Accounting,”\nFinance and Economics Discussion Series 2020-027.

Waller\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\nKansas City, Missouri\nJuly 17, 2024\n\nThank you, Jeff, and thank you to the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City for\nthe opportunity to speak to you today.1 So far, 2024 has been a challenging year for\neconomic forecasters, and for monetary policymakers. After significant progress in 2023\ntoward the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) price-stability goal, inflation\njumped in the first quarter. At the same time, both the labor market and economic growth\nran strong enough that some commentators wondered whether monetary policy was\nrestrictive enough and whether rate hikes should be back on the table. These twists and\nturns in the economic data shifted everyone’s expectations back and forth as to when the\nFOMC might begin lowering its policy interest rate and how many cuts there would be\nthis year. During this time, my consistent view was that there was no urgency to cut rates\nuntil the Committee is confident that inflation is returning sustainably to 2 percent.\nThen, in the second quarter, data on inflation and the labor market moderated in a\nway that suggests progress toward price stability has resumed. The data over the past\ncouple months shows the economy growing at a more moderate pace, labor supply and\ndemand apparently in balance, and inflation slowing from earlier this year. These are all\ndevelopments that support progress toward achieving the FOMC’s dual-mandate goals.\nFor reasons that I will elaborate on later, I believe current data are consistent with\nachieving a soft landing, and I will be looking for data over the next couple months to\nbuttress this view. So, while I don’t believe we have reached our final destination, I do\nbelieve we are getting closer to the time when a cut in the policy rate is warranted.\nBefore turning to the economic outlook, let me say a word about central bank\ncommunication—in particular, communication about the policy path. Central bankers\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of\nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nuse communications to try, as much as possible, to describe the extent of progress, and\neven more importantly, the remaining path to the ultimate destination. The problem is\nthat there may not be just one path to the ultimate destination—it depends on the\nincoming data. For example, when leaving work, you have a normal route to get home,\nand that is the base case for your estimated commuting time. But that day’s traffic\nconditions will dictate whether you should take that route or an alternative to get home.\nYou need to think about the alternative routes to get home and how long they will take if\nyou are confronted with unexpected congestion. And, most likely, you will also have to\ncommunicate these alternative travel plans to family members so they have an idea of\nwhen you will arrive and how you will get the kids to after school activities.\nCentral bankers face the same problem: How will you set policy if the data come\nin different than you expected? It is important to not only lay out your base case, but also\nalternative paths for policy if your base case is disrupted by incoming data. And for\nmonetary policy, it is even more important to communicate those alternative policy paths\nto the public so that they can also make plans. So, after reviewing the economic outlook,\nI will explore three possible data scenarios about inflation for the second half of 2024 and\nhow those differing scenarios affect my view of the appropriate stance of policy.\nEconomic Activity\nLet me start with the economic outlook. Real gross domestic product (GDP) grew\nat about a 4 percent annual pace in the second half of 2023 and then significantly slowed\nto a 1.4 percent rate in the first quarter. Recent forecasts indicate that output grew a little\nfaster in the second quarter. We will get an initial estimate of second-quarter GDP next\nweek, but the Blue Chip average of private-sector forecasts estimates that GDP grew at a\n\n- 3 -\n1.8 percent pace in the second quarter, and the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow model estimates\ngrowth at 2.5 percent. A big reason for the higher GDPNow estimate is because it was\nupdated after yesterday’s retail sales report. Digging into that report, one finds that the\ndata directly informing the Bureau of Economic Analysis’s estimate of consumer\nspending posted solid gains for June and revised up sales for both April and May. I\nsuspect that this moderate consumption growth may continue in the second half of the\nyear because personal income data is holding up.\nA signal of possible slowing in economic activity comes from the Institute for\nSupply Management's (ISM) survey of purchasing managers for non-manufacturing\nfirms. Nonmanufacturing firms constitute the large majority of businesses in the\neconomy. The non-manufacturing index fell below 50 in June, suggesting a contraction\nin activity. As a part of that survey, “business activity,” corresponding to production or\nsales, fell below 50 for the first time since May 2020. The index for new orders fell\nespecially sharply and the employment index fell further into contractionary territory.\nClearly, economic activity among these businesses is slowing, but it is too soon to say by\nhow much. Previous months when the overall index fell below 50 were followed by\nsustained periods above that threshold, so we will have to wait and see what this current\nreading means for a slowing in this sector. Meanwhile activity among manufacturing\nbusinesses has been fairly steady this year after contracting from late 2022 through 2023.\nNew orders and most other readings are close to 50.\nThe Labor Market\nOne development in the past few months with significant implications for\nmonetary policy is that labor supply and demand have finally come into rough balance.\n\n- 4 -\nDemand of workers exceeded supply for several years, contributing significantly to high\nwage inflation, which inevitably fed through into services inflation. Supply was damaged\nafter the pandemic, as many people left the workforce to care for family, older workers\nretired, and immigration fell significantly. At the same time, the economy grew solidly,\nand labor demand rose at a brisk pace. The imbalance in the labor market was reflected\nin a surge in job openings, with two vacant jobs for each worker counted as looking for\nwork, nearly double the rate prior to the pandemic. There was also a surge in the number\nof people quitting their jobs, most of them to take a higher-paying job elsewhere.\nBut now that situation has changed dramatically. Labor supply has improved,\nwith a higher labor force participation rate and much higher rates of immigration. Not\nlong ago, I would have been concerned that the high levels of job creation reported\nrecently were inconsistent with a labor market coming into better balance, but the high\npace of immigration in recent quarters helped accommodate the strong demand. And,\nmore recently, as restrictive monetary policy has put downward pressure on aggregate\ndemand, the demand for labor has moderated.\nThe unemployment rate has risen from a 50-year low to 4.1 percent, still low in\nhistorical terms but the highest since late 2021. In May, the ratio of job vacancies to\nunemployed people stood at 1.2, which was the average in the year before the pandemic.\nThe share of workers who quit their jobs is now slightly below the pre-pandemic level.\nOne indication that this is a loosening, rather than a weakening, of the labor market is that\nlayoff rates have been more or less steady at the low rate of around 1 percent. To me,\nthis is all evidence of labor supply and demand in balance.\n\n- 5 -\nBack in 2022, I wrote a research note with Fed economist Andrew Figura on the\nBeveridge curve, which is the relationship between unemployment and the job vacancy\nrate.2 In that research, we projected that, if layoffs were steady, the unemployment rate\nwould rise to around 4.5 percent if the job vacancy rate dropped back to its pre-pandemic\nlevel of 4.6 percent. The latest data estimated the vacancy rate in May as 4.9 percent,\npretty close to the pre-pandemic level. There were some prominent skeptics, but this data\ntells us that if inflation continues to moderate as it has since May, then we may achieve\nthe soft landing in the labor market that I said back then was possible, with even less of a\ntradeoff in terms of unemployment.\nAnother sign of balance in the labor market is that wage growth has continued to\nslow. The twelve-month change in average hourly earnings has slowed from its peak of\nabout 6 percent in March 2022, to 4.3 percent by December 2023, and is down to 3.9\npercent as of June. The three-month increase through June was running at an annual pace\nof 3.6 percent, which is close to what I judge is the rate needed to support inflation\nrunning at 2 percent in a sustained way. And this interpretation is consistent with other\nmeasures that suggest wage growth is back to its pre-pandemic level.\nSo what lies ahead for the labor market? Right now, the labor market is in a\nsweet spot—employment growth is not excessive when accounting for immigration,\nnominal wage growth is near the rate consistent with price stability, the unemployment\nrate is close to what is thought of as its long run value, the job vacancy rate is near its\npre-pandemic level and the involuntary layoff rate has held steady at 1 percent for over 2\n2 See Andrew Figura and Chris Waller (2022), “What Does the Beveridge Curve Tell Us about the\nLikelihood of a Soft Landing?” FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem, July 29), https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/what-does-the-beveridge-curve-\ntell-us-about-the-likelihood-of-a-soft-landing-20220729.html.\n\n- 6 -\nyears. In terms of the employment leg of the dual mandate, we may well be able to\nachieve the soft landing.\nBut we need to keep the labor market in this sweet spot. As my research note\nhighlighted, the history of the Beveridge curve indicates that, given the normalization of\nthe labor market, a continued decline in the job vacancy rate and the vacancy-to-\nunemployment ratio may lead to a larger increase in unemployment than we have seen\nthe past two years. In short, one implication of a balanced labor market is that the risk of\nit becoming too loose is more closely balanced with the risk of it being too tight. This is\na policy challenge that we have not faced for the past couple years. As of today, I see\nthere is more upside risk to unemployment than we have seen for a long time.\nInflation\nLet me now turn to the outlook for inflation. After making progress last year\ntoward our 2 percent goal, early this year I was concerned that progress might have\nstalled. But data in recent months has been reassuring. Last week’s consumer price\nindex (CPI) report was the second month of very good news. It showed that total\nconsumer prices fell in June, after staying flat in May. This means that CPI inflation for\nthe 12-months through June declined to 3 percent, while the 3-month annualized change\ndropped to 1.1 percent. For consumers who have been dealing with prices that are still\nsignificantly higher than before the pandemic, this is good news, and with continuing\nsolid gains in wages and other income, over time I hope it will begin to feel like the level\nof prices is becoming more manageable.\nFor policymakers, this was also welcome news. Factoring out energy and food\nprices, which tend to be volatile, core CPI inflation rose only 0.1 percent last month, the\n\n- 7 -\nslowest pace since the pandemic. This brings 3-month annualized core inflation down to\nan annual rate of 2.1 percent. Based on the consumer and producer price data reported\nlast week, private sector forecasters are predicting that the FOMC’s preferred inflation\ngauge based on personal consumer expenditures (PCE) rose 0.1 percent in June and that\ncore PCE inflation rose 0.2 percent.\nSo, after disappointing data to begin 2024, we now have a couple of months of\ndata that I view as being more consistent with the steady progress we saw last year in\nreducing inflation, and also consistent with the FOMC’s price stability goal. The\nevidence is mounting that the first quarter inflation data may have been an aberration and\nthat the effects of tighter monetary policy have corralled high inflation. To see this,\nconsider the average monthly rate of core PCE inflation over the past 18 months. In the\nfirst quarter of 2023 it averaged 0.4 percent, and then 0.3 percent, 0.2 percent and 0.1\npercent over the remaining quarters of the year. Core PCE inflation jumped to a monthly\naverage of 0.4 percent in the first quarter of this year but is now estimated to be back to\n0.2 percent last quarter. Most importantly, I don’t have to look at the second decimal\nplace to see progress! The recent data are making me more confident we will achieve the\ninflation goal of our dual mandate.\nMonetary Policy\nNow let me turn to the implications of this data for monetary policy. As I noted\nearlier, the changes in the data this year have made it hard to formulate an outlook for\npolicy that would apply to the range of possible paths the economy may take. That range\nof possibilities must consider two risks.\n\n- 8 -\nOn the one hand, it is essential that monetary policy get inflation down to a\nsustained level of 2 percent. If we start to loosen policy too soon, and allow inflation to\nflare up again, we risk losing credibility with the public and allowing expectations of\nfuture inflation to become unanchored. That credibility has helped inflation fall as\nquickly as it has in the past 18 months and squandering it would be a grave mistake.\nMonthly PCE inflation has very recently been running near 2 percent at an annual rate,\nbut I need to see a bit more evidence that this will be sustained. The other risk is that we\nwait too long to ease monetary policy and contribute to a significant economic slowdown\nor a recession, with unemployment rising notably.\nWith those two risks in mind, let me lay out three scenarios for the economy this\nyear that would result in leading me to different views about appropriate policy. One\nassumption I make is that there is no significant deterioration in the labor market in the\nnext several months—that we are able to keep the labor market in its current sweet spot.\nWhile I believe this is likely, I will be paying close attention to the employment side of\nour mandate.\nThe first scenario is the optimistic one. Here we continue to receive more very\nfavorable CPI inflation reports, with implications for very favorable PCE inflation\nreadings as well. This would give us a nice run of inflation data starting in May. I see a\nsignificant but not high probability of this scenario occurring. And, in that circumstance,\nI would have much greater confidence in inflation moving sustainably toward 2 percent.\nIn this scenario, I could envision a rate cut in the not-too-distant future.\nThe second scenario is a bit less optimistic but probably more likely to occur. In\nthis case, the inflation data comes in uneven—not as good as the previous few months but\n\n- 9 -\nstill consistent overall with progress on bringing inflation down toward 2 percent. Here,\nwith the uneven data, it would be a matter of timing as to when I thought we are making\nsustainable progress to 2 percent inflation. In this case, a rate cut in the near future is\nmore uncertain.\nThe final scenario is the one that I certainly don’t want to see but have to worry\nabout. In this case, if we were to see a significant resurgence in inflation in the second\nhalf of 2024, it would be tough to conclude we were making sustainable progress on\ninflation this year. While this pessimistic outcome is possible, I put a low probability on\nit happening given the recent data we have received.\nThese scenarios highlight that the data will influence how my confidence in\ninflation returning sustainably to 2 percent could evolve over time. And this will then\ninfluence my view of the appropriate path of policy. This all goes to say that my view of\nthe appropriate path of policy is data dependent.\nIn laying out these scenarios, I don’t mean to suggest that I will ignore other data\nand what they tell us about economic and financial conditions. As always, my judgments\nabout appropriate policy will consider the totality of the data, including importantly the\nsignals we receive about the state of the labor market, which has eased and now looks to\nbe in balance. But for the purpose of clearly communicating my thinking about the\nstance of policy over the next several months, I think these scenarios are helpful. And\ngiven that I believe the first two scenarios have the highest probability of occurring, I\nbelieve the time to lower the policy rate is drawing closer.\nThank you.",

Waller\nAt the most recent Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, I\nsupported no change in the federal funds target range but preferred to continue the current\npace of decline in securities holdings.\nReducing the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet is an important part of normalizing\nmonetary policy implementation and reducing unneeded reserves in the banking system.\nSlowing further or stopping redemptions of securities holdings will be appropriate as we\nget closer to an ample level of reserves. But in my view we are not there yet because\nreserve balances stand at over $3 trillion and this level is abundant. There is no evidence\nfrom money market indicators or my outreach conversations that the banking system is\ngetting close to an ample level of reserves.\nThe Committee slowed the pace of redemptions in June 2024 to help ensure a\nsmooth transition to the appropriate level of securities holdings needed to implement\nmonetary policy efficiently and effectively. I believe that pace continues to be the right\none.\nIf unanticipated disturbances to reserve demand emerge on the path to balance\nsheet normalization, the Federal Reserve System has a variety of tools to address such a\ndevelopment. Rather than changing our current pace of balance sheet reduction, the\nFederal Reserve should rely on those tools and develop a plan for how to respond to\nshort-run strains if they emerge.

Even with the decision to\n\n- 2 -\nslow the pace of runoff at this meeting, a plan is still required should a disturbance occur\nin the future.

Waller\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nInternational Organization for Standardization\nTechnical Committee 68 Financial Services 44th Plenary Meeting\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis\nMinneapolis, Minnesota\nMay 17, 2024\n\nThank you, President Kashkari, for the introduction, and thank you to the\nconference participants for the opportunity to speak with you.1 As you all know, the\npayment system relies on the kind of cooperation and collaboration that this body\nrepresents. So, let’s begin by acknowledging that ongoing effort.\nFrom its founding, the Federal Reserve has played a central role in payments. We\nseek to foster a payment and settlement system that is safe and efficient. Such a system\npromotes a vibrant economy, since it allows for participation from a broad range of\nindividuals and businesses without requiring them to invest heavily in bilateral\narrangements. Technical standards are the common language used by payment system\nparticipants like businesses, financial institutions, payment system operators, and\npayment service providers. Technical standards can help contribute to payment system\nsafety and efficiency, benefitting the full range of participants. Technical standards for\npayments are in no way new—we have had them in place for decades, and those\nstandards make it more efficient to process a check, access cash at an ATM, and carry out\nother functions less visible to consumers but essential to the payment system. As\npayments technology advances at a rapid pace, technical standards must also evolve.\nAnd they must do so in a way that supports innovation while promoting safety,\nefficiency, and interoperability among a growing number of payments products and\ntechnologies. Today I will share some perspectives on technical standards, particularly in\nthe context of evolving payments technology.\n1 Thank you to Alex Sproveri, Hannah Kim, and Cy Watsky of the Federal Reserve Board and Ainsley\nHargest of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis for their assistance in preparing this text. The views\nexpressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board.\n\n- 2 -\nEverything Old Is New Again\nBut before getting to that, I would like to provide some historical context since\nthe benefits of standardization within an evolving payment system predate this current\nwave of innovation.\nLet’s start with some early examples from U.S. payments history. The free-\nbanking era from 1837 to 1863 experienced significant fragmentation and corresponding\nfrictions in the payment system as competing banknotes circulated across different\ngeographical regions, requiring costly and inefficient trading of various forms of currency\nand featuring high levels of fraud and counterfeiting.2 Later, during the national banking\nera from 1863 to 1913, checks were becoming a predominant form of payment at the\nsame time that the population of the United States was moving westward, requiring a\nnationwide method to clear checks. The check clearing infrastructure at the time,\nhowever, was regional, creating a patchwork network reliant on correspondent banks to\nmove and clear checks across regions, often at high cost and with long delays. Congress\ncreated the Federal Reserve in 1913 and assigned the Fed a number of key roles including\nissuance of Federal Reserve Notes and, in short order, establishment of a national check-\nclearing network. These are examples that predate electronic payments where\nstandardization improved the efficiency of payments.\nWe can also call on examples where we have seen rapid changes in the\ntechnology of payments, and technical standards supported innovation by providing a\n2 See Alan Greenspan, “Our banking history” (remarks at the Annual Meeting and Conference of the\nConference of State Bank Supervisors, Nashville, TN, May 2, 1998),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/1998/19980502.htm and Daniel Sanches, “The Free-\nBanking Era: A Lesson for Today?,” Economic Insights (Third Quarter 2016): 9–14,\nhttps://www.philadelphiafed.org/-/media/frbp/assets/economy/articles/economic-\ninsights/2016/q3/eiq316.pdf.\n\n- 3 -\ncommon language for systems to communicate with each other. Immediately after 9/11,\nplanes were grounded, and check payments, which were still largely paper-based, could\nnot be processed.3 This highlighted inefficiency in the clearing of paper checks. In\nresponse, Congress passed the Check 21 Act, which enabled banks to process check\ninformation electronically using digital images of an original check. The Check 21 Act\ncreated a framework for the substitute check to be provided under generally applicable\nindustry standards and also served as a bridge until industry acceptance of fully electronic\nchecks became ubiquitous.4 Electronic check processing at such scale necessitated\ncommon check image exchange standards, which were developed and adopted through\nindustry and Fed collaboration.\nAnd, as I mentioned earlier, the payment system once again is experiencing a\ntechnology-driven revolution.5 Shifting consumer preferences and new technologies\nhave led to new financial products and services. This includes the introduction of instant\npayments, advances in digital wallets and mobile payment apps, and the emergence and\ngrowth of digital assets. Innovators see an opportunity for enhancements in payments,\nwhether through the introduction of new capabilities or finding ways to alleviate frictions\nsuch as speed, cost, and accessibility.\nWhile the potential benefits of these advances are significant, disjointed or\nincompatible innovations could increase fragmentation in the payment system or\n3 See Christopher J. Neely, “The Federal Reserve’s Response to the September 11 Attacks,” Regional\nEconomist, January 01, 2002, https://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/regional-economist/january-\n2002/the-federal-reserves-response-to-the-sept-11-attacks.\n4 See section 3 of the Check 21 Act, Pub. L. No. 108-100 (2003).\n5 See Christopher J. Waller, “Reflections on Stablecoins and Payments Innovations” (speech delivered via\nwebcast at the 2021 Financial Stability Conference, cohosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nand the Office of Financial Research, Cleveland, OH, November 17, 2021),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20211117a.htm.\n\n- 4 -\nexacerbate frictions at different points of the payment chain. Will platforms that use\nnewer technologies, for example, be able to talk with one another and traditional payment\nrails, or will they lead to siloed, parallel networks—so-called “walled gardens”?\nSupporting compatibility or interoperability is important because payment\nsystems are similar to other networks in that greater participation in the network usually\nmeans greater value for its users. The network effects in turn can drive a more vibrant\neconomy, since a well-functioning payment system can promote commerce across a\nbroader range of consumers and businesses. While achieving goals like network scale\nand interoperability is a complex problem, technical standards are one part of the solution\nto support consistent communication among existing and emerging technologies.\nPerspectives on Technical Standards\nA technical standard is simply a common specification or guideline. For\nexample: when I drive across the country, I do not need to worry about whether pumps at\ndifferent gas stations will fit my gas tank. That is because there is an agreed-upon\nstandard. Or, in the example of payments, financial institutions adopt messaging\nstandards to allow systems and networks to communicate with one another.\nIf done well, the development and adoption of technical standards can help\nincrease efficiency across payment chains and promote consistency in how disparate\nsystems communicate. This requires standards that are technically sound, implemented\nconsistently, and timed correctly to meet a market need.\nTechnical standards—such as those developed within the International\nOrganization for Standardization (ISO)—are voluntary, open, and consensus-based. The\ncollective market can identify frictions where standards would be beneficial, and then\n\n- 5 -\nindividual firms can choose whether and when to adopt them based on perceived benefit.\nThe process to develop the standards is open and transparent, and it requires consensus at\nevery step. This process establishes standards that are seen as credible and legitimate.\nConsiderations and Lessons Learned\nIt is important to note that simply having a standard in place will not\nautomatically translate to economic benefits. To achieve network effects, standards must\nbe widely adopted. Developing consensus-based standards implies that all relevant\nparticipants are at the table and advocating for their interests, which is not a given, but is\ncritical if standards are to be widely adopted. Timing is also important. In the early\nstages of technological advances, standards should not be overly prescriptive to stifle\ninnovation and should be flexible and adaptable as the market changes. Conversely,\nwaiting too long to adopt a technical standard could lead to inefficiencies and high costs\nto comply after the fact.\nStandards also need to be implemented consistently, which requires industry\ncoordination to align on common practices. Building on previous lessons learned, the\nISO 20022 messaging standard was developed to be a common standard for multiple\npayment rails, with a structured data format, and aims to align messages across payment\nsystems. Nonetheless, there has been variation in ISO 20022 implementation, and further\nindustry coordination over time will be necessary to align on common practices.\nAll of this—identifying the need and timing for standards, incorporating a breadth\nof industry perspectives, and aligning on implementation approaches—requires an\nimmense amount of coordination. And much of this coordination must take place among\ncompetitors. So often a neutral convener is needed to achieve better outcomes. That is\n\n- 6 -\nwhy we have standard development organizations like ISO to provide a forum where\nparticipants from the private sector, academia, and the public sector can contribute\nexpertise and collectively shape standards in a way that meets business and public sector\nobjectives, providing some comfort that the needs of all market participants and\nconsumers will be considered.\nThe Federal Reserve and Payments Technical Standards\nThat brings me to the Federal Reserve’s roles in this process—not role but roles.\nOne such role is to serve as a convenor, with this week’s conference being a typical\nexample. Among standards development organizations, like the Accredited Standards\nCommittee X9 domestically and ISO internationally, the Fed is known for impartial\nfacilitation of efforts to work toward a common goal.\nIn another role, the Federal Reserve leverages its expertise as a payment system\noperator to inform future standards and broader improvements in the payment system.\nFor example, in 2015, the Fed issued a call to action in its paper, “Strategies for\nImproving the U.S. Payment System,” asking stakeholders to come together in pursuit of\na better payment system for the future. The paper, and subsequent work, highlighted the\nrole of standards to enhance payments security and efficiency at various points in the\npayment and ancillary processing flows, noting the importance of supporting industry\nefforts to develop and adopt standards, as well as common approaches to\nimplementation.6\n6 See Federal Reserve System, “Strategies for Improving the U.S. Payment System,” last modified January\n26, 2015, https://fedpaymentsimprovement.org/wp-content/uploads/strategies-improving-us-payment-\nsystem.pdf and Federal Reserve System, “Strategies for Improving the U.S. Payment System: Federal\nReserve Next Steps in the Payments Improvement Journey,” last modified September 6, 2017,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/other20170906a1.pdf.\n\n- 7 -\nThe Federal Reserve itself adopts standards in its role as a payment system\noperator. For example, the FedNow Service, which went live in July 2023, was built\nusing the ISO 20022 messaging standard. Incorporating this standard enables a number\nof operational efficiencies, including improved information exchange between financial\ninstitutions, support for straight-through processing, and reduction in errors and the need\nfor manual processing steps. We have also committed to adopting the ISO 20022\nmessaging standard for the Federal Reserve’s wholesale payments service, the Fedwire\nFunds Service, by March 2025. We expect this adoption will improve the speed of\nwholesale cross-border payments by reducing operational costs and promoting consistent\ncommunication across global platforms. The richer data in ISO 20022 could also\nimprove anti-money laundering and sanctions screening and support broader adoption of\nextended remittance information.\nIn serving as a neutral convenor, providing payments expertise, and improving\npayments in our role as a payment system operator, the Fed extends its long history of\nengaging in the development of payments technical standards.\nConclusion\nAs we navigate the latest wave of technological innovation in payments, the\nfundamental payment system dynamics and role of technical standards are not new.\nHowever, the pace of change is a lot faster now than in the 1910s, when paper checks\nwere used. Collaboration among a broad range of private and public stakeholders can\nhelp to establish standards for integrating the new technologies into the payment system.\nAdvocating for an open and transparent standards development process, where\nparticipants adopt standards that are technically sound and supportive of business and\n\n- 8 -\npublic objectives, is one way the Federal Reserve can help to foster payment system\nsafety and efficiency, as well as support responsible innovation at its present rapid clip.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\nNoon EDT\nApril 20, 2023\nInnovation and the Future of Finance\nRemarks by\nChristopher J. Waller\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nCryptocurrency and the Future of Global Finance\nSarasota, Florida\nApril 20, 2023\n\nThank you to the Global Interdependence Center for inviting me to speak today.\nWhile my remarks will touch on crypto-assets, they are focused more broadly on\ninnovation and the future of finance.1\nInnovation has been defined as “the introduction of novelties; the alteration of\nwhat is established by the introduction of new elements or forms.”2 This definition does\nnot take a position on whether innovation is a good thing or a bad thing. To our modern\nears, innovation generally has a positive connotation—it is something desirable that we\nwant to foster. But it is important to remember that there is also a long tradition of\nviewing innovation with suspicion. This gets to a fundamental point: Innovation is a\ndouble-edged sword, with costs and benefits, and different effects on different groups of\npeople. This is a lesson that we as financial regulators should bear in mind. Former Fed\nChair Paul Volcker was a well-known critic of financial innovation, noting that, while\ncredit default swaps and collateralized debt obligations may have helped some people\nhedge investment risks, they also played a key role in the Global Financial Crisis. He\nfamously praised the automated teller machine as a beneficial bank innovation, but was\nskeptical about most other financial innovation.3 As we think about crypto-assets, or\nother forms of innovation, we need to think carefully about which edge of the sword we\nare looking at: Will the innovation create new efficiencies, help mitigate risks, increase\nfinancial inclusion; or will it create new or exacerbate existing risks?\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board.\n2 “Innovation,” Oxford English Dictionary, accessed April 18, 2023,\nhttps://www.oed.com/view/Entry/96311?redirectedFrom=innovation#eid.\n3 Paul Volcker, “Paul Volcker: Think More Boldly,” The Wall Street Journal, December 14, 2009,\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704825504574586330960597134.\n\n- 2 -\nRecently, I gave remarks on crypto-assets,4 discussing how individuals can make\ntheir own choices about whether to invest in speculative assets, but I also said that banks\nand other intermediaries choosing to engage in crypto-asset-related activities must do so\nin a safe and sound manner. At the same time, the world is rapidly changing, and we\nneed to be open to the potential benefits of innovation. In that light, I am focusing my\nremarks on two areas of innovation that may have the potential to deliver substantial\nbenefits—tokenization and artificial intelligence, or AI.\nTokenization\nLet’s start with tokenization. As I discussed in my prior remarks on crypto-assets,\nI think of the crypto ecosystem as consisting of several parts, including the database\nmanagement protocol used to record trades, commonly referred to as blockchain. A\nblockchain is ultimately a type of distributed database that can be used to record data,\nincluding asset ownership and transactions in the asset (i.e., changes in asset ownership).5\nTo date, blockchain has primarily served as the ledger of record for crypto-assets, but it\nmay be suitable to play a similar role for traditional assets, such as securities and\nderivatives.\nBefore a blockchain can be used to facilitate transactions in traditional assets, the\nassets must first be “tokenized”—that is, represented on the blockchain such that the\nblockchain becomes the ledger of record for the asset. At that point, parties can engage\nin transactions with the tokenized asset by updating records on the blockchain.\n4 Christopher J. Waller, “Thoughts on the Crypto Ecosystem” (speech at the Global Interdependence\nCenter Conference: Digital Money, Decentralized Finance, and the Puzzle of Crypto, La Jolla, CA,\nFebruary 10, 2023), https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20230210a.htm.\n5 The remainder of this speech refers to tokenized assets that are represented on a blockchain. But assets\ncan also be tokenized on other forms of distributed ledger technology.\n\n- 3 -\nWhy would a financial institution undertake this process to tokenize an asset?\nWhat advantages does blockchain offer relative to traditional approaches to conducting\ntransactions? I do not intend to provide exhaustive answers to those questions here, but I\ndo want to highlight several areas.\nFirst, blockchain can offer fast or even near-real time transfers on a 24/7/365\nbasis, which, among other things, allows parties precise control over settlement times and\nin some cases, can enhance efficiencies and reduce liquidity risks. I will note, of course,\nthat these benefits are not unique to blockchains. The Federal Reserve’s FedNow\nservice, which is set to begin operations in July, does not rely on blockchain; and it will\nprovide safe and efficient instant payment services in real time, around the clock, every\nday of the year.\nAnother potential advantage of tokenized assets is that they are “programmable”\nand have “smart contract” functionality. A smart contract is a computer program stored\non a blockchain, which can be programmed to execute predefined actions once certain\nconditions are met. When assets are tokenized, smart contracts can be used to construct\nand execute transactions involving the asset. When the smart contract is activated, the\ntransaction proceeds automatically as long as the specified conditions are met. This is the\nsense in which smart contracts are smart: they do not depend on the parties to the\ntransaction to implement them; instead, they implement themselves, based on the terms\nspecified by the parties.\nSmart contracts may allow for what is called “atomic settlement.” Rather than\nrelying on each party to separately carry out its leg of the transaction, smart contracts can\neffectively combine the two, or more, legs of the transaction into a single unified\n\n- 4 -\n“atomic” act that is executed by the smart contract. This may be an additional robust way\nto achieve delivery-versus-payment (“DVP”) and payment-versus-payment (“PVP”)\nfunctionality, such that one leg of a transaction settles if and only if the other leg settles\nas well. Atomic settlement is useful because it can mitigate settlement and counterparty\ncredit risks: it ensures that the buyer will not pay if the seller does not deliver; and\nconversely, that the seller will not deliver if the buyer does not pay.\nIn fact, private sector institutions are testing use cases to better understand the\nbenefits and risks of this technology. Firms have executed foreign-exchange trades using\nblockchain technology with smart contracts in an attempt to improve efficiencies.\nSeparately, financial institutions have used blockchain to facilitate intraday repo\ntransactions. Parties to these transactions may have more flexibility as to when the\ntransactions settle, which in turn has the potential to create additional capital and liquidity\nefficiency. And blockchain’s atomic settlement functionality may serve as another way\nto achieve an important risk mitigant: using repurchase agreements as an example, the\nrepo “seller” can have confidence that it will receive the specified loan amount in\nexchange for the collateral it conveys; while the repo “buyer” knows it will receive the\nspecified collateral.\nThese efforts are still in early stages, but I expect that as functionality expands\nwith more currencies, eligible securities, and new products, there will be more\nparticipation and growth.\nThat isn’t to say that there aren’t risks associated with tokenization and the use of\nsmart contracts: smart contracts can have bugs and potential cyber vulnerabilities; and\ninstantaneous settlement raises its own set of risks. But there is considerable promise,\n\n- 5 -\nand I look forward to seeing what private sector participants come up with to potentially\nenhance the way traditional transactions are conducted.\nArtificial Intelligence\nThe second area I will discuss is artificial intelligence. Can you go anywhere\nwithout hearing about AI? AI, as I am sure you know, is currently seeing a surge in\ninterest thanks to so-called generative language models. These types of models can\nprovide complex responses to user requests in conversational prose that comes very close\nto passing the famous “Turing Test” for artificial intelligence. You could ask it to write\nyou a 10-page story that involves foxes, and a fairly polished short story will be ready for\nyou in a matter of seconds. It can also develop presentations, summarize documents, do\nelementary coding, and perform a host of other functions, all at superhuman speeds.\nBy now, it has been well-documented that these generative language models\nremain fallible, and that the technology still has a way to go. Its responses are often\ninaccurate, although even in those cases, it often sounds like it knows what it is talking\nabout. As with other sources of information, it is important for anyone using these tools\nto review the output with an appropriately critical eye and not take it at face value.\nBut the advances keep coming, and we can only speculate as to what these models\nwill be capable of in the coming years. So, what does all this mean for banking? Banks\nare already testing or using AI in a variety of areas. Banks have started to use AI models\nto generate personalized product suggestions for their customers, and AI can even\ngenerate and send a customized marketing email to that customer based on the model’s\nproduct recommendations. Banks are also looking to AI for a range of customer service\napplications such as chatbots that can help reset passwords, locate a branch or ATM, and\n\n- 6 -\ncheck account balances without the need for human intervention. AI has also proven\nuseful for fraud monitoring: it can, for example, help banks spot potentially fraudulent\ncredit card transactions, including by identifying new spending patterns that are\nindicative of fraud.\nBanks have also begun to explore the potential for using AI to refine their credit\nunderwriting process and analysis, with the potential to speed up underwriting decisions\nand lower loan pricing.\nLike many innovations, AI involves novel risks, or at least new variations on old\nrisks. AI models are only as good as the data they are trained on. This can raise\nchallenges when AI depends on high volumes and different varieties of data, which can\ncomplicate efforts to detect problems or biases in datasets. Another key consideration is\nthe “black box” problem, because with some AI models it can be difficult to explain how\nthey arrive at outputs given a set of inputs (this is often called a lack of explainability).\nIn some cases, even the AI developers themselves may not know precisely how the AI\napproach works.\nAs I noted, we are already seeing banks use AI in a number of ways, and we have\nregular discussions with them about understanding and managing the associated risks.6\nWhether and how they might make use of generative language models remains to be\nseen. The technology may bring new efficiencies to banks’ software development\nprocesses; or have applications in customer service; or it may be useful in some way we\n6 Request for Information and Comment on Financial Institutions’ Use of Artificial Intelligence, Including\nMachine Learning, 86 Fed. Reg. 16837 (March 31, 2021).\n\n- 7 -\nhaven’t foreseen yet. As with tokenized assets, I am curious to see how banks may make\nfurther use of AI. I also want to make sure they do that responsibly.\nConclusion\nTokenization and AI are just a few of the innovations that may ultimately come to\nplay a prominent role in banking and, for that matter, more broadly in the economy. I\ncould just as easily today have talked about Web3 or quantum computing. All of these\ninnovations will have their champions, who make claims about how their innovation will\nchange the world; and I think it’s important to view such claims critically. But it’s\nequally important to challenge the doubters, who insist that these innovations are much\nado about nothing, or that they will end in disaster. The world will change, and we\nshould encourage innovations that show promise for benefitting society, including the\nfinancial services sector.",

Waller\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat a\nFed Listens Event\nhosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\nSt. Louis, Missouri\nApril 23, 2025\n\nThank you, Alberto, it is great to be back in St. Louis. And thank you to everyone\nhere for this great turnout, which is itself a big part of what we are trying to accomplish\ntoday.1\nFed Listens is about hearing from the public on the Federal Reserve’s approach to\nmonetary policy, and that begins with active and broad participation. Your interest and\nengagement in the work of the Fed is an essential first step in this process of consultation.\nIn addition to the valuable information that Fed policymakers receive at these events,\nengagement with the public contributes to a broader understanding of the important role\nthat monetary policy plays in the economy.\nAs we have heard from President Musalem, the Federal Reserve was, in important\nways, actually designed to promote this kind of engagement and input from the public.\nUnusually among agencies of the federal government, the Fed is located in and part of\nevery region of the United States. Reserve Banks such as the St. Louis Fed carry out a\nnumber of important functions, but among the most important is ensuring that the\nconcerns and priorities of the communities each Reserve Bank serves are reflected in\nmonetary policy decisions made in Washington.\nThis is something I know very well, having served here as executive vice\npresident and research director for nearly a dozen years. I advised on monetary policy\nwhile engaging with people throughout the Eighth District, hearing their concerns about\nhow they were faring in the economy, and how they were affected by inflation, interest\nrates, and the state of the job market. I learned a lot about the economies of Missouri,\nIllinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, and Arkansas (see, I haven’t\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nforgotten!). But I learned just as much about how important it is to hear from people\ndirectly about their experiences as well as their perceptions, which are sometimes just as\nconsequential for the economy. We call this part of the “soft” data that supplements the\nhard numbers of the government statistics that policymakers eagerly await. The “hard”\ndata is indispensable for setting monetary policy, but we can’t get a full and detailed\npicture of the economy without the soft data you can provide.\nFed Listens is directly connected to the Fed’s review of our long-run goals and\nstrategy for monetary policy, referred to as our framework, which was last updated five\nyears ago. But in a larger sense, it is part of a broader process of consultation with the\npublic that never stops. We know that individuals, families, businesses, and communities\nare significantly affected by decisions we make to promote a healthy economy. We\nwant—in fact, we need—to know how you have been impacted. We need to know how\ninflation and interest rates are affecting consumers. We need to know how rates are\naffecting the cost and access to credit by businesses small and large. We need to know\nhow you expect the economy to evolve over the coming months and years, and how that\nis influencing your plans for the future.\nIn conclusion, I will say again how great it is to be back in St. Louis, and I look\nforward to hearing from all of you.\nThank you.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n6:00 p.m. EDT\nMarch 27, 2024\nThere’s Still No Rush\nRemarks by\nChristopher J. Waller\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe Economic Club of New York\nNew York, New York\nMarch 27, 2024\n\nThank you, Barbara, and thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today.1\nMy subject, as it often is, is the outlook for the U.S. economy, and how that affects the\nFederal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) continuing effort to reduce inflation to a\nsustained level of 2 percent while maintaining a healthy labor market.\nWe made a lot of headway toward our inflation goal in 2023, and the labor market\nmoved substantially into better balance, all while holding the unemployment rate below\n4 percent for nearly two years. But the data we have received so far this year has made\nme uncertain about the speed of continued progress. Back in February, I noted that data\non fourth quarter gross domestic product (GDP) as well as January data on job growth\nand inflation came in hotter than expected. I concluded then that we needed time to\nverify that the progress on inflation we saw in the second half of 2023 would continue,\nwhich meant there was no rush to begin cutting interest rates to normalize the stance of\nmonetary policy.\nOver the past month, additional economic data has reinforced this view. February\njob gains moved back up to 275,000, making the three-month average a strong 265,000,\nand various inflation measures have continued to come in hot. Core personal\nconsumption expenditures (PCE) inflation jumped to 0.4 percent on a monthly basis in\nJanuary, after averaging around 0.1 percent in October through December last year. And\nwith February consumer price index (CPI) and producer price index inflation data in\nhand, some forecasts are predicting core PCE inflation may be revised up for January and\nis expected to come in at 0.3 percent for February, which we will learn about on Friday.\nAdding this new data to what we saw earlier in the year reinforces my view that there is\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nno rush to cut the policy rate. Indeed, it tells me that it is prudent to hold this rate at its\ncurrent restrictive stance perhaps for longer than previously thought to help keep inflation\non a sustainable trajectory toward 2 percent.\nI continue to believe that further progress will make it appropriate for the FOMC\nto begin reducing the target range for the federal funds rate this year. But until that\nprogress materializes, I am not ready to take that step. Fortunately, the strength of the\nU.S. economy and resilience of the labor market mean the risk of waiting a little longer to\nease policy is small and significantly lower than acting too soon and possibly\nsquandering our progress on inflation.\nTurning to the performance of the U.S. economy, the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow\nmodel, based on all current data, predicts first quarter growth in real GDP of 2.1 percent\nat an annual rate. Similarly, the consensus from the Blue Chip survey of private sector\nforecasters is 2 percent. This would be a significant slowdown from the average of\naround 4 percent in the second half of 2024 but still quite solid growth.\nConsumer spending, the largest component of GDP, seems to be moderating this\nquarter. Retail sales fell significantly in January and then retraced about half of that\ndecline in February. Smoothing out these swings, they clearly indicate a moderation in\ngoods spending from the second half of last year. However, services spending, excluding\nenergy, grew moderately in January, which offset to some extent the decline in goods\nspending. I will be watching on Friday morning to see what the February data on\npersonal income and spending show.\nOn the business side, surveys of purchasing managers in February continued to\nreport results we have been hearing for over a year. For manufacturers, the Institute for\n\n- 3 -\nSupply Management indicated a slight contraction in activity, with new orders and\nproduction moving down a bit. This contrasts with nonmanufacturing businesses that\ncontinued to see an expansion in activity, with measures of new orders and business\nactivity on the higher end of their readings over the past year.\nNow let me turn to the labor market. The data is sending a mixed message on\nhow supply and demand are evolving. As I noted earlier, payroll data estimate that\nemployers added 275,000 jobs in February. This robust gain is not only above the\n265,000 average level of job creation since November, but also above the 251,000\nmonthly average for all of 2023. Recent gains have been broad based across most\nsectors, rather than concentrated in a few sectors, which may be a sign that demand is not\nmoderating as much as is needed to support continued progress on inflation. Conversely,\nthe household survey estimated that the unemployment rate rose to 3.9 percent in\nFebruary. But that increase was driven mostly by an outsized rise in the number of 16- to\n24-year-olds counted as unemployed. Youth employment tends to be volatile, so this rate\nmay drop back in the next few months and, if so, pull the overall unemployment rate back\ndown as well.\nAnother sign of loosening in the labor market is that the number of people\nquitting their jobs has fallen below the levels just before the pandemic. I believe most\nworkers quit their jobs for better pay or other benefits. So less turnover means firms do\nnot need to enhance their compensation packages to attract workers.\nIn reviewing wage pressures, the most recent data suggest nominal wage growth\nhas continued to ease. But most of these measures are still above their pre-pandemic\n\n- 4 -\nlevels. And, considering overall compensation—wages and benefits —here, too, growth\nhas slowed but remains a bit elevated.\nLooking across various indicators of labor demand, there hasn’t been much\nchange in recent months. Job openings drifted down last year but then flattened out\nrecently at a still elevated level, while the pace of hiring is close to its pre-pandemic\nlevel. With strong labor supply and little apparent change in demand in recent months,\nthe ratio of vacancies to people looking for work has been roughly flat after declining\nsignificantly in 2023. At 1.4 jobs for each person looking, that ratio is down from 2022’s\npeak of around 2 and indicates that the labor market has loosened up. But the vacancies-\nto-unemployed rate is still higher than the 1.2 that prevailed before the pandemic and has\nheld steady around 1.4 for several months, which suggests that the labor market remains\ntight.\nLet me turn to a topic related to the labor market that has important implications\nfor the longer-term course of U.S. economy: productivity. When productivity across the\neconomy grows quickly, it means that output and income can also grow quickly without\nputting upward pressure on inflation, so it supports rising living standards. And lately,\nproductivity has been growing fast. Over the final three quarters of 2023, it grew at a\npace a bit under 4 percent, much faster than the average since the 1970s. Some have\nargued that this must be why we had such strong economic growth in 2023, even while\ninflation was slowing. Perhaps, they say, we are at the start of another era of fast and\nsustained productivity growth, such as the United States experienced from 1998 through\n2004.\n\n- 5 -\nBelieve me, I hope this is true, because it would be the basis for broadly shared\nprosperity that raises living standards, but I am skeptical that it will last. The first thing\nto note is that productivity growth is notoriously volatile. Though productivity grew fast\nfor the final nine months of last year, it actually fell in the first quarter of 2023 and rather\nsubstantially for all of 2022. One may view this fast growth as making up for the earlier\ndeclines. In fact, smoothing across the past two years, productivity growth averages a bit\nabove 1.25 percent annually. Also keep in mind that periods of fast growth that last more\nthan a few years are unusual, and it is also difficult to be sure about the causes.\nWhen thinking about productivity, one has to distinguish between factors that\nraise productivity in the short run but ultimately are one-off increases in the level of\nproductivity, as opposed to those that increase the long-run growth rate of productivity so\nthat the level is constantly increasing. So let me posit several factors that have been\nsuggested for explaining the recent increase in productivity and try to place them in the\none-off or long-run buckets.\nMany people point to recent large investment projects in the United States, such\nas those associated with the Inflation Reduction Act or artificial intelligence, as boosting\nproductivity. But these investments will take place over many years and may not have\ndone much yet to add to the nation’s productive capacity. While it is possible they could\nincrease longer-run productivity growth, it remains to be seen if they will. Thus, they are\nunlikely to explain the recent rise in productivity growth.\nThe recent surge in business start-ups after a sustained lull has also been\nmentioned as a factor. Like the investment projects, it may be causing a boost to\nproductivity, but it is likely to occur over a number of years. And, unless the current\n\n- 6 -\nboom in new business formation continues into the future, once again this factor will at\nbest raise the level of productivity over the short term and not the long-run growth rate.\nAnother factor that is often pointed to is the resolution of supply chain problems.\nBut once the supply chain issues are resolved, this boost to productivity growth will end,\nso this clearly is a short-run factor that will simply raise the level but not the long-run\ngrowth rate of productivity.\nAnother potential cause of recent productivity growth is that the pandemic\nchanged how we work and use technology. While I certainly can see how this could\naffect the level of productivity and short-run growth, once we have made those changes,\nthey’re done, so I don’t see this as a driver of sustained productivity growth. I have also\nheard the argument that when labor turnover was very high during the pandemic, new\nhires were being trained, and by the time they were ready to start contributing to\nproduction, they would leave for a new job and start a new training process. Now that\nthe pace of turnover is back down to normal levels, firms are reaping the benefits of\nkeeping newly trained workers who then move up the learning curve at the firm. Again,\nwhile I see this raising the level of productivity in the short run, it may simply be\nreturning productivity to previous levels.\nI will be watching how productivity evolves in the near term. I will keep my\nfingers crossed for more good news, but I am not convinced that the recent boom in\nproductivity growth will continue. Therefore, I will keep that in mind as I form my\njudgments about the economic outlook and appropriate setting of monetary policy.\nNow let’s talk about inflation. We made a lot of headway in reducing inflation in\nthe past year or so, although the readings in the past two months have been disappointing.\n\n- 7 -\nBoth total CPI inflation and core inflation that excludes energy and food rounded to a 0.4\npercent increase for the month of February, which is obviously not progress toward our\ninflation goal. While housing services prices, which rose in January, moderated a bit,\ncore goods prices, which had been falling recently, rose due to elevated import price\nincreases. In trying to judge what the underlying trend is for inflation, I tend to look at\nannualized core measures over 3 or 6 months. For most of a year, I watched these\nnumbers come down more quickly than 12-month readings, telling me that we were\nmaking substantial progress. But, more recently, the 3-month core CPI, which was\nrunning at a 3.3 percent rate in December, rose to 4.2 percent in February. Six-month\ncore CPI, which was also 3.3 percent in December, was up to 3.9 percent last month.\nThese shorter-term inflation measures are now telling me that progress has slowed and\nmay have stalled. But we will need more data to know that.\nThe FOMC uses personal consumption expenditure inflation data to measure\nprogress toward our 2 percent goal, and we won’t get those results for February until\nFriday. But, as I noted at the start, based on the consumer and producer prices that we do\nhave, estimates suggest that core PCE inflation is likely to be elevated. Though the\nFebruary reading is estimated to step down from January’s, this recent pace would not\nrepresent significant progress toward 2 percent.\nLet me pause here and make an important point about how I think about and want\nto talk about adverse developments such as this recent inflation data and how as a\npolicymaker I manage risks to the economic outlook.\nIt is appropriate to point out that a month or two of data does not necessarily\nindicate a trend, and there are good reasons to think that progress on inflation will be\n\n- 8 -\nuneven but likely to continue down toward 2 percent. At the same time, monetary policy\nis data driven, and I do want to take it into account when formulating my economic\noutlook. While I don’t want to over-react to two months of data, I do think it is\nappropriate to react to it.\nThere is ample evidence that the recent data has also been taken on board by both\nfinancial markets and forecasters in adjusting their views of the economic outlook. The\nmarkets have pulled back the number of expected rate cuts in 2024. FOMC participants\nhave also adjusted their views on policy in response to recent data and it is reflected in\nthe Summary of Economic Projections. Comparing the December 2023 projections to\nthose just released, one sees that the median number of cuts in the federal funds rate for\n2024 is still three, but the dots for 2024 have moved up, meaning at least several\npolicymakers removed one or more cuts from their projection. In fact, the number of\npolicymakers expecting more than three cuts in 2024 decreased significantly, while the\nnumber expecting two or fewer increased. I interpret this as showing that the Committee\nis not over-reacting to the recent data but is not discounting it either.\nIn my view, it is appropriate to reduce the overall number of rate cuts or push\nthem further into the future in response to the recent data. This reflects the reality of\nmanaging an outlook in real time as data comes in. Subsequent data may well alter this\noutlook again, but we shall see. Based on what we know now, there is no urgency in\ntaking that step.\nSo where do I see things standing? I see economic output and the labor market\nshowing continued strength, while progress in reducing inflation has slowed. Because of\nthese signs, I see no rush in taking the step of beginning to ease monetary policy. The\n\n- 9 -\ntarget range for the federal funds rate has been 5¼ to 5½ percent since last July, and I\nbelieve that this restrictive level is helping to reduce imbalances in the economy and\ncontinuing to put downward pressure on inflation. All indications are that the economy\ncontinues to grow at a healthy pace. While retail sales and some other indicators suggest\na softening in demand this quarter from the second half of last year, when growth\naccelerated, the evidence for a significant slowdown is sparse. Meanwhile, as the labor\nmarket continues to add jobs at a rapid pace, some signs point to improvement in the\nimbalance between supply and demand, but others indicate continued tightness.\nMy judgment on the balance of risks for monetary policy, which I explained in a\nspeech on February 22, hasn’t changed: The risk of waiting a little longer to cut rates is\nsignificantly lower than acting too soon.2 Cutting the policy rate too soon and risking a\nsustained rebound in inflation is something I want to avoid.\nAs a result, in the absence of an unexpected and material deterioration in the\neconomy, I am going to need to see at least a couple months of better inflation data\nbefore I have enough confidence that beginning to cut rates will keep the economy on a\npath to 2 percent inflation. Fortunately, we can wait to see how the data come in before\ndeciding the appropriate time to start lowering the policy rate. The remarkable U.S.\neconomy keeps on chugging along, adding jobs at a rate that over time will keep\nunemployment near its current, historically low rate. But the overall strength of the U.S.\neconomy makes it a fairly easy decision to wait a little longer to get a better\nunderstanding of the trajectory of inflation and, when appropriate, begin easing policy.\n2 See Christopher J.

    "text": "For release on delivery\n11:30 a.m. EDT (8:30 a.m. local time)\nMay 9, 2025\nThank You, John\nby\nChristopher J. Waller\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“John Taylor and Taylor Rules in Policy”\nHoover Monetary Policy Conference: Finishing the Job and New Challenges\nThe Hoover Institution\nStanford, California\nMay 9, 2025\n\nThank you, Volker, and thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today.1\nJohn Taylor is deservedly well known for his work on monetary policy rules, the\nbest known of which bear his name. But in the early 1980s, John was part of a broader\ndiscussion about rules versus discretion in the setting of monetary policy.\nThe traditional argument for discretionary monetary policy was that any policy\nchoice that a rule would recommend could be replicated by discretion, especially when\npolicymakers are aware of the rule, but not vice versa. Discretion allowed more\nflexibility than a rule and thus was the dominant strategy for setting monetary policy.\nThen, in 1977, Finn Kydland and Ed Prescott published their paper “Rules Rather\nthan Discretion: The Inconsistency of Optimal Plans,” which argued that policy promises\nmade today may not be carried out in the future if there are advantages to reneging on\nthose promises.2 Reneging on promises made by discretionary policymakers, they\nargued, is much easier than reneging on a policy rule, which is a way to commit to future\nactions.\nKydland and Prescott provided a simple and appealing model at the end of their\npaper. The model had an incentive for the central bank to renege on its promise to keep\ninflation low, since doing so would expand the economy and lower unemployment. If\nrational agents knew of this incentive, they would not find the promise of low inflation\ncredible and would therefore raise their expectations for future inflation. The central\nbank would then have to validate those expectations with higher inflation to avoid a\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 See Finn E. Kydland and Edward C. Prescott (1977), “Rules Rather than Discretion: The Inconsistency\nof Optimal Plans,” Journal of Political Economy, vol. 85 (June), pp. 473–92.\n\n- 2 -\nrecession. In the end, the economy ends up in a high-inflation equilibrium with no gains\nfrom higher output or lower unemployment.\nKydland and Prescott then showed that if, on the other hand, the central bank\ncould commit to following a rule to set policy, then it could not renege on its promises.\nAs a result, inflation would stay low while yielding the same outcomes for output and\nemployment. In this case, rules beat discretion. This was pathbreaking research, and it\ncame to influence both the theory and practice of central banking. It was also part of the\nbasis for Kydland and Prescott’s Nobel Prize in Economics in 2004.\nBut commitment to most things in life is easier said than done. Even rules can be\nabandoned if it is optimal to do so. In the absence of commitment, can the central bank\ndo anything to enhance the credibility of its promise to keep inflation low?\nIn 1983, Robert Barro and David Gordon used the Kydland–Prescott example to\nstudy reputation building by the central bank.3 The basic idea is to establish a reputation\nfor fulfilling promises. But what promises can be made in a discretionary world that the\npublic would find credible? They showed that promising the low-inflation outcome\nwasn’t credible. However, the central bank could promise an inflation rate that was\nbetween the low-inflation equilibrium and the high-inflation equilibrium. If private\nindividuals expected this intermediate inflation rate, then the gains from reneging would\nbe reduced just enough to dissuade the central bank from breaking its promise.\nConsequently, promises to deliver this intermediate inflation rate were credible, and\nsociety was better off than it would be in the high-inflation world, showing that\ncredibility really mattered in a world in which commitment was not feasible.\n3 See Robert J. Barro and David B. Gordon (1983), “Rules, Discretion and Reputation in a Model of\nMonetary Policy,” Journal of Monetary Economics, vol. 12 (1), pp. 101–21.\n\n- 3 -\nI now introduce John Taylor and his work into the story, which coincided with the\nbeginning of my own research career.\nIn 1983, having read the Barro and Gordon paper, I started working on reputation-\nbuilding strategies as part of my Ph.D. dissertation research. In the process, I was struck\nby the thought that the building of credibility and reputation hinges on the person setting\nmonetary policy at the time: If that person leaves, does the central bank have to start over\nto rebuild its credibility? At the time, I had in mind Paul Volcker, whose personal\ncredibility seemed so crucial in the Federal Reserve’s campaign to vanquish high\ninflation. Relying on the credibility of individual policymakers seemed like a weak\nfoundation for sustaining the credibility of policy promises.\nThat is when I went back and read John Taylor’s discussion of the Barro and\nGordon paper in the Journal of Monetary Economics.4 John applauded the analytical\ncontribution that Barro and Gordon—as well as Kydland and Prescott—had made, but he\nwas skeptical about the practical applicability of their story. In his critique, John said, “In\nother well-recognized time inconsistency situations, society seems to have found ways to\ninstitute the optimal (cooperative) policy.”5\nAs I read that sentence, I thought, “How does society build credibility into the\ninstitution instead of relying on the credibility of an individual?” That one sentence that\nJohn wrote in 1983 set me off on a 20-year journey studying central bank design.\nSo where did it lead me?\n4 See John B. Taylor (1983), “‘Rules, Discretion and Reputation in a Model of Monetary Policy’ by Robert\nJ. Barro and David B. Gordon,” Journal of Monetary Economics, vol. 12 (1), pp. 123–25.\n5 See Taylor, ‘“Rules, Discretion and Reputation in a Model of Monetary Policy’ by Robert J. Barro and\nDavid B. Gordon” in note 4.\n\n- 4 -\nAround that time, Ken Rogoff published his paper on what he referred to as\n“conservative” central bankers.6 In his terminology, a conservative central banker was\nsomeone who disliked inflation more than the rest of society did. Rogoff showed that a\nconservative central banker would choose a lower rate of inflation than the average\ncitizen but at the cost of greater instability of output and employment. This tradeoff\nimproved social well-being, but there was one catch to this solution—there had to be\nsafeguards to guarantee that the conservative central banker could not be fired for this\npolicy decision, ensuring that these promises to control inflation were credible. In short,\nthe central bank had to be independent and protected from the threats to its independence.\nThis type of institutional design issue was one that I was interested in researching.\nUp until Rogoff’s work, the underlying assumption had been that the central bank\nwas trying to maximize social welfare and that its preferences were aligned with those of\nsociety. Think of it as a “representative agent” economy. But as I read Rogoff’s work, it\nsuggested that society consisted of people who had a variety of views about inflation,\nmeaning that they would also have different views on the tradeoff between inflation and\noutput stability. Consequently, members of society may have different views on how\nconservative the central banker should be. But where are these views coming from?\nSo I tried to endogenize the heterogeneity in preferences. I had the idea that\nindividuals all had the same fundamental preferences for inflation and output stability but\nthat they varied if they worked in different sectors of the economy. In one sector, wages\nand employment were determined in a standard competitive fashion. In the other sector,\nwages were determined by wage contracts, and employment was determined by demand.\n6 See Kenneth Rogoff (1985), “The Optimal Degree of Commitment to an Intermediate Monetary Target,”\nQuarterly Journal of Economics, vol. 100 (November), pp. 1169–89.\n\n- 5 -\nThus, when a negative shock hit the economy, the wage contract workers suffered a\nbigger reduction in employment because wages couldn’t adjust, whereas in the\ncompetitive sector, wages would adjust to soften the blow to employment—implying that\nif the wage contract sector got to choose a conservative central banker, they would want a\nmore dovish central banker who would accept higher inflation in return for greater\nemployment stability. The flexible wage workers wanted the opposite: They were more\nhawkish on inflation because they didn’t bear the same employment volatility. The\npunchline was that if political parties formed around workers from different sectors, then\nthey would install central bankers with different policy preferences if they won the\nelection.\nIt was around that time that I read Alberto Alesina’s paper on “partisan business\ncycles.”7 In that paper, he assumed there were different political parties, each having\ndifferent preferences about inflation and unemployment. One party was more concerned\nwith price stability and less concerned about output stability than the other. Monetary\npolicy and inflation outcomes were determined by the party that won a national election.\nAs power changed hands after an election, monetary policy would differ from expected\npolicy depending on who won the election. These election surprises would create\nvolatility in monetary policy and thus inflation and output. In other words, elections\nwould lead to partisan business cycles. In Alesina’s model, monetary policy was fully\naccountable to the electorate, which is desirable, but it came at the cost of causing greater\neconomic instability.\n7 See Alberto Alesina (1987), “Macroeconomic Policy in a Two-Party System as a Repeated Game,”\nQuarterly Journal of Economics, vol. 102 (August), pp. 651–78.\n\n- 6 -\nThis was a brilliant paper, but, again, it raised a serious question for me: Why\nwould society choose full electoral accountability and maximum volatility in monetary\npolicy? Economists usually think there are tradeoffs on the margin such that “corner\nsolutions” like these aren’t optimal. It seemed to me that there could be a welfare-\nimproving institutional design for the central bank. I looked at the Federal Reserve’s\nBoard of Governors structure, and I felt that electoral accountability could be achieved\nthrough the appointment process, but economic instability would be reduced by having a\nmonetary policy board composed of current and past appointees who set policy according\nto majority rule. This thinking led me to taking a variant of Alesina’s model and\nstudying how a policy board would change his results.\nI assumed that board members were appointed by the winning party of an election\nto serve for multiple periods. This appointment process provided accountability to the\nelectorate via the nomination and confirmation process. To ensure that economic\nstability would be improved, I assumed these members served staggered and long\n(relative to the election cycle) terms in office.8 Furthermore, as in Rogoff’s model, board\nmembers could not be removed from office. This feature of the model captured the idea\nthat the central bank board would be independent.\nMy research showed that by having an independent policy board set monetary\npolicy, social well-being was improved relative to Alesina’s results. Accountability to\nthe electorate could be achieved through the nomination and confirmation process, and\n8 See Christopher J. Waller (1989), “Monetary Policy Games and Central Bank Politics,” Journal of\nMoney, Credit and Banking, vol. 21 (November), pp. 422–31; Christopher J. Waller (1992), “A Bargaining\nModel of Partisan Appointments to the Central Bank,” Journal of Monetary Economics, vol. 29 (June), pp.\n411–28; and Christopher J. Waller (2000), “Policy Boards and Policy Smoothing,” Quarterly Journal of\nEconomics, vol. 115 (February), pp. 305–39.\n\n- 7 -\neconomic stability was enhanced by having a group of individuals set policy who could\nnot be removed from office. This structure is the one that we have in place today at the\nFederal Reserve. I would argue that it has stood the test of time, and I hope that it\ncontinues to be in place for years to come.\nTo conclude, I have come full circle in my professional life—from first reading\nthat sentence that John wrote in 1983 to researching central bank independence and\ncentral bank boards for 20 years to then becoming a central bank board member, which\nled me here today. So, I can finally thank John for sending me on a wonderful journey\nthat he had no idea he launched me on.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n9:00 a.m. EDT\nOctober 16, 2025\nCutting Rates in the Face of Conflicting Data\nRemarks by\nChristopher J. Waller\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nCouncil on Foreign Relations\nNew York, New York\nOctober 16, 2025\n\nThank you, Tom, and thank you to the Council on Foreign Relations for the\nopportunity to speak to you today.1\nSince the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) last meeting on September\n16 and 17, economic data have tended to support my view of a labor market that is\nsoftening and inflation—absent temporary tariff effects—that is running fairly close to\nthe FOMC’s 2 percent target. Based on what I know today, I support continued easing of\nmonetary policy from its current setting, which I judge is moderately restricting\naggregate demand and economic activity. But I also see a conflict right now between\ndata showing solid growth in economic activity and data showing a softening labor\nmarket.2 So, something’s gotta give—either economic growth softens to match a soft\nlabor market, or the labor market rebounds to match stronger economic growth. Since we\ndon’t know which way the data will break on this conflict, we need to move with care\nwhen adjusting the policy rate to ensure we don’t make a mistake that will be costly to\ncorrect. I believe that how that process plays out in the coming months will have a\nsignificant impact on the path of monetary policy.\nResolving this conflict has been complicated by the government shutdown,\nwhich has delayed important economic data that policymakers and the public rely on to\njudge economic conditions. Although private-sector data alternatives are available and a\nhelpful complement to official statistics, they are less informative when they stand alone.\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 Some have suggested that this could be the result of higher productivity growth. However, technology\nthat improves labor productivity leads firms to demand more labor not less. Later in these remarks, I\nconsider whether AI may be contributing to the decline in recent net job creation, an effect on the margin of\nthe huge U.S. labor market, but it seems too soon in AI’s adoption for it to have significantly raised\nproductivity across the entire economy.\n.\n\n- 2 -\nThe delay in the September employment report in particular makes it harder to know\nwhether the labor market is continuing to soften or is stabilizing. The shutdown also\ndelayed today’s retail sales report for September, which would help show if household\nspending is continuing to support solid growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) or if\nthere are signs of slower spending that forecasters have been expecting for some time.\nYesterday’s and today’s releases on consumer and producer prices were also delayed,\ndata that is important in judging the impact of higher import tariffs and progress toward\nthe FOMC’s price-stability goal. The Administration has recalled some Labor\nDepartment employees to complete and release the consumer price inflation report on\nOctober 24—in time to inform the FOMC’s policy decision five days later.\nTo deal with this lack of public data, I spend a lot of my time talking to business\ncontacts, whose views help me form my outlook for the economy. So far that input tends\nto support—rather than resolve—the contrast we have seen between strong economic\nactivity and a softening labor market. Employers indicate to me that there was some\nfurther softening of the labor market last month, while retailers report continued solid\nspending, with a bit of caution from lower-income households.\nIn the balance of these remarks, I will examine other information we have on\neconomic activity, inflation, and the labor market, and what this implies for monetary\npolicy. While I feel confident, based on what I know today, that monetary policy should\ntake another step toward a more neutral setting at the FOMC’s next meeting, the path of\nappropriate policy beyond that point will be influenced by how the conflict between data\non economic activity and the labor market is resolved and the expected path of inflation.\n\n- 3 -\nWhile there are times when the data are consistent and paint a clear picture, the\neconomy is vast and complex, and it is quite often the case that some of the data we look\nat will point in a different direction from other data and make that picture of the economy\nfuzzy. Almost every month, I need to use some judgment in sifting signal from noise in\nthe economic data—it is just part of the job of economic forecasting and policymaking.\nLess often, but often enough, the conflicts in the data are consequential for the outlook.\nFor example, recall that in the first half of 2022, the data were creating a puzzle: GDP\nwas contracting while the economy created 2.7 million jobs.3 These conflicting data on\nthe performance of the economy complicated the decision on how to set the policy rate.\nWe are facing a similar problem today.\nI have been referring to the surprisingly strong data on economic activity, so let’s\nstart there. After real GDP expanded 2.8 percent last year, it slowed in the first half of\nthis year. GDP—after smoothing through the modest contraction in the first quarter and\nrobust growth of 3.8 percent in the second quarter—grew around 1.6 percent in the first\nhalf. This pattern of GDP growth is partially a result of consumption growth that showed\na similar pattern. Slower growth in spending and GDP made sense based on the\nrestrictive setting of monetary policy, but it was stronger than many expected with the\nimposition of sizable tariffs. And after not observing the effects of tariffs on household\nspending in the first half of the year, many thought it would show up in the third quarter.\nYet, the data we have for the third quarter indicate that growth has accelerated. Looking\nacross all the available data, the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow model is projecting another\n3 For a full discussion of how I was viewing this puzzle at the time, see Christopher J. Waller (2022),\n“Monetary Policy in a World of Conflicting Data,” speech delivered at the Rocky Mountain Economic\nSummit, Victor, Idaho, July 14, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20220714a.htm.\n\n- 4 -\nquarter of GDP growth close to 4 percent, while the Blue Chip consensus of private-\nsector forecasts has a prediction of 2.5 percent. Even if the published estimate is closer to\n2.5 percent, that is still not consistent with a labor market that has barely created any jobs\nsince May.\nOne sign that GDP may be expanding closer to the lower end of these estimates is\nthat business conditions seemed a bit softer in September, based on surveys of purchasing\nmanagers. The manufacturing sector continued to contract slightly—as it has since\nMarch. Purchasing managers for the large majority of businesses that are outside\nmanufacturing reported a slowdown from August to a level that is at the breakeven point\nbetween expansion and contraction.\nSomething that will affect the growth rate of GDP in the fourth quarter is the\nfederal government shutdown. If it is resolved in the next couple of weeks without major\nchanges in government staffing or funding, the shutdown will lower GDP growth several\ntenths of a percentage point in the fourth quarter and raise it the same amount in the first\nquarter of next year. But if the shutdown lasts considerably longer and does result in\npermanent staffing and spending cuts, then the drag in the fourth quarter could be larger\nand the bounceback smaller.\nLet me now turn to inflation. Twelve-month personal consumption expenditures\n(PCE) inflation rose in August to 2.7 percent, and core PCE inflation was up 2.9\npercent—both above the FOMC’s 2 percent target. Compared with an earlier era, when\ninflation ran close to 2 percent—from 2002 through 2007—core goods inflation is now\nrunning a half a percentage point higher, and research by Federal Reserve Board staff and\nothers indicates that most of this is due to the effects of tariffs. Though a partial pass-\n\n- 5 -\nthrough of tariffs will permanently raise the price level, tariffs will only temporarily\naffect the rate of inflation. The FOMC does not target the price level, but it does target 2\npercent inflation over the longer run. Since I expect tariff effects on inflation to fade in\nthe coming months, what matters for monetary policy is the rate of inflation outside of\ntariffs, and estimates by Federal Reserve staff indicate that this underlying rate of\ninflation is running fairly close to our target.4 With market-based measures of longer-\nterm inflation expectations apparently well anchored and a soft labor market keeping\ndown wage demands, I judge that inflation is on a path to a sustained level of 2 percent\nand should not itself be a barrier to moving monetary policy toward a more neutral\nsetting.\nGiven this benign view of inflation, I believe the ultimate disposition of the labor\nmarket will be the more salient factor affecting monetary policy. As I said, the broad\nmessage of all the labor market data is one of weakening in demand, relative to supply,\neven with substantially lower net immigration and a decline in labor force participation\nthis year. Monthly job creation went from an average of 111,000 in the first quarter to\n55,000 in the second, and the latest official report for August was 22,000. The numbers\nare nearly the same for the private sector, which I consider a better guide to the overall\nlabor market. Furthermore, based on an estimate of the benchmark revision to the level\nof employment in March 2025 and extrapolating forward for the rest of this year, when\nthe revisions are released next year it is likely that payroll employment has actually\nfallen, on net, since May. If the economy is growing as healthily as spending and GDP\n4 For a detailed discussion of the methodology to detect tariff effects on inflation, see Robbie Minton and\nMariano Somale (2025), “Detecting Tariff Effects on Consumer Prices in Real Time,” FEDS Notes\n(Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, May 9), https://doi.org/10.17016/2380-\n7172.3786.\n\n- 6 -\ndata indicate, I would expect that employment would recover in the coming months to a\npositive but not high level, reflecting the reduced labor supply that I just mentioned.\nHowever, if spending and GDP growth slow, and better reflect an economy that doesn’t\nseem to be creating jobs, then the labor market may continue to soften.\nWith the absence of the September employment report, we must rely on other data\nfor a sense of what happened last month. Alternative labor market data for September\npresent a mixed picture of how things are evolving. Private-sector employment tracked\nby the payroll services firm ADP points to continued slowing in job creation. ADP\nestimates that private employment fell 32,000 in September after falling 3,000 in August.\nThe company said that “job creation continued to lose momentum across most sectors.”5\nData on job postings on the online job search firm Indeed also point to a continued\ngradual reduction in employment but don’t signal of a significant downturn in hiring.\nIndeed’s openings data are useful in the absence of the September jobs report\nbecause, over time, they line up closely with another report for September that may be\ndelayed: the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS). The JOLTS data,\navailable through August, have been echoing what I have been hearing consistently from\nmy business contacts, which is that firms are holding on to workers but are not\nbackfilling positions or planning to expand hiring. Total separations are quite low by\nhistorical standards, and both layoffs and the number of people voluntarily quitting their\njobs are low. At the same time, the hiring rate has continued to fall and, outside of the\npandemic recession, is at its lowest level since 2012.\n5 ADP’s National Employment Report is available on its website at https://adpemploymentreport.com/.\n\n- 7 -\nThis situation may appear fairly stable, but I find this “no hire, no fire” stance by\nemployers a bit ominous. It is possible that many employers who found it hard to find\nqualified workers during the pandemic are especially reluctant to let them go, even in the\nface of considerable uncertainty about demand and staffing levels in the future. But\nwhen workers do leave, they are not being replaced. Businesses have reported that hiring\nand expansion are “on pause,” but some of my business contacts say that they can’t wait\nforever and will soon have to decide whether more or fewer employees are needed. Both\nbusiness and consumer surveys conducted by the New York Fed signal an upturn in\nexpectations about future levels of unemployment.6\nLooking further ahead, I can see two possible paths for the labor market.\nOn the one hand, we could see a stabilization of the labor market—in essence, it\ncould move toward the story that consumption and GDP seem to be telling. Despite more\nthan three years of restrictive monetary policy, spending has proved very resilient. Most\nforecasts called for a significant step-down in the pace of PCE growth this year, but that\nsizable slowdown hasn’t happened. One factor that may help explain this is that the\nsavings rate has been revised notably upward, resulting in higher disposable personal\nincome and more support for spending. It is possible that resilient spending will help\nconvince businesses to maintain staffing and even expand in the coming months, bringing\nabout a recovery in job creation. Another possibility is that r*—the interest rate below\nwhich monetary policy stimulates demand—is higher than most forecasters believe. If\n6 The September 2025 Business Leaders Survey is available on the New York Fed’s website at\nhttps://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/Survey/business_leaders/2025/2025_09blsreport.pdf?sc_l\nang=en&hash=872CB84D638D0F3D1A3F833365E25EF4; information from the most recent Survey of\nConsumer Expectations is also available at https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/sce#/.\n\n- 8 -\nthis were true, then the current setting of monetary policy may not be holding back\ndemand and economic activity very much, which would have implications for how\nquickly the FOMC should lower the policy rate.\nThose are some reasons why the labor market may strengthen and validate the\nstory being told, based on what we know so far, about economic activity in the third\nquarter. On the other hand, there are some reasons why the labor market could continue\nto soften while GDP growth steps down to a more moderate pace. For me, one of them is\nhow dependent consumption is on a relatively small number of higher-income\nconsumers. The highest-earning 10 percent of households are responsible for 22 percent\nof personal consumption. The top 20 percent of households spend 35 percent of the total.\nTheir share of stock market wealth is even more skewed, and lots of research shows that\nthese consumers are fairly unaffected by higher prices, higher unemployment, or a slower\neconomy. The bottom 60 percent of earners represent 45 percent of consumption and\nhold only 15 percent of wealth. Their spending decisions are much more likely to be\naffected by prices, financing conditions, and job availability. I have heard from business\ncontacts that this group has been affected by higher prices this year and is already\nchanging its spending plans to find better value.\nThat view was echoed in the Federal Reserve’s recently released Beige Book,\nwhich is a survey of business contacts.7 The consensus view across the country is that\nwhile consumer spending inched down in recent weeks, spending by higher-income\nhouseholds on luxury travel and accommodation was strong; lower- and middle-income\nhouseholds continued to seek discounts and promotions in the face of rising prices and\n7 The October 2025 Beige Book is available on the Federal Reserve Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/publications/beige-book-default.htm.\n\n- 9 -\nelevated economic uncertainty. At what point do higher prices prompt a larger cutback in\nspending by middle- and lower-income people?\nAnother reason for a greater weakening of the labor market is that artificial\nintelligence (AI) may reduce demand for workers. Over the past few months, retailers\nhave told me that they will reduce employment next year because of the efficiency gains\nfrom AI. Firms are saying that they can and will replace workers in call centers and IT\nsupport with AI robots. This echoes what I read recently about the largest private\nemployer in the United States: Walmart. Walmart says that despite expectations of solid\nsales growth, it plans to hold net employment steady for the next three years as AI\nreplaces or transforms different roles at the company.\nThat said, while AI adoption is widespread among large firms, it is not nearly as\ncommon among smaller firms, which account for a large share of the U.S. economy, so\nthe impact of AI on labor demand is uncertain. The implication of this for monetary\npolicy is not so clear. Monetary policy addresses cyclical fluctuations in the economy,\nbut if AI constitutes a structural shift in the demand for labor, monetary policy will not be\nan effective tool. Overall, I see AI as a short-term risk for the labor market, but, in the\nlong run, AI should bring productivity gains that will be welfare improving.8\nSo where does all this leave monetary policy? Tariffs have modest effects on\ninflation, but with underlying inflation close to our goal and expectations of future\ninflation well anchored, I believe we are on track toward the FOMC’s 2 percent goal. As\na result, my focus is on the labor market, where payroll gains have weakened this year\n8 For more discussion of how I see AI affecting the economy, see Christopher J. Waller (2025), “Innovation\nat the Speed of AI,” speech delivered at DC Fintech Week, Arlington, Va., October 15,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20251015a.htm.\n\n- 10 -\nand employment may well be shrinking already. Lower labor supply has surely reduced\nwhat would be a good monthly rate of job creation, but I am very skeptical that it could\nbe zero, or a negative number. Based on all of the data we have on the labor market, I\nbelieve that the FOMC should reduce the policy rate another 25 basis points at our\nmeeting that concludes October 29. But beyond that point, I will be looking for how the\nsolid GDP data reconcile with the softening labor market.\nIf GDP growth holds up or accelerates and the labor market accordingly recovers,\nit might be an indication that policy is less restrictive than I thought and that the pace\ntoward a neutral setting for the policy rate should be slower than I expected at the last\nFOMC meeting. What I would want to avoid is rekindling inflationary pressure by\nmoving too quickly and squandering the significant progress we have made taming\ninflation.\nOn the other hand, if the labor market continues to soften or even weaken and\ninflation remains in check, then I believe the FOMC should proceed to reduce the policy\nrate toward a neutral level, which I judge is about 100 to 125 basis points lower than it is\ntoday. The labor market has been sending some clear warnings lately, and we should be\nready to act if those warnings are validated by what we learn in the coming weeks and\nmonths.\nThank you.",

Waller\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nSibos 2025\nFrankfurt, Germany\nSeptember 29, 2025\n\nThank you for inviting me to speak here today.1 The theme for Sibos this year, “the next\nfrontiers of global finance” is a fitting one. We are indeed witnessing a new frontier of\ninnovation in payments and the broader financial system. New technologies like distributed\nledgers, tokenized assets, smart contracts, and artificial intelligence (AI) have the potential to\nmake payments smarter, faster, and more efficient. I know many of you in the audience today\nrepresent firms that are using the latest cutting-edge advances to bring new global solutions to\nthe market.\nThe conference theme also accurately captures that we are at the next frontier. I often\nnote that the modern history of payments is a story of technological innovation.2 The history\nspans from the last century, when payments and securities transfers were converted from paper\nto electronic solutions, to the present day when we increasingly have payment systems that\nprocess transactions in real time, 24/7.\nLastly, the conference theme recognizes the global nature of payments and financial\ninfrastructures that underpin international commerce. Of particular focus in this domain are\ncross-border payments, which involve transactions across a layered and complex set of networks\nand experience frictions that contribute to higher costs, slower speeds, limited transparency, and\nbarriers to access. Multiple opportunities for improvement exist in international payments,\nincluding improvements to smaller-value remittances, business-to-business payments, and\ncollateral management in capital markets.\n1 Thank you to Alex Sproveri, Kirstin Wells, and Priyanka Slattery of the Federal Reserve Board for their assistance\nin preparing this text. The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the\nFederal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 See Christopher J. Waller, “Technological Advancements in Payments,” speech delivered at the Wyoming\nBlockchain Symposium, Teton Village, WY, August 20, 2025,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/waller20250820a.pdf.\n\n- 2 -\nAs we enter the next frontier, let us remember that this is not a new story and that we\nshould not fear new technologies, nor new types of providers. Instead, we should ask how new\ntechnologies could benefit all types of actors, including the most sophisticated financial firms as\nwell as consumers, while not losing sight of the need for guardrails that promote safety for\nconsumers and the broader financial system. In addition, we should ask how new technologies\ncould be used to upgrade the infrastructures that serve as critical components to the global\nfinancial system, in a way that maintains and extends safety and resilience. These are the topics\nI will consider today.\nChoice and competition\nI approach these issues fundamentally as an economist and as a firm believer in the free\nmarket. In particular, I would highlight the importance of choice in how markets function and\nhow competition develops. In general, choices encourage competition, leading to better quality\nproducts and services. Businesses innovate to differentiate products, including by incorporating\nnew technical capabilities. This improves market responsiveness to consumer demand.\nBusinesses also incorporate new technologies to compete on cost and efficiency. I see\nstablecoins, for example, as simply another choice available to consumers and businesses, where\nthey have signaled a need in the market to further improve payments.3 I believe that we must\ntake this articulated need seriously and respect the ability of the private sector to develop\nsolutions.\nThis dynamic is nothing new. Market participants have long had choices in the types of\npayment instruments they use. Public and private forms of money coexisting, in multiple forms,\n3 See Christopher J. Waller, “Reflections on Stablecoins and Payments Innovations,” speech at “Planning for\nSurprises, Learning from Crises” 2021 Financial Stability Conference, Cleveland, OH, November 17, 2021,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20211117a.htm.\n\n- 3 -\nis in fact a common feature in all developed economies. In the United States, consumers have\nhad central bank money in the form of cash, commercial bank money in the form of deposits in a\nbank account, and nonbank money (or “e-money”) in the form of a funds balance on a nonbank\npayment app. Stablecoins are simply a new form of private money and will exist alongside these\nother payment instruments, provided consumers accept them as safe, low-risk assets with\nregulatory protections.4\nConsumers and businesses have for decades also had a choice of providers of payment\nservices and financial products including banks, card networks, nonbank payment service\nproviders, and, more recently, other fintechs. Having a choice of providers is important because\nneeds and preferences vary among consumers and businesses. I may choose one provider if I\nwant to park my emergency fund in a high-yield savings account, and I may choose different\nproviders if I want to process a cross-border payment, pay someone with a QR code, or buy a\ncrypto-asset. A choice of providers also encourages competition on cost, speed, efficiency, and\nuser experience.\nAdditionally, firms have options for payments and financial infrastructure, which is\nimportant because firms might choose to route money or securities on different rails depending\non business needs. Some may value speed; some may prefer the ability to batch payments and\nsettle on net to capture liquidity savings. Some will prefer the features of a centralized financial\nmarket infrastructure and its built-in regulatory guardrails; some may prefer to transact on public\nblockchains, with different models for achieving security and integrity. Having multiple options\nis also good for public policy objectives like promoting resilience across the broader payment\nsystem.\n4 See Christopher J. Waller, “Reflections on Stablecoins and Payments.”\n\n- 4 -\nAssessing benefits of the next frontier of innovations\nGiven this backdrop of new technologies and new entrants within a competitive market,\nlet’s explore how this could lead to positive economic outcomes.\nFirst, will the next frontier of innovations translate to lower costs? An influx of new\nmarket entrants certainly has the potential to drive down costs as they compete for customers,\nparticularly if blockchain-based transactions prove to be cheaper. If stablecoins present a lower\ncost alternative to consumers and businesses, I am all for it. We are already seeing this dynamic\ndevelop outside of the United States, where U.S. dollar stablecoins are an attractive option in\ncountries in which access to dollar banking services is expensive or limited. We also know that\ncross-border payments, in particular remittances, are relatively expensive. This is attributable in\npart to the complexity of transactions involving multiple infrastructures, currencies, and\nintermediaries. One way in which innovative technologies could translate to lower costs is\nthrough efficiency gains.\nThis brings me to my second question: how might new technologies improve the\nefficiency of the payment system? Distributed ledger technology, or DLT, is rapidly becoming\nan efficient infrastructure for 24/7 transactions, recordkeeping, and data management by\nenabling multiple platforms, parties, assets, and functions to be combined in new ways. As an\nexample, DLT-based platforms can support 24/7 real-time payments and securities transfers by\nusing programmable functionalities like smart contracts to enhance operational efficiency and\nautomate more complex financial transactions. With the ability to specify the precise time at\nwhich a transaction settles and under what conditions, DLT-based platforms have the potential to\nincrease the flexibility and efficiency of settlement for money and assets.\n\n- 5 -\nMany cross-border payments today rely on the correspondent banking model—a network\nof bilateral banking relationships that enables financial institutions to access foreign financial\nsystems and to conduct business across jurisdictions without establishing physical and legal\npresence in every market they serve. While correspondent banking has been the backbone of\nglobal payments for decades, this model faces several challenges, including high transaction\ncosts, slower processing times, and a global decline in correspondent banking relationships.\nWhile these frictions are attributed in part to the process of sending payments through a complex\nchain of correspondent banks, I should note that not all frictions are barriers to overcome.\nCertain frictions are purposely built into the global payment system for compliance and risk-\nmanagement reasons, such as preventing money laundering and countering the financing of\nterrorism.5\nDLT-based platforms have the potential to improve upon the existing correspondent\nbanking model, and private-sector firms are pursuing multiple approaches to do so. One way is\nthrough the “stablecoin sandwich” model, in which fiat currency in one country is converted first\ninto a stablecoin, then that stablecoin is transferred to another individual, and then converted\nback into the local fiat currency at its destination. Another way is through the use of tokenized\ndeposits, where banks represent deposit liabilities on a blockchain for wholesale and cross-\nborder transactions. Either model has the potential to improve transparency, cost, and timeliness,\nwhile balancing the need for safety and integrity of the transfer. DLT-based platforms generally\n(and stablecoins, specifically) may also present opportunities for efficiency gains in remittance\npayments, where today, money transfer operators rely on large global networks of agents and\npre-position capital in various currencies to pay out customers in different jurisdictions. These\n5 See Christopher J. Waller, “Interlinking Fast Payment Systems,” speech delivered at the Global Fintech Fest 2024,\nMumbai, India, August 28, 2024, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240828a.htm.\n\n- 6 -\nexamples also demonstrate that innovation is not an issue of “TradFi” versus “DeFi,” but rather\nposes an opportunity to harness the complementary strengths each has to offer, especially at a\ntime where we are seeing increased convergence between the two.\nImportantly, efficiency will depend on the extent to which DLT networks can\ninteroperate with one another and with traditional payment rails. This is particularly true\nbecause payments exhibit significant network effects. Fortunately, numerous private-sector\nadvances in interoperability are emerging given this market need, and as an operator of core\npayment and settlement infrastructure, we at the Federal Reserve continue to assess how we can\nimprove our existing rails that serve private-sector firms.\nLet’s turn from DLT to AI. AI can further improve the efficiency of payments in a\nnumber of ways, including through automating manual tasks, detecting fraud or compliance\nrisks, and now with agentic AI, executing tasks on behalf of a person or company quickly and\ncheaply through the use of AI agents.6 Let’s again take the example of cross-border payments,\nwhich involve multiple jurisdictions, each with its own compliance requirements. Firms are\nincreasingly exploring AI and machine learning (as well as smart contracts) to automate\ncompliance activities.\nThird, can new technologies and products maintain and build trust in the digital\necosystem? I believe they can. One common criticism of stablecoins is that they will somehow\nundermine the trust in money. Under regulatory frameworks like the GENIUS Act in the United\nStates, payment stablecoins will be backed at least 1 to 1 with safe, liquid assets and users will be\nable to redeem their stablecoins at par. I have long advocated that a right-sized regulatory\n6 For additional discussion on AI in payments, see Christopher J. Waller, “Technological Advancements in\nPayments.”\n\n- 7 -\nframework can address concerns related to safety and financial stability, while allowing\nstablecoins to scale on their own merits.7\nAs with any technology, ecosystem operators will need to assess and manage risks,\nincluding cybersecurity. As payments shift to new rails and include stablecoins, tokenized\nassets, and smart contracts, new opportunities for cyberattacks will emerge. Achieving security\nand resilience means ensuring these digital platforms are hardened against misuse, with\nredundancy and safeguards in place that match the scale of domestic and global payments.\nBuilding resilience requires both the private and public sectors to work together on standards,\ncybersecurity, and risk management, so that innovation goes hand-in-hand with safety.\nRoles of the private and public sectors\nThis brings me to the roles that the private and public sectors can play at the next frontier\nof payments innovation. I often argue that the private sector can most reliably and efficiently\nallocate resources and take risks to explore the value of new technologies.8 The private sector is\nalso best positioned to serve consumers and provide products and services that meet their needs.\nYou don’t want the government to decide what technologies are in or out, or decide what\nconsumers want. Further, the private sector brings a depth and level of technical expertise\nrequired to translate new technologies into practical improvements for payments.\nThe role of the public sector is to support the private sector in specific circumstances\nwhere that is useful. At the Federal Reserve, that means serving as a convener to solve\ncoordination problems, providing regulatory clarity when within our specific remit, and\n7 See Christopher J. Waller, “Reflections on a Maturing Stablecoin Market,” speech delivered at A Very Stable\nConference, San Francisco, CA, February 12, 2025,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/waller20250212a.pdf.\n8 See Christopher J. Waller, “What Roles Should the Private Sector and the Federal Reserve Play in Payments?”\nspeech delivered at The Clearing House Annual Conference 2024, New York, NY, November 12, 2024,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/waller20241112a.pdf .\n\n- 8 -\noperating core payment and settlement infrastructure that the private sector uses.\nComplementary private and public roles can contribute to a safe and efficient payment system.\nLooking ahead, I believe it is important to understand how the Federal Reserve can\ncontinue to support private-sector innovation. One way is to conduct research and\nexperimentation on emerging technologies. At the Federal Reserve, we are conducting hands-on\nresearch on the latest wave of innovations, including tokenization, smart contracts, and AI in\npayments. We do this to understand how private-sector innovators will use these to improve\npayments, as well as identify any opportunities to upgrade our own payment infrastructures.\nAnother way is to engage actively with industry on innovations. That is why, in three\nweeks, I am convening industry leaders and U.S. policymakers to discuss how to further improve\nthe payment system. That is also why I appreciate coming to events like Sibos, where industry\nexperts within the private sector engage with public-sector officials to discuss how we can best\nnavigate the next frontier of innovations.

Waller\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nSociety of Professional Economists Annual Dinner\nLondon, United Kingdom\nNovember 17, 2025\n\nThank you to the Society for the honor of addressing your annual meeting.1 In\ndoing a little research on the SPE’s history, I noted that one goal cited by the business\neconomists who founded this group was creating a forum to discuss the divergence\nbetween real-world challenges and economic theory. That task is pressing when business\nprofits, losses, and the jobs of employees are on the line, and the stakes are also high for\neconomic policymakers, who face those very challenges today.\nEconomies are confoundingly difficult to understand because, in a sense, they are\nthe largest and most complex things ever created by humans. Economists try to make\nsense of this complicated world and explain in logical and clear terms how to understand\nit. We develop rigorous theories that yield testable hypotheses, and we test those\nhypotheses to see if they are supported or rejected by the data. Being both an economist\nand economic policymaker, my objective today is to follow in that tradition and use\neconomic theory and various types of data to describe my outlook for the U.S. economy\nand my views on the appropriate course of monetary policy. It may seem odd to come all\nthe way to London to speak about the U.S. economy, but I hope it will be of interest—\nand I did warn the organizers about what I would talk about. Monetary policymakers like\nto use forward guidance to avoid surprises.\nFormulating my outlook has been complicated recently by the 43-day government\nshutdown, including the agencies that produce key economic data. As I will argue, I\nbelieve the challenge presented by this missing data has been overstated in many\nquarters. Policymakers and forecasters are not “flying blind” or “in a fog.” While it is\nalways nice to have more data, as economists, we are skilled at using whatever available\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\ndata there is to formulate forecasts. Despite the government shutdown, we have a wealth\nof private and some public-sector data that provide an imperfect but perfectly actionable\npicture of the U.S. economy.\nSo, what is that data telling us? First, that the labor market is still weak and near\nstall speed. Second, that inflation through September continued to show relatively small\neffects from tariffs and support the hypothesis that tariffs are having a one-off effect\nraising price levels in the U.S. and are not a persistent source of inflation. Accounting for\nestimated tariff effects, underlying inflation is relatively close to the Federal Open\nMarket Committee’s (FOMC) 2 percent target. Third, despite realized inflation running\nclose to 3 percent and above target for five years, medium- and longer-term inflation\nexpectations remain well anchored. And, lastly, even excluding the temporary effects of\nthe shutdown, growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) has likely slowed in the\nsecond half of 2025 from its fast pace in the second quarter.\nThis reading of the data leads me, at this moment, to support a cut in the FOMC’s\npolicy rate at our next meeting on December 9 and 10 as a matter of risk management.\nAs I will discuss in more detail, risk management, in fact, provides some practical\nguidance in dealing with two questions that seem to have flummoxed some people: Is the\njob-creation slowdown in the U.S. this year mostly supply or demand related, and how\nshould monetary policy respond?\nBefore I delve into the outlook, I’d like to say a bit more about data availability.\nThe official sources delayed by the U.S. government shutdown are important but by no\nmeans the only source of information for Fed policymakers about the economy. At any\ntime, my colleagues and I rely on a range of data to form our views on economic\n\n- 3 -\nconditions and the outlook. That can be “hard” data, such as official government\nstatistics, or “soft” data, gleaned from surveys or conversations with a variety of people.\nOften, different sources of data are consistent with each other, but at critical times they\ncan conflict. When that happens, it takes our skills as economists to reconcile this\nconflict.\nLet me cite two examples of my own experience to illustrate this point. First,\nback in 2022, the Fed was combating rampant inflation, and this required large and rapid\nincreases in our policy rate. Standard Phillips curve models predicted that this would\ncause a sharp slowdown in economic growth and high unemployment. However, I had\nmore trust in the Beveridge curve, which relates the unemployment rate to the job\nvacancy rate, as my guide to thinking about how the labor market would respond to these\nlarge rate hikes. I argued that we were on the steep part of the Beveridge curve, which\nmeant that we could tighten policy and that the brunt of the effect would be borne by a\ndecline in job vacancies, and crucially, not by the higher unemployment many predicted.\nA critical assumption I made was that a spike in layoffs would not occur. This\nassumption was controversial, since previous hard data showed that this was not the\ntypical outcome. But all of my business contacts at that time were telling me about their\nstruggles to find and keep workers since the COVID-19 pandemic and that they had no\nintention of letting workers go if aggregate demand eased. This “soft” data helped\nconvince me that my view of the labor market was correct, and subsequent “hard” data\nconfirmed my theoretical prediction.\nThe second example of reconciling conflicting data is from this past summer.\nFrom late spring through June, the soft data, including anecdotes from business contacts,\n\n- 4 -\nsuggested the labor market was in a “no hire, no fire” equilibrium. Firms repeatedly said\nthey were holding off on hiring for a variety of reasons. Yet the hard data at that time\nindicated a robust job market, with job creation rising from a monthly average of 110,000\nin the first quarter to 150,000 in the second quarter. It was clear to me that, once again,\nsomething wasn’t quite right with the labor market despite the official data. After the\nJune FOMC meeting, I said that the labor market was more fragile than the hard data\nindicated and that the Committee needed to cut the policy rate to head off substantial\nweakening in the labor market.2 This was clearly an out-of-consensus view that raised\nmore than a few eyebrows. But when the July jobs report was released on August 1, the\nsecond-quarter jobs numbers were revised down dramatically—from an average of\n150,000 per month to 64,000 a month, which vindicated my view. So, once again, the\nsoft data gave a better signal of the state of the labor market than the hard data.\nNow let me turn to the outlook, and I will start with U.S. economic activity. In\nmy last speech, I discussed an apparent conflict between some forecasts of GDP growth\nin the second half of 2025 and the story that the labor market is weakening.3 In the\nabsence of more official data but with additional private-sector forecasts and surveys, it\nnow appears to me that economic activity is not accelerating and, therefore, is tracking\nmore closely with the weak labor market data than appeared to be the case when I spoke\non October 16. For example, private-sector forecasts, as seen by the median of\nrespondents to the Blue Chip survey, are pointing to real GDP growth for the second half\n2 For a discussion of the tension in the hard and soft labor market data, see Christopher J. Waller (2025),\n“The Case for Cutting Now,” speech delivered at the Money Marketeers of New York University, New\nYork, New York, July 17, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250717a.htm.\n3 See Christopher J. Waller (2025), “Cutting Rates in the Face of Conflicting Data,” speech delivered at the\nCouncil on Foreign Relations, New York, New York, October 16,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20251016a.htm.\n\n- 5 -\nof this year that will be close to the modest first-half pace and a significant slowing from\nthe pace of last year.\nOf course, one factor lowering economic growth in the fourth quarter is the\nshutdown, which lasted longer than many expected. I continue to assume that any loss in\nreal GDP growth in the fourth quarter will boost growth by roughly the same amount\nearly next year. But besides that one-off boost from the shutdown, a possible warning\nabout future economic activity is coming from a survey of consumer sentiment conducted\nby the University of Michigan. While over the decades this survey has not been closely\ncorrelated with near-term spending, large and persistent drops in consumer sentiment\nhave occurred heading into recessions. In the United States, personal consumption\nexpenditures are about 70 percent of GDP, so a slowdown in spending has dramatic\nimplications for GDP growth. The Michigan survey is down significantly since July and\nfell unexpectedly sharply in October to near its record low reading. The dour view\nexpressed by consumers, which may have been affected by the shutdown, lines up with\nwhat I am hearing from U.S. businesses, which report slackening demand from middle-\nand lower-income consumers.\nOne interesting detail from that survey is that deteriorating consumer sentiment\nwas widespread among different demographic groups, with the exception of those who\nown stocks. While the booming stock market is supporting spending by a narrow band of\nwell-off consumers, it does not reflect financial conditions for most Americans, and that\nis a vulnerability for the economy. The rise in the stock market is substantially driven by\nartificial intelligence (AI)–related businesses that only account for a small share of\n\n- 6 -\nemployment.4 Even while AI’s share of stock market growth and corporate profits grew\nsignificantly from 2021 through 2024, employment in AI-related firms held steady at less\nthan 3 percent of nonfarm employment. While I believe AI will create jobs in the\nmedium term, the AI boom on Wall Street isn’t doing so yet.\nA factor that I believe will weigh on spending in the coming months is that most\nhouseholds are facing strains in purchasing large assets, such as housing and autos, in\npart because of the expense. While home price increases have slowed recently and even\ndeclined in some parts of the country, prices rose significantly in the past few years. That\nis especially true for lower-value homes, which is making it harder for first-time buyers.\nAlthough mortgage rates have declined a bit this year, they are still above\n6 percent and much higher than the average for the decade or so before rates began rising\nin 2022. Housing affordability is near a record low. Since 2020, the income needed to\nafford a median priced home has risen by 50 percent, while median income through 2024\nwas up about 26 percent.5 And while the growth of mortgage debt has slowed, that in\npart reflects how high mortgage rates are weighing on demand for mortgages.\nTurning to auto loan growth, it has been relatively weak this year, likely reflecting\na combination of weak demand from households and pressures in car affordability. To a\ngreater extent than housing, the cost of purchasing an auto mostly reflects the price, but\n4 Between 2021 and 2024, the workforce of AI-related firms stayed at levels equivalent to less than\n3 percent of the entire U.S. nonfarm labor employment—that is, a small number of firms are accounting for\nan increasingly larger share of corporate profits but are not growing their share of labor demand at a\ncommensurate pace.\n5 See https://www.bankrate.com/real-estate/home-affordability-in-current-housing-market-\nstudy/#:~:text=See%20more-\n,Income%20needed%20to%20afford%20a%20typical%20home%20verges%20on%20$117,000,2025,%20\naccording%20to%20Bankrate%20data. Also see https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MEPAINUSA646N\n\n- 7 -\ninterest rates play a factor in the monthly payment. Auto loan rates continue to be\nelevated relative to their average in the years before the pandemic. For example, in 2019,\nthe average five-year loan carried a 5.3 percent interest rate, whereas the average is now\n7.6 percent.6 Reflecting the combination of higher auto prices and interest rate expenses,\nthe weeks of median income needed to purchase an average new vehicle remains\nelevated, rising from 32.8 weeks in November 2019 to 37.4 weeks in September this\nyear.7\nTo sum up, I consider the costs of housing and autos to be an ongoing challenge\nfor consumers, especially lower- and middle-income consumers. This is likely weighing\non spending growth and would become a more acute problem if the labor market\ncontinues to weaken.\nNow let me turn to inflation, which, even with the delay in price data is the more\nstraightforward side of the FOMC’s dual mandate to discuss. Twelve-month consumer\nprice index inflation through September was 3 percent, and estimates are that inflation\nbased on personal consumption expenditures—the FOMC’s targeted measure—was\nabout 2.8 percent. Tariff effects have been smaller than many forecasters expected and\nthe fraction borne by consumers will only modestly boost inflation—an effect that has\nbeen quite gradual so far because of the slow drawdown of inventories that was built up\nin anticipation of tariffs.\nDespite inflation that has been above target for five years, inflation expectations\nare well anchored in the medium and longer run. To me, this shows that financial\n6 See “Finance Rate on Consumer Installment Loans at Commercial Banks, New Autos 60 Month Loan,”\nFederal Reserve Economic Data, https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/RIFLPBCIANM60NM.\n7 See Cox Automotive (2025), “September Incentives Hit High, but Record Prices Keep New-Vehicle\nAffordability Tight,” October 15, https://www.coxautoinc.com/insights-hub/sept-2025-vai.\n\n- 8 -\nmarkets understand that they need to look through one-time price-level shocks and that\nthey have confidence the FOMC will achieve its 2 percent target in the medium term.\nWith the evidence of slower economic growth and the prospect of only modest wage\nincreases from the weak labor market, I don’t see any factors that would cause an\nacceleration of inflation.\nLet me now focus on the side of the FOMC’s economic mandate that has more of\nmy attention—maximum employment. In the absence of federal data on the labor\nmarket, states have continued to report on initial and continuing unemployment insurance\nclaims and private-sector sources have continued to publish their data as well. While\nthere are methodological differences in these private data—some of it that is less than\ncomprehensive and some that does not meet the strictest statistical standards—the private\ndata do contain useful information.\nAccording to the Labor Department, we know that job creation in the U.S. stalled\nfrom May through August, and with expected revisions that have been previewed and\nwill become official next year, it is likely that employment actually fell over that period.\nA private-sector measure of job creation that has continued since August, produced by\nthe payroll services firm ADP, mirrored the drop in official data from May through\nAugust, reporting a monthly average of 27,000 jobs created over that period, compared to\nthe 143,000 a month that ADP counted for the six months up to May. While the ADP\ndata are quite volatile and have some other shortcomings that make them less reliable\nthan government statistics, I do think these data are telling us something. And in\nSeptember and October, ADP reported that businesses created a net total of only 6,500\njobs a month. And the latest weekly data are even weaker.\n\n- 9 -\nSlowing labor demand is also being echoed in surveys of employers and workers.\nThere has been a steady decline this year in the Conference Board index of job\navailability reported by employers. Fewer small businesses are saying it is hard to fill\njobs according to the National Federation of Independent Business. Meanwhile, job\npostings by Indeed continued to drift lower in October. A new survey of large employers\nfound that these companies are predicting that 2026 will be the worst job market for new\ncollege graduates since the pandemic year of 2021, when the unemployment rate was\naround 6 percent at graduation time.8\nOne series of government labor market data that we do have, continuing state-\nlevel claims for unemployment benefits, have risen, on net, in recent weeks and are\nrunning above levels in 2023 and 2024, although they are still fairly low by historical\nstandards. This increase reflects the fact that it is taking unemployed individuals longer\nto find jobs than in the recent past. This is consistent with the well-known news lately\nabout large corporate layoffs. Such announcements are anecdotes and may not be fully\nreflected, at least yet, in initial unemployment claims. But the numbers are eyepopping.\nThe staffing firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported announcements of 153,000 job\ncuts in September and around 1 million so far in 2025, which is up 65 percent from 2024.\nBy all accounts, many businesses may be cutting jobs, or allowing levels to fall by\nattrition, in connection with actual or anticipated productivity gains from AI.\nAs you may know, there is a vigorous debate in the U.S. about whether the low\njob-creation numbers are the result of declining labor supply or declining labor demand.\n8 See Lindsay Ellis (2025), “Companies Predict 2026 Will Be the Worst College Grad Job Market in Five\nYears,” Wall Street Journal, November 13.\n\n- 10 -\nSimply looking at job-creation numbers isn’t sufficient to answer the question—one must\nlook at other data that correspond to these changes.\nTo help sort things out, let’s think about a standard supply and demand diagram.\nConsider a situation where there is a decline in labor supply that is greater than a decline\nin labor demand. This would shift the supply curve inward more than the demand curve.\nThe result would be a reduction in employment, which is what we have seen. But it\nwould also lead to upward pressure on wages due to labor shortages. We should also see\nan increase in job vacancies and a higher quits rate as workers chase higher-paying jobs.\nFurthermore, workers should be reporting that job availability is increasing, and firms\nshould be saying that it’s becoming more difficult to hire workers. Now consider the\nopposite situation: a contraction in labor demand that is greater than the decline in labor\nsupply. Again, this would lead to a reduction in employment. But it would also\ncorrespond to downward pressure on wages from an excess supply of labor as well as\ndeclines in vacancies and quit rates; workers would be reporting that job availability is\nfalling, and firms would be saying that hiring is getting easier.\nSo, which of these two situations are the data telling me we are in? It is clear to\nme that the data are saying that there has been a greater reduction in demand than supply.\nI’m not seeing or hearing stories of an acceleration in wage growth, an increase in job\nopenings, or a rise in the quits rate. The overwhelming share of the data I have cited so\nfar supports the weaker demand story. There is definitely a reduction in supply, but, to\nme, that is masking the extent of the reduction in demand that I am concerned about.\nWhen outcomes are uncertain, policymakers must manage the risks, and the evidence is\n\n- 11 -\npointing toward a greater risk that low job creation is predominantly demand driven.\nThis has implications for monetary policy.\nSo let’s talk about the implications of this hard and soft data. With underlying\ninflation close to the FOMC’s target and evidence of a weak labor market, I support\ncutting the Committee’s policy rate by another 25 basis points at our December meeting.\nFor reasons I have explained, I am not worried about inflation accelerating or inflation\nexpectations rising significantly. My focus is on the labor market, and after months of\nweakening, it is unlikely that the September jobs report later this week or any other data\nin the next few weeks would change my view that another cut is in order. I worry that\nrestrictive monetary policy is weighing on the economy, especially about how it is\naffecting lower-and middle-income consumers. A December cut will provide additional\ninsurance against an acceleration in the weakening of the labor market and move policy\ntoward a more neutral setting.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n12:40 p.m. EST\nNovember 17, 2021\nReflections on Stablecoins and Payments Innovations\nRemarks by\nChristopher J. Waller\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Planning for Surprises, Learning from Crises”\n2021 Financial Stability Conference, cohosted by\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and the Office of Financial Research\nCleveland, Ohio\n(via webcast)\nNovember 17, 2021\n\nThe U.S. payment system is experiencing a technology-driven revolution.\nShifting consumer preferences and the introduction of new products and services from a\nwide variety of new entities have led to advancements in payments technology. This\ndynamic landscape has also sparked an active policy debate—about the risks these new\ndevelopments pose, how regulators should address them, and whether the government\nshould offer an alternative of its own.\nEarlier this year, I spoke about the last of these questions: whether the Fed should\noffer a general-purpose central bank digital currency (CBDC) to the American public.1\nMy skepticism about the need for a CBDC, which I still hold, comes in part from the real\nand rapid innovation taking place in payments. My argument—simple as it sounds—is\nthat payments innovation, and the competition it brings, is good for consumers. The\nmarket and the public are telling us there is room for improvement in the U.S. payment\nsystem. We should take that message to heart and provide a safe and sound way for those\nimprovements to occur.\nMy remarks today focus on “stablecoins,” the highest-profile example of a new\nand fast-growing payments technology.2 Stablecoins are a type of digital asset designed\nto maintain a stable value relative to a national currency or other reference assets.\nStablecoins have piggybacked off the recent increase in crypto-asset activity, and their\nmarket capitalization has increased almost fivefold in just the past year.3 Stablecoins can\n1 See Christopher J. Waller (2021), “CBDC: A Solution in Search of a Problem?” speech delivered at the\nAmerican Enterprise Institute, Washington (via webcast), August 5,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20210805a.htm.\n2 These views are my own and do not represent any position of the Board of Governors or other Federal\nReserve policymakers.\n3 See President’s Working Group on Financial Markets, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and Office\nof the Comptroller of the Currency (2021), Report on Stablecoins (Washington: PWG, FDIC, and OCC,\nNovember) https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/StableCoinReport_Nov1_508.pdf.\n\n- 2 -\nbe thought of in two forms. Some serve as a “safe, liquid” asset in the decentralized\nfinance, or DeFi, world of crypto-trading. Examples include Tether and USD Coin.\nAlternatively, there are stablecoins that are intended to serve as an instrument for retail\npayments between consumers and firms. Although these types of stablecoins have not\ntaken off yet, some firms are working to assess the viability of such stablecoins as a retail\npayment instrument. This growth in usage of stablecoins and their potential to serve as a\nretail payment instrument has prompted regulatory attention, including a new report from\nthe President’s Working Group on Financial Markets (PWG). This report urges the\nCongress to limit the issuance of “payment stablecoins” to banks and other insured\ndepository institutions.\nFostering responsible payments innovation means setting clear and appropriate\nrules of the road for everyone to follow. We know how to handle that task, and we\nshould tackle it head-on. The PWG report lays out one path to responsible innovation,\nand I applaud that effort. However, I also believe there may be others that better promote\ninnovation and competition while still protecting consumers and addressing risks to\nfinancial stability. This is the right time to debate such approaches, and it is important to\nget them right. If we do not, these technologies may move to other jurisdictions—posing\nrisks to U.S. markets that we will be much less able to manage.\nStablecoins: What’s Old, and What’s New\nStablecoin arrangements involve a range of legal and operational structures across\na range of distributed ledger networks. They are a genuinely new product, based on\ngenuinely new technology. But despite the jargon surrounding stablecoins, we can also\n\n- 3 -\nunderstand them as a new version of something older and more familiar: the bank\ndeposit.4\nAs I have said before, both the government and the private sector play\nindispensable roles in the U.S. monetary system. The Federal Reserve offers both\nphysical “central bank money” to the general public in the form of physical currency and\ndigital “central bank money” to depository institutions in the form of digital accounts.\nCommercial banks, in turn, give households and businesses access to “commercial bank\nmoney,” crediting checking and savings accounts when a customer deposits cash or takes\nout a loan. This privately created money serves as a bridge between the central bank and\nthe public.\nCommercial bank money is a form of private debt. The bank issuing that debt\npromises to honor it at a fixed, one-to-one exchange rate with central bank money. The\nbank itself is responsible for keeping that promise. However, the bank is supported in\nthat task by a tried-and-true system of public support. That includes regulation and\nsupervision, which ensure banks are safe and sound, not taking imprudent risks in their\nday-to-day business; the availability of discount window credit, which ensures well-\ncapitalized banks can meet their emergency liquidity needs; and deposit insurance, which\nprotects consumer deposits if the bank fails. Put together, those programs leave very\nlittle residual risk that a depositor in good standing will ever have to leave the teller\nempty handed. They make a bank’s redemption promise credible, and they make\ncommercial bank money a near-perfect substitute for cash. As a result, households and\nbusinesses overwhelmingly use commercial bank money for everyday transactions.5\n4 This analogy applies to the economics of stablecoins; I make no comment on their legal status.\n5 See Waller, “CBDC,” in note 1.\n\n- 4 -\nThis arrangement has many advantages. Small retail customers do not have to\nspend their time vetting the safety and soundness of their banks—regulators and\nsupervisors do that for them. Consumers have a safe place to keep their savings and a\nnearly risk-free way to make payments, which are settled in ultrasafe central bank\nliabilities. Banks can focus their effort on investments, products, and services from a\nplace of safety and soundness. Communities and customers benefit from those efforts in\nthe form of more efficient capital allocation and higher-quality, lower-cost financial\nproducts.\nThese advantages, however, are not cost free. Regulation ensures that\ncommercial banks issue “sound money” by making sure those banks are safe and stable,\nand that they bear the risks of their own investment decisions. But regulation also\nimposes costs, from the expense and time required to seek a banking charter to the costs\nof compliance with an array of regulations. While regulations are necessary, they also\nlimit free entry into at least some of the markets in which banks operate. As a result,\nregulatory oversight can insulate banks from some forms of direct competition. The\nCongress has long recognized the importance of private-sector competition and customer\nchoice, particularly in payments, and the Congress and the Federal Reserve take regular\nsteps to preserve a competitive payments marketplace.6\nThe objective of stablecoins is to mimic the safe-asset features of commercial\nbank money. They typically offer a fixed exchange rate of one-to-one to a single asset or\na basket of assets. Payment stablecoins tend to choose a sovereign currency as their\n6 See Federal Reserve System (2021), “Fostering Payment and Settlement System Safety and Efficiency,”\nin The Fed Explained: What the Central Bank Does, 11th ed. (Washington: FRS), pp. 84–111,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/files/the-fed-explained.pdf.\n\n- 5 -\nanchor, typically the U.S. dollar. Stablecoin issuers suggest that one can redeem a\nstablecoin from the issuer for one U.S. dollar, although redemption rights are not always\nwell defined. Nor is the entity responsible for conducting redemption always clearly\nspecified.\nTo enhance the credibility of redemption at par, some stablecoin issuers go\nfurther, promising to limit the investments they make with the money backing each\nstablecoin by keeping it in cash or other highly liquid assets. In this respect, stablecoins\ncan resemble a “narrow bank,” a well-known payment-only banking structure that\nmonetary economists have studied for more than half a century.7 Constructed this way,\nstablecoins also resemble currency boards, which peg a foreign currency to the dollar and\nhold dollar reserves to back up redemption promises.\nAlthough stablecoins try to mimic commercial bank money, they differ\ndramatically in terms of the payment networks they use. Dollar-denominated commercial\nbank money is a settlement instrument in a wide range of asset markets, and customers\ncan transfer it using a wide range of payment platforms. However, commercial bank\nmoney is not “native” to public blockchains, the distributed networks that support trading\nand other activity involving crypto-assets. Stablecoins help fill that gap as a less volatile\nanchor for crypto-asset transactions and an “on-ramp” for digital asset trading.\nPromises and Risks\nThis role—as a more stable private asset in digital markets that otherwise lack\nsuch assets—has meaningful benefits by itself, helping make those markets deeper and\nmore liquid. A well-designed, well-regulated stablecoin could also have other benefits,\n7 See, for example, Milton Friedman (1960), A Program for Monetary Stability (New York: Fordham\nUniversity Press).\n\n- 6 -\nwhich go well beyond digital asset markets. It might allow for different activity on\ndistributed ledger technology, or DLT, platforms, like a wider range of automated (or\n“smart”) contracts. It might serve as an “atomic” settlement asset and thus help bring\nsome of the speed and potential efficiencies of digital asset markets into more traditional\nones. With the right network design, stablecoins might help deliver faster, more efficient\nretail payments as well, especially in the cross-border context, where transparency can\nstill be low and costs can still be high. Stablecoins could be a source of healthy\ncompetition for existing payments platforms and help the broader payments system reach\na wider range of consumers. And, importantly, while stablecoins and other payment\ninnovations could create new risks, we should not foreclose the possibility that they may\nhelp address old ones—for example, by providing greater visibility into the resources and\nobligations that ultimately support any system of privately issued money.\nThese benefits are substantial, and even where they are still uncertain, it is\nimportant to recognize them. But to capture those benefits, stablecoins must bridge the\nbiggest gap between them and commercial bank money: robust, consistent supervision\nand regulation and appropriate public backstops. Strong oversight, combined with\ndeposit insurance and other public support that comes with it, is what makes bank\ndeposits an acceptable and accepted form of money. Today stablecoins lack that\noversight, and its absence does create risks. The PWG described several such risks in its\nreport, but I will highlight just three.\nThe first is the risk of a destabilizing run. The United States has a rich history of\nprivately created money, stretching back to promissory notes that merchants and lawyers\n\n- 7 -\nissued on the early frontier.8 Some of these instruments worked well for long periods;\nothers came from unregulated or unscrupulous issuers, who promised safety and stability\nat a more attractive rate of return. When these instruments went bad, the consequences\ncould extend well beyond the depositors, investors, or even institutions who put their\nprincipal at risk. It is important not to overstate these risks; if the investors that\nparticipate in stablecoin arrangements know their money is at risk, then a run on one\nissuer is less likely to become a run on all of them. But without transparency into those\nrisks, or with retail users that are less able to monitor them, the possibility of widespread\nlosses is more of a concern. As I mentioned, for commercial bank money, regulation,\nsupervision, deposit insurance, and the discount window make this dynamic more remote\nby giving a bank’s creditors less reason to run.\nThe second risk is the risk of a payment system failure. Stablecoins share many\nof the functions of a traditional payment system. If stablecoins’ role in payments activity\ngrows—which, again, could be a good development—their exposure to clearing,\nsettlement, and other payment system risks would grow, too. Stablecoins also present\nsome unique versions of these risks because responsibility for different payment\nfunctions is scattered across the network. The United States does not have a national\npayments regulator, but it does have strong standards for addressing payment system risk,\nespecially where those payment systems are systemically important. Regulators should\ndraw on those standards with care and take a fresh look at what should or should not\napply in the stablecoin context.\n8 See Justin Simard (2016), “The Birth of a Legal Economy: Lawyers and the Development of American\nCommerce,” Buffalo Law Review, vol. 64, no. 5, pp. 1059–1134.\n\n- 8 -\nThe third risk is the risk of scale. Stablecoins, like any payment mechanism, can\nexhibit strong network effects; the more people use a payment instrument, the more\nuseful it is, and the greater the value it delivers to each participant. For this same reason,\nnetwork effects can be (and usually are) highly beneficial. As a result, rapid and broad\nscaling of a payment instrument is socially desirable. In fact, in a perfect world, there\nwould be one payment system and one payment instrument that everyone uses. The\nproblem with this is that, in our imperfect world, this would confer monopoly power over\nthe payment system. Any entity that has control over a large and widely used payment\nsystem has substantial market power and thus the ability to extract rents in exchange for\naccess—which, again, hurts competition and decreases the network benefits to\nconsumers. Thus, there is a tradeoff between the efficiency of having one large network\nand the cost of monopoly control of that network. I believe that we are a long way from a\nmonopoly in stablecoin issuance; I see a lot of interest in offering this type of payments\ncompetition and ensuring that there are relatively few barriers to entry. In my view,\nhaving stablecoins scale rapidly is not a concern as long as there is sufficient competition\nwithin the stablecoin industry and from the existing banking system. In this world, some\nform of interoperability is critical to ensure that competition allows consumers to easily\nmove across stablecoin networks, just as they can move between different commercial\nbank monies or sovereign currencies.\nLooking Beyond the Banking Model\nJurisdictions around the world are grappling with these same risks, trying to foster\nthe potential benefits of stablecoin arrangements while minimizing their costs. The PWG\nreport described one approach to that cost-benefit equation: restricting the issuance of\n\n- 9 -\n“payment stablecoins” to insured depository institutions and imposing strict limits on the\nbehavior of wallet providers and other nonbank intermediaries. Given the economic\nsimilarities between payment stablecoins and bank deposits, I have no objection to the\nidea of banks issuing both instruments. The United States has a tried-and-true system for\noverseeing and supporting the creation of commercial bank money, and there is no reason\nto suggest it could not be adapted to work in this context.\nHowever, I disagree with the notion that stablecoin issuance can or should only be\nconducted by banks, simply because of the nature of the liability. I understand the\nattraction of forcing a new product into an old, familiar structure. But that approach and\nmindset would eliminate a key benefit of a stablecoin arrangement—that it serves as a\nviable competitor to banking organizations in their role as payment providers. The\nFederal Reserve and the Congress have long recognized the value in a vibrant, diverse\npayment system, which benefits from private-sector innovation. That innovation can\ncome from outside the banking sector, and we should not be surprised when it crops up in\na commercial context, particularly in Silicon Valley. When it does, we should give those\ninnovations the chance to compete with other systems and providers—including banks—\non a clear and level playing field.\nTo do so, the regulatory and supervisory framework for payment stablecoins\nshould address the specific risks that these arrangements pose—directly, fully, and\nnarrowly. This means establishing safeguards around all of the key functions and\nactivities of a stablecoin arrangement, including measures to ensure the stablecoin\n“reserve” is maintained as advertised. But it does not necessarily mean imposing the full\nbanking rulebook, which is geared in part toward lending activities, not payments. If an\n\n- 10 -\nentity were to issue stablecoin-linked liabilities as its sole activity; if it backed those\nliabilities only with very safe assets; if it engaged in no maturity transformation and\noffered its customers no credit; and if it were subject to a full program of ongoing\nsupervisory oversight, covering the full stablecoin arrangement, that might provide\nenough assurance for these arrangements to work.\nThere should also be safeguards for other participants in a stablecoin arrangement,\nlike wallet providers and other intermediaries. Again, however, not all of the restrictions\nthat apply to bank relationships might be necessary. For example, there is no need to\napply restrictions on commercial companies from owning or controlling intermediaries in\nthese arrangements. The separation of banking and commerce is grounded in concerns\nabout captive lending—the idea that banks might lend to their owners on too favorable\nterms, giving the owners an unfair subsidy and putting the bank on shaky ground. These\ntraditional concerns do not apply to wallet providers and other intermediaries who abstain\nfrom lending activities. There are new questions to consider, such as around the use of\ncustomers’ financial transaction data, but where anticompetitive behavior happens,\nexisting law (and particularly antitrust law) should still apply.\nPolicymakers will continue to work through these questions in the coming\nmonths, but in the process, we should not let the novelty of stablecoins muddy the waters.\nThe United States has a long history of developing, refining, and integrating new\npayment technologies in ways that maintain the integrity of its financial institutions and\nits payment system. Stablecoins may be new, but their economics are far from it. We\nknow how to make this kind of privately issued money safe and sound, and, in designing\n\n- 11 -\na program of regulation and supervision to do so, we have plenty of examples to draw on.\nIn the interest of competition and of the consumers it benefits, we should get to work.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n1:00 p.m. EDT (noon local time)\nApril 14, 2025\nA Tale of Two Outlooks\nRemarks by\nChristopher J. Waller\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nCertified Financial Analysts Society of St. Louis\nSt. Louis, Missouri\nApril 14, 2025\n\nThank you, Jack and thank you to the CFA of St. Louis for the opportunity to\nspeak to you today. It’s a pleasure to be back home here in the city where I worked for\nnearly 12 years before becoming a Governor at the Federal Reserve Board.\nI am here to discuss my favorite topic, which is the outlook for the U.S. economy\nand the implications for monetary policy.1 I speak publicly on the outlook every few\nweeks or so, and usually the most exciting thing to happen in between these appearances\nis a monthly data release from the Bureau of Labor Statistics or the Commerce\nDepartment.\nThis time, of course, is different. The tariff increases announced April 2 were\ndramatically larger than I anticipated, adding on to other tariffs announced in March,\nalong with retaliatory actions from some countries. Combining all of these actions to\ndate, it is clear that tariffs this large and broadly applied could significantly affect the\neconomy and the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) pursuit of our economic\nobjectives. Given that there is still so much uncertainty about how trade policy will play\nout and how businesses and households will respond, I have struggled, like many others I\nhave talked with, to fit these varying possibilities into a single coherent view of the\noutlook.\nIt is an understatement to say that financial markets did not respond well to the\nApril 2 tariff announcement. Then last Wednesday, a substantial proportion of the\nnewest tariffs were suspended for 90 days pending negotiations to lower them, reportedly\nin exchange for lower barriers to U.S. exporters. This left in place a 10 percent tariff on\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nall imports, the pre-existing tariffs on some products and countries, and a sharp increase\nin import and export tariffs on China trade. More sector-specific tariffs are promised, and\nmuch uncertainty remains about whether tariff negotiations will lead to deals or whether\nthe April 2 tariffs will be implemented in 90 days.\nUncertainty about trade or fiscal policy decisions is precisely why you won’t hear\nme talking about such actions very often. It is why I avoided speaking in detail about\nproposed tariffs earlier this year. I do not judge such policy actions. But I must base my\npolicy decisions on the actions taken. Tariffs are the elephant in the room, so let’s talk\nabout them.\nAs I said a moment ago, I struggled after April 2 to come up with a single\ncoherent view of how the tariff increases would affect my outlook and views on monetary\npolicy. That difficulty did not end after the 90-day tariff suspensions announced on April\n9, which, if anything, may have widened the range of possible outcomes and effects and\nmade the timing even less certain. Friday’s exemptions for some tariffs on some\nelectronics imports from China only complicated the picture. Considering all this\nuncertainty, it is impossible to forecast how the economy will evolve very far into the\nfuture. In such circumstances, I tend to think in terms of scenarios and managing the\nassociated risks. So, for the balance of my remarks, I will try to lay out some possible\ntariff scenarios and how they will affect my thinking about the appropriate path for\nmonetary policy in the coming months.\nBut before I get to this exercise, it is essential to understand how the economy\nwas faring leading up to this big change in trade policy. As I will detail, in my view, the\neconomy was on a fairly solid footing in the first quarter of 2025. While the evidence\n\n- 3 -\nsuggests real gross domestic product (GDP) growth slowed from a 2.4 percent annual\npace in the fourth quarter, I believe the economy did grow modestly in the first quarter\nand that growth would have been stronger except for some special factors that are\nunlikely to continue.\nA variety of “soft” data—reports from business contacts and a range of consumer\nand business surveys—hinted at a substantial slowdown. The “hard” data, which\nincludes actual measurement and estimates of aggregate economic conditions, have\ntended to show that the economy grew modestly. While monthly readings through\nFebruary show consumer spending slowed from the fourth quarter, that may have\nreflected unusual seasonal factors that weighed on spending in the first two months of\nthis year, including harsh winter weather. We will get March retail sales later this week,\nand that should provide some helpful evidence of the pace of consumer spending.\nAnother factor counted against measured GDP growth in the first quarter was a surge in\nimports, likely an anticipatory effect caused by the prospect of the new tariffs, which\nprobably won’t continue. In the labor market, employment grew 228,000 in March,\nexceeding expectations, and job openings through February indicated that the labor\nmarket remained roughly in balance. In light of the continuing strength of the labor\nmarket and factors that probably temporarily lowered GDP growth, I think the U.S.\neconomy was in good shape in the first quarter.\nInflation has had a bumpy path down toward our 2 percent goal, and progress\nseemed to stall last year. But after some high inflation readings in January and February,\nwe got some encouraging news last Thursday on consumer price index (CPI) inflation.\nHeadline CPI prices fell 0.1 percent in March, bringing the 12-month measure of CPI\n\n- 4 -\ninflation down to 2.4 percent. A drop in energy prices—which has continued so far this\nmonth—was a big reason for the step-down. Core CPI inflation, which excludes volatile\nenergy and food prices and is a good guide to future inflation, rose just a tenth of a\npercent last month, which brought the 12-month change down to 2.8 percent, its lowest\n12-month reading since March 2021.\nWhen CPI data is supplemented with the producer price data that we received last\nweek, we estimate that the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), the\nFOMC’s preferred inflation gauge, was roughly unchanged in March bringing the 12-\nmonth change to 2.3 percent. Core PCE prices are estimated to have risen less than 0.1\npercent for the month, leaving core PCE inflation at 2.7 percent over the previous 12\nmonths. Both measures of total and core PCE inflation were above the FOMC’s 2\npercent goal.\nLooking across the first-quarter data, I see the economy growing modestly with a\nlabor market that was still solid and inflation that was still too high but was making slow\nprogress toward our goal of 2 percent.\nLet me now return to tariffs and my scenarios. To level set the discussion of\ntariffs, as of December 2024, the effective average trade-weighted tariff for all imports\ninto the United States was under 3 percent. Earlier this year, targeted tariffs brought the\naverage to 10 percent. The April 2 tariffs would have pushed that to 25 percent or more.\nEven with the pause on implementing those tariffs, retaining the new 10 percent tariff on\nmost imports and a tariff on Chinese imports of well over 100 percent, estimates are that\nthe average effective tariff today is still around 25 percent. This estimate is rough, and\nwe have seen that policy can change quickly, but the point is that even after the 90-day\n\n- 5 -\npause, the current tariff rate is a sharp increase to a level that the United States has not\nexperienced for at least a century.\nThe primary challenge in analyzing the economic effects of the tariff increases is\nthe considerable uncertainty that remains about their size and permanence. So I have\ndecided to focus on two scenarios for tariff policy when thinking about the economic\nresponse. One possibility is that they will remain very high and be long-lasting, near the\ncurrent average of 25 percent or more, as part of a committed effort by the\nAdministration to engineer a fundamental shift in the U.S. economy toward producing\nmore goods domestically and reducing trade deficits. The second scenario is that the\nsuspensions are the beginning of a concerted effort to negotiate reductions in foreign\nbarriers faced by U.S. exporters that will result in the removal of most of the announced\nimport tariffs, which would reduce the average tariff rate to around 10 percent. This\nlatter scenario had been my base case up until March 1. While there is a range of\npossibilities that could combine these objectives for tariff policy, these two approaches\nwould yield significantly different outcomes for the economy and monetary policy, so I\nwould like to discuss them today as two separate scenarios.\nIn doing so, I am not here to judge the objectives for the tariff increases. I am a\ncentral banker, and, as I said earlier, that means I take fiscal and other policy decisions\nmade by others as a given when setting monetary policy.\nBefore I summarize my two scenarios, let me emphasize that neither of them are\nforecasts and that I am employing scenarios as a way to frame my thinking about\nmanaging the risks of decision making when the outlook is as uncertain as it is. The\n“large tariff” scenario assumes that average tariffs around 25 percent will remain in place\n\n- 6 -\nfor some time. Let’s assume they remain at that level until at least the end of 2027,\nwhich is the horizon for economic projections made by FOMC participants. In my view,\nkeeping the large tariffs in place this long would be necessary if the primary goal is\nremaking the U.S. economy, which is now mostly services, into one that produces a\nlarger share of the goods it consumes. Such a shift, if it is possible, would be a dramatic\nchange for the United States and would surely take longer than three years.\nIn the second scenario, it is assumed that the primary goal would be to use the\ntariffs as leverage to negotiate reductions in trade barriers faced by U.S. exporters. In this\ncase, while I would expect that the announced minimum 10 percent tariff on all goods\nfrom all countries would remain in place, I would also expect that substantially all other\ntariffs would be eliminated over time. I will call this the “smaller tariff” scenario.\nLet me begin with the large tariff scenario and the implications for inflation. As I\nhave noted in past speeches, the textbook view of tariffs is that they are a one-time\nincrease in prices and would not be expected to be a persistent source of inflationary\npressure.2 While the tariffs after April 9 were very large, I still believe they would have\nonly a temporary effect on inflation.\nPrivate sector forecasts expect tariff increases of this magnitude to increase\ninflation by 1-1/2 to 2 percentage points over the next year or so, which I think is a\nreasonable estimate. If underlying core PCE inflation were to continue at its estimated\n12-month pace of 2.7 percent in March, that would mean inflation could reach a peak\nclose to 5 percent on an annualized basis in coming months if businesses quickly and\n2 See Christopher J. Waller (2025), “Disinflation Progress Uneven but Still on Track Rate Cuts on Track as\nWell,” speech delivered at the University of New South Wales Macroeconomic Workshop, Sydney, New\nSouth Wales, Australia, February 17,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250217a.htm.\n\n- 7 -\ncompletely passed through the cost of the tariff. Even if the tariffs were only partially\npassed on to consumers, inflation could move up to around 4 percent. These outcomes\nwould obviously be a reversal of the progress we have made on bringing inflation down\nover the past few years.\nIt will be important to watch inflation expectations and make sure they remain\nanchored during this process. Surveys of consumers have shown big increases in\ninflation expectations for this year. However, I tend to discount survey-based measures\nof inflation and prefer those based on the spread between nominal and inflation-indexed\nsecurities, since investors have more skin in the game than survey respondents. These\nmarket-based measures have not increased significantly, which implies market\nparticipants view tariffs as a one-time change to the price level. So I don’t think\nexpectations have become unanchored.\nThere are other factors that may limit the increase in inflation. I continue to\nbelieve that monetary policy is meaningfully restricting economic activity and hope that\nunderlying inflation may moderate over the course of the year, separate from the tariff\neffects. Also, competitive forces, including the desire to hold on to customers, may\ninduce businesses to pass along only a fraction of higher costs from tariffs. Finally, if the\neconomy slows substantially, then weaker demand will put downward pressure on\ninflation after tariffs take effect.\nIn terms of output growth, with large tariff increases, I would expect the U.S.\neconomy to slow significantly later this year and this slower pace to continue into next\nyear. Higher prices from tariffs would reduce spending, and uncertainty about the pace\nof spending would deter business investment. I have heard this repeatedly from business\n\n- 8 -\ncontacts around the country—tariff uncertainty is freezing capital spending. Productivity\ngrowth, an important source of GDP increases in recent years, would slow as investment\nis allocated according to trade policy and not towards its most productive and profitable\nuses. A fall in productivity would likely lower estimates of the neutral policy rate,\nmaking the current policy rate more restrictive than it is currently. Any trade retaliation\nfrom U.S. trading partners would reduce U.S. exports, which would be a drag on growth.\nThere is a long list of factors that can lower growth in this scenario.\nAlong with slower economic growth would come higher unemployment. With\nlarge tariffs remaining in place, I expect the unemployment rate, which was 4.2 percent in\nMarch, would rise by several tenths of a percentage point this year and approach 5\npercent next year. Even as the economy has moderated over the past year, the\nunemployment rate has stayed remarkably stable and close to estimates of its long-term\nrate—in other words, close to the FOMC’s goal. But a verifiable fact about the\nunemployment rate, based on history, is that when it starts to rise, as I expect it would\nunder this scenario, it often rises significantly.\nIn summary, under the large tariff scenario, economic growth is likely to slow to a\ncrawl and significantly raise the unemployment rate. I do expect inflation to rise\nsignificantly, but if inflation expectations remain well anchored, I also expect inflation to\nreturn to a more moderate level in 2026. Inflation could rise starting in a few months and\nthen move back down toward our target possibly as early as by the end of this year.\nYes, I am saying that I expect that elevated inflation would be temporary, and\n“temporary” is another word for “transitory.” Despite the fact that the last surge of\ninflation beginning in 2021 lasted longer than I and other policymakers initially expected,\n\n- 9 -\nmy best judgment is that higher inflation from tariffs will be temporary. If this inflation\nis temporary, I can look through it and determine policy based on the underlying trend. I\ncan hear the howls already that this must be a mistake given what happened in 2021 and\n2022. But just because it didn’t work out once does not mean you should never think that\nway again. Let me use a football analogy to characterize my thoughts. You are the\nPhiladelphia Eagles and it is fourth down and a few inches from the goal line. You call\nfor the Tush Push but fail to convert by running the ball. Since it didn’t work out the way\nyou expected, does that mean that you shouldn’t call for the Tush Push the next time you\nface a similar situation? I don’t think so. With the history of 2021 and 2022 still in my\nmind, I believe my analysis of the effect of tariffs is the right call, and I am going to stick\nwith my best judgment.\nWhile I expect the inflationary effects of higher tariffs to be temporary, their\neffects on output and employment could be longer-lasting and an important factor in\ndetermining the appropriate stance of monetary policy. If the slowdown is significant\nand even threatens a recession, then I would expect to favor cutting the FOMC’s policy\nrate sooner, and to a greater extent than I had previously thought. In my February\nspeech, I referred to this as the world of “bad news” rate cuts. With a rapidly slowing\neconomy, even if inflation is running well above 2 percent, I expect the risk of recession\nwould outweigh the risk of escalating inflation, especially if the effects of tariffs in\nraising inflation are expected to be short lived.3\n3 Recent research from the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis shows that this action is the optimal\nmonetary policy response in a standard macroeconomic model. See Javier Bianchi and Louphou Coulibaly\n“The Optimal Monetary Policy Response to Tariffs” Working Paper 810, Federal Reserve Bank of\nMinneapolis, March 7, 2025. The Optimal Monetary Policy Response to Tariffs | Federal Reserve Bank of\nMinneapolis\n\n- 10 -\nLet me now turn to the second scenario, in which tariffs are lower. In this case, I\nwould expect the 10 percent across-the-board tariff to be the baseline for the average\ntrade weighted tariff. Under this scenario the effect on inflation would be significantly\nsmaller than if larger tariffs remained. Here, the peak effect on inflation could be around\n3 percent on an annualized basis Since it may take some time for tariff-related price\n.\nincreases to work their way through production chains, the peak may be lower but still\ndissipate slowly. As trade negotiations proceed, I would expect that expectations of\nfuture inflation would remain anchored and short-term measures could even fall over\ntime, helping keep overall inflation in check.\nAt the same time, the fact that there is still an increase in tariffs means the smaller\ntariff scenario would surely have a negative effect on output and employment growth, but\nsmaller than the larger tariff scenario. The new tariffs are hitting an economy in good\nstanding, which leaves me encouraged that households and businesses would continue to\nspend and hire during trade negotiations that lead to substantially reduced import tariffs\nand possibly remove barriers to U.S. exporters over time.\nAs a result of these limited effects on inflation and economic activity from\nsteadily diminishing tariffs, I would support a limited monetary policy response.\nAnchored or even lower inflation expectations as the economy slows, combined with the\nview that smaller tariff effects are temporary, gives the FOMC room to adjust policy as\nprogress on the underlying trend in inflation is revealed in price data. With the threat of a\nsharp slowdown or recession diminished, pressure to reduce rates based on falling\ndemand would diminish also. That is, the policy response in this scenario could allow for\nmore patience. The preemptive policy cuts we did last fall can allow us some time to\n\n- 11 -\nwait and see if the hard data catch up to the soft data or vice versa and how much of the\ntariff will be passed through to the consumer. In such a scenario, the outlook for\nmonetary policy might not look much different than it did before March 1. With a fairly\nsmall tariff effect on inflation, I would expect inflation to continue on its path down\ntowards our 2 percent target. In this case, “good news” rate cuts are very much on the\ntable in the latter half of this year.\nLet me conclude with two essential points. The first is that the new tariff policy is\none of the biggest shocks to affect the U.S. economy in many decades. The second is that\nthe future of that policy, as well as its possible effects, is still highly uncertain. This\nmakes the outlook also highly uncertain and demands that policymakers remain flexible\nin considering the wide range of outcomes. In the end, the United States is a dynamic,\nresilient capitalist system that responds well to shocks and always has. I suspect that will\ncontinue to be the case now.\n.",

Waller\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Digital Currencies and National Security Tradeoffs,” a symposium presented by\nthe Harvard National Security Journal\nCambridge, Massachusetts\nOctober 14, 2022\n\nThank you, Professor Jackson, and thank you to the Harvard National Security\nJournal for the invitation to speak at this symposium. As the payment system continues\nto evolve rapidly and the volume of digital assets continues to grow, it is critical to ensure\nthat we keep both the benefits and risks of digital assets in the policy conversation,\nincluding the implications for America’s role in the global economy and its place in the\nworld. My speech today focuses on exactly this issue and on an aspect of the digital asset\nworld that is now the center of domestic and international attention—central bank digital\ncurrencies (CBDCs) and how they relate to the substantial international role of the U.S.\ndollar.1\nIn January 2022, the Federal Reserve Board published a discussion paper on\nCBDCs to foster a broad and transparent public dialogue, including the potential benefits\nand risks of a U.S. CBDC.2 To date, no decisions have been made by the Board on\nwhether to move forward with a CBDC. But my views are well known. As I have said\nbefore, I am highly skeptical of whether there is a compelling need for the Fed to create a\ndigital currency.3\nI am not a national security expert. But one area where economics, CBDCs, and\nnational security dovetail is the role of the dollar. Advocates for creating a U.S. CBDC\noften assert how it is important to the long-term status of the dollar, particularly if other\nmajor jurisdictions adopt a CBDC. I disagree. As I will discuss, the underlying reasons\n1 These views are my own and do not represent any position of the Board of Governors or other Federal\nReserve policymakers.\n2 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2022), “Money and Payments: The U.S. Dollar\nin the Age of Digital Transformation” (Washington: Board of Governors, January),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/money-and-payments-20220120.pdf.\n3 See Christopher J. Waller (2021), “CBDC: A Solution in Search of a Problem?” speech delivered at the\nAmerican Enterprise Institute, Washington (via webcast), August 5,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20210805a.htm.\n\n- 2 -\nfor why the dollar is the dominant currency have little to do with technology, and I\nbelieve the introduction of a CBDC would not affect those underlying reasons. I offer\nthis view, again, in the spirit of dialogue, knowing how important these issues are, and I\nam very happy to engage in vigorous debate regarding my view. I remain open to the\narguments advanced by others in this space.\nThe Role of the U.S. Dollar\nAfter World War II and the creation of the Bretton Woods system, the U.S. dollar\nserved as the central currency for the international monetary system. Other countries\nagreed to keep the exchange value of their currencies fixed to the dollar, and eventually,\ncountries came to settle international balances in dollars.4 That role has continued long\nafter the Bretton Woods system dissolved.\nBy any measure, the dollar is the dominant global currency—for funding markets,\nforeign exchange transactions, and invoicing. It also is the world’s predominant reserve\ncurrency.5\nIn terms of the dollar’s reserve currency status, 60 percent of disclosed official\nforeign reserves are held in dollars, far surpassing the shares of other currencies, with the\nmajority of these dollar reserves held in safe and liquid U.S. Treasury securities.6 Even\nin a world of largely floating exchange rates, many countries either implicitly or\n4 See Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (2013), “Federal Reserve History: Creation of the Bretton Woods\nSystem,” webpage, https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/bretton-woods-created.\n5 See Committee on the Global Financial System (2020), “U.S. Dollar Funding: An International\nPerspective,” CGFS Papers 65 (Basel, Switzerland: CGFS, June), https://www.bis.org/publ/cgfs65.pdf.\n6 These figures are taken from Carol Bertaut, Bastian von Beschwitz, and Stephanie Curcuru (2021), “The\nInternational Role of the U.S. Dollar,” FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System, Oct. 6), https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/the-international-role-of-\nthe-u-s-dollar-20211006.html.\n\n- 3 -\nexplicitly anchor their currencies to the dollar; together, these countries account for about\nhalf of world gross domestic product.7\nThe dollar is by far the dominant currency for international trade. Apart from\nintra-European trade, dollar invoicing is used in more than three-fourths of global trade,\nincluding 96 percent of trade in the Americas.8 Approximately 60 percent of\ninternational and foreign currency liabilities—international banking loans and deposits as\nwell as international debt securities—are denominated in dollars. And the dollar remains\nthe single most widely used currency in foreign exchange transactions. Why does this\nmatter to the United States? As indicated in the Board’s CBDC discussion paper, the\ndollar’s international role lowers transaction and borrowing costs for U.S. households,\nbusinesses, and government. It widens the pool of creditors and investors for U.S.\ninvestments. It may insulate the U.S. economy from shocks from abroad.9 It also allows\nthe United States to influence standards for the global monetary system.10\nThe dollar’s role doesn’t only benefit the United States. The dollar serves as a\nsafe, stable, and dependable form of money around the world. It serves as a reliable\ncommon denominator for global trade and a dependable settlement instrument for cross-\nborder payments. In the process, it reduces the cost of transferring capital and smooths\nthe world of global payments, including for households and businesses outside of\n7 See Ethan Ilzetzki, Carmen M. Reinhart, and Kenneth S. Rogoff (2019), “Exchange Arrangements\nEntering the Twenty-First Century: Which Anchor Will Hold?” Quarterly Journal of Economics, vol. 134\n(May), pp. 599-646.\n8 See Bertaut, von Beschwitz, and Curcuru “International Role of the U.S. Dollar,” in note 6; and Emine\nBoz, Camila Casas, Georgios, Georgiadis, Gita Gopinath, Helena Le Mezo, Arnaud Mehl, and Tra Nguyen\n(2020), “Patterns in Invoicing Currency in Global Trade” IMF Working Paper WP/20/126 (Washington:\nInternational Monetary Fund, July), https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2020/07/17/Patterns-\nin-Invoicing-Currency-in-Global-Trade-49574.\n9 For example, pass-throughs of exchange rate changes to U.S. inflation are reduced materially when the\noverwhelming majority of U.S. imports are invoiced in U.S. dollars.\n10 See Board of Governors, “Money and Payments,” p. 15, in note 2.\n\n- 4 -\nAmerica.11 For example, consider the dollar’s role in foreign exchange markets. To\nmake a foreign exchange transaction between two lightly traded currencies, it is often less\nexpensive to trade the first currency with the dollar, and then to trade the dollar with the\nsecond currency, rather than to trade the two currencies directly.\nThe factors driving the dollar’s role as a reserve currency are well researched and\nwell demonstrated, including the depth and liquidity of U.S. financial markets, the size\nand openness of the U.S. economy, and international trust in U.S. institutions and the rule\nof law. We must keep these factors in mind in any debate regarding the long-term\nimportance of the dollar.\nCBDCs and the U.S. Dollar\nThreats to the U.S. dollar’s international dominance are numerous, including\nshifting geopolitical alliances and pressure to invoice in alternative currencies, as well as\ndeeper and more open foreign financial markets. My focus today is on just one supposed\nthreat—namely, the purported shifting payments landscape as a result of the growth of\ndigital assets, particularly CBDCs.\nRecent years have seen a number of changes to the payments system, from instant\ninterbank payments to mobile payment services to a shift toward nonbank payment\nproviders. Some of this shift has been through the rise in digital assets and include\ncryptocurrencies and other crypto-assets such as stablecoins, which have money-like\ncharacteristics. They also include CBDCs. A CBDC is a digital instrument that is a\nliability of the central bank. That is all it is—a direct liability of a central bank.\n11 See Committee on the Global Financial System, “U.S. Dollar Funding,” in note 5.\n\n- 5 -\nWhat major security gap exists that a CBDC, and only a CBDC, can close? What\nwould be the effect of CBDCs and other digital money-like instruments on the role of the\ndollar? There are many ways to approach this question, but I want to do so by using a\nsimple example: What is it about a CBDC that would make a non-U.S. company,\nengaging in international financial transactions, more or less likely to use the dollar?\nThis example, of course, focuses on the reasons for why contracts are generally invoiced\nin U.S. dollars, which is just one feature of the dollar’s international role. To me,\nhowever, it simplifies the overall question regarding the effect of a CBDC on the dollar’s\ndominance.\nWe can break down this question into three others: First, would a foreign CBDC\naffect this non-U.S. company’s decisions? Second, would a U.S. CBDC affect them?\nAnd, third, while stablecoins are not CBDCs, how would a privately issued stablecoin\nhave a different effect?\nForeign CBDCs\nFirst, I will consider the emergence of one or more foreign CBDCs in a world\nwith no U.S. CBDC. What would be the effect on the non-U.S. company? Let’s assume\nthe company acts pragmatically; it would only move away from using the U.S. dollar if it\nis better off by doing so. The discussion around this question usually tends to focus on\nthe potential technological advantages of a CBDC and doesn’t grapple with the\nunderlying reasons for the dominance of the dollar. That is, advocates for a CBDC tend\nto promote the potential for a CBDC to reduce payment frictions by lowering transaction\ncosts, enabling faster settlement speeds, and providing a better user experience. I am\nhighly skeptical that a CBDC on its own could sufficiently reduce the traditional payment\n\n- 6 -\nfrictions to prevent things like fraud, theft, money laundering, or the financing of\nterrorism.12 Though CBDC systems may be able to automate a number of processes that,\nin part, address these challenges, they are not unique in doing so. Meaningful efforts are\nunder way at the international level to improve cross-border payments in many ways,\nwith the vast majority of these improvements coming not from CBDCs but improvements\nto existing payment systems.13\nFor argument’s sake, though, let’s suppose that this foreign CBDC is more\nattractive for payments to the non-U.S. company, perhaps for technological reasons, or\nbecause the preferences of the firm’s consumers or trading partners change in response to\nthe introduction of the CBDC. Due to the well-known network effects in payments, the\nmore users the foreign CBDC acquires, the greater will be the pressure on the non-U.S.\ncompany to also use the foreign CBDC. In this case, it is true that the appeal of the\nforeign CBDC as a transactions medium—not as a unit account or store of value—might\ngain at the expense of the dollar. These effects will likely only be on the margin because\nthey rely on a large enough number of individuals and businesses being nearly indifferent\nbetween the dollar and the foreign currency in CBDC form.\nBut the broader factors underpinning the dollar’s international role would not\nchange. Changing those factors would require large geopolitical shifts separate from\nCBDC issuance, including greater availability of attractive safe assets and liquid financial\n12 The legal and reputational risks associated with noncompliance with requirements on anti-money\nlaundering and countering the financing of terrorism often result in financial institutions choosing to be\nvery cautious, including by requiring manual intervention in cases of uncertainty, which decreases speed\nand increases costs of cross-border payments. See Financial Action Task Force (2021), Cross Border\nPayments: Survey Results on Implementation of the FATF Standards (Paris: FATF, October),\nhttps://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/recommendations/pdfs/Cross-Border-Payments-Survey-\nResults.pdf.\n13 See Financial Stability Board (2020), Enhancing Cross-border Payments: Stage 3 Roadmap (Basel,\nSwitzerland: FSB, October), https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P131020-1.pdf.\n\n- 7 -\nmarkets in other jurisdictions that are at least on par with, if not better than, those that\nexist in the United States. The factors supporting the primacy of the dollar are not\ntechnological, but include the ample supply and liquid market for U.S. Treasury\nsecurities and other debt and the long-standing stability of the U.S. economy and political\nsystem.14 No other country is fully comparable with the United States on those fronts,\nand a CBDC would not change that.\nFinally, as I’ve noted before, it is possible that a foreign-issued CBDC could have\nthe opposite of its intended effect and make companies even less willing to use that\ncountry’s currency. Since digital currencies would make it easier for a government to\nmonitor transactions, shifting to a CBDC might make a company less willing to use that\ncountry’s currency. For example, I suspect that many companies will remain wary of\nChina’s CBDC for just this reason.\nU.S. CBDC\nI am also skeptical that a U.S. CBDC would affect this hypothetical foreign\ncompany’s decisionmaking. A U.S. CBDC is unlikely to dramatically reshape the\nliquidity or depth of U.S. capital markets. It is unlikely to affect the openness of the U.S.\neconomy, reconfigure trust in U.S. institutions, or deepen America’s commitment to the\nrule of law. As I have said before, the introduction of a U.S. CBDC would come with a\nnumber of costs and risks, including cyber risk and the threat of disintermediating\ncommercial banks, both of which could harm, rather than help, the U.S. dollar’s standing\n14 Several recent studies set forth similar perspectives, including the following: U.S. Department of the\nTreasury (2022), The Future of Money and Payments: Report Pursuant to Section 4(b) of Executive\nOrder 14067 (Washington: Department of the Treasury, September),\nhttps://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/Future-of-Money-and-Payments.pdf; and Bertaut,\nvon Beschwitz, and Curcuru, “International Role of the U.S. Dollar,” in note 6.\n\n- 8 -\ninternationally. Like a foreign CBDC, the technological advantages of a U.S. CBDC\nwould have a hard time overcoming long-standing payments frictions without violating\ninternational financial integrity standards. For the non-U.S. company already conducting\nits business in dollars, introducing a U.S. CBDC would not provide material benefits over\nand above the current reasons for making U.S. dollar-denominated payments. For non-\nU.S. companies conducting their business in currencies other than dollars, a U.S. CBDC\nsimilarly would likely not be preferred to their current options. It could be that\nindividuals outside the United States would find a U.S. CBDC particularly attractive, but,\nagain, making a U.S. CBDC globally available would raise a number of issues, including\nmoney laundering and international financial stability concerns. And as with a foreign-\nissued CBDC, the dollar’s function as a unit of account and store of value is unlikely to\nbe affected, resulting in a limited effect on the international role of the dollar.\nStablecoins\nThe last scenario I want to consider is one in which a privately issued stablecoin\npegged to a sovereign currency is available for international payments. Stablecoins are\ncrypto-assets that aim to maintain a stable value relative to a specified asset or pool of\nassets.15 The reasons that stablecoins may be more attractive than existing options for\npayments include their ability to provide real-time payments at lower cost between\ncountries that were previously poorly serviced and to provide a safe store of value for\nindividuals residing in or transacting with countries with weak economic fundamentals.\nThis is different than an intermediated U.S. CBDC, for which access in developing\n15 See Christopher J. Waller (2021), “Reflections on Stablecoins and Payments Innovations,” speech\ndelivered at “Planning for Surprises, Learning from Crises,” 2021 Financial Stability Conference,\nCleveland (via webcast), November 17,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20211117a.htm.\n\n- 9 -\neconomies would depend on banks’ incentives to provide such access. Stablecoins,\nhowever, may be held directly in any country that allows its citizens to do so. To\nimprove payments, especially for jurisdictions that are not well served under the current\nglobal payments ecosystem, stablecoins must be risk-managed and subject to a robust\nsupervisory and regulatory framework.\nCould such an asset affect the role of the U.S. dollar? Once again, I am unsure\nwhether even a large issuance of a stablecoin could have anything more than a marginal\neffect. It has often been suggested by commentators that private money-like instruments\nsuch as stablecoins threaten the effectiveness of monetary policy. I don’t believe that to\nbe the case, and it should be noted that nearly all the major stablecoins to date are\ndenominated in dollars, and therefore U.S. monetary policy should affect the decision to\nhold stablecoins similar to the decision to hold currency. This follows from a vast body\nof evidence in international economics showing how countries pegging their exchange\nrates effectively import monetary policy from the country to which their currency is\npegged.16\nAlso, because stablecoins are pegged to the dollar, they may increase rather than\nreduce the primacy of the dollar abroad, since demand for stablecoins increases demand\nfor dollar-denominated reserve assets held by the stablecoin issuer.\nConclusion\nThe ongoing debate over the risks and benefits of a CBDC is important, and I am\nhappy to continue to engage with both advocates and skeptics of CBDCs. But, for the\nreasons I have laid out, I don’t think there are implications here for the role of the United\n16 See, for instance, Maurice Obstfeld and Alan M. Taylor (2004), Global Capital Markets: Integration,\nCrisis, and Growth (New York: Cambridge University Press).\n\n- 10 -\nStates in the global economy and financial system. We should instead focus and debate\nthe salient CBDC-related topics, like its effects on financial stability, payment system\nimprovements, and financial inclusion.

Waller\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nMark C. Berger Workshop Series\nUniversity of Kentucky\nLexington, Kentucky\nOctober 6, 2022\n\nThank you, Jim, and thank you to the University of Kentucky for the opportunity\nto speak to you today. It is nice to be back in the Bluegrass state and see old friends and\ncolleagues. I taught at UK from 1998 to 2003 and one of my colleagues at that time was\nMark Berger, who passed away at far too young an age. Mark was a good friend, and I\nam honored to speak in this seminar series that is named after him.\nMy subject is the outlook for the U.S. economy and inflation, and the Federal\nReserve’s efforts to get inflation under control.1 I will start with the outlook for the\neconomy, focusing on inflation, and then turn to a discussion of the housing market,\nwhere strong demand has outrun limited supply, causing substantial increases in prices\nfor shelter, which is a large component of inflation. Because the housing market is\nsensitive to changes in interest rates and thus to monetary policy, I’ll conclude by\ndiscussing how housing is being affected by the Federal Open Market Committee’s\n(FOMC) efforts to achieve our dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices.\nRecent data on economic activity suggest that after a slight contraction in gross\ndomestic product in the first half of this year, the economy is posed for modest but\nbelow-trend growth in the latter half. Meanwhile, the labor market remains strong and\nvery tight. Employers added 315,000 jobs in August, well above the rate needed to keep\nup with population growth. While the unemployment rate rose, that was largely due to\nnearly 800,000 people who joined the civilian labor force, many of them drawn in by\nample job openings and fast wage growth. At 3.7 percent, the unemployment rate was\nbelow the median projection for its long run rate among FOMC participants.\nFurthermore, initial unemployment claims are very low and stable. We will get another\n1 These views are my own and do not represent any position of the Board of Governors or other Federal\nReserve policymakers.\n\n- 2 -\njobs report tomorrow. Expectations are for job gains of around 260,000, which would be\nlower than recent months but very healthy relative to past experience. A jobs number in\nthis range along with the job openings rate reported on Tuesday would show that the\nlabor market is slowing a bit but is still quite tight. As a result, I don’t expect tomorrow’s\njobs report to alter my view that we should be focused 100 percent on reducing inflation.\nSince I last spoke about the economic outlook on September 9, we have received\ntwo important pieces of data on inflation for August, consumer price index (CPI) and the\nprice index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE).2 Both reports confirmed that\noverall inflation remained much too high in August. Though gasoline prices fell, which\nwas very welcome news for consumers, food prices increased notably. Core PCE\ninflation, which strips out the volatile categories of food and energy, moved up to 0.6\npercent for the month, which implies an annualized rate of inflation of about 7 percent in\ncore goods and services. Furthermore, core PCE inflation is not only high, but very\npersistent, with monthly prints of core PCE inflation at an annualized rate averaging\nabout 5 percent this year. These numbers indicate that inflation is far from the FOMC’s\ngoal and not likely to fall quickly.\nThis is not the inflation outcome I am looking for to support a slower pace of rate\nhikes or a lower terminal policy rate than projected in the September 2022 SEP. And,\nthough there are additional data to come, in my view, we haven’t yet made meaningful\nprogress on inflation and until that progress is both meaningful and persistent, I support\ncontinued rate increases, along with ongoing reductions in the Fed’s balance sheet, to\n2 See Christopher J. Waller (2022), “The Economic Outlook: Time to Let the Data Do the Talking,” speech\ndelivered at the 17th Annual Vienna Macroeconomics Workshop (2022), Vienna, Austria, September 9,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20220909a.htm.\n\n- 3 -\nhelp restrain aggregate demand. As far as achieving our dual mandate, this is a one-sided\nbattle. We currently do not face a tradeoff between our employment objective and our\ninflation objective, so monetary policy can and must be used aggressively to bring down\ninflation.\nLet me turn to the troubling persistence of inflation. In the past couple of\ninflation reports, housing services has been a major contributor to measured inflation. In\nthe latest inflation reports, shelter prices rose 0.7 percent on a monthly basis. Housing\nhas a large weight in price indexes, as households spend a sizable amount of their\nincomes on housing services. The combination of high monthly inflation and a large\nweight in measuring overall prices means that shelter inflation is a key driver of overall\ninflation. Moreover, shelter inflation is a particularly persistent component of inflation\nand why I am focused on closely watching shelter inflation in determining my outlook for\nU.S. inflation. Unfortunately, the message is that shelter inflation will likely remain high\nfor several months, meaning overall core PCE inflation will continue to be persistently\nhigh.\nThere has been a considerable imbalance in the supply and demand for housing\nfor some time. Housing is also sensitive to interest rates and thus quite responsive to\nmonetary policy. So for the next few minutes, I would like to focus on how demand–\nsupply imbalance in both owner-occupied and rental markets came about, how it is\naffecting prices for housing today and in future, and how housing is likely to affect the\nFOMC’s efforts to return inflation to our 2 percent goal.\nHousing demand increased strongly in the years leading up to the pandemic,\nsustained by relatively low interest rates, the formation of new households, and rising\n\n- 4 -\nincomes. Demand for housing then surged during the pandemic as people spent more\ntime at home, initially on the intensive margin—more housing square footage per\nhousehold. Couples in apartments wanted more space to work from home and opted for\nbigger apartments or houses. Also, remote work enabled people to work from preferable\nlocations so the demand for second homes surged. As the pandemic wore on, demand\nfor housing also increased on the extensive margin—meaning more household\nformation—as roommates sharing apartments now wanted to live on their own as they\ncontinued to work from home. And adult children began moving out of their parent’s\nhomes. All of these factors led to higher rates of household formation and greater\ndemand for housing. So, by the end of 2021, the pandemic was driving up the demand\nfor housing on both margins.\nMeanwhile, the pandemic’s supply constraints caused shortages in construction\nmaterials and construction workers, limiting the supply of new housing. The\ncombination of soaring demand for housing and limited supply until earlier this year\nmeant the housing market had substantial excess demand, which was reflected in\nsubstantial increases in housing costs.\nBut now imbalances in the owner-occupied market have started to shift. Due to\nthe Fed’s actual and anticipated tightening of monetary policy, mortgage rates have\nincreased from less than 3 percent at the end of last year to nearly 7 percent recently.\nHigher borrowing costs have made it more expensive for households to buy homes,\nwhether they are first-time buyers or trading their current home for a different one. And\nso, we have seen big drops in home sales over the course of this year. The monthly\nnumbers of new and existing home sales are now back below the average levels seen in\n\n- 5 -\nthe few years before the pandemic. And the August decline in pending home sales\nreleased last week suggests that sales will fall further. Reflecting the slowdown in sales,\nbuilders have responded by pulling back on starting new single-family homes.\nSo far, the contraction in housing demand has been more pronounced than the\nchanges in supply, and so inventories of homes for sale have increased. While\ninventories of existing homes are still low in historical terms, they have grown a lot for\nnew homes. Based on the current pace of sales, estimates of the number of months of\nsupply of new homes has shot up and is now nearing the peaks seen in 2008 during the\nprevious housing cycle.\nThe easing in housing demand can also be seen in a slowdown in house price\nincreases. Nationwide, prices of existing homes rose by about 20 percent over the 12\nmonths ending in May, while they rose at an annual rate of less than 10 percent in recent\nmonths. Prices have even fallen in some areas of the country, especially those that saw\nthe largest increases over the previous two years. And many builders are reportedly\ncutting their list prices and offering larger incentives.\nThe combination of price cuts and slowing of new single-family construction\nshould help builders work off excess inventory, continuing to bring the market into better\nbalance. In addition, after mortgage rates stabilize, their drag on housing demand should\nebb. While this market correction could be fairly mild, I cannot dismiss the possibility of\na much larger drop in demand and house prices before the market normalizes.\nDespite the risk of a material correction in house prices, several factors help\nreduce my concern that such a correction would trigger a wave of mortgage defaults and\npotentially destabilize the financial system. One is that because of relatively tight\n\n- 6 -\nmortgage underwriting in the 2010s, the credit scores of mortgage borrowers today are\ngenerally higher than they were prior to that last housing correction. Also, the experience\nof the last correction taught us that most borrowers only default when they experience a\nnegative shock to their incomes in addition to being underwater on their mortgage.\nBecause people still need a place to live, demand for rental housing has remained\nquite strong. Rental vacancy rates are very low. Reflecting this fact, multifamily\nconstruction has been quite high this year, at a level not seen since the mid-1980s, when\nthe tax treatment of investment in structures was much more favorable than it is today.\nBut demand is still much greater than supply, so rents have continued to surge.\nSo what does all of this mean for inflation? The measures of inflation that receive\nthe most attention in the United States attempt to measure the prices of goods and\nservices consumed by households. For housing, this means measuring the price of\nconsuming the shelter and other services provided by a home. The price of shelter is\nmost easily measured by rents. Of course, rent cannot be observed for owner-occupied\nhomes. For these homes, the price of shelter is estimated as the rent that owners would\npay based on rents of nearby rental units. The purchase price of a home is not\nincorporated into these measures of inflation because it reflects the cost to invest in a real\nestate asset, not the price to consume the shelter that housing provides.\nAs I mentioned earlier, rent growth has been very high recently. The housing\nservices component of the PCE price index rose a bit above 0.7 percent in August, which\nwas slightly above the previous three-month average. And I expect a similar pace to\ncontinue for a while, well into next year. Why? Shelter inflation measures the rents\nactually paid by households. Only a fraction of households sign a new lease in a given\n\n- 7 -\nmonth or renew their lease each month. So, when monthly shelter inflation is calculated,\nit includes a large share of homes under lease where rents did not change. As a result,\nchanges in market conditions show up in the inflation statistics only over a period of\nseveral months. In addition, the inflation statistics use a six-month average when\ncalculating rent growth. Asking rents and rents on new lease contracts—which do reflect\ncontemporaneous rental market conditions—have been rising at a fast pace for more than\na year. These increases have fueled shelter inflation so far this year, and they should\ncontinue to do so for at least the next six months. That said, there is a glimmer of hope in\nthe most recent readings of asking rents, where the rate of increase has stepped down a\nbit. This slower pace should eventually contribute to a slowdown in shelter inflation,\nalthough that might not be seen until later next year.\nSo now let’s consider the implications of this picture of the current and future\nhousing market for overall inflation and monetary policy. If we assume that the recent\nrate of inflation in the cost of shelter continues, how much would prices of goods and\nother services need to moderate in order to lower overall inflation meaningfully—say, to\n3 percent?\nWhen talking about future inflation, it is most helpful to focus on measures of\ncore inflation. So if the price index for housing services continues to increase at the\nrecent monthly average rate of around 0.6 percent for the next several months, then other\ncore price increases would need to moderate considerably, to a monthly average of a bit\nless than 0.2 percent.3 This would be a big slowdown from inflation in August, which\n3 This estimate is calculated for PCE price inflation, where housing services constitutes 17 percent of the\nPCE price indexes’ measure of core inflation.\n\n- 8 -\nhad core inflation of 0.6 percent, with non-housing services and core goods each\nincreasing more than 0.5 percent.\nSuch a step-down in non-housing core inflation, if sustained over several months,\nwould be a big improvement in inflation, and I think it is quite possible to get there\nbecause of the considerable tightening of monetary policy that has occurred so far and\nadditional anticipated tightening. But this exercise shows why it is so important for the\nFOMC to maintain its focus on the appropriate path of monetary policy in order to\nmoderate demand. While housing seems likely to continue contributing to high inflation\nin the near term, in the medium-term higher mortgage rates should slow the housing\ncomponent of inflation as housing demand cools. Meanwhile, increases in broader\ninterest rates should help moderate demand and damp inflation in other sectors. So,\nacross sectors, a moderation in demand should help bring inflation down toward our 2\npercent target.\nAs we think about policy actions for the remainder of the year, one can look at the\nSummary of Economic Projections released by the FOMC at our meeting last month.\nThese projections showed participants expected an additional 100 to 125 basis points of\ntightening by the end of the year, which means either a couple of 50 basis point hikes at\nour remaining two meetings, or 75 basis points in November and 50 basis points in\nDecember. Of course, the exact path for policy will depend on the data we receive\nbetween now and the end of the year.\nBefore the next meeting on November 1–2, there is not going to be a lot of new\ndata to cause a big adjustment to how I see inflation, employment, and the rest of the\neconomy holding up. We will get September payroll employment data tomorrow, and\n\n- 9 -\nCPI and PCE inflation reports later this month. I don’t think that this extent of data is\nlikely to be sufficient to significantly alter my view of the economy, and I expect most\npolicymakers will feel the same way. I imagine we will have a very thoughtful\ndiscussion about the pace of tightening at our next meeting.\nSo, as of today, I believe the stance of monetary policy is slightly restrictive, and\nwe are starting to see some adjustment to excess demand in interest-sensitive sectors like\nhousing. But more needs to be done to bring inflation down meaningfully and\npersistently. I anticipate additional rate hikes into early next year, and I will be watching\nthe data carefully to decide the appropriate pace of tightening as we continue to move\ninto more restrictive territory.\nIn considering what might happen to alter my expectations about the path of\npolicy, I’ve read some speculation recently that financial stability concerns could\npossibly lead the FOMC to slow rate increases or halt them earlier than expected. Let me\nbe clear that this is not something I’m considering or believe to be a very likely\ndevelopment.\nI am a little confused about this speculation. While there has been some increased\nvolatility and liquidity strains in financial markets lately, overall, I believe markets are\noperating effectively. Actions by banks and financial regulators in recent years have\ngreatly strengthened the financial system. Banks are well capitalized. Functioning in the\nTreasury, equity, and commodity markets remains orderly.\nOne factor that is likely helping to stabilize the financial system is the existence of\nmonetary policy tools which could serve as a backup source of liquidity in times of\nfinancial stress. For example, swap lines that the Fed maintains with other central banks\n\n- 10 -\nhave been used effectively in the past to relieve stress in the financial system, and I think\nthe availability of these facilities tend to be a stabilizing force at other times. In addition,\nto help implement monetary policy, the Fed established new standing repurchase\nagreement (repo) facilities in July 2021, one for domestic counterparties and another for\nforeign and international monetary authorities. These facilities are capable of responding\nto strains that may put upward pressure on money market rates, but I think it is likely that\ntheir mere existence has been a stabilizing force. Along with the improved regulatory\nframework, I believe we have tools in place to address any financial stability concerns\nand should not be looking to monetary policy for this purpose. The focus of monetary\npolicy needs to be fighting inflation.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\nNoon EDT (6:00 p.m. CEST)\nSeptember 9, 2022\nThe Economic Outlook: Time to Let the Data Do the Talking\nRemarks by\nChristopher J. Waller\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\n17th Annual Vienna Macroeconomics Workshop (2022)\nVienna, Austria\nSeptember 9, 2022\n\nThank you, Klaus, and thank you for the invitation to speak at this workshop,\nwhich I have been attending since its very beginning in 2004. Something that I love\nabout this conference that has kept me coming back almost every year is its tradition of\nopen inquiry and even some fun, on the one hand, combined with rigorous, critical\nanalysis, on the other. I am a supporter, and I guess a practitioner, of rigorous criticism,\nbecause, as you may have heard, the conference award given each year for “outstanding\ncritic” was named for me. Based on the standard I set, the person who wins the award is\nalso known as the “most annoying participant.” I suppose it was only karma that a guy\nlike me who likes to dish out the criticism would end up in a job that receives plenty of it.\nKidding aside, I do consider being the namesake for this award a great honor, and just to\nmake sure I don’t get too much of a swelled head, by tradition the conference organizers\npurposefully misspell my name.\nMy subject today is the outlook for the U.S. economy and the Federal Reserve’s\nongoing campaign to bring down inflation and achieve our 2 percent objective.1 There\nare three takeaways from my speech today. First, inflation is far too high, and it is too\nsoon to say whether inflation is moving meaningfully and persistently downward. The\nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is committed to undertake actions to bring\ninflation back down to our 2 percent target. This is a fight we cannot, and will not, walk\naway from. The second takeaway is that the fears of a recession starting in the first half\nof this year have faded away and the robust U.S. labor market is giving us the flexibility\nto be aggressive in our fight against inflation. For that reason, I support continued\nincreases in the FOMC’s policy rate and, based on what I know today, I support a\n1 These views are my own and do not represent any position of the Board of Governors or other Federal\nReserve policymakers.\n\n- 2 -\nsignificant increase at our next meeting on September 20 and 21 to get the policy rate to a\nsetting that is clearly restricting demand. The final takeaway is that I believe forward\nguidance is becoming less useful at this stage of the tightening cycle. Future decisions on\nthe size of additional rate increases and the destination for the policy rate in this cycle\nshould be solely determined by the incoming data and their implications for economic\nactivity, employment, and inflation.\nBased on all of the data that we have received since the FOMC’s last meeting, I\nbelieve the policy decision at our next meeting will be straightforward. Because of the\nstrong labor market, right now there is no tradeoff between the Fed’s employment and\ninflation objectives, so we will continue to aggressively fight inflation. Inflation is\nwidespread, driven by strong demand that has only begun to moderate, by an ongoing lag\nin labor force participation, and by supply chain problems that may be improving in some\nareas but are still considerable. For these reasons, I expect it will take some time before\ninflation moves back to our 2 percent goal, and that the FOMC will be tightening policy\ninto 2023. But the answers to questions of “how high?” and “for how long?” will depend\nsolely on incoming data.\nSince I last spoke in July, I think the argument that we entered a recession in the\nfirst half of 2022 has pretty much ended—we didn’t. With each passing week, the\nabsence of any indication of a recession in spending or employment data buries that\nrecession argument a little deeper. We understand some of the factors that lowered the\ngross domestic product (GDP) numbers in the first half, and a debate continues about\nother possible factors, such as mismeasurement, potentially underreporting GDP. What\nwe can say is that after the Fed telegraphed its policy pivot to tightening in the latter\n\n- 3 -\nmonths of 2021 and began raising rates in the first quarter of this year, demand and\neconomic activity slowed in the first half of 2022 from the strong pace of 2021. Data\nsuggest an uptick in consumption growth in the third quarter. Meanwhile, the Atlanta\nFed’s GDPNow model forecasts real GDP will grow 2.6 percent this quarter, though\nother estimates are a touch below this prediction.\nSpending data are supportive of continued expansion. Nominal retail sales overall\nwere flat in July, but that is mainly because falling gasoline and auto prices—which is\ngood news—held back sales in those sectors. Excluding that, retail sales rose 0.7 percent,\nsuggesting that discretionary spending grew solidly. Businesses also continued to expand\nproduction and spending. Total industrial production increased 0.6 percent in July,\nstanding 3.9 percent above its level a year ago. Forward-looking indicators of\nmanufacturing activity, such as new orders indexes in various manufacturing surveys, are\nsofter than earlier in the year, but most (and in particular the positive August reading\nfrom the ISM) are not suggestive of a material pullback in manufacturing activity.\nMeanwhile, the non- manufacturing ISM report suggests continuing growth, with its new\norders index rising to a solid level last month.\nBut there are signs of moderation in economic activity, which is what the FOMC\nis trying to achieve by tightening monetary policy. Not surprisingly, higher interest rates\nthis year are slowing activity in the housing market. There have been declines in\nconstruction of single-family homes for a number of months, with permits and home\nstarts both decreasing in July. Sales of existing and new single-family homes have also\nslowed. Existing home sales fell by 5.9 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of\n4.8 million homes in July. While the imbalance between housing supply and demand\n\n- 4 -\nremains significant, it has meaningfully improved. The inventory of unsold new and\nexisting homes has more than doubled since January. While the three months supply of\nexisting home is still below levels before the pandemic, the eleven months of new home\ninventory is the highest since the spring of 2009. This latter statistic has raised concerns\nby some about a significant downturn looming in the housing market, but an important\ncaveat is that much of the current elevated inventory reflects the recent low rate of\nhousing completion due to continued supply constraints. Many of these new homes for\nsale are still under construction, and as supply constraints ease, builders will be able\ndeliver more completed homes to a market where the supply of existing homes remains\ntight. All that said, the housing market is a significant channel for monetary policy, and I\nwill be watching this sector carefully.\nThe FOMC’s goal is that the tightening in monetary policy slows aggregate\ndemand so that it is in better alignment with supply across all sectors of the economy.\nMy expectation is that strong household savings, the tight labor market, and additional\navailability of manufactured goods as supply chains constraints continue to resolve will\nallow households to make long-awaited purchases, which will provide a partial offset to\ntighter policy. That will support a slowing, rather than a contraction, in demand.\nTurning to the very strong labor market, private payroll employment has been\nincreasing at an average of nearly 400,000 a month over the last several months.\nUnemployment rose two tenths of a percent in August to 3.7 percent, in part reflecting an\nincrease in the labor force participation rate, but still stands at a very low level. The\nincrease in participation was welcome news, but this rate is still far below that achieved\nbefore the pandemic, when unemployment was roughly as low as today. We are facing\n\n- 5 -\nworker shortages in many sectors of the economy. Job openings have started to decline a\nbit but remain very elevated. These data confirm that the Fed is hitting its full\nemployment mandate, so all my attention is on bringing inflation down.\nInflation slowed in July, which was a very encouraging development. Headline\ninflation for both the consumer price index and the index derived from personal\nconsumption expenditures (PCE)—the Fed’s preferred measure—slowed, largely due to\ncontinuing declines in prices for gasoline and other petroleum products. Excluding\nvolatile energy and food prices, core inflation for these two indexes also stepped down\nfrom the rapid increases of earlier this year, but it is still too early to say that inflation is\nmoving meaningfully and persistently downward.\nInflation is still widespread. For both headline and core inflation, at least 60\npercent of the underlying categories of different goods and services increased by 3\npercent or more. Prices for housing services are elevated and still rising. Core goods\ninflation continues to run well above its pre-pandemic level. Inflation for services\nexcluding housing has moved up this past year in part due to consumers shifting back to\nmore normal activities outside the household as social distancing has eased.\nLooking ahead, I will be focusing on a number of factors that will influence\ninflation. On housing services—rent and the so-called owners’ equivalent rent —I expect\nto see sizable increases in this component of inflation for a while as the recent rise in new\nrentals makes its way into aggregate price measures.2 In a speech in March, I noted that,\nbased on various measures of asking rents, some analysts were predicting that the rate of\n2 Recent increases in asking rents and new rental contracts are incorporated in aggregate price measures\nwith a lag because many of the properties surveyed for the Consumer Price Index Housing Survey do not\nhave new rental contracts each month. In addition, the housing component of the official statistics is based\non the average change over the previous six months.\n\n- 6 -\nrent inflation in the consumer price index could double in 2022, and so far it is on pace to\nmore than double.3 Owners-equivalent rent is similarly on pace to nearly double this\nyear.4 Sometime early next year, though, I expect to see the upward pressure on inflation\nfrom these forces to ease as future increases in new or renewed leases moderate and the\nfull effects of monetary policy tightening make their way to housing services prices.\nBeyond housing, I expect goods price inflation to continue to moderate as monetary\npolicy now and going forward slows the pace of increase in aggregate demand, supply\nproblems ease, and supply and demand come into better balance. There is some evidence\nthat goods supply production and delivery problems tied to the pandemic are improving,\nwith supplier delivery times and reports of items in short supply continuing to drop. In\nterms of service price inflation, we saw a step-down in airfares and other travel-related\nservices last month, but I am uncertain about how these services, as well as food services,\nand nonmarket services prices will evolve going forward.\nNominal wages have been growing quickly, and I’ll be watching closely to see\nhow wage growth evolves and feeds into inflation. The Atlanta Fed’s Wage Growth\nTracker hit another record in July for its 24 years of data, a 12-month rate of 6.7 percent\nwage growth. I don’t expect wage increases to ease up much unless and until there is a\nsignificant softening in the labor market. One way to anticipate future wage growth is\nthrough quit rates. Most people who quit their jobs are moving to others that pay\nsignificantly better, so I take quits as one signal about where wages are headed in the near\n3 See Christopher J. Waller (2022), “The Red Hot Housing Market: The Role of Policy and Implications\nfor Housing Affordability,” speech delivered at the “Recent Fiscal and Monetary Policy: Implications for\nU.S. and Israeli Real Estate Markets” conference, March 24,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20220324a.htm.\n4 Tenants’ rent, which rose 3.3 percent in 2021 and has already increased another 4.3 percent through the\nfirst seven months of 2022, is on pace to more than double this year. Similarly, owner’s equivalent rent\nrose by 3.8 percent in 2021 and has risen another 3.8 percent in the first seven months of this year.\n\n- 7 -\nterm. Quits are near their highest level over the 22 years that the government has tracked\nthem, but they have come down from the start of this year, and further decreases would\nbring them closer to the level they were at immediately before the pandemic, when wages\nwere growing much more slowly than today.\nAnother factor that I will be watching closely is longer-term inflation\nexpectations, which I believe significantly influence inflation. As inflation moved higher\nover the past year and a half, measures of short-term inflation expectations moved up\nnotably, but measures of longer-term expectations rose only a little and generally stand\nnear levels seen in the years before the pandemic, when inflation was low. In fact,\nseveral measures of longer-term expectations have edged lower over the past couple of\nmonths. To me, this means that the public retains confidence that the Fed will be able to\nrein in inflation in the medium term.\nTo sum up, while I welcome promising news about inflation, I don’t yet see\nconvincing evidence that it is moving meaningfully and persistently down along a\ntrajectory to reach our 2 percent target. I keep in mind that a year ago we saw similarly\npromising evidence of inflation moderating for several months before it jumped up to a\nhigh and then very high level. Those earlier inflation readings probably delayed our\npivot to tightening monetary policy by a few months. The consequences of being fooled\nby a temporary softening in inflation could be even greater now if another misjudgment\ndamages the Fed’s credibility. So, until I see a meaningful and persistent moderation of\nthe rise in core prices, I will support taking significant further steps to tighten monetary\npolicy.\n\n- 8 -\nNow let me lay out the implications of this outlook for monetary policy. Since\nMarch, the FOMC has raised our policy target range from near zero to between 2¼ and\n2½ percent. That puts the upper bound of the current target range at the median of\nFOMC participants’ longer-run projection for the policy rate, as recorded in the June\nSummary of Economic Projections (SEP). This long-run rate is effectively where\nparticipants think the policy rate would settle when the economy is growing at its\npotential and inflation is at our 2 percent target. This is a good definition of success\nwhen employment and inflation are near our goals and no help is needed from monetary\npolicy. But that isn’t the case now; inflation is far from our goal, so more action is\nneeded. The policy rate will have to move meaningfully above this neutral level to\nfurther restrain aggregate demand and put more downward pressure on prices.\nLooking ahead to our next meeting, I support another significant increase in the\npolicy rate. But, looking further out, I can’t tell you about the appropriate path of policy.\nThe peak range and how fast we will move there will depend on data we will receive\nabout the economy. Earlier this year, when we were ending asset purchases, inflation\nwas quite elevated, and we were lifting the target range off the effective lower bound, so\nit made sense to provide forward guidance to help convey the urgency the FOMC felt\nabout tightening monetary policy. Forward guidance was useful in helping the public\nunderstand how quickly we expected to tighten, and we saw longer-term interest rates\nmove up quite rapidly as a result of these communications. And additional hikes should\nlead to further restraint in aggregate demand. As we continue to raise rates, we need to\nsee, month by month, how households and businesses are adjusting to the tighter\nfinancial conditions, and how that adjustment is affecting inflation. We shouldn’t be\n\n- 9 -\nestimating what the peak level of the target range will be and how quickly we will get\nthere, because those details are much more dependent on what new economic data tell us\nthan was the case when the only direction for the federal funds rate to go was up—and up\nby a lot.\nThis is not to suggest that I anticipate rate increases stopping very soon. I expect\nthat getting inflation to fall meaningfully and persistently toward our 2 percent target will\nrequire increases in the target range for the federal funds rate until at least early next year.\nBut don’t ask me about the policy path because I truly don’t know—it will depend on the\ndata. Six months ago, I would not have thought that we would be where we are today,\nwith inflation so far from our target, after significantly tightening policy with a series of\nlarge rate increases and by shrinking the balance sheet.\nThere are a range of possibilities for how the economy will perform, however,\nand we can talk about the implications of that range. Say, for example, that inflation\nfollows the path laid out in the June SEP, which has core PCE inflation falling to 4.3\npercent in the fourth quarter of 2022 and then moving toward 2 percent over 2023 and\n2024. In that case, I would support our policy rate peaking near 4 percent. But based on\nthe experience of the past year and half, it would be foolish to express great confidence\nthat this plausible path will come to pass. Instead, it is important to consider the range of\npossibilities and the appropriate policy responses. For example, if inflation does not\nmoderate or rises further this year, then, in my view, the policy rate will probably need to\nmove well above 4 percent. Alternatively, if inflation suddenly decelerates, then, in my\nview, the policy rate might peak at less than 4 percent.\n\n- 10 -\nOne thing that is more predictable and has a significant effect on tightening policy\nover time is the shrinking of the Fed’s holdings of assets as maturing securities run off\nour balance sheet. Starting this month, the Fed is shedding $60 billion a month in\nTreasury securities and up to $35 billion a month in agency mortgage-backed securities.\nThis action effectively increases the supply of securities in the hands of private investors\nand will thus put upward pressure on interest rates, as private investors must now be\nenticed to hold these assets.\nAll told, the FOMC has taken unprecedented and decisive policy actions this year\nto quickly increase the policy rate in response to high inflation. But where we stand now\nis not good enough. Though the labor market is strong, inflation is too elevated. So I\nsupport another significant hike in two weeks. After that, the tightening path will\ncontinue until we see clear and convincing evidence that inflation is moving\nmeaningfully and persistently down to our 2 percent target. The pace of tightening is\nuncertain; it will depend on the data. No matter what, I am ready and willing to do what\nit takes to bring inflation down.",

Waller\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“The Future of Macroeconomic Policy,” a conference sponsored by\nthe Norges Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the IMF Economic Review\nOslo, Norway\nJune 16, 2023\n\nI have been asked to talk about monetary policy and financial stability in today’s\neconomic environment.1 The recent stress in the U.S. banking system has brought these\ntwo topics, their interlinkages, and the tools we use to achieve our goals to the forefront\nof central bank policy and public discourse. In short, although financial stability and\nmonetary policy tools are used independently, they are nevertheless interconnected via\ntheir respective effects on the macroeconomy. So let me take a few minutes to discuss\nthis topic in more detail.\nFinancial stability is essential for monetary policy in the United States to achieve\nits congressionally mandated goals of maximum employment and price stability.\nImportantly, stable financial markets and institutions allow changes in the stance of\npolicy to transmit in a smooth and expected way to the financial conditions that\nhouseholds and businesses face in making spending and production decisions. Instability\nin the financial system, on the other hand, hinders economic activities of households and\nbusinesses, which impedes the attainment of our dual mandate. This is in large part why\nthe Federal Reserve monitors financial stability risks—to help ensure that banks, nonbank\nfinancial institutions, and financial markets can continue channeling credit to households\nand businesses.\nBut this is a two-way street. Financial stability depends on a healthy economy,\nand all else equal is strengthened by monetary policy actions taken to promote our\nmacroeconomic goals. The U.S. financial system is generally resilient enough to handle\nlarge shocks. However, in March, we saw an instance where this wasn’t true. A rapid,\nsizable increase in interest rates resulting from persistently elevated inflation contributed\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nto stresses in the banking system that we needed to address using our financial stability\ntools.\nDespite the interconnections between maximum employment, price stability, and\nfinancial stability, the tools we use to promote financial stability are separate and distinct\nfrom the tools we use to carry out monetary policy. And, I will argue, that separation is\nappropriate, as each set of tools is fit to its respective purpose.\nThe set of tools the Federal Reserve uses to address financial stability issues is\ntargeted and surgical. These include bank supervisory and regulatory tools that are used\non an ongoing basis to promote the safety and soundness of individual financial firms and\nbuild a resilient financial system. There are also tools that provide liquidity to banks and\nother financial intermediaries in emergencies, such as the discount window or lending\nfacilities created to extend credit more broadly.\nSo far, these financial stability tools have had a good track record of effectively\npromoting financial stability in the United States. Numerous lending facilities set up in\nthe spring of 2020 helped limit strains that the pandemic put on the financial system.\nMore recently, when the failure of Silicon Valley Bank led to the loss of deposits at other\nbanks, the discount window and a new facility to help ensure banks have the ability to\nmeet the needs of all their depositors have been effective at containing stresses in the\nbanking system. Importantly, these actions to address financial stability enabled us to\ncontinue to pursue our monetary policy objectives during these times.\nCompared with financial stability tools that address liquidity or other strains in\ntargeted individual institutions or segments of the financial system, monetary policy\naffects everyone and every part of the economy and would be a blunt and less effective\n\n- 3 -\ntool to address financial stability problems. That said, in carrying out monetary policy,\nwe do consider how credit conditions and other factors related to financial stability are\naffecting the economy. As I argued in a speech last month, the recent strains in the\nbanking sector may lead to a tightening of price and nonprice conditions for lending.2 If\nthat is the case, then it might reduce the need for at least some further tightening of\nmonetary policy to lower inflation. The Fed could tighten policy too much if it ignored\nsuch a development.\nTo make this argument more concrete, consider the onset of the pandemic in\nMarch 2020. The Federal Open Market Committee held two unscheduled meetings\nwhere, recognizing that the coronavirus would weigh on economic activity and pose risks\nto the economic outlook, it lowered the policy target range down to zero. At the same\ntime, the unprecedented uncertainty about how the macroeconomy would be affected by\nthe pandemic destabilized financial markets, which led the Federal Reserve to put in\nplace several lending facilities to support the system. We took each of these actions\nindependently; we did not lower the policy rate for the sole purpose of achieving\nfinancial stability. Although both types of tools were used simultaneously, they were\nused to solve different problems.\nFinancial stresses in the banking sector are a factor that my colleagues and I are\nclosely watching as we determine the appropriate stance of monetary policy going\nforward. While lending conditions imposed by banks have tightened since March, the\nchanges so far are in line with what banks have been doing since the Fed began raising\n2 See Christopher J. Waller (2023), “Hike, Skip, or Pause?” speech delivered at the 2023 Santa Barbara\nCounty Economic Summit, University of California, Santa Barbara Economic Forecast Project, Santa\nBarbara, Calif. (via webcast), May 24,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20230524a.htm.\n\n- 4 -\ninterest rates more than a year ago. That is, it is still not clear that recent strains in the\nbanking sector materially intensified the tightening of lending conditions.\nLet me end by noting that some have argued that the Fed’s tightening of monetary\npolicy was significantly responsible for the failures and stress in the banking system.\nThey argue we should have taken this into account when setting policy. Let me state\nunequivocally: The Fed’s job is to use monetary policy to achieve its dual mandate, and\nright now that means raising rates to fight inflation. It is the job of bank leaders to deal\nwith interest rate risk, and nearly all bank leaders have done exactly that. I do not\nsupport altering the stance of monetary policy over worries of ineffectual management at\na few banks. We will continue to pursue our monetary policy goals, which ultimately\nsupport a healthy financial system. At the same time, we will continue to use our\nfinancial stability tools to prevent the buildup of risks in the financial system and, when\nneeded, to address strains that may emerge.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n1:30 p.m. EDT\nOctober 10, 2023\nMonetary Policy Analysis and the Development of Federal Reserve Policymaking\nRemarks by\nChristopher J. Waller\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“The Legacy of Bennett McCallum and Lessons for Monetary Policy Today,” a conference\nsponsored by\nthe Mercatus Center at George Mason University\nWashington, D.C.\nOctober 10, 2023\n\nIt is a pleasure to be here to honor the legacy of Bennett McCallum by discussing\nhis work on monetary policy. Over the years, I was fortunate to cross paths with Ben\nseveral times—from when I was a young academic economist to when I was research\ndirector at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. But, like many of you, most of my\nexposure to Ben McCallum’s thinking has consisted of reading, and learning from, his\nwritings on monetary policy.\nBen was an influential researcher who focused on a number of topics that are key\nto monetary policy, some of them highlighted in today’s panel sessions, including policy\nrules, instruments, and targets. When I was an academic, these were research interests\nthat I shared with Ben. More recently, since I became a member of the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (FOMC), the same issues have been at the forefront of my work, as I\nwill explain in my remarks today.\nI will cover these issues in the context of discussing broad developments in U.S.\nmonetary policy over the past quarter-century.1 In doing so, I’m motivated by\nMcCallum’s 1999 paper “Recent Developments in Monetary Policy Analysis: The Roles\nof Theory and Evidence,” which was a review of the previous 25 years.2 In my remarks,\nI’ll first talk about changes that have taken place since the 1990s in the way in which the\nFOMC has conducted policy. Then I’ll turn to a discussion of monetary policy rules,\nhow Ben thought about them, their use as an input into policymakers’ decisions, and the\nchoice of instruments and targets in policy rules.\n1 The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the FOMC or the\nBoard of Governors.\n2 See McCallum (1999b).\n\n- 2 -\nDevelopments in Monetary Policy from 1998 to 2023\nMcCallum’s review, which was largely written in 1998, contrasted monetary\npolicy analysis in 1973 and 1998. In 1973, many economies were adjusting to the demise\nof the Bretton Woods international monetary system, and their domestic monetary policy\nregimes were starting to develop alongside floating exchange rates as well as the first oil\nshock that materialized during that year. In the U.S., continued dissatisfaction with\neconomic performance—particularly high inflation—led to the restrictive monetary\npolicy implemented by Paul Volcker from 1979 to 1982. The disinflation delivered by\nthis policy was followed by greatly improved overall economic performance in the period\nthat came to be known as the Great Moderation. The Great Moderation was also\nassociated, in the era of Alan Greenspan’s leadership of the Federal Reserve, with\ninflation moving down further, to rates consistent with price stability.\nConsequently, by the time of McCallum’s 1998 retrospective, U.S. monetary\npolicy had established a track record that was held in very high regard. It was widely\nbelieved that the Fed had lost credibility in the 1970s in terms of its willingness to fight\ninflation. Chairman Volcker’s actions restored the Fed’s credibility. Following the\nVolcker disinflation, economic research focused on the idea that monetary policy\nstrategies would be fully effective only if they were credible. This idea led to an\nintensified debate about “rules versus discretion.” The issue was how to maintain the\nbasis for U.S. monetary policy that Volcker had created. As I’ll discuss further, what was\nneeded was a way to maintain the credibility of the institution, as opposed to relying on\nthe credibility of an individual Fed Chair. One approach was for the FOMC to commit to\n\n- 3 -\nfollowing a policy rule and explicit policy targets, combined with communication of its\npolicy rule to the public. And this approach was a key aspect of Ben McCallum’s work.\nIn the 25 years since 1998, there have been numerous changes in U.S. monetary\npolicy arrangements. These have included several important reforms that were\nsubstantially along the lines advocated by Ben and others. In multiple ways, the FOMC’s\npolicy framework has become much more explicit. At the end of 2007, the FOMC began\npublishing a quarterly Summary of Economic Projections, collecting information on\nindividual meeting participants’ forecasts. Then, in January 2012, the FOMC issued a\nStatement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy—also known as our\nconsensus statement. The consensus statement has been reaffirmed every year and\nrevised several times. From its inception, it made the price-stability goal that is part of\nour congressional mandate more concrete by indicating that Federal Reserve\npolicymakers interpret it as a 2 percent longer-run inflation rate (in the personal\nconsumption expenditures price index). In 2011, Ben Bernanke initiated the practice of\npostmeeting press conferences, which under Chair Powell’s leadership now follow every\nFOMC meeting.\nIn the summer of 2020, FOMC participants released a revised consensus\nstatement that further elaborated their interpretation of the dual-mandate goals of\nmaximum employment and price stability and how the Committee would pursue those\nobjectives. The new statement explicitly recognized the policy tools of asset purchases\nand forward guidance on the federal funds rate. These tools were developed during the\nperiod, which started in late 2008, in which the federal funds rate was at the effective\n\n- 4 -\nlower bound (ELB), and they were used again during the new ELB episode that began in\nMarch 2020.\nAs many observers have noted over the years, the introduction of the 2 percent\ninflation objective and other formalizations of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy\nframework actually took place well after disinflation had been achieved under Volcker\nand consolidated under Greenspan. It might be asked why—with price stability secured\nby around the mid-1990s—these formalizations were thought necessary. The answer lies\nin the fact that a well-understood monetary policy regime is needed to make price\nstability and anchored inflation expectations durable features of the economic\nenvironment.3 Communicating key characteristics of the regime—including the\nnumerical inflation target and policymakers’ reaction function—makes it concrete and\ntransparent in the eyes of the general public while also enhancing the central bank’s\ncredibility and the effectiveness of monetary policy.\nIn this connection, the design of modern central bank policy regimes has drawn\nimportantly on the literature on monetary policy rules. It is no coincidence that the\nperiod in the 1990s and 2000s of major strides in central bank transparency, frameworks,\nand communications took place alongside a resurgence of interest in research on\nmonetary policy rules. The literature on monetary policy rules and on inflation targeting\nprovided insights about how the U.S. monetary policy framework could achieve our dual-\nmandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices. And we have made use of\nthose insights. By setting out a long-run inflation goal, while indicating that we take\n3 Paul Volcker essentially recognized this point in congressional testimony of July 22, 1980, when he\nobserved that “we want to have a firm monetary standard. . . [one that is] tied to the general stability of\nprices” (Volcker, 1980, p. 134).\n\n- 5 -\nmaximum employment as a long-term variable largely determined by nonmonetary\nfactors, we make clear that we do not view our mandate as licensing us to seek\nunsustainably high levels of real output through bouts of loose monetary policy. As the\nliterature on time consistency shows, not only would such monetary policy looseness\nsacrifice the achievement of long-run price stability, it would also not even deliver higher\noutput in the long run.4 Ben McCallum once summarized the consensus as follows:\n“The pragmatic argument for inflation targeting begins with the proposition that, from a\nlong-run (i.e., steady state) perspective, monetary policy has a dominating influence on\nan economy’s (average) inflation rate and a negligible influence on its rate of\nunemployment or output relative to capacity. This proposition has wide support among\ncentral bankers and also within the academic community.”5\nThe benefits of an explicit, transparent policy regime are brought out clearly by\nour recent experience. When the FOMC began raising the federal funds rate in March\n2022 to tame inflation, it used forward guidance to make clear our intention to reach a\npolicy stance that is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation back to 2 percent. I believe\nthat this guidance has made our policy actions more effective.\nThe FOMC’s Reaction Function and the Analysis of Monetary Policy Rules\nForward guidance and the postmeeting statement are major means by which the\nFOMC is able to communicate to households, businesses, and financial markets key\naspects of our reaction function. The reaction function connects decisions on our main\n4 See Kydland and Prescott (1977) and Barro and Gordon (1983). As already indicated, the advent of\nexplicit inflation targeting in several countries helped motivate the changes made to the Federal Reserve’s\npolicy arrangements. But the adoption of inflation targeting abroad was itself partly driven by the\nanalytical considerations that I am highlighting. For discussions of how the early practice of inflation\ntargeting in various countries incorporated these considerations, see, for example, King (1997), Bernanke,\nLaubach, Mishkin, and Posen (1999), and Svensson (1999).\n5 See McCallum (1997, p. 224).\n\n- 6 -\npolicy instrument—the federal funds rate—to inflation and other key variables, such as\ndata on labor market conditions.\nThe reaction function relates to a key research interest of Ben McCallum’s:\npolicy rules. Three key messages that McCallum stressed regarding rules have become\nwidely accepted.\nThe first message is that rules can be countercyclical. McCallum became\ninterested in policy rules at a time when those rules were closely associated with what is\ntermed “nonactivist” policymaking—defined as approaches that did not involve the\nmonetary authority responding to fluctuations in real variables such as output and\nemployment. At that time, the research literature focused on what was known as the k\npercent rule, implying a fixed rate of growth for the money supply. This rule was\nintended to pin down the longer-run inflation rate, but it precluded monetary policy\nresponses to the state of the business cycle. In contrast, McCallum, as well as other\neconomists of his generation such as Stanley Fischer and John Taylor, argued that it was\nappropriate to consider both nonactivist policy rules and rules that were deliberately\ncountercyclical or activist.6 A policy rule, according to this view, could respond to\nmovements in output, employment, and inflation in a systematic way, using a formula\nintended to be applicable over time and in different circumstances.7 Today it is widely\naccepted by economists that monetary policy rules can be activist rules.\nA second, related message of McCallum’s work was that different rule\nspecifications can concretely characterize differences among economists on appropriate\nmonetary policy. In the 1970s, the whole notion of policy rules was closely associated\n6 See Dornbusch and Fischer (1978, p. 290), Taylor (1980, pp. 31−32), and McCallum (1980, 1987).\n7 See McCallum (1987, p. 416).\n\n- 7 -\nwith advocates of monetarism and rational expectations, with Keynesian economics\nbeing seen as entailing opposition to policy rules. McCallum opposed this dichotomy\nand observed, “To me it seems quite clear that debates between economists—for\nexample, Milton Friedman and James Tobin—are about the desirability of different\npolicy rules.”8 That is, McCallum wanted to represent alternative perspectives on\nmonetary policy as different rule specifications, and he urged the study of rules as a\nmeans of understanding various policy prescriptions and their consequences for the\neconomy. This perspective on rules has also become standard. Indeed, the box on\nmonetary policy rules that regularly appears in the Federal Reserve Board’s Monetary\nPolicy Report provides a menu of policy rules designed to reflect a variety of views about\nthe appropriate formulation of monetary policy.9 Similarly, multiple rule prescriptions\nand the possible implications of alternative rules for economic outcomes have, for many\nyears, been a regular part of the briefing materials that go to policymakers before each\nFOMC meeting, allowing policymakers to incorporate these prescriptions into their\nthinking and discussions.10\nA third message of McCallum’s work on rules was that there were merits in actual\npolicy following “rule-like” behavior.11 He recognized that policy rules were not likely\nto be used literally or mechanically as a means of deciding on monetary policy actions.\nEven so, McCallum believed that rules provided information about the responses to the\nstate of the economy that were likely to be associated with more successful\n8 See McCallum (1980, p. 725).\n9 See, most recently, the box “Monetary Policy Rules in the Current Environment” in Board of Governors\n(2023, pp. 44–46).\n10 Examples of such materials can be found in the publicly available Tealbooks (through 2017), which are\nprovided on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc_historical.htm.\n11 See McCallum (1980, 1999a).\n\n- 8 -\npolicymaking. According to this reasoning, the prescriptions coming from policy rules\nprovide valuable benchmarks. As McCallum put it, “Actual central banks are unlikely to\nofficially adopt such rules, of course, but consideration of their implications could\nnevertheless prove helpful in practice.”12\nMcCallum also noted that this idea was strongly advanced by John Taylor in his\n1993 paper introducing the Taylor rule.13 It’s worth looking at some features of the\nTaylor rule, as this will help bring out the connections between the policy rules literature\nand Federal Reserve practice. My discussion of these features will underline the fact that\nit is today widely accepted that the predictability of policymakers’ reaction function\nstrengthens the stabilizing properties of monetary policy. In that sense, policymakers\nunderstand the value of making decisions in “rule-like” ways.\nFirst, I will discuss the Taylor rule formula’s left-hand side—its specification of\nthe instrument. I will then turn to its right-hand side—the target variables to which the\ninstrument responds.\nThe Monetary Policy Instrument\nAs McCallum observed, “Taylor’s paper (1993) succeeded brilliantly in\ninteresting central bankers in the consideration of rule-guided policy making.”14 In\nparticular, Taylor’s article helped bring monetary policy research into better alignment\nwith central bank practice in putting the focus squarely on interest rate rules. Much\nmonetary policy analysis in academia had considered rules in which the policy instrument\nwas a monetary or reserves aggregate. As I expect most of you know, this was a matter\n12 See McCallum (1993, p. 39).\n13 See Taylor (1993).\n14 See McCallum (1999b, p. 16).\n\n- 9 -\non which McCallum’s research had two branches. On the one hand, the rule that\nMcCallum himself advanced in a number of papers in the 1980s and 1990s was a rule for\nthe monetary base and was designed to improve on the k percent monetary-growth rule\nby introducing countercyclical responses and allowing for shifts in money demand.15\nBut, on the other hand, he also produced fundamental analytical work showing that\ninterest rate rules were viable, with his 1981 paper establishing that such rules could\nprovide an anchor on the economy’s nominal variables.16 Consequently, McCallum was\nreceptive when the Taylor rule became a baseline reaction function in monetary policy\nanalysis.\nCentral banks were likewise receptive to the analysis of interest rate rules—and\nthe Taylor rule in particular. Their favorable reaction was driven by two factors. First,\nafter the experience of monetary targeting, central banks were disillusioned with policy\nanalysis that was focused on monetary aggregates. Second, interest rate rules were policy\nrelevant because these rules were expressed in terms of the short-term interest rate on\nwhich central banks actually made decisions. As McCallum put it, “The fact is that\nactual central banks in industrial countries conduct monetary policy in a manner that is\nmuch more accurately depicted by writing [the interest rate] as the instrument.”17\nReflecting this reality, all the rules considered in our Monetary Policy Report are interest\nrate rules.18\n15 See, for example, McCallum (1987, 1993, 1999a).\n16 This work was in response to the negative judgment made on interest rate rules by Sargent and Wallace\n(1975). See Woodford (2003, p. 45) and Cochrane (2023, p. 416) for discussions of McCallum’s (1981)\nresult in the context of dynamic general equilibrium analysis.\n17 See McCallum (1999b, p. 24).\n18 In addition, interest rate rules, largely consisting of variants of the Taylor rule, have been found useful in\ncharacterizing earlier eras of U.S. monetary policy. See Clarida, Galí, and Gertler (2000).\n\n- 10 -\nMonetary Policy Targets\nAn additional attraction of the Taylor rule is that the right-hand-side variables\ncorrespond closely to economic variables for which central banks have targets: inflation\nand an estimate of the state of real aggregate demand or labor market conditions. I’ll\nmake a few remarks about considerations related to these targets.\nWhen it comes to the specification of the inflation term in a policy rule, in the\nU.S. case, it’s important that the inflation target is consistent with our dual mandate,\nwhich includes a price-stability goal. In 1993, John Taylor suggested that a 2 percent\ninflation objective characterized the Federal Reserve’s behavior in the early Greenspan\nyears pretty well. This goal subsequently became official. In 2012, as I noted earlier, the\nCommittee made a goal of 2 percent inflation its formal interpretation of the price-\nstability objective. The choice of a 2 percent longer-run goal reflected a broad consensus\nthat this rate corresponded to effective price stability in the United States. Around the\nworld, too, inflation-targeting central banks view 2 percent as the rate corresponding to\nprice stability. The FOMC has further judged that 2 percent is the inflation goal most\nconsistent with achievement of our dual mandate. We have reaffirmed this numerical\ngoal repeatedly since 2012, and, in tightening monetary policy since early last year,\nwe’ve made clear that we’re determined to bring inflation down to 2 percent.\nIn considering the appropriate monetary policy response needed to return inflation\nto 2 percent, I find it useful to draw on the findings of the policy rules literature. These\nfindings include the “Taylor principle” notion that deviations of inflation from target\n\n- 11 -\nshould likely be met by a more than one-for-one response of the federal funds rate—a\nresponse that helps ensure that the real interest rate is increased in policy tightenings.19\nThe other part of our dual mandate is the goal of maximum employment.\nReflecting the fact that this goal refers to the labor market rather than economic activity,\nthe interest rate rules considered in the Monetary Policy Report put the real target in\nterms of an unemployment gap, rather than an output gap. On the matter of how this rule\nshould be used as an input into policymaking, the main thing that I would stress is that\nthere are multiple dimensions of labor market conditions, as well as considerable\nuncertainty about the level of maximum employment. As a result, caution is justified in\nhaving monetary policy responding to gap estimates. I therefore see merit in McCallum’s\nwarning against monetary policy responding strongly to the output gap.20 In this\nconnection, Athanasios Orphanides’s research suggests that estimates of the first\ndifference of economic slack (or excess demand pressure) may be less vulnerable to\nmismeasurement than the corresponding estimates of the level.21 These considerations\nimply that the prescriptions of the first-difference interest rate rule—which also appear in\nthe Monetary Policy Report—serve as a useful crosscheck on the prescriptions of more\nstandard variants of the Taylor rule.\nConclusion\nStaying on the topic of policy targets, I think it is worth concluding by\nemphasizing an important respect in which things have not changed since 1998 when Ben\n19 A detailed analysis of the Taylor principle appears in Woodford (2003). The Federal Reserve Board\nwebsite has a discussion of the Taylor principle in the context of “Principles for the Conduct of Monetary\nPolicy” (https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/principles-for-the-conduct-of-monetary-\npolicy.htm).\n20 See McCallum (2001).\n21 See, for example, Orphanides and Williams (2002) and Orphanides (2003).\n\n- 12 -\nMcCallum reviewed monetary policy developments. He noted, “Overall, the most\nfundamental change since the 1970s has been the assumption of responsibility by central\nbanks for performance in terms of inflation rates. In 1998, it would be extremely\nsurprising to run across a central bank statement that discussed medium-term inflation\nprospects in a manner suggesting that these are unaffected by monetary policy\nbehavior.”22 That difference between 1973 and 1998 is also an important contrast\nbetween 1973, when U.S. monetary policy failed to play the part that it needed to play in\nrestoring price stability, and the FOMC’s behavior over the past two years. Price stability\nis a primary responsibility of the Federal Reserve. This is why we have taken forceful\nsteps aimed at reducing inflation—and why we will stay on the job to achieve our\nobjective.\n22 See McCallum (1999b, p. 11).\n\n- 13 -\nReferences\nBarro, Robert J., and David B.

Waller\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“A 50 Year Retrospective on the Shadow Open Market Committee and\nIts Role in Monetary Policy,” a conference sponsored by\nthe Hoover Institution, Stanford University\nStanford, California\nOctober 14, 2024\n\nThank you, Athanasios, and thank you for the opportunity to be part of this very\nworthy celebration.1 In support of the theme of this conference, I do have some thoughts\non the Shadow Open Market Committee’s contributions to the policy debate, in particular\nits advocacy for policy rules. But before I get to that, I am going to exercise the keynote\nspeaker’s freedom to talk about whatever I want. To that end, I want to take a few\nminutes to offer my views on the economic outlook and its implications for monetary\npolicy. So let me start there, and afterward I will discuss the role that policy rules play in\nmy decision making and in the deliberations of the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC).\nIn the three weeks or so since the most recent FOMC meeting, data we have\nreceived has been uneven, as it sometimes has been over the past year. I continue to\njudge that the U.S. economy is on a solid footing, with employment near the FOMC’s\nmaximum employment objective and inflation in the vicinity of our target, even though\nthe latest inflation data was disappointing.\nReal gross domestic product (GDP) grew at a 2.2 percent annual rate in the first\nhalf of 2024, and I expect it to grow a bit faster in the third quarter. The Blue Chip\nconsensus of private sector forecasters predicts 2.3 percent, while the Atlanta Fed’s\nGDPNow model, based on up-to-the moment data, is predicting real growth of 3.2\npercent.\nEarlier, there were concerns that GDP in the first half of this year was overstating\nthe strength of the economy, since gross domestic income (GDI) was estimated to have\ngrown a mere 1.3 percent in the first half of this year, suggesting a big downward\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nrevision to GDP was coming. But revisions received after our most recent FOMC\nmeeting showed the opposite—GDI growth was revised up substantially to 3.2 percent.\nThis change in turn led to an upward revision in the personal saving rate of about 2\npercentage points in the second quarter, leaving it at 5.2 percent in June. This revision\nsuggests that household resources for future consumption are actually in good shape,\nalthough data and anecdotal evidence suggests lower-income groups are struggling.\nThese revisions suggest that the economy is much stronger than previously thought, with\nlittle indication of a major slowdown in economic activity.\nThat outlook is supported by consumer spending that has been and continues to be\nstrong. Though the growth in personal consumption expenditures (PCE) has moderated\nsince the second half of 2023, it has continued at an average pace of close to 2.5 percent\nso far this year. Also, my business contacts believe that there is considerable pent-up\ndemand for durable goods, home improvements, and other big-ticket items, demand that\nbuilt up due to high interest rates for credit cards and home equity loans. Now that rates\nhave started to come down and are expected to come down more, consumers will be\neager to make those purchases. For business spending, purchasing managers for\nmanufacturers describe ongoing weakness in that sector, but those for the large majority\nof businesses outside of manufacturing continue to report a solid expansion of activity.\nNow let’s talk about the labor market. Only a couple months ago, it appeared that\nthe labor market was cooling too quickly. Low numbers for job creation and a jump in\nthe unemployment rate from 4.1 percent in June to 4.3 percent in July raised risks that the\nlabor market was deteriorating. To remind you of how bad the markets viewed the July\ndata, some Fed watchers were calling for an emergency FOMC meeting to discuss a rate\n\n- 3 -\ncut. While the unemployment rate ticked down in August, job growth was once again\nwell below expectations. Many were arguing that the labor market was on the verge of a\nserious deterioration and that the Fed was behind the curve even after a 50 basis point cut\nin the policy rate at the September FOMC meeting.\nThen we got the September employment report. Job creation in September was\nunexpectedly strong at 254,000 and the unemployment rate fell back down to 4.1 percent,\nwhich is where it was in June. The report also showed big upward revisions to payroll\ngains for the previous two months. Together, the message was loud and clear: While job\ncreation has moderated and the unemployment rate has risen over the past year, the labor\nmarket remains quite healthy.\nAlong with other new data on the labor market, the evidence is that labor supply\nand demand have come into balance. The number of job vacancies, a sign of strength in\nthe labor market, has fallen gradually since the beginning of the year. The ratio of\nvacancies to unemployed is at 1.2, about the level in 2019, which was a pretty strong\nlabor market. To put this number into perspective, recent research has shown that this\nratio has been above 1 only three times since 1960.2 The quits rate, another sign of labor\nmarket strength, has fallen lower than it was in 2019, a decrease which partly reflects that\nthe hiring rate has fallen as labor supply and demand have come into better balance.\nIn sum, based on payrolls, the unemployment rate and job revisions, there has\nbeen a very gradual moderation in labor demand relative to supply, but not a\n2 See Pierpaolo Benigno and Gauti B. Eggertsson (2024), “Revisiting the Phillips and Beveridge Curves:\nInsights from the 2020s Inflation Surge,” paper presented at “Reassessing the Effectiveness and\nTransmission of Monetary Policy,” a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City,\nheld in Jackson Hole, Wyo., August 23,\nhttps://www.kansascityfed.org/Jackson%20Hole/documents/10385/Eggertsson_Paper_JH.pdf.\n\n- 4 -\ndeterioration. The stability of the labor market, as reflected in these two measures as well\nas the other metrics I mentioned, bolsters my confidence that we can achieve further\nprogress toward the FOMC’s inflation goal while supporting a healthy labor market that\nadds jobs and boosts wages and living standards for workers.\nI will be looking for more evidence to support this outlook in the weeks and\nmonths to come. But, unfortunately, it won’t be easy to interpret the October jobs report\nto be released just before the next FOMC meeting. This report will most likely show a\nsignificant but temporary loss of jobs from the two recent hurricanes and the strike at\nBoeing. I expect these factors may reduce employment growth by more than 100,000\nthis month, and there may be a small effect on the unemployment rate, but I’m not sure it\nwill be that visible. Since the jobs report will come during the usual blackout period for\npolicymakers commenting on the economy, you won’t have any of us trying to put this\nlow reading into perspective, though I hope others will.\nLooking ahead, I expect payroll gains to moderate from their current pace but\ncontinue at a solid rate. The unemployment rate may drift a bit higher but is likely to\nremain quite low in historical terms. While I believe the labor market is on a solid\nfooting, I will continue to watch the full range of data for signs of weakness.\nMeanwhile, inflation, after showing considerable progress for several months\ntoward the FOMC’s 2 percent target, likely moved up in September. The consumer price\nindex grew 0.2 percent over the past month, 2.1 percent over the past three months, 1.6\npercent over six months and 2.4 percent in the past year. Oil prices fell over most of the\nsummer but then more recently have surged. Excluding energy and also food prices that\n\n- 5 -\nlikewise tend to be volatile, and just as it did in August, core CPI inflation printed at 0.3\npercent in September and 3.3 percent over the past year.\nPrivate-sector forecasts are predicting that PCE inflation, the FOMC’s preferred\nmeasure, will also move up in September. Core PCE prices are expected to have risen\naround 0.25 percent last month. While not a welcome development, if the monthly core\nPCE inflation number comes in around this level, over the last 5 months it is still running\nvery close to 2 percent on an annualized basis. We have made a lot of progress on\ninflation over the course of the last year and half, but that progress has clearly been\nuneven—at times it feels like being on a rollercoaster. Whether or not this month’s\ninflation reading is just noise or if it signals ongoing increases, is yet to be seen. I will be\nwatching the data carefully to see how persistent this recent uptick is.\nThe FOMC’s inflation goal is an average of 2 percent over the longer run and\nthere are some good reasons to think that price increases will be modest going forward. I\nam hearing reports from firms that their pricing power seems to have waned as\nconsumers have become more sensitive to price changes. There has also been a steady\nslowing in the growth of labor compensation. It is true that average hourly earnings\ngrowth in September ticked up to 4 percent over the past year. And though it might seem\nlike wage increases of 4 percent a year would put upward pressure on inflation that is\nnear 2 percent, that might not be true if one considers productivity, which has grown at an\naverage annual rate of 2.9 percent for the past five quarters. Some of this strength was\nmaking up for productivity that shrank due to the pandemic, but the longer it continues—\nup 2.5 percent for the second quarter—the better productivity supports wage growth of 4\n\n- 6 -\npercent, or even higher, without driving up inflation. All that said, I will be watching all\nthe data related to inflation closely.\nWith the labor market in rough balance, employment near its maximum level, and\ninflation generally running close to our target over the past several months, I want to do\nwhat I can as a policymaker to keep the economy on this path. For me, the central\nquestion is how much and how fast to reduce the target for the federal funds rate, which I\nbelieve is currently set at a restrictive level. To help answer questions like this, I often\nlook at various monetary policy rules to assess the appropriate setting of policy. Policy\nrules have long been of serious interest to the Shadow Open Market Committee. So\nbefore I turn to my views on the future path of policy, I thought I would talk about\nmonetary policy rules versus discretion and begin with some background about the use of\nrules at the FOMC.\nFor a brief overview of the history of the advent of rules at the Board, I have been\ndirected to the second chapter of The Taylor Rule and the Transformation of Monetary\nPolicy written by George Kahn, and I have also consulted the memories of longtime\nmembers of the Board staff.3 Rules came along in the 1990s as the Fed was moving\naway from monetary targeting, focusing more on interest-rate policy, and taking its first\nmajor steps toward increased transparency. There was immediate interest in Taylor-type\nrules among Fed staff, and even some contributions of research.4 There was a\n3 See Evan F. Koenig, Robert Leeson, and George A. Kahn, eds. (2012), The Taylor Rule and the\nTransformation of Monetary Policy (Stanford, Calif.: Hoover Institution Press). I was assisted in this brief\nhistory by Board economists James Clouse and Edward Nelson.\n4 See Dale W. Henderson and Warwick J. McKibbin (1993), “A Comparison of Some Basic Monetary\nPolicy Regimes for Open Economies: Implications of Different Degrees of Instrument Adjustment and\nWage Persistence,” Carnegie-Rochester Conference Series on Public Policy, vol. 39 (December), pp. 221–\n317). This paper was also published in the International Finance Discussion Papers series and is available\non the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/ifdp/1993/458/ifdp458.pdf.\n\n- 7 -\npresentation to the FOMC on rules in 1995, and that was the same year that John Taylor’s\nBay Area colleague, Janet Yellen, was apparently the first policymaker to mention the\nTaylor rule at an FOMC meeting. While FOMC decisions mimicked a Taylor rule much\nof the time under Chairman Alan Greenspan, he was famously an advocate of\n“constructive ambiguity” in communication, and he and other central bankers since have\nresisted the suggestion that decisions could be handed over to strict rules. Today, of\ncourse, a number of rules-based analyses are included in the material submitted to\npolicymakers ahead of every FOMC meeting, and we publish the policy prescriptions of\ndifferent rules as part of the Board’s semi-annual Monetary Policy Report. Rules have\nbecome part of the furniture in modern policymaking.\nAs everyone here knows, but for the benefit of other listeners, Taylor rules relate\nthe level of the policy interest rate to a limited number of other economic variables, most\noften including the deviation of inflation from a target value and a measure of resource\nuse in the economy relative to some long-run trend.5 There are numerous forms of the\nTaylor rule, but they generally fall into two categories.\nThe first of these, an inertial rule, has the property that the policy rate changes\nonly slowly over time. I tend to think of it as an approach that captures the reaction\nfunction of a policymaker in a stable economy where the forces that would tend to\nchange the economy and policy build over time. When change does occur, a gradual\nresponse may give policymakers time to assess the true state of the economy and the\npossible effects of their decision. One example I can use is the steadfastness of\n5 For a variety of Taylor rules and their implication for policy, see the Monetary Policy Report, available on\nthe Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/publications/mpr_default.htm.\n\n- 8 -\npolicymakers in the latter part of 2023, when inflation fell more rapidly than was widely\nexpected, and again in early 2024, when it briefly escalated. The FOMC did not change\ncourse either time, an approach validated by inertial rules.\nA non-inertial rule, on the other hand, allows and in fact calls for relatively quick\nadjustments to policy. The guidance from these rules is more useful when there is a\nturning point in the economy, and policymakers need to stay ahead of events. One saw\nthese non-inertial rules prescribe a sharper rise in the policy rate above the effective\nlower bound starting in 2021 as inflation began climbing above the FOMC’s 2 percent\ntarget. Non-inertial rules are also more useful in the face of major shocks to the economy\nsuch as the 2008 financial crisis and the start of the pandemic.\nThe great promise of rules is that they provide a simple and reliable guide to\npolicy, but what should one do when different rules recommend different policy actions\ngiven the same economic conditions? Right now, inertial rules tell us to move slowly in\nreducing policy rates toward a neutral stance that neither restricts nor stimulates the\neconomy. On the other hand, non-inertial rules tell us to cut the policy rate more\naggressively, subject to the caveat that one is certain of the values of all the ‘star’\nvariables: U*, Y* and r*. I think the answer is that while rules are valuable in helping\nanalyze policy options, they have limitations. Among these are the limits of the data\nconsidered, which is typically narrower than the range of data that policymakers use to\nmake decisions, and also the fact that simple policy rules do not take into account risk\nmanagement, which is often a critical consideration in policy decisions. So, while policy\nrules serve as a good check on discretionary policy, there are times when discretion is\nneeded. As a result, I prefer to think of them as “policy rules of thumb”.\n\n- 9 -\nTurning to my view for the path for policy, let me discuss three scenarios that I\nhave had in mind to manage the risks of upcoming decisions in the medium term.\nThe first scenario is one where the overall strong economic developments that I\nhave described today continue, with inflation nearing the FOMC’s target and the\nunemployment rate moving up only slightly. This scenario implies to me that we can\nproceed with moving policy toward a neutral stance at a deliberate pace. This path would\nbe based on the judgment that the risks to both sides of our dual mandate are balanced.\nIn this circumstance, our job is to keep inflation near 2 percent and not slow the economy\nunnecessarily.\nAnother scenario, less likely in light of recent data, is that inflation falls\nmaterially below 2 percent for some time, and/or the labor market significantly\ndeteriorates. The message here is that demand is falling, the FOMC may suddenly be\nbehind the curve, and that message would argue for moving to neutral more quickly by\nfront-loading cuts to the policy rate.\nThe third scenario applies if inflation unexpectedly escalates either because of\nstronger-than-expected consumer demand or wage pressure, or because of some shock to\nsupply that pushes up inflation. As we learned in the recovery from the pandemic\nrecession, when demand was stronger and supply weaker than initially expected, such\nsurprises do occur. In this circumstance, as long as the labor market isn’t deteriorating,\nwe can pause rate cuts until progress resumes and uncertainty diminishes.\nMost recently, we have seen upward revisions to GDI, an increase in job\nvacancies, high GDP growth forecasts, a strong jobs report and a hotter than expected\nCPI report. This data is signaling that the economy may not be slowing as much as\n\n- 10 -\ndesired. While we do not want to overreact to this data or look through it, I view the\ntotality of the data as saying monetary policy should proceed with more caution on the\npace of rate cuts than was needed at the September meeting. I will be watching to see\nwhether data, due out before our next meeting, on inflation, the labor market and\neconomic activity confirms or undercuts my inclination to be more cautious about\nloosening monetary policy.\nWhatever happens in the near term, my baseline still calls for reducing the policy\nrate gradually over the next year. The median rate for FOMC participants at the end of\n2025 is 3.4 percent, so most of my colleagues likewise expect to reduce policy over the\nnext year. There is less certainty about the final destination. The median estimated\nlonger-run level of the federal funds rate in the Committee’s Summary of Economic\nProjections (SEP) is 2.9 percent, but with quite a wide dispersion, ranging from 2.4\npercent to 3.8 percent. While much attention is given to the size of cuts over the next\nmeeting or two, I think the larger message of the SEP is that there is a considerable extent\nof policy restrictiveness to remove, and if the economy continues in its current sweet\nspot, this will happen gradually.\nThank you again, for the opportunity to be part of today’s conference, and for\nallowing me to share some thoughts, relevant to monetary policy rules and my day job\nback in Washington. The Shadow Committee has elevated the public debate about\nmonetary policy. May you continue to play that role for many years to come.i\ni Note: On October 14, 2024, a sentence on page 10 was corrected to say “restrictiveness”: “I think the\nlarger message of the SEP is that there is a considerable extent of policy restrictiveness to remove, and if\nthe economy continues in its current sweet spot, this will happen gradually.”",

Waller\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nSNB-CIF Conference on Cryptoassets and Financial Innovation\nZürich, Switzerland\nJune 3, 2022\n\nThank you for the chance to be part of this interesting discussion. It’s a pleasure to speak\nwith such a good mix of academic, industry, and official-sector experts about a topic with real\nimportance to the future of the financial system. I know my remarks are coming after a long day,\nand I plan to keep them short. My goal tonight is not to weigh in on whether and how crypto-\nasset markets should be regulated. Instead, I want to make some observations that I hope will\nhelp focus discussion of that question in the right place. The main issue in crypto-asset\nregulation isn’t how to protect sophisticated crypto-investors; it’s how to protect the rest of us.\nBy any measure, the last five years have been a stretch of incredible growth in crypto-\nasset markets. Every aspect of them has expanded, from protocols and platforms, to instruments\nand intermediaries. Public awareness and government attention have increased. Above all,\ncrypto itself has evolved from a limited set of coins meant to provide an alternative means of\npayment to decentralized finance, or “DeFi,” arrangements, meant to provide alternatives to a\nrange of financial products and services.1 Innovation is happening fast, and many of the people\nand groups represented in this room have found new uses in finance for this technology.\nBy law or by practice, many crypto-related products and activities fall between the cracks\nof traditional legal and regulatory structures, outside the so-called “regulatory perimeter.” In that\nenvironment, the normal backstops and safety nets of traditional finance do not necessarily or\nreliably apply. High volatility is the rule, not the exception; fraud and theft occur regularly,\noften at large scale. Your whole pot is always on the table; you take part at your own risk.\nSome DeFi traders understand these dynamics well. If they don’t embrace them, they\nstill accept them as the natural state for a new, exciting, and still relatively unregulated\n1 International Organization of Securities Commissions, IOSCO Decentralized Finance Report (Madrid: OICV-\nIOSCO, March 2022), 3, https://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD699.pdf.\n\n2\nmarketplace. And they have a point: Crypto and DeFi may be new, but these kinds of\nfreewheeling markets aren’t. They often emerge—to quote Professor Debora Spar—after:\n“a sharp movement along the technological frontier—a moment in time when innovation\nleap[s] suddenly outward, creating new opportunities for commerce and tremendous\nenthusiasm among aspiring entrepreneurs. In each case…the technological leap also\ncreate[s] a political gap. Innovation, in other words, enable[s] firms to play in some new\nsphere of activity, free from the rules or regulations that might bind them in another,\nmore established realm.”2\nThat was true with long-distance ocean trade in the 1400s; with the spread of railroad\ntransportation in 19th century America and the explosive growth of banks to fund it; with\n“homebrew” computing in the ’60s and ’70s; and with the internet in the ’90s. New\ntechnology—and a lack of clear rules—meant some new fortunes were made, even as others\nwere lost.\nThere’s a lot to like about these kinds of markets. Entry is often cheap, and exit is often\nswift. Competition can be fierce. And inefficiency can be fatal, so improvements can happen\nquickly. The ideas, practices, and technologies that survive in these rough waters can eventually\ndisrupt and improve older and calmer markets. As I’ve said previously in the context of\n2 Debora L. Spar, Ruling the Waves: From the Compass to the Internet, a History of Business and Politics along the\nTechnological Frontier (New York: Harper Business, 2003), 9.\n\n3\nstablecoins, those positive spillovers can (under the right circumstances) make everyone better\noff.3\nFrom the perspective of many market participants—the ones who survive and thrive in\nthis rough and tumble—regulation isn’t just unnecessary, it’s counterproductive. It drives up\ncosts, creates barriers to entry, and stifles innovation. From some crypto advocates, I have heard\nthis argument as well as a related one: that these experienced investors know what they’re\ngetting into, and that they’re not asking for protection because they believe they don’t need it.\nGiven all of that, the argument goes, why should anyone bring regulation into a space that’s not\nasking for it?\nLet’s focus on crypto-asset users, who are a very different group than just a few years\nago. The Federal Reserve’s most recent Survey of Household Economic Decisionmaking found\nthat 12 percent of adults used or held cryptocurrency in the past year, and more than 90 percent\nof these adults held them for investment purposes rather than payments.4 The Pew Research\nCenter put the number of users even higher at 16 percent, and other polls as high as 20 percent.5\nSome of these users are seasoned professional investors, but others, of course, are not—they’re\nattracted to a new and complicated market by curiosity, by stories of newly minted crypto\nbillionaires, or by promises of high and reliable returns on their life savings.6\n3 Christopher J. Waller, “Reflections on Stablecoins and Payments Innovations” (remarks at the Financial Stability\nConference, Cleveland, OH (via webcast), November 17, 2021),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20211117a.htm.\n4 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households in 2021,\n(Washington: Board of Governors, May 2022), https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/2021-report-\neconomic-well-being-us-households-202205.pdf.\n5 Thomas Franck, “One in five adults has invested in, traded or used cryptocurrency, NBC News poll shows,”\nCNBC, March 31, 2022, https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/31/cryptocurrency-news-21percent-of-adults-have-traded-\nor-used-crypto-nbc-poll-shows.html; Andrew Perrin, “16% of Americans say they have ever invested in, traded or\nused cryptocurrency,” Pew Research Center, November 11, 2021, https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-\ntank/2021/11/11/16-of-americans-say-they-have-ever-invested-in-traded-or-used-cryptocurrency/.\n6 Anthony Cuthbertson, “‘I lost my life savings’: Terra Luna cryptocurrency collapses 98% overnight,” Yahoo!\nNews, May 11, 2022, https://news.yahoo.com/lost-life-savings-terra-luna-160848651.html; Muyao Shen, “DeFi App\n\n4\nNew retail users, by definition, do not have crypto experience. They don’t know how to\nindependently buy a crypto asset, how to obtain and protect a private key, how to conduct trades\non a DeFi protocol, or how to write a smart contract. They need help, and for a price, a range of\nfast-growing exchanges, wallet providers, and other intermediaries are willing to provide it. But\nwhile intermediaries can potentially help monitor and manage risk, they can’t eliminate it. In\nsuch a volatile market, any user still has a meaningful chance of losing their money.\nWhat happens in the aftermath of these losses? On an individual level, one possibility is\na dispute between the intermediary and its customers over poor due diligence, poor financial\nadvice, poor management practices, and so on. Resolving those disputes individually can be\ncostly. So, it’s no surprise that intermediaries would ask for some kind of protection from\nthem—some standard rules of the road that, if followed, create at least some presumption of\nproper conduct. As a result, intermediaries can eventually demand regulation to protect\nthemselves.\nFrom a social perspective, there is another possible outcome when losses become\nwidespread: Those losses become practically, politically, or morally intolerable. When everyday\ninvestors start losing their life savings, for no reason except wanting to participate in a hot\nmarket, demands for collective action can mount quickly. History shows that there will be\ndemands to make individual investors “whole” by socializing their individual losses.

It’s not to protect high-net-worth investors but\nto protect society from the often-irresistible pressure to socialize the losses of investors with\nlimited resources, and to limit the spread of financial stress.8 The desire for a backstop can\nemerge even in an isolated failure—to say nothing of a systemwide event—when uncertainty or\nprivate information moves stress from one asset class to others. By definition, those financial\nexternalities—which central banks, including the Fed, monitor closely—can create losses that\ninnocent parties never signed up for and couldn’t have controlled.9 Those are the kinds of losses\nthat the public often gets asked to cover—and when they do, very often, the public also asks for\nnew oversight and regulations, so the same mistakes don’t happen again.\nIn summary, financial regulation is typically demanded (1) by financial intermediaries as\na form of liability protection and (2) by the taxpayer to prevent socialization of individual losses.\nIt does not arise to protect sophisticated, experienced, well-informed investors. On the contrary:\nLarge-scale losses can easily occur even if these investors are getting the information they need\nto make decisions and are otherwise following the rules.

Waller\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n2023 Arkansas State University Agribusiness Conference\nJonesboro, Arkansas\nFebruary 8, 2023\n\nThank you, Bert, and thank you for the opportunity to talk about where the\neconomy is heading, what the Federal Reserve is doing to get inflation back down to our\n2 percent goal, and how all that is likely to affect American agriculture.1\nThe big picture is that the U.S. economy is adjusting well so far to the higher\ninterest rates that are necessary to rein in inflation. But inflation remains quite elevated,\nand so more needs to be done. Although economic activity slowed in 2022, I expect the\nFed will need to keep a tight stance of monetary policy for some time to slow activity\nfurther in 2023. That is what I believe is needed to bring demand and supply into better\nalignment and lower inflation toward the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) 2\npercent target. Some believe that inflation will come down quite quickly this year. That\nwould be a welcome outcome. But I’m not seeing signals of this quick decline in the\neconomic data, and I am prepared for a longer fight to get inflation down to our target.\nSo, what is my take on the recent data? It looks like the economy grew at a solid\npace in the final quarter of the year, the labor market remained tight, and inflation\ncontinued to retreat. After adjusting for inflation, personal consumption grew at around a\n2 percent rate, though it contracted in the last two months of the year amid some pretty\nsignificant headwinds.\nOne of those headwinds was high inflation, including for food and agricultural\nproducts. After accounting for inflation, spending on food consumed at home fell in\n2022 after rising strongly in 2020 and 2021, the effect of both large price increases over\n1 I am grateful to Katia Peneva for assistance in preparing these remarks. These remarks represent my own\nviews, which do not necessarily represent those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board and the\nFederal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nthe past year and the normalization of spending on groceries, which surged when people\nstayed home during the pandemic and reversed when they returned to restaurants.\nLooking forward, I expect personal consumption will grow modestly and price\nincreases will moderate, and I think such outcomes would bode well for the agricultural\nsector this year. It looks as though economic activity may be moderating further in the\nfirst quarter of 2023, but I expect the U.S. economy to continue growing at a modest pace\nthis year, supported by a strong labor market and by encouraging progress in lowering\ninflation.\nThough we have made progress reducing inflation, I want to be clear today that\nthe job is not done. Inflation is still too high relative to the price stability goal of the dual\nmandate assigned to the Federal Reserve by Congress. The Fed has defined that goal as 2\npercent annual inflation, as measured by the change in the price index for personal\nconsumption expenditures, but another yardstick you could use is when high prices for\ngroceries and other things are no longer front page news, and when farmers can worry\nless about rising costs for fertilizer and other inputs.\nThat is where we intend to get to, and thus the FOMC last week increased the\ntarget range for the federal funds rate by another 25 basis points, to 4½ to 4¾ percent.\nOur intention is to tighten financial conditions, including raising the cost of credit, to\ndampen demand and spending to further reduce inflation. Of course, we know that\nhigher interest rates pose challenges for farmers and ranchers who must borrow to\nsmooth out the costs and returns from agriculture over the year. But excessive inflation is\na larger challenge because it has the potential to become a lasting problem weighing on\neconomic growth, undermining living standards, and hurting consumers, who farmers\n\n- 3 -\ndepend on. That is why I am determined to get the job done, get high inflation off the\nfront pages, and back to being something that households and businesses don’t think too\nmuch about when making decisions.\nContinued upward pressure on inflation comes, in part, from a very tight labor\nmarket. The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey for December continued to show\nthat the demand for workers remains robust, with job openings increasing by over\n500,000 at the end of last year. Based on last Friday’s initial estimate, we learned that the\nU.S. economy created a whopping 517,000 jobs in January, 330,000 more than the solid\ngrowth that was expected by economic forecasters. Furthermore, the unemployment rate\nticked down to 3.4 percent, the lowest level since 1951.\nSuch employment gains mean labor income will also be robust and buoy\nconsumer spending, which could maintain upward pressure on inflation in the months\nahead. For employers, the very strong labor market makes it hard to find and retain\nworkers. One effect of this tightness is seen in wages and other compensation, which\nultimately show up in the prices that consumers pay for goods and services. For\nexample, last year the Employment Cost Index (ECI), which tracks movements in labor\ncosts, including both wages and benefits, increased over 5 percent, the highest rate since\n1984. We want to see wages grow but at a pace that is consistent with our goal of stable\nprices.\nWe have seen some moderation in compensation growth in recent months but not\nenough. The ECI for hourly compensation for private industry workers increased at an\nannual rate of 4 percent over the three months ending in December, a step down from the\n4.3 percent gain recorded over the three months ending in September and the 6.3 percent\n\n- 4 -\nincrease in June but still a strong increase. More recently, the 12-month change in a\nnarrower measure of labor costs, average hourly earnings, was about 4½ percent in\nJanuary, continuing its slow deceleration from 5½ percent last summer. The data are\nmoving in the right direction, but I will watch for further slowing because we don’t want\nexcessive wage increases to be a potential source of higher inflation in the future.\nSo now let’s talk about inflation. I will start with overall inflation and then focus\non the different components, including food. I will talk about what those components can\ntell us about the direction of overall inflation and how I look at the different parts of\ninflation in my approach to monetary policy.\nFigure 1 depicts inflation measured by two common indexes. No matter how one\nmeasures it, inflation has been running too hot for too long. “Overall” or “headline”\ninflation indexes are measured as the rate of increase in the average price level of a broad\ngroup of goods and services, called a market basket. Government statistics on the\ninflation rate will be a function of the specific goods and services included in the market\nbasket. Including a different set of goods and services in the market basket will result in\na different overall inflation rate.\nProbably the most often-discussed inflation measure in the United States is one\nbased on the consumer price index (CPI). The CPI is widely used as a cost-of-living\nindex to adjust Social Security and other payments. The CPI puts considerable weight on\nthe prices of food, energy, and shelter. These three items account for about 50 percent of\nthe expenditures in the CPI basket.2\n2 Food at home, energy and housing represent 49 percent of the CPI basket, whereas all food, energy and\nhousing are 54 percent of the market basket.\n\n- 5 -\nA second measure that is frequently watched is the one I mentioned earlier, the\npersonal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, which places less weight on food,\nenergy and shelter—they make up about 30 percent of the expenditures in the PCE\nbasket. The FOMC chose the PCE index over the CPI for its inflation target in part\nbecause it includes a broader set of goods and services in its market basket and is widely\nbelieved to better capture changes in the mix of goods and services purchased by\nconsumers.\nMonetary policy works with a lag, and after the Federal Reserve started raising\ninterest rates last March, inflation peaked in the middle of 2022 and has been falling\ngradually since then. Twelve-month PCE inflation hit a high of 7 percent in June but\nended the year at 5 percent. By comparison, over the final three months of 2022,\nheadline inflation was much lower, running at an annualized rate of just 2.1 percent. The\ndifference between the three-month and 12-months changes is a signal of ongoing\nmoderation. As has been the case since the summer, falling energy prices are a big\nreason for lower inflation in the last few months, though food price inflation also\nmoderated in the final few months of 2022.\nThese improvements are welcome news, but we need to keep them in perspective.\nAs we can see in the figure, though PCE inflation is down from its peak, it is still quite\nelevated. And while the recent trend is encouraging, the improvements over the past year\nhave been coming in ebbs and flows and it likely will continue this way. I need to be\nconfident that inflation is declining in a sustained manner towards our 2 percent target, so\nI will need to see continued moderation in inflation before my outlook changes.\n\n- 6 -\nSo where do I think inflation is heading? You will often hear economists talk\nabout core inflation, which strips out energy and food prices, which tend to be volatile.\nThe core measure is considered a better guide to the direction of future inflation. You\nmight wonder why it is that the Fed doesn’t just target core inflation in measuring\nprogress toward our price stability goal. There are some good reasons for keeping the\nfocus on overall inflation, and in front of an audience of people who pay a lot of attention\nto food price inflation, I thought I would take a couple minutes to explain why I consider\nfood and all of the components of inflation to be so important in my approach to setting\nmonetary policy.\nThe argument for stripping out food and energy prices is that they tend to be quite\nvolatile, with big ups and downs tending to equal out over time, and thus do not provide a\nclear signal of how inflation in these categories will evolve. One can see the recent\nvolatility in figure 2 that reports 12-month rates of inflation for food and energy. Energy\nprices were decreasing for most of 2020 (they fell 10 percent during that period) but then\nswitched to very large increases in 2021 and the first half of 2022. In mid-2022 we saw\nenergy prices up about 40 percent from the year before. By December, that retraced to\nless than a 7 percent increase over 2021. And I’m sure I don’t have to tell anyone that\nfood inflation has been quite high relative to its pre-pandemic average. Of course, food\nprices haven’t increased as much as energy prices, but food inflation has risen notably in\n2021 and 2022 and has been running above 10 percent recently, which is unusually high.\nI know that farmers have been dealing with sharply rising input costs, and that is a\nsignificant factor driving up wholesale and retail prices for many food products. As\nshown in figure 3, inflation for agricultural chemicals, such as fertilizer, skyrocketed in\n\n- 7 -\n2021 and continued up in early 2022 and, though this inflation has moderated in recent\nmonths, the price level of agricultural chemicals remains very high.\nCore inflation, as shown in Figure 4, didn’t rise as much as headline inflation in\nthis recent period of high food and energy price increases, and lately it hasn’t moderated\nas much. Core inflation stood at 4.4 percent in December, over double the Fed’s 2\npercent target for headline inflation. Core inflation includes a measure of housing\nservices, which is what households pay for rent or the equivalent for those who own their\nhomes. Housing services inflation has been stubbornly high for all of 2022 and is a big\nfactor driving up core inflation. There is good reason to believe rents will moderate\nsignificantly over this year and so some people have suggested that the focus should be\non a “super core” measure of inflation that excludes food, energy, and housing. That\nwould make inflation look not nearly as bad over the last year or two and also likely not\nshow much improvement in the coming months.\nBut there are a few reasons why I don’t let these stripped-down measures of\ninflation shape my views of the inflation environment. First, yes, historically food and\nenergy prices have been volatile, and it has not been unusual to see price increases\nfollowed by price declines over fairly short periods of time, but that isn’t the recent\nhistory. In the last two years, prices for these goods and services have been moving\nlargely in one direction—up—and even the decline in energy prices we saw in the second\nhalf of 2022 hasn’t offset the huge increases earlier.\nThe second reason that I wouldn’t exclude food, energy, and housing prices, or\nwant to move toward a narrower inflation target, is that, by any measure of headline\ninflation, they constitute a large share of expenses paid by people. Excluding this large\n\n- 8 -\nshare of consumer spending doesn’t give you an accurate picture of what consumers are\nfacing in their everyday lives, and that is a perspective that policymakers should never\nforget.\nThe third reason to include, rather than exclude, these prices in considering\ninflation is that they make up an even larger share of expenses for lower-income people,\nwho have less savings and other means to deal with the ups and downs of their finances\nand the economy. Recent research indicates that the share of overall spending that lower-\nincome households dedicate to food, energy and housing is about 1.2 times (or 20 percent\nmore) than the share spent by higher-income households. Because of this disparity, when\ninflation peaked last summer, lower-income households effectively faced inflation that\nwas a percentage point higher than was paid by higher-income households.3\nLastly, and this is really the bottom line, the Fed has stated that its target for\ninflation is headline PCE prices. So, to meet the Fed’s price stability objective,\npolicymakers are accounting for all the categories of goods and services that affect\nhouseholds.\nWith that context, let me take a few minutes on each of the three big categories to\nhighlight how they have been moving, and I think there is some good news. Let’s look at\neach category in the order of how much consumers spend on them each month. Housing\nservices are about 15 percent of the PCE basket. Figure 5 shows how housing inflation\nhas been evolving both when measured on a 12-month basis (left panel) and 3-month\nbasis (right panel). As I just noted, housing inflation has been stubbornly elevated. This\nis true if you look at inflation over the past year or just at recent months. But high\n3 Based on work by Jake Orchard (2022) that matches consumption spending by income with CPI data.\nSee https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4033572\n\n- 9 -\nfrequency measures of market rents (for new leases by new tenants) have slowed sharply,\nsuggesting an upcoming slowing in the rate of inflation in this part of the PCE basket.\nBecause rents usually don’t change until leases run out, these recent declines in market\nrent inflation will only show through to the official inflation measure with a delay. So I\nexpect, over time, that housing inflation will move down to be more in line with core\ninflation.\nTurning to food, which represents about 7.5 percent of consumption in the PCE\nbasket, figure 6 shows that the 12-month change in PCE food prices has greatly outpaced\nthat of core PCE inflation over the past couple of years. More recently, we can see that\nthe 3-month change in the PCE price index for food has slowed considerably, which is a\ngood sign. But food inflation is still above the average annual pace of 1.1 percent over\nthe ten years preceding the pandemic. This ongoing elevated food inflation likely reflects\npassthrough of the past strong increases in food commodity prices, rising labor and fuel\ncosts, as well as supply-chain bottlenecks in packaging and transportation that have\nlimited supplies amid strong demand. For example, as seen in figure 7, spot prices for\ncattle and soybeans are well above their levels at the onset of the pandemic, likely\nboosted by the sharply rising input costs farmers have been facing, which I discussed\nearlier. However, futures prices for these commodities suggest limited movements in\nthese prices through year end. If this plays out, with a slowdown in wage increases that\nshould occur because of tighter monetary policy, this should help continue to moderate\nfood inflation over the next few years.\nFinally, let’s turn to energy inflation. Households spend less than 5 percent of\ntheir PCE basket on gasoline, electricity, and heating but, as seen in the left panel of\n\n- 10 -\nfigure 8, the energy price index skyrocketed over the past couple of years, reflecting a\nsurge in crude oil prices after the pandemic recession which was exacerbated by Russia’s\ninvasion of Ukraine. Turning to the 3-month change (the right panel) energy prices have\nbeen declining sharply recently and we expect them to continue to decline this year,\nreflecting the path of crude oil futures prices and the expectation that unusually elevated\ngasoline margins will, on average, decline over the remainder of this year.\nSo, what do I take away from all this? I think there are practical implications for\ngetting a clear picture of the economy and setting appropriate monetary policy, and also a\nreminder for me about the trust I bear as a public official.\nMost practically, if I had focused on core inflation over the last two years and tended\nto look past increases for food and energy, and especially for housing, I would have\nmissed an alarming increase in inflation, and reacted more slowly than my Federal\nReserve colleagues and I appropriately did to start bringing down inflation. The Federal\nOpen Market Committee raised interest rates more quickly than it had in more than forty\nyears, and I think the progress we have made on inflation shows how important it was to\nact so urgently.\nJust as importantly, excluding those prices would have neglected how much hardship\nthis high inflation has been for many people, especially lower-income individuals and\nfamilies. High inflation is a very different experience when you are effectively paying a\nhigher rate than others, when a higher share of your expenses and income are spent on\nnecessities, and when you have little in savings to draw on, as lower-income people do.\nWhen I talk about how important it is to win this inflation fight, it is partly in recognition\nof this inescapable reality for many millions of people.\n\n- 11 -\nFortunately, there are signs that food, energy, and shelter prices will moderate this\nyear. An important factor has been the Federal Reserve’s ongoing fight to lower inflation\nthrough tighter monetary policy. We are seeing that effort begin to pay off, but we have\nfarther to go. And, it might be a long fight, with interest rates higher for longer than\nsome are currently expecting. But I will not hesitate to do what is needed to get my job\ndone.\n\nThe Inflation Rate for Necessities: A Look\nat Food, Energy, and Shelter Inflation\nChristopher J.

Waller\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe Clearing House Annual Conference 2024\nNew York, New York\nNovember 12, 2024\n\nThank you for inviting me to speak here today.1 The Clearing House is a great\nplace to talk about the evolution of clearing and settlement of payments in the United\nStates. The key question I want to address today is, what roles should the private sector\nand the Federal Reserve play in payments?\nAs a strong believer in the benefits of a capitalist system, I hold the view that it is\ngenerally the private sector that can most reliably and efficiently provide goods and\nservices to the economy. And I apply this view to the payments ecosystem.\nIt is that perspective that underlies a question I often ask when forming my\npositions on the appropriate role the Federal Reserve should play in a wide variety of\ninitiatives: What is the fundamental market inefficiency that would be solved by\ngovernment intervention and can only be solved by government intervention? If there\nisn’t a satisfactory answer, then I believe government shouldn’t intervene in private\nmarkets. Does this mean I believe the Federal Reserve should not be involved in\npayments? No. While I generally believe that government shouldn’t directly compete\nwith the private sector, there are situations where government involvement is needed to\nsolve for market inefficiencies that may arise because of things like incomplete markets,\ncoordination problems, or a lack of resilience.\nAs a policymaker, I have applied that same question to issues ranging from bank\nregulation to monetary policy. For an example in the payments area, three years ago\nthere was an increase in public discussion about creating a new payment instrument\ncalled a central bank digital currency (CBDC). The Federal Reserve Board was\ncompiling a report and seeking public comment on the potential benefits and risks of the\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board.\n\n- 2 -\nidea. In a speech I gave in August 2021, I asked, what problem would a CBDC solve? In\nother words, what market failure or inefficiency demands this specific intervention?2 In\nmore than three years, I have yet to hear a satisfactory answer as applied to CBDC.\nGiven today’s audience and my position serving as the chair of the Board’s\npayments committees, I want to focus on the important roles the private sector and the\nFederal Reserve play in our ever-evolving payment system. To set the stage for that\ndiscussion, I think it is helpful to recap some history around payments and clearing in the\nUnited States.3\nIn the early decades following the country’s founding, banks generally had state\ncharters. While state banknotes and checks circulated locally as payment instruments,\nthere were difficulties clearing and settling checks across states. One way of describing\nthis is to say that the early U.S. payment system suffered from incomplete markets. The\nSecond Bank of the United States was created in 1816 and, due to its federal charter, it\nwas able to create a national system for clearing checks and banknotes. This in turn led\nto a more complete national clearing and settlement process.\nWhen the charter for the Second Bank lapsed, clearing and settlement of\nbanknotes and checks fell back to state-chartered banks. Many of the earlier\ninefficiencies resurfaced. For example, porters in New York City would deliver checks\nand exchange them for gold or other coins and then transport that “specie” to the payee.\nHauling these money bags around New York posed obvious risks, and these risks\n2 See Christopher J. Waller (2021), “CBDC: A Solution in Search of a Problem?” speech delivered at the\nAmerican Enterprise Institute, Washington (via webcast), August 5,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20210805a.htm.\n3 I am drawing on material in Stephen Quinn and William Roberds (2008), “The Evolution of the Check as\na Means of Payment: A Historical Survey,” Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Economic Review,\nvol. 93 (4), pp. 1–28.\n\n- 3 -\nmultiplied by the mid-19th century when the number of banks in New York grew rapidly.\nAs this audience is well aware, the New York Clearing House Association (NYCH) was\nfounded in 1853 and served as a central location for the clearing process, which soon\nevolved, with certificates replacing coins. Furthermore, by being part of a common\ninfrastructure, all members had a reasonably good idea of the quality of each other’s\nbalance sheets. In modern economic language, the NYCH became a coordination\nmechanism that improved clearing by getting banks to clear and settle payments in a\nwell-organized manner. It also reduced asymmetric information about the quality of\nmember balance sheets. By performing this function for New York banks, which\nconstituted a relatively large share of the U.S. financial system, the clearing and settling\nof payments improved nationally. In this sense, the NYCH was the closest thing the\nUnited States had at that time to a central bank.4\nWhile this was an improvement, not all important financial intermediaries were\nmembers of the NYCH or other such private arrangements. That is, there were gaps.\nAnd financial panics, sometimes driven by gaps and problems in check clearing, were a\nregular feature of the latter 19th and early 20th century.\nThe Panic of 1907 was a classic example of that. Depositors and investors lost\nconfidence in certain New York banks that had been combined into large, complex, and\nopaque trust companies that were not members of the NYCH. This resulted in runs on\nthose trusts, which led to broader liquidity problems. Although the NYCH had the ability\nto provide liquidity to those trusts, the provision of that liquidity was delayed. It appears\nthat at the time, the NYCH was, reasonably, observing some form of Bagehot’s dictum\n4 See Eugene Nelson White (2016), The Regulation and Reform of the American Banking System, 1900–\n1929 (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press).\n\n- 4 -\nwhen deciding whether to provide liquidity. Under that dictum, you want to know that\nthe institution to which you’re providing liquidity is solvent. If it isn’t, then the liquidity\nextension could be akin to throwing good money after bad. But because the trust\ncompanies at the time weren’t member institutions, the clearinghouse didn’t have a good\nenough understanding of their balance sheets to know whether they were solvent.5 Some\nbanks refused to clear checks from other institutions, which led to an erosion of depositor\nconfidence and more failures. This historical example points to another aspect of a\npayment system that is important—resilience of the system.\nThese problems highlighted by the 1907 panic—coordination failures and a lack\nof resilience—could have been mitigated with the help of a central bank. Paul Warburg,\nan influential banker at the time, argued that such a central bank could “establish and\nmaintain a perfect system of credit, enabling the general banks to transform cash credits\ninto actual cash with such absolute ease and certainty that the use of cash credit, instead\nof actual cash, will not cease, no matter what may happen.”6\nIn 1913, Congress agreed and created the Federal Reserve. It positioned the\nFederal Reserve at the center of the banking system by establishing a nationwide check-\nclearing system and a telegraph wire transfer service that is now known as Fedwire®.\nThe Fed was also intended to function as a lender of last resort so that suspension of\npayments would no longer be necessary. In the 1970s, the Fed promoted more efficient\ncheck-clearing by adding the automated clearinghouse service. Our job in providing\n5 See Jon R. Moen and Ellis W.

Warburg (1911), “A United Reserve Bank of the United States,” Proceedings of the Academy\nof Political Science in the City of New York, vol. 1 (January), pp. 302–42.\n\n- 5 -\nthese services and carrying out our responsibilities was and continues to be to make sure\nthe payment system functions efficiently and resiliently, promoting the kind of\nconfidence that is vital for a modern economy.\nThe lesson from this history, as relevant now as ever, is that the payment system\nhas been one of those areas in which the best efforts of the private sector have sometimes\nfallen short. The decentralized and diverse nature of banks in the United States is a\nfeature that goes back to the 1800s and has the merits of promoting competition and a\nvibrant economy. However, when engaging in clearing and settling payments,\ncoordination problems and information asymmetries across banks can be, and were,\ndestabilizing. While the private sector made advances in resolving those issues, the Panic\nof 1907 showed that those steps were not sufficient. As successful as the NYCH was for\nits members, it could not protect its members and the economy from risks in the growing\nshare of finance occurring outside its walls. This contributed to the motivation to\nestablish the Federal Reserve and its role in payments.\nFast forward to today, and we are once again in an era of rapid change and\ninnovation in money and payments. Some of this will not pan out. Some of this change\nis about delivering services already available but doing so with new technologies. And\nsome of it is leveraging new technology to rethink existing payment, clearing, and\nsettlement structures. How will all of this come together? And what will be the\nrespective roles of the private sector and the Federal Reserve? Let’s break it down,\nkeeping in mind my principle that the Federal Reserve should focus on addressing issues\nthat the private sector cannot address alone and, in doing so, promote an efficient and\nresilient U.S. payment system.\n\n- 6 -\nI’ll start by discussing the important roles that the private sector now plays in the\npayment system and in the evolution of payments under way. The private sector\nconnects consumers and businesses to the payment system, with financial institutions\ncompeting to provide services to their customers. Such competition can lead to better\nproducts and services for consumers as profit-seeking competitors look for opportunities\nto win over customers including through the adoption of new technologies. I have noted\nmy concern that some see these new technologies as an opportunity for the public sector\nto play a bigger role in payments, which may crowd out private investment. I believe this\nwould be a policy mistake and a better approach is one in which the private sector\ncontinues to have a significant footprint, with the role of government limited.\nOne important reason for that is that the private sector, through competition, is\ntypically best situated to sort out good ideas from bad ideas, rather than central banks or\nother public-sector institutions choosing winners and losers. At the early stages of\ninnovation, the true value-added of the application of new technologies is murky. Market\ncompetition helps sort that out and typically leads to a wider range of products that can be\nbetter suited to the needs of consumers.\nBut just as was the case in the time of Warburg, there remain problems in\npayments that can’t be fully resolved by the private sector. And just as we have done\nthroughout history, the Federal Reserve stands ready to support the evolution in payments\nand do so primarily through our operational role in the payment system, by providing\ncore clearing and settlement infrastructure on which the private sector can innovate.\nNotably, the Fed has the unique ability to provide the infrastructure to reliably settle\ninterbank obligations using balances at the central bank, which enhances the stability of\n\n- 7 -\nthe banking system and the broader economy, reflecting the lessons learned in 1907 and\nthrough earlier banking panics.\nCompared with many other countries where a small number of large banks\ndominate, the United States has thousands of banks and credit unions. Connecting those\nmany organizations to a payment network requires a significant amount of coordination.\nOne recent example of an area in which we’re playing such a coordination role is in\ninstant payments. The role we’re playing with FedNow is to help with that coordination\nproblem using our existing connections to those thousands of institutions. And that\napproach is consistent with my overall view of the appropriate role of government—to\nnarrowly address problems like those of coordination that can’t always be efficiently\nsolved by the private sector alone. In doing so, we complement the private sector and\npromote responsible and efficient innovation in the broader market.\nWith respect to new and emerging technologies in finance, I can think of two\nways in which the private sector is uniquely positioned to develop and deploy them while\nthe government is not well suited to do so. First is the question of innovation risk—the\ninvestment in new payment technologies is large and comes with risk of failure. Private-\nsector entities, risking their own funds and seeking to turn a profit, will have a greater\nincentive to accurately gauge demand for these technologies and bring those products to\nmarket faster. Second, despite the current fascination around the world with industrial\npolicy, rarely can the government match the ability of the private sector to efficiently\nallocate resources and explore how well new technologies can address actual\nshortcomings in the current payment system. It is too early to tell whether some of the\nnew technologies will relieve significant frictions in the payment system, but it is going\n\n- 8 -\nto be the private sector, betting with its own money, that is best positioned to explore this\nquestion.\nIf problems emerge, as they did with check clearing in the 19th century, then\ngovernment can play a constructive role in overcoming them. Well before this point,\nhowever, it makes sense for the public and private sectors to look down the road together\nand engage in dialogue about potential issues and opportunities that might arise. For\nexample, through the Bank for International Settlements, the Fed is engaged with the\nprivate sector to explore how tokenization technology might be used to facilitate cross-\nborder payments in a faster and cheaper manner. This project brings together multiple\ncentral banks and private-sector financial firms in collaboration to potentially facilitate a\nbetter-functioning monetary system.7 That process of working together to promote the\nefficiency and safety of the payment system, as the Federal Reserve has done for decades,\ncan lead to outcomes that benefit households, businesses, and the overall economy.\nAmerican entrepreneurship and technical prowess have generated exciting\ninnovations in payments, and they will continue to do so. The role of the Federal Reserve\nis to support that initiative and engage with the private sector to promote innovation\nwhile guarding against risks to financial stability. We’ve managed this balancing act\nbefore and will continue to do so. And, together, we will ensure that the payments\necosystem continues to move forward for the benefit of households and businesses.\n7 See Bank for International Settlements (2024), “Private Sector Partners Join Project Agorá,” webpage,\nSeptember 16, https://www.bis.org/about/bisih/topics/fmis/agora.htm.",

Waller\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nDistinguished Speaker Seminar\nEuropean Economics and Financial Center\nLondon, United Kingdom\nOctober 18, 2023\n\nThank you, Professor Scobie. Thank you to the European Economics and\nFinancial Centre for inviting me to speak and for the honor of referring to me as a\n“distinguished speaker.” I have noticed that people started calling me “distinguished”\nonly after my hair turned white. I suspect that “distinguished” is a polite way of saying\nyou are old.\nMy subject today is one I trust is of interest in this center of global finance—\nnamely, the outlook for the U.S. economy and the implications for monetary policy.1 It\nhas been one year and seven months since the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates\nto rein in inflation, and there has been considerable progress. But uncertainties remain,\nboth about the forces that will shape the economic outlook in the coming months and\nabout whether monetary policy has reached a level that is sufficiently restrictive to\nsupport continued progress toward the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) target\nof 2 percent inflation. Let me share my thinking about what recent economic data can,\nand in some cases, cannot tell us about the outlook and the appropriate setting for\nmonetary policy.\nThe data in the past few months has been overwhelmingly positive for both of the\nFOMC’s goals of maximum employment and stable prices. Economic activity and the\nlabor market have been strong, with what looks like growth well above trend and\nunemployment near a 50-year low. Meanwhile, there has been continued, gradual\nprogress in lowering inflation, and moderation in wage growth. This is great news, and\nwhile I tend to be an optimist, things are looking a little too good to be true, so it makes\nme think that something’s gotta give. Either growth moderates, fostering conditions that\n1 The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee.\n\nsupport continued progress toward our 2 percent inflation objective, or growth doesn’t,\npossibly undermining that progress. But which is going to give—the real side of the\neconomy or the nominal side?\nI find myself thinking about two possible scenarios for the economy in the\ncoming months. In the first, the real side of the economy slows. This is the scenario\nbroadly reflected in the September Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) by FOMC\nparticipants, where an easing in demand helps bring the economy into better balance with\nsupply and allows inflation to move closer to our 2 percent objective. In this scenario, I\nbelieve we can hold the policy rate steady and let the economy evolve in the desired\nmanner.\nBut I also can’t avoid thinking about the second scenario, where demand and\neconomic activity continue at their recent pace, possibly putting persistent upward\npressure on inflation and stalling or even reversing progress toward 2 percent. In such a\nscenario, failing to take action in a timely way carries the considerable risk of\nundermining what have been fairly stable inflation expectations and possibly unwinding\nthe work that we have done to date. Thus, more action would be needed on the policy\nrate to ensure that inflation moves back to target and expectations remain anchored.\nBefore getting into the economic data, let me address the increase in medium- and\nlonger-term interest rates that has occurred since July. The 10-year Treasury yield is up\nabout 90 basis points, while shorter-term maturities increased only a quarter of this\namount and primarily early in the period. There are several factors that have been\nmentioned to explain this movement, including stronger-than-expected incoming data on\nthird quarter economic activity, an increased focus on U.S. deficits and the associated\n\nincrease in Treasury issuance, as well as geopolitical events and a flight to safety.\nWhatever the causes, I will be watching how these interest rates evolve in coming months\nto evaluate their impact on financial conditions and economic activity.\nLet’s now dig into the recent economic data, starting with those on economic\nactivity that help us get a handle on the strength of demand. Real gross domestic product\n(GDP) grew at about a 2 percent annual rate in the latter part of 2022 and the first half of\n2023. Recent data suggest that this pace stepped up in the third quarter. The latest\nconsensus estimate from the Blue Chip survey of business forecasters was that third-\nquarter real GDP grew 3.5 percent, and the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow model is coming in\neven higher. We’ll get a first look at the third quarter GDP number next week, but it\nseems clear that economic activity was substantially higher for July through September\nthan earlier in the year.\nThe question is whether that acceleration of real activity will be sustained.\nSometimes an uptick in activity is followed by some payback, or slowdown. For\nexample, if firms pull construction forward because of good weather, then current\nstructures investment will be high now but lower in the next period. Thus, we want to be\ncareful and not pay too much attention to the specific month activity took place but\ninstead average growth over a couple of quarters to get a clearer picture of the underlying\nstrength of the economy.\nTo see this point more clearly, recall that at the start of this year, personal\nconsumption expenditures increased dramatically in the first quarter but subsequently\ngrew less rapidly in Q2 of 2023. A similar dynamic may be playing out now. On the\nother hand, if the third quarter data represents the beginning of persistently stronger\n\ndemand, then we can expect that strength to show up in the fourth-quarter data, including\nby putting upward pressure on prices, which could have ramifications for upcoming\ndecisions on monetary policy.\nIn thinking about these two possibilities, let me tell you how I view two key\ncomponents of GDP growth this year.\nConsumer spending, which represents nearly 70 percent of GDP, has been quite\nstrong thus far in 2023. While household spending has been volatile, smoothing it out\nover the past several quarters indicates underlying momentum. Yesterday’s September\nretail sales data indicated continued strong spending.\nThe solid spending in the face of tightened monetary policy suggests consumption\nis likely supported by households’ strong balance sheets as well as confidence in future\nlabor income. I will be watching the spending data carefully, including those that hint at\na slowdown. Though hard to measure, it seems that households are drawing down their\nliquid assets. Some other data supporting a slowing include more use of credit cards this\nyear and a return of delinquency rates for consumer loans, which plunged over the course\nof the pandemic, to essentially their pre-pandemic levels.2 Also, as I mentioned earlier,\nfinancial conditions have tightened considerably since July. Of course, I have been\nwaiting a while for tightening financial conditions to cause a significant slowing of\nspending, and I have been consistently surprised at the resilience of consumer spending.\nSo I will be patient in waiting for the data to document how spending evolves.\nAnother component of GDP that I’ll be watching is investment in non-residential\nstructures. Manufacturing investment boosted real GDP growth in the first half of the\n2 This fact holds for both auto and credit card delinquencies across all levels of the income distribution.\n\nyear, partly driven by a surge in the construction of semiconductor and electric battery\nfactories that began before new government subsidies were enacted and driven higher by\nthat legislation. Recent data suggests this spending is leveling off at a new, higher level:\nConstruction spending growth has flattened out in recent months, and so have new\nproject starts. In addition, the considerably higher interest rates over the past three\nmonths can dampen this growth. Only time will tell whether these factors slow\ninvestment activity or whether the subsidy programs and the enthusiasm for onshore chip\nand battery production continue to encourage higher investment spending.\nLet me turn now to the labor market. Since the FOMC’s September meeting, the\nlabor market data indicate continued tight conditions. The economy created 336,000 jobs\nin September, a robust figure that was much higher than forecasters expected. While the\nprevious two job reports had signaled softer job growth, revisions to those reports added\nanother 100,000 jobs. While down from the elevated levels seen in the first part of last\nyear, the latest three-month average for new jobs of 266,000 is not that much different\nfrom the three-month average at the end of 2022 of 284,000. The inference is that job\ngrowth is still exceptionally strong and hasn’t slowed much this year.\nOther data, however, are showing some continued loosening of conditions in the\nlabor market. For example, looking through some monthly volatility, the number of job\nopenings for every person counted as looking for a job was 1.2 in 2019 and shot up to a\npeak of 2 in March 2022. As we tightened policy and put downward pressure on labor\ndemand, this ratio fell to 1.8 at this time last year and is currently 1.5. In addition, labor\nforce participation has moved up notably this year, particularly among prime-age\nworkers. Looking across various measures of labor compensation, the rate of wage\n\ngrowth has also moderated, despite an unemployment rate that is near a 50-year low.\nThese metrics are not yet at their pre-pandemic levels but are moving closer to levels that\nwould be consistent with 2 percent inflation.\nIn sum, although the labor market is showing signs of loosening by various\nmetrics, it is still unusually tight. While I anticipate that it will continue to loosen, I will\nbe watching closely to see that this remains true.\nNow let’s talk about inflation. As reported a week ago, headline inflation\nbased on the consumer price index (CPI) was 3.7 percent in the 12 months through\nSeptember, down significantly from 8.2 percent the year before. Core inflation,\nexcluding energy and food prices, was 4.1 percent, down from 6.7 percent last\nSeptember. We will get an update on personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation\nnext week, but based on data we received through August, the 12-month percent change\nin PCE inflation was 3.5 percent and core PCE inflation was 3.9 percent.\nFocusing on the annualized three-month change in inflation gives a better, albeit\nnoisy, indicator of inflation dynamics. With this measure, core CPI was 3.1 percent\nbased on data from July through September. Core PCE, increased 2 percent based on\nJune through August. Across the categories that make up these price indexes, one finds\nthat more than half of them had annualized monthly price increases of less than 3 percent.\nClearly, this is progress. And there are some factors that would be expected to\nput downward pressure on inflation in the coming months. Monetary policy is restrictive.\nHouseholds are spending the excess saving accumulated during the pandemic and have\ngrowing levels of debt, which are likely to moderate spending growth. The increase in\n\nmedium and longer-term interest rates over the past several months should weigh on both\nhousehold and business spending.\nBut, while core PCE inflation over the last three months has declined to our 2\npercent target, there are a couple of reasons to be concerned that this progress might not\ncontinue. First, in the latest CPI report, despite expectations of continued deceleration,\nhousing services prices jumped from a monthly change of 0.3 percent to 0.6 percent. I\nhave been concerned since May about a resurgence of housing services inflation and this\nnumber heightens my concern that housing services inflation has not slowed, and may not\nslow, to the rate needed to sustain a return to our 2 percent target. Similarly, supercore\ninflation, which is core services excluding housing, has continued at a robust monthly\nrate of about 0.5 percent the past two months. Again, this reading is not at a level needed\nto make progress toward our goal and we need to watch and see if these numbers indicate\nthat inflation is reaccelerating.\nThe second reason to be concerned is that, while there is some basis for expecting\nthat inflation will continue to fall, let me remind you, as I have done repeatedly, that we\nhave seen a string of good inflation reports evaporate multiple times in the recent past.\nSo I will be watching the next several reports for clearer indications that inflation is on a\ntrajectory to 2 percent.\nWhat does that mean for monetary policy? I will be looking carefully at the data\nto see whether the real side of the economy begins to cool off or whether prices, the\nnominal side of the economy, heat up. As of today, it is too soon to tell. Consequently, I\nbelieve we can wait, watch and see how the economy evolves before making definitive\nmoves on the path of the policy rate. Should the real side of the economy soften, we will\n\nhave more room to wait on any further rate hikes and let the recent run-up on longer-term\nrates do some of our work. But if the real economy continues showing underlying\nstrength and inflation appears to stabilize or reaccelerate, more policy tightening is likely\nneeded despite the recent run up in longer term rates.\nSo I will be watching to see if core inflation comes in higher than expected,\nperhaps sustained by continued strength in spending and investment or, if demand and the\nreal economy slow, moderating core inflation. My views on the appropriate path for\npolicy will be based on a careful assessment of incoming data and financial market\ndevelopments and a judgement about whether we are continuing on a path of sustained\nprogress toward 2 percent inflation.\nThank you. I am happy to take some questions.",

Waller\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nAward Ceremony for the Winners of the\nBank Al-Maghrib Prize for Economic and Financial Research\nBank of Al-Maghrib\nRabat, Morocco\nMay 14, 2025\n\nThank you for the opportunity to speak to you today.1\nI have spent most of my career conducting research and overseeing research by\nothers, first as a professor and later as a research director in the Federal Reserve System.\nMore recently, I have been more of a consumer than a producer of research as a member\nof the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). Eight times a year, the FOMC meets to\nset the appropriate stance of monetary policy to achieve the economic goals assigned to\nus by the U.S. Congress. We discuss where the economy stands in relation to those\ngoals, how it is likely to evolve, and the implications for monetary policy. We examine\nhard statistical data, “soft” data in the form of surveys and input from business contacts,\nand other domestic and global factors.\nAnother vital input for central bankers is economic research. Nearly all central\nbanks have a research group to help policymakers think through the effects of monetary\npolicy on the economy. In the Federal Reserve, the 12 regional Reserve Banks and the\nBoard of Governors have staffs that perform a variety of research activities. First and\nforemost, they use research to advise the Governors and Bank presidents on the\nappropriate path of monetary policy given current events. Second, they provide analysis\nof the global, U.S., and regional economies. Third, economists at the Reserve Banks\nmeet with businesses in their Districts to discuss economic issues and to collect\ninformation about the local economy. Finally, there are research groups around the\nFederal Reserve System that focus on banking, payments, financial markets, financial\nstability, and community development.\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nThe word “research” is used very loosely in everyday life. When I was a\nprofessor, my undergraduates would do “research” to write a term paper. When I go on\nvacation, I often do “research” on what to do or see at my destination. Analysts at\nfinancial institutions do “research” on individual firms or sectors of the economy. For\ntoday’s talk, I narrow in on the types of research done at central banks, with a focus on\nthe Federal Reserve.\nResearch at the Federal Reserve\nResearch is a vital input for providing state-of-the-art advice to policymakers\nwithin the Federal Reserve System. Because the Fed is accountable to the public,\npolicymakers must be able to explain why certain actions were taken and describe the\nintellectual foundations underlying those decisions. Decisions are analyzed, discussed,\nand criticized by many, in particular by highly skilled and knowledgeable academic\nresearchers. Top academics are on the cutting edge of research, particularly on the\nsubject of monetary policy. Milton Friedman, Allan Meltzer, Robert Lucas, John Taylor,\nand Michael Woodford are just a few examples of academic scholars who challenged\ncentral bankers over the past 70 years on how monetary policy should be conducted.\nCentral banks must be up to the challenge and be able to debate and compete with these\nacademics in the world of theory and ideas.\nTo do that requires hiring central bank economists who are trained in the\nacademic research tradition and continue working at the research frontier. And that\nmeans pursing academic research at central banks. Our decisions will be better if we hire\nmotivated and well-trained economists and let them work on the big questions that\neconomics seeks to answer. The Federal Reserve tries to create a strong academic\n\n- 3 -\nresearch environment to attract strong researchers to work at the Federal Reserve to give\nus a better foundation for the decisions we make.\nWhen I was research director at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, I told our\nboard of directors that my goal was to build a department that was renowned for\nproducing high-quality academic research. They often responded by saying, “But the\nFederal Reserve is not a university. Rather than doing academic research, why isn’t your\nstaff doing research on issues that you direct them to work on that helps the president of\nthe Bank?” This is a great question and one that should be asked at every central bank.\nTo answer that question, I would start by explaining the difference between academic\nresearch and directed research, which I will now do today. Once I have, it will be clear\nthat directed research relies on its grounding in academic research and is a complement to\ndirected research in supporting policymaking.\nAcademic Research\nAcademic research considers a broad range of economic matters. It often focuses\non issues that are currently off the radar screens of policymakers who are focused on the\nnear-term economic outlook. But there is value in thinking broadly. Not too long ago,\ntrade policy and tariffs were not a major concern of policymakers. A critical aspect of\nacademic research is that it is often “proactive”—it focuses on intellectually interesting\nissues often before they become relevant for monetary policy.\nAcademic research conducted by Federal Reserve economists is often done with\nthe goal of publishing it in academic journals. Papers submitted to these journals go\nthrough a rigorous vetting process by economists outside the central bank. This serves as\nan important check on central bank “group think.” The ideas and conclusions of the\n\n- 4 -\npaper must be based on sound economic theory and empirical evidence. They cannot\nreflect dogma or outdated beliefs about how the economy operates.\nAcademic research can take the form of an evaluation of major economic events,\nsometimes called an “economic autopsy.” This type of analysis can take years, and it’s\nnot particularly time sensitive. To this day, economists are still researching the causes of\nthe 2008 financial crisis and how policies undertaken at that time helped or hindered the\nsubsequent economic recovery.\nDirected Research\nThen there is directed research. Directed research is just that—an issue or policy\nproblem that staff economists are told to work on by their supervisors. It is not\nunrestricted thinking about an issue. Often, directed research addresses an emerging\ntopic that demands attention from policymakers. As a result, directed research is usually\nreactive in nature. It often has the feel of firefighting—an issue flares up, and\npolicymakers must respond. They need analysis of the problem to think about the issue\nand how to act. For example, the April 2 tariff announcement was larger and more\nextensive than nearly anyone expected. Immediately, questions were asked of staff\naround the Federal Reserve System such as, “What will this do to the U.S. economy?\nWhat will happen to inflation and unemployment?” The answers to these questions are\nobviously time sensitive.\nDirected research often involves running shocks though existing economic\nmodels or quick data analysis and it relies on existing economic research. One could call\nthe results “quick and dirty” answers. Because this work is time sensitive, central bank\nresearchers do not have the luxury of getting their directed research vetted by the\n\n- 5 -\neconomics profession. They simply figure out how the current issue can be incorporated\ninto the models or analyzed with econometrics, and whatever answer comes out is the\nbest they can do in the time they have.\nBecause directed research is often reactive and time sensitive, researchers must\nrely on existing published research as a key input into their analysis. You cannot come\nup with original or innovative models on the spot to deal with an issue that suddenly\nappears. And, on the data front, you may not have the time to look deeply at the\nmicrodata. In these situations, existing academic research done by central bank\neconomists and by academics outside the central bank provides the foundation for\nconducting the directed research. This is why I say that academic research is a\ncomplement to directed research. Good directed research requires academic research.\nFurthermore, postmortem analysis is not always done after directed research is\ncompleted. Once the issue goes off policymakers’ radar screens, it might not be looked\nat again. If the issue resurfaces at a later date, then there may be some postmortem\ninvestigation into earlier analyses to see what went right and what went wrong.\nFinally, directed research sometimes takes the form of analysis involving the\ngathering and organizing of facts and data to generate a simple narrative for less\nspecialized audiences. The Beige Book—which is a survey of regional economic\nconditions done by the Reserve Banks—is a clear example. But it also takes other forms,\nsuch as talks by research economists to private-sector audiences, presentations to the\nReserve Bank boards of directors, or writing about timely topics in short economic posts.\n\n- 6 -\nHistory of Research at the Federal Reserve\nEconomic research has shaped monetary policy at the Federal Reserve from its\nvery beginnings, but the form and use of that research has varied considerably over time.\nI do not have the time today to give this topic the justice it deserves. But I will touch on a\nfew historical highlights. During the early decades of the Federal Reserve System,\n“research” at the Fed was largely limited to the collection of statistics, only some of\nwhich were published by the Fed and other government agencies. At the Reserve Banks,\nthe focus was often on measuring and reporting on regional economies or sectors.2\nMonetary policy decisions were made using policy frameworks that were often not tested\nin the rigorous and scientific ways associated with economic research today. For\nexample, in the 1920s, the Federal Reserve adhered to the “real bills” doctrine that called\nfor providing liquidity to businesses when it was demanded during expansions and\ncontracting credit when demand for it fell during times of slowing growth.3 This, of\ncourse, is often exactly the opposite of what monetary policy should do to either control\ninflation in an overheating economy or support economic activity in a slowdown.\nUp until the 1950s, journal-oriented economic research in the Federal Reserve\nSystem was quite limited. But a big increase took place in the 1950s, when the Reserve\nBank presidents became much more involved in monetary policy decisions.4 Before that,\n2 The Federal Reserve Board and the Reserve Banks did have several Ph.D. economists on staff who\nengaged in pathbreaking research. For example, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s John H.\nWilliams and Randolph Burgess and the Board’s E.A. Goldenweiser and Winfield Riefler produced\nnumerous articles and treatises on financial markets, international monetary arrangements, and Federal\nReserve policy.\n3 See Ben S. Bernanke (2013), “A Century of U.S. Central Banking: Goals, Frameworks and\nAccountability,” Journal of Economic Perspectives, vol. 27 (Fall), pp. 3–16.\n4 Much of the following material draws from Michael D. Bordo and Edward S. Prescott (2023), “Federal\nReserve Structure and the Production of Monetary Policy Ideas,” Working Paper Series 23-29 (Cleveland:\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, November), https://doi.org/10.26509/frbc-wp-202329.\n\n- 7 -\nBank presidents focused mainly on local operations and discount window policy. But\nonce they became more involved in national-level policymaking decisions, their new\nresponsibilities required them to have more specialized research staff who were trained in\nmodern economic theory and data methods. The creation and development of\nprofessional research departments led to a greater debate within the Federal Reserve and\namong outside academics as to how monetary policy should be conducted.\nIn the 1960s, Keynesian macroeconomic theory was the dominant paradigm in\npolicymaking, and large-scale econometric models were being developed to provide\nquantitative analysis of monetary policy. The Board of Governors led the way by hiring\nPh.D. economists from academia to develop and use these Keynesian models and\neconometric techniques to aid policymakers. This was an important first step in raising\nthe skill level of research staff to match that of top academics.\nBut the beauty of the Federal Reserve’s structure is that alternative\nmacroeconomic frameworks and theories could be developed in the rest of the System.\nAnd the first example of an alternative view of monetary policy was developed by\nresearch economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and became a force to be\nreckoned with.\nIn the early 1970s, after inflation failed to fall as much as expected in a slow\neconomy, Fed Chairman Arthur Burns came to believe that inflation was very little\naffected by economic slack and was instead a structural problem that could only be dealt\nwith through wage and price controls.5 Board models typically viewed the 1970s\n5 See Edward Nelson (2005), “The Great Inflation of the Seventies: What Really Happened?” Advances in\nMacroeconomics, vol. 5 (1); and Christina D. Romer and David H. Romer (2013), “The Most Dangerous\nIdea in Federal Reserve History: Monetary Policy Doesn’t Matter,” American Economic Review: Papers\n& Proceedings, vol. 103 (May), pp. 55–60.\n\n- 8 -\ninflation as being driven by special factors that were outside the influence of monetary\npolicy. In contrast, at the St. Louis Fed, monetarism was the dominant paradigm in\nthinking about monetary policy. The Bank’s researchers believed the 1970s inflation was\ndriven by excessive monetary growth.6 This led to a vigorous debate throughout the\n1970s between Board staff and St. Louis Fed economists over the sources of inflation and\nhow to bring it back down. At the end of the 1970s, Paul Volcker became Chair of the\nFederal Reserve and essentially adopted the St. Louis monetarist position of halting\nmonetary growth to bring inflation under control. He announced a fundamental change\nin the Fed’s policy approach, vowing to bring inflation down by adopting strict monetary\ngrowth targeting. Volcker succeeded, but at the cost of causing a severe recession.\nIn the 1980s, the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis became a dominant force\nin monetary policy research by proposing new economic theories and policy frameworks.\nIn association with economists at the University of Minnesota and the University of\nChicago, researchers at the Minneapolis Fed explored how rational expectations would\naffect the transmission channel of monetary policy. Up until then, Fed forecasting\nmodels assumed that individuals had adaptive expectations, meaning they were purely\nbackward looking. This meant that the Board’s econometric models didn’t account for\npolicy actions that were announced in advance but hadn’t taken effect yet. If households\nand firms did understand how current policy actions and announcements would affect\nfuture outcomes, they would react in ways that didn’t match the predictions of the\n6 For a discussion of the part played by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis in the development of\nmonetarism, see chapter 13 in Edward Nelson (2020), Milton Friedman and Economic Debate in the\nUnited States, 1932−1972, Volume 2 (Chicago: University of Chicago Press).\n\n- 9 -\nBoard’s forecasting models. This would lead to significant errors in the guidance that the\nstaff provided to policymakers.\nA critical finding of all this research was that private agents’ inflation\nexpectations were forward looking—they would adjust to promises, and failures, of\ncentral bankers to keep inflation low and stable. If people didn’t believe a central bank’s\npromise to keep inflation low, then the central bank lacked credibility. This would cause\ninflation expectations to increase, which would lead to demands for higher nominal\nwages, thereby feeding future inflation. It is now widely believed that this was a key\nproblem that Volcker faced: His promises to bring inflation down were not fully\ncredible, as they came after the Fed’s uneven efforts at fighting inflation over the\nprevious decade. Research on monetary policy, along with the experience of the Volcker\nyears, led to the concepts of “credibility” and “stable inflation expectations” becoming\ncentral parts of how every central bank enacts policy.\nA key innovation at the Minneapolis Fed that led to this explosion of fundamental\nmacroeconomic research was creating strong research links between Fed researchers and\nacademics at the University of Minnesota. Instead of being on opposite sides of the\nfence, the idea was to have Fed researchers and academics work together side by side.\nThis frequent interaction led to the type of rigorous debate between academics and Fed\nresearchers that I discussed earlier. As a result, more rigorous and sound monetary policy\nframeworks were developed over the next several decades. The success of this close\ninteraction between academics and Fed researchers led most Federal Reserve Banks and\nthe Board of Governors to adopt similar relationships that continue to this day.\n\n- 10 -\nAnother example of the value of economic research came with the onset of the\nGlobal Financial Crisis in 2008, the worst since the Great Depression. As it happened,\nthe Fed Chair at the time was one of the world’s leading experts on that period, Ben\nBernanke. He drew heavily on his and others’ research on the 1930s, and related work on\nJapan’s crisis and slow growth in the 1990s and 2000s, to help fashion new monetary\npolicy tools to combat the downturn, including quantitative easing and extended forward\nguidance.7\nDoes this suggest that central bank policymakers should all be Ph.D. economists\nand have a record of journal publications? Of course not—there are other skills and work\nexperiences needed in the policy sphere, and the Fed has economists and non-economists\namong its policymakers. Before the 1990s, very few policymakers were Ph.D.\neconomists, and those who were usually did not have academic records in research;\ninstead, policymakers typically had backgrounds in financial markets or the law.8 In\ncontrast, since the 1990s, key policymaking roles in central banks around the world have\nbeen filled by Ph.D. economists with an academic research background. Today, 10 of the\n19 FOMC policymakers are Ph.D. economists. The experience of these economists\nfurther embeds economic research into monetary policymaking and strengthens the\ndecisions that are made.\n7 See Bernanke’s discussion of the comparison between the Great Depression of the 1930s and the Great\nRecession of 2007–09 in Ben S. Bernanke (2023), “Nobel Lecture: Banking, Credit, and Economic\nFluctuations,” American Economic Review, vol. 113 (May), pp. 1143–69.\n8 For example, Alan Greenspan, a successful Wall Street economist and chairman of President Ford’s\nCouncil of Economic Advisers, had not published much in journals when he earned his Ph.D. in economics\nin 1977, at age 51, 10 years before he became Fed Chair.\n\n- 11 -\nIn conclusion, I expect research to remain an important part of policymaking at\nthe Fed and other central banks. I believe that the insights provided by this research can\nfurther our understanding of the economy and improve monetary policymaking.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n1:15 p.m. EST\nFebruary 15, 2024\nThe Dollar’s International Role\nRemarks by\nChristopher J. Waller\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Climate, Currency, and Central Banking,” a conference sponsored by\nthe Global Interdependence Center and the University of the Bahamas\nNassau, Bahamas\nFebruary 15, 2024\n\nThank you to the Global Interdependence Center for the invitation to speak to you\ntoday.1 My subject is the U.S. dollar’s primacy in global finance and the global\neconomy, which some feel is under threat as never before. One headline asserts: “Why\nthe Dollar’s Reign Is Near an End.” Actually, it turns out this threat isn’t so new. That\nheadline was from 2011.2 It is tempting to write off concerns about the dollar’s status\nthat never seem to come to pass, but I don’t dismiss them. The role of the United States\nin the world economy is changing, finance is always changing, and I think it is important\nfor policymakers to regularly consider if and why the dollar’s role might change as well.\nThat’s what I aim to do in these remarks.\nWhen people refer to the dollar and its reserve currency status, they typically mix\ntogether a variety of roles that it plays on the world stage. So I would like to start by\nclarifying these many roles. First, the term “dollar” often refers to physical U.S. currency\nand its use around the world. However, in certain contexts, it is used to describe financial\nassets, such as U.S. Treasury securities, that are denominated in and promise redemption\nin U.S. dollars. Finally, the word “dollar” is used to describe its use as the settlement unit\nof account in international transactions. I will use the word “dollar” throughout this\nspeech to refer to these various concepts, and I hope it will be clear which one I am\nreferring to as I speak.\nFor many decades, the U.S. dollar has had an outsized role in the global economy,\nsupported by the size and strength of the U.S. economy, its stability and openness to trade\nand capital flows, and strong property rights and rule of law. The dollar’s international\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee. I would like to thank Carol Bertaut, Stephanie Curcuru, and Justin Pierce for their\nsupport in preparing this text.\n2 See Eichengreen (2011).\n\n- 2 -\nrole has clear benefits for the United States, lowering transaction and borrowing costs for\nU.S. households, businesses, and government and widening the pool of creditors and\ninvestors. The widespread use of the dollar can help insulate the U.S. economy from\nshocks from abroad.\nThe rest of the world also benefits from the dollar’s international role. The dollar\nserves as a safe, stable, and dependable form of money around the world. It serves as a\nreliable common denominator for global trade and a dependable settlement instrument for\ncross-border payments. In doing so, it reduces costs of engaging in international\ntransactions for households and businesses including those outside of the United States.\nRecent commentary warning of a possible decline in the status of the U.S. dollar\nraises concerns about the effects of sanctions against Russia, U.S. political dysfunction,\nthe rise of digital assets, and China’s efforts to bolster usage of the renminbi. Other\ncommentary has warned of “geoeconomic fragmentation” and whether trade and\nfinancial flows could realign in ways that adversely affect the dollar’s outsized role.\nAgainst this backdrop, it’s useful to review whether there has been any change in how the\ndollar stacks up against the standard measures by which we assess a currency’s\nacceptance as an international currency.\nAcceptance as an “international currency” is typically assessed along three\ndimensions: its use as a store of value, as a medium of exchange, and as a unit of\naccount. Alarmist headlines notwithstanding, the dollar continues to dominate in all three\nof these measures, and generally by a large margin compared with any other currency.3\n3 See Maggiori, Neiman, and Schreger (2019).\n\n- 3 -\nThe “store of value” dimension relates to the ability to save in a given currency\nand retrieve those savings in the future without a significant expected loss of purchasing\npower. A key measure of the confidence in a currency as a store of value is its use in\nofficial foreign exchange reserves. At almost 60 percent of global reserves in 2022, the\nU.S. dollar is by far the dominant reserve currency.4 The next leading competitor to the\ndollar is the euro, with a share of roughly 20 percent. Although some have pointed to a\ndecreasing share of reserves held in dollars, the dollar share—though down somewhat\nfrom the mid-2000s—is actually little changed from the mid-1990s. And while there has\nbeen an increase in the share held in renminbi, that share is trivial at about 2 percent. To\nthe extent that there has been gradual diversification in reserves since the mid-2000s, it\nhas been into a wide range of other currencies, such as Canadian and Australian dollars.\nThe majority of global dollar reserves are held in U.S. Treasury securities, with\nthe depth and liquidity of the U.S. Treasury market reinforcing the desirability of the\ndollar as a store of value. Currently, foreign investors hold about one-third of Treasury\nsecurities outstanding. There has been a steady decline in this share: Foreign investors\nheld roughly half of Treasury securities outstanding 10 years ago. A major reason for the\ndecline, however, is that over the past decade, the stock of global foreign exchange\nreserves has grown much more slowly than the stock of Treasury securities outstanding,\nso foreign official investors are accounting for a declining share. Foreign private investor\ndemand for U.S. Treasury securities, by contrast, has been sustained and has kept pace\nwith the increased issuance in recent years. The roughly one-third of Treasury securities\ncurrently held by all foreign investors is now broadly comparable with shares of\n4 See Bertaut, von Beschwitz, and Curcuru (2023).\n\n- 4 -\nsovereign debt held by foreign investors in the euro area, the U.K., and Japan.5 The U.S.\nbenefits from foreign demand for U.S. Treasury securities since it bids up the price of\nsuch securities, thereby lowering the interest expense paid on Treasury debt.\nAnother way to look at the dollar as a store of value for the global financial\nsystem is the demand for U.S. dollar banknotes abroad. Determining exactly how much\ncurrency is held abroad is challenging, but research suggests that foreign investors hold\nroughly half of the dollar value of U.S. banknotes outstanding.6 This share is similar to\nor a bit higher than for euro banknotes, where recent research estimates suggest that\nbetween 30 and 50 percent of euro banknotes are held abroad, primarily in countries that\nare geographically close to the euro area.7 “Dollarization” or “partial dollarization” is a\nglobal phenomenon that refers to the use of dollars in foreign countries as a substitute for\nthe domestic currency.\nTypically, this practice occurs because of persistently high domestic inflation.\nWhile foreign citizens are free to use any other currency issued around the world, the\ndollar is the overwhelming choice for citizens in these countries. Fulfilling foreign\ndemand for U.S. currency allows us to earn seigniorage on banknotes held abroad.\nSo, by store-of-value measures, the dollar remains the most widely used currency,\nthough its dominance may have edged down slightly over the past couple decades.\nThe dollar’s attractiveness to private investors and businesses is especially\napparent in its role as a medium of exchange—that is, in its use in trade invoicing, global\nbanking, international debt issuance, and foreign exchange transactions.\n5 See Bertaut, von Beschwitz, and Curcuru (2023).\n6 See Bertaut, von Beschwitz, and Curcuru (2023).\n7 See Lalouette and others (2021).\n\n- 5 -\nTo start with trade invoicing, the dollar is by far the dominant currency. Trade\ninvoicing in dollars means that the terms of the contract are specified in units of the dollar\nand the dollar is the settlement object for the trade. Dollar invoicing accounts for at least\nthree-fourths of export invoicing in all regions, except in Europe, and over 96 percent in\nthe Americas. Not surprisingly, the euro is the dominant invoicing currency in Europe,\nbut even there, the euro share is only about 50 percent once intra-euro-area trade is\nexcluded.8 Dollar dominance on this dimension has major benefits for U.S. firms, as it\nremoves exchange rate risk and eliminates the need for complicated and costly hedging\nstrategies when they engage in international trade.\nInvoicing dominance is linked to a similarly dominant role in international\nbanking and debt issuance. About 60 percent of international banking loans and deposits\nare denominated in U.S. dollars. For international debt securities, about 70 percent of\nbonds issued in a currency other than the issuer’s home country currency are\ndenominated in U.S. dollars.9 These shares have been quite stable over the past 10 to 15\nyears. Dollar dominance in international banking has benefits for U.S. households and\nbusinesses, since it means that foreign banks have strong connections to the U.S.\nfinancial system, increasing the amount of credit available in the U.S. and lowering the\ncost of borrowing. For debt securities, dollar dominance means that when U.S. firms\nissue debt in markets outside the United States, they can issue in dollars and don’t have to\nbear exchange rate risk. And U.S. investors can get exposure to foreign firms without\nincurring exchange rate risk.\n8 See Bertaut, von Beschwitz, and Curcuru (2023).\n9 See Bertaut, von Beschwitz, and Curcuru (2023).\n\n- 6 -\nThe many sources of demand for U.S. dollars show through to its very high share\nof foreign exchange transactions, where, according to the latest statistics from the Bank\nfor International Settlements, the dollar remains by far the most commonly traded\ncurrency.10 The size and depth of dollar foreign exchange markets mean the dollar is\nfrequently used as a “vehicle” currency: Even when firms and investors around the globe\nwant to transact in two currencies that don’t include the dollar, they typically find that it\nis easier and less expensive to first conduct a trade between the initial currency and the\ndollar and then conduct a second trade to exchange the dollars for the second currency.11\nThe final role for an international currency is as a unit of account, and an\nimportant measure on this dimension is its use as an “anchor currency” against which\nother countries may attempt to limit their exchange rate movements. Here, the research\nfinds that the dollar’s usage as an anchor currency has increased somewhat over the past\ntwo decades. Not including the U.S., economies anchored to the dollar accounted for\nroughly 50 percent of world gross domestic product (GDP) by 2015. By contrast, the\nshare of world GDP anchored to the euro was only 5 percent (not counting the euro area\nitself).12\nTo recap, by standard measures of an international currency’s use, there has not\nbeen any notable erosion in the dollar’s dominance over the past couple of decades.\nGoing forward, however, there are potential challenges to the dollar’s international status,\nand some recent developments have the potential to boost the international use of other\ncurrencies.\n10 See Bank for International Settlements (2022).\n11 See Devereux and Shi (2013).\n12 See Ilzetzki et al. (2019).\n\n- 7 -\nA shifting payments landscape—for example, the rapid growth of digital\ncurrencies—could reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar. People often conjecture that\ncryptocurrencies like Bitcoin may replace the U.S. dollar as the world’s reserve currency.\nBut most trading in decentralized finance (DeFi) involve trades using stablecoins, which\nlink their value one-for-one to the U.S. dollar. About 99 percent of stablecoin market\ncapitalization is linked to the U.S. dollar, meaning that crypto-assets are de facto traded\nin U.S. dollars. So it is likely that any expansion of trading in the DeFi world will simply\nstrengthen the dominant role of the dollar.\nA second potential challenge to the dollar could be increased prominence of the\neuro, the second most widely used international currency. Like the U.S., the European\nUnion (EU) is a large economy with fairly deep financial markets, generally free trade,\nand robust and stable institutions. Wider use of the euro as a reserve currency may have\nbeen held back by the lack of a deep and liquid market for EU debt, though there have\nbeen some notable recent developments. During the COVID-19 crisis, the EU issued an\nunprecedented amount of jointly backed debt, reaching about EUR 400 billion by May\n2023. While this is a noteworthy development for the EU, this amount is tiny compared\nwith the $24 trillion outstanding in U.S. Treasury securities.13\nThe continued rapid growth of China and Chinese efforts to boost the use of their\ncurrency could make the Chinese renminbi a more attractive competitor to the dollar and\nincrease its international use. Several factors currently weigh against the renminbi as an\nattractive asset for international investors: It is not freely exchangeable, the Chinese\ncapital account is not open, and investor confidence in Chinese institutions is relatively\n13 See Bertaut, von Beschwitz, and Curcuru (2023).\n\n- 8 -\nlow. Recent endeavors by China to overcome these shortcomings include increased\nefforts to promote renminbi invoicing. For example, it reached an agreement with Brazil\nto allow Chinese and Brazilian companies to settle trade in their domestic currencies and\nhas been in discussion with Saudi Arabia to potentially price oil trade in renminbi.\nHowever, outside analysts generally view these agreements as symbolic and at most\nlaying the groundwork for potential future use of the Chinese renminbi in very isolated\ninstances.\nSome commentators have also argued that sanctions imposed by the United States\nand its allies on Russia following the invasion of Ukraine could make the dollar less\nattractive as a reserve currency for the United States’s geopolitical adversaries. In\npractice, however, U.S. adversaries have few practical alternatives to the dollar, as other\nprominent reserve currencies—such as the euro, Japanese yen, and British pound—are all\nissued by close U.S. allies, who also participated in sanctions on Russia.\nMore generally, some worry that the dollar’s role could be threatened by a move\ntoward so-called geoeconomic fragmentation, in which trade and financial flows realign\nand become restricted within blocs of allied countries. The formation of a bloc that\nexcludes the U.S.—or even explicitly seeks to counter the United States’ role in the\nglobal economy—could make some countries less likely to denominate international\ntransactions in dollars.\nThis scenario sounds alarming, but thus far, trends that appear consistent with\nfragmentation largely can be explained by specific policy actions. One example is the\ndramatic reallocation of U.S.–China trade in recent years, as firms in each country\ndecrease reliance on imports sourced from the other. While this shift has coincided with\n\n- 9 -\na period of heightened geopolitical tensions, the evidence suggests a simpler explanation:\nfirms responding to changes in relative prices, in this case caused by the imposition of\nreciprocal tariffs by the two countries since 2018. For example, while U.S. imports of\ntariff-affected goods from China have plunged, imports of goods not subject to tariffs\nhave continued to rise.14 Despite the reallocation of trade flows across countries, at the\nend of the day, those trade flows continue to be invoiced mainly in dollars.\nA final consideration regarding the international use of the dollar relates to\nfinancial stability concerns. In times of global financial stress, investors and\ngovernments seek a safe haven to protect the value of their assets and stabilize their own\nfinancial markets. When this happens, there is almost always a “flight to the dollar” and\nheightened demand for U.S. dollar assets. We saw this in 2008 and again in 2020. This\nis the ultimate vindication that the U.S. dollar is the world’s reserve currency and is likely\nto remain so—in times of global stress, the world runs to the dollar, not away from it.\nTo conclude, for the reasons I have laid out here, I do not expect to see the U.S.\ndollar lose its status as the world’s reserve currency anytime soon, nor even see a\nsignificant decline in its primacy in trade and finance. Recent developments that some\nhave warned could threaten that status have, if anything, strengthened it, at least so far.\n14 See Bown (2022).\n\n- 10 -\nReferences\nAlfaro, Laura, and Davin Chor (2023). “Global Supply Chains: The Looming ‘Great\nReallocation,’ ” NBER Working Paper Series 31661.

Waller\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nMid-Size Bank Coalition of America\nLos Angeles, California\n(via webcast)\nMarch 2, 2023\n\nThank you, Raj, and thank you to the coalition for the invitation to be with you—\nvirtually, at least. I don’t want to take up too much of the time for our discussion but let\nme frame a few of the issues around inflation and the economic outlook.1\nLast month we received a barrage of data that has challenged my view in January\nthat the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) was making significant progress in\nmoderating economic activity and reducing inflation. I’m not the only one whose\noutlook has shifted. Since the end of January, financial market participants have revised\ntheir outlooks in a way that has led them to mark up their expectations for the federal\nfunds rate at the end of 2023 by about a half percentage point.\nThe shift in the data started with a bang on February 1, with a big increase in the\nnumber of job openings in December that reversed the gradual easing over several\nmonths in what is a key indicator of tightness in the labor market. Part of the FOMC’s\nplan to lower inflation is reducing this excess tightness, which has been driving elevated\nwage growth and contributing to high inflation. The Job Openings and Labor Turnover\nSurvey data can be noisy so, at times, there is a tendency to downplay large moves. But\nthen on February 3, the job report for January showed a stunning 517,000 increase in\nemployment and the unemployment rate moved down to a level not seen in over 50\nyears.2 These data indicated that, instead of loosening, the labor market was tightening.3\nA little over a week later, on Valentine’s Day, instead of a box of chocolates, we got the\n1 These remarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 Some have argued that the large change in payroll employment should be discounted because of\nunusually warm weather; however, estimates of weather-adjusted employment are also quite large. See\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (2023), “Weather-Adjusted Employment Change,” webpage,\nhttps://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/indicators-data/weather-adjusted-employment-change.\n3 Of course, more people finding jobs is good. But in the context of ongoing labor market tightness, this\nabove trend number can complicate efforts to move the economy toward price stability, on which my\nremarks go into more detail.\n\n- 2 -\nconsumer price index (CPI) inflation report for January and revisions to 2022. By this\nmeasure, not only had inflation stopped declining in January, it also slowed a lot less in\nthe second half of last year than previously reported.4 Later that week, data on producer\nprices and last week’s report on personal consumption expenditures (PCE) prices\nreinforced these two points. Retail sales for January also came in much stronger than\nexpected, suggesting the economy was slowing less than it had appeared just a month\nearlier, a picture that was confirmed by data on personal spending, which represents\nalmost 70 percent of gross domestic product. Continuing progress on inflation depends\non lowering demand and moderating economic activity, and the retail sales and spending\ndata suggest that progress on reducing aggregate demand may have stalled.\nWhether or not subsequent data confirm the setback in progress last month, the\nFOMC will do what is needed to reduce inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent objective\nover time. It is possible there may be some bumps on that path, but I assure you, the\nFOMC’s dual mandate objectives will be achieved. Inflation has been elevated for nearly\ntwo years due to an excess of aggregate demand relative to supply. Even though the\nfiscal stimulus and goods supply constraints that contributed to that imbalance have\nmostly unwound and the FOMC has rapidly raised the target range for the federal funds\nrate, the labor market remains very tight and aggregate demand has proved resilient to\nconsiderable increases in interest rates. One implication of the strong labor market is that\nthe FOMC’s maximum employment goal has been achieved and monetary policy can be\nutterly focused on fighting inflation. Any fear that we might face two-sided risk in\nachieving our dual mandate was blown away by the January employment numbers. But\n4 Each year, with the release of the January CPI, the Bureau of Labor Statistics recalculates seasonal\nadjustment factors. This adjustment resulted in noticeable revisions to 2022 seasonally adjusted CPI prices.\n\n- 3 -\nan excessively tight labor market complicates the path toward achieving price stability,\nbecause wages are growing faster than they have in decades, at a pace that may contribute\nto keeping inflation elevated. We see this excess pressure in the fast growth of services\nprices, where labor costs are a higher share of overall input costs and shortages of\nworkers are reportedly most acute.\nAlthough inflation has been coming down since the middle of last year, the recent\ndata indicate that we haven’t made as much progress as we thought. That assessment\ngoes for both overall inflation, and “core” inflation, which strips out volatile energy and\nfood prices and is a good guide to future price increases. And this holds for both CPI and\nPCE measures of inflation. Core CPI inflation over the last three months of 2022 was\nrevised up from 3.1 percent (at an annual rate) to now be 4.3 percent. Similarly, the 2022\nfourth quarter PCE inflation data was revised from 2.9 percent to 3.6 percent. And the\nthree-month rates increased in January; even measures that trim out the largest and\nsmallest price changes saw increases. These data underscore the view, as laid out in the\nFOMC’s December Summary of Economic Projections, that the fight to bring inflation\ndown to our 2 percent target will be slower and longer than many had expected just a\nmonth or two ago.\nI don’t want to brush aside the fact that we have made progress in reducing\ninflation, and there are indications that further improvement is coming. The three-month\ninflation rate is running below the 12-month rate, which highlights the progress. And\nthere are reasons to be optimistic about continued improvement, including a sharp\ndeceleration in rent increases since the middle of last year, which will start to get\ncaptured in inflation statistics only in the coming months.\n\n- 4 -\nBut recent data suggest that consumer spending isn’t slowing that much, that the\nlabor market continues to run unsustainably hot, and that inflation is not coming down as\nfast as I had thought. It could be that progress has stalled, or it is possible that the\nnumbers released last month were a blip, perhaps associated with unusually favorable\nweather, and that forthcoming data will show that economic activity and inflation\nresumed their decline.\nFortunately, we will get the next employment report and CPI release ahead of the\nMarch 21–22 FOMC meeting, information that will affect my assessment of the\nappropriate next step for monetary policy. If job creation drops back down to a level\nconsistent with the downward trajectory seen late last year and CPI inflation pulls back\nsignificantly from the January numbers and resumes its downward path, then I would\nendorse raising the target range for the federal funds rate a couple more times, to a\nprojected terminal rate between 5.1 and 5.4 percent.5 On the other hand, if those data\nreports continue to come in too hot, the policy target range will have to be raised this year\neven more to ensure that we do not lose the momentum that was in place before the data\nfor January were released.\nI would be very pleased if the data we receive on inflation and the labor market\nthis month show signs of moderation, which would suggest that the February data\nreleases were just a bump in the road and that progress is continuing. But wishful\nthinking is not a substitute for hard evidence, in the form of economic data. After seeing\npromising signs of progress, we cannot risk a revival of inflation. Policymakers must\nremain data dependent, so my view will depend on what the data say.\n5 This estimate of the terminal rate would align with the central tendency of FOMC participants’\nprojections of the federal funds rate at the end of 2023.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n12:30 p.m. EST (9:30 a.m. PST)\nFebruary 10, 2023\nThoughts on the Crypto Ecosystem\nRemarks by\nChristopher J. Waller\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nDigital Money, Decentralized Finance, and the Puzzle of Crypto\nThe Global Interdependence Center\nLa Jolla, California\nFebruary 10, 2023\n\nThanks to the conference organizers for inviting me to participate today. It is great to be\nback at a Global Interdependence Center conference. Given recent events in crypto, it is\ncertainly timely to have a day of discussions related to digital assets.1\nBefore diving into today’s talks, which will touch on various parts of the crypto\necosystem, I’d like to clearly define some concepts to ensure we’re all talking about the same\nthings. I think of the crypto ecosystem as consisting of three parts:\na crypto-asset, which generally refers to any digital asset implemented using\no\ncryptographic techniques that is being traded;\na database management protocol used to record trades, commonly referred to as\no\nthe blockchain, which includes both permissioned and permissionless distributed\nledger technologies; and\ntechnology that directly facilitates trading crypto-assets; this includes smart\no\ncontracts and tokenization as a form of data privacy.\nThe latter two parts may facilitate the trading of crypto-assets, but also have much\nbroader applications.\nFirst, let’s consider distributed ledger technology. The technology is simply a database\nmanagement protocol that has various permissions regarding who can write to the database and\nwho can read the database. Although this technology is fundamental for the creation of crypto-\nassets, there is nothing in this technology that restricts it to being used solely in the crypto\necosystem. In fact, distributed ledger technology is being explored to potentially address a wide\nrange of data management problems.\n1 The views expressed here are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of my colleagues on the Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n- 2 -\nNext, there are various technologies related to crypto-assets. One is the use of smart\ncontracts in peer-to-peer trading. Smart contracts also can be used in conjunction with a\ncentralized data management protocol to automate the execution of certain transactions in non-\ncrypto-assets. For example, over time, they could be used to speed up the clearance and\nsettlement of securities transactions. Another emerging technology is tokenization. In any trade\nof assets, there are issues regarding how much personal information you need to provide to\nconduct the trade. For example, some personal information is needed to protect against the\npossibility of anonymous trading, which can promote money laundering. Tokenization, when\ncombined with data vaults to securely store personal information, can be used to trade objects in\na way that protects one’s identity from being exploited for profit. While these technological\ndevelopments are still in their infancy, they have potential applications beyond the crypto\necosystem that could lead to substantial productivity enhancements in other industries.\nThis leaves us with the crypto-assets themselves. The question is, why would someone\nhold such an asset? What is the value proposition of such an asset? The answer isn’t new or\nunique, but rather is based on economic relationships that result in objects having value. One\nreason objects have value is because of their intrinsic properties. For example, the value of corn\nderives in part from the fact that it can be used for food or fuel, or in some cases for\nThanksgiving centerpieces. Intuition suggests that if an object has no intrinsic value, then the\nprice of that object should be zero—why pay for something that has no fundamental value?\nShockingly, it turns out that objects may be valued well above what their intrinsic properties\nwould suggest. Since Paul Samuelson’s seminal work in 1958 on intertemporal consumption\nsmoothing, economists have known that an intrinsically useless object can trade at a positive\n\n- 3 -\nprice.2 Such an object’s value is driven purely by belief. If I believe someone will pay a\npositive price for this object in the future, then I may be willing to pay a positive price now,\ncarry it across time, and sell it when I need to consume other goods and services. Samuelson\nreferred to this concept as “the social contrivance of money.”\nWhile an intrinsically useless object can trade at a positive price, we also know that there\nis always a second equilibrium price for this object, which is zero. What if one day, beliefs\nchange and I no longer believe that someone will pay me for this object in the future? Then I\nclearly shouldn’t pay anything for it today, so its price goes to zero.\nThere are many intrinsically useless objects that still have value. Consider things like\nbaseball cards and celebrity autographs, which are pieces of cardboard and paper with pictures or\nscribbles on them. Based on their fundamental properties, these things have little to no intrinsic\nvalue, yet can be in high demand and command staggering prices. What happens if one day, no\none wants to collect baseball cards? As valuable as they are today, they wouldn’t be worth\nmuch, if anything.\nThis brings us to crypto-assets. To me, a crypto-asset is nothing more than a speculative\nasset, like a baseball card. If people believe others will buy it from them in the future at a\npositive price, then it will trade at a positive price today. If not, its price will go to zero. If\npeople want to hold such an asset, then go for it. I wouldn’t do it, but I don’t collect baseball\ncards, either. However, if you buy crypto-assets and the price goes to zero at some point, please\ndon’t be surprised and don’t expect taxpayers to socialize your losses.\nThe upshot of this is that crypto-assets are risky and many of the firms dealing in them\nare in their infancy. That has come to bear in the past year as several prominent crypto-related\n2 Paul Samuelson, “An Exact Consumption-Loan Model of Interest with or without the Social Contrivance of\nMoney,” Journal of Political Economy, vol. LXVI (December 1958): 467–482.\n\n- 4 -\nfirms have filed for bankruptcy, including payment platforms, exchanges, crypto lenders, and\nhedge funds. The declines in crypto-asset values and associated business failures have led to\nmany investors in the crypto industry getting hurt. As I mentioned in a speech last summer,\nsurveys conducted indicated that somewhere between 12 and 20 percent of U.S. adults have\nowned, traded, or used crypto-assets.3 As losses mount, the debate is turning to whether there\nshould be better investor protections in place. But even institutional investors, with significant\nresources to conduct due diligence of investments, have felt the pain of the so-called crypto\nwinter. For example, it has been reported that at least 15 public pension funds, which manage\npublic employee retirement funds, had investments in the now-bankrupt crypto-asset exchange,\nFTX.4\nWhile I don’t care if people take on risky investments or engage in risky business\nventures, banks and other financial intermediaries must engage in any activity they do in a safe\nand sound manner. I’m supportive of prudent innovation in the financial system, while at the\nsame time concerned about banks engaging in activities that present a heightened risk of fraud\nand scams, legal uncertainties, and the prevalence of inaccurate and misleading financial\ndisclosures. As with any customer in any industry, a bank engaging with crypto customers\nwould have to be very clear about the customers’ business models, risk-management systems,\nand corporate governance structures to ensure that the bank is not left holding the bag if there is a\ncrypto meltdown. And banks considering engaging in crypto-asset-related activities face a\n3 Christopher J. Waller, “Risk in the Crypto Markets” (remarks at the SNB-CIF Conference on Cryptoassets and\nFinancial Innovation, Zurich, Switzerland, June 3, 2022),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20220603a.htm.\n4 “Have Pensions Lost Money on FTX?,” Equable.org, December 1, 2022, https://equable.org/have-pensions-lost-\nmoney-on-ftx/.\n\n- 5 -\ncritical task to meet the “know your customer” and “anti-money laundering” requirements,\nwhich they in no way are allowed to ignore.\nSo far, spillovers to other parts of the financial system from the stress in the crypto\nindustry have been minimal. The lack of spillovers to date may be attributable in part to the\nrelatively limited number of interconnections between the crypto ecosystem and the banking\nsystem. While it is critical that we ensure that the financial stability risks associated with crypto-\nassets are mitigated, it is important that we keep the various parts of the crypto ecosystem\ndistinct in our minds as the debate about if and how to regulate crypto rolls on. Doing so will\nensure we do not unduly limit the development and potential future uses of the positive features\nof the crypto ecosystem.\nWith that, I’d be happy to answer some questions.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n1:00 p.m. EST\nJanuary 20, 2023\nA Case for Cautious Optimism\nRemarks by\nChristopher J. Waller\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nC. Peter McColough Series on International Economics\nCouncil on Foreign Relations\nNew York, New York\nJanuary 20, 2023\n\nThank you, Ben, and thank you to the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) for\ninviting me to be part of this discussion. It has been close to a year since the Federal\nOpen Market Committee (FOMC) began tightening monetary policy. We began raising\ninterest rates in March 2022 and shrinking our securities holdings in June in order to\nbring inflation down to our 2 percent target.1 Today I thought I would spend a few\nminutes taking stock of the year behind us and talking about what’s next.\nA year ago, inflation was elevated and rapidly accelerating, and the Fed moved to\nquickly and dramatically tighten monetary policy. At the end of December, the federal\nfunds rate target was set in a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, the highest in 15 years.\nEconomic activity, meanwhile, has been holding up well. After shrinking slightly in the\nfirst half of 2022, real gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 3.2 percent in the\nthird quarter, and monthly data suggest it grew around 2 percent in the fourth quarter. I\nexpect such slowing to continue in this quarter, which is both expected and desirable in\nour ongoing fight to lower inflation.\nThe FOMC’s goal in raising interest rates is to dampen demand and economic\nactivity to support further reductions in inflation. And there is ample evidence that this is\nexactly what is going on in the business sector. On the manufacturing side, industrial\nproduction declined for the second month in December. And the Institute for Supply\nManagement’s (ISM) forward-looking indicators of orders and customers’ inventory\nsuggested that further weakening is in train. Meanwhile, the ISM survey for\nnonmanufacturing businesses, which had reported expansion since April of last year,\n1 The FOMC communicated its intentions for some time before March, and this guidance effectively began\nmonetary policy tightening before raising rates and beginning the tapering of asset purchases that month.\nThe views expressed here are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of my colleagues on the FOMC.\n\n-2 -\nindicated a slight contraction in December. This slowdown in services activity was\nwidespread, affecting 11 of 17 sectors in the survey, with significant slowdowns in\nconstruction and real estate, two industries heavily affected by higher interest rates. This\nslowing in business activity is consistent with the FOMC’s goal of damping demand and\nreducing production so that it is in better alignment with the productive capacity of the\neconomy. The goal is not, I would emphasize, to halt economic activity, and so we will\nbe watching these sectors closely to see how this moderation continues.\nGrowth in consumer spending has also begun to slow. While that growth was\nsurprisingly strong through most of the second half of 2022, nominal personal\nconsumption expenditures growth slowed to 0.1 percent in November, and retail sales fell\n1 percent. We don’t have spending data on goods and services for December, but retail\nsales fell another 1.1 percent. While the latest readings of consumer sentiment from the\nUniversity of Michigan moved up some from historic lows, I continue to expect that last\nyear’s decline in real incomes, along with higher borrowing costs, will moderate\nconsumer spending this year and help return inflation more promptly to the FOMC’s 2\npercent target. Job one is maintaining the progress we are making in lowering inflation,\nand moderation in consumer spending will support that progress.\nThe slowing in output growth has occurred alongside the continuing strength of\nthe labor market. Total nonfarm employment grew 223,000 in December, close to the\naverage of 237,000 a month for the fourth quarter. That is down quite a bit from the\nmonthly increase of 539,000 in the first quarter of 2022 but still a solid growth rate, far\nabove the number of new jobs needed to keep pace with population growth. Employment\n\n- 3 -\ngrew robustly in the leisure and health-care sectors, where labor shortages are reportedly\nsevere.\nWhile the labor market is strong, it is also tight. The unemployment rate was 3.5\npercent in December, matching the low reached before the pandemic, and the lowest in\n53 years. But there are signs that demand for labor is moderating. Job openings reported\nin the November Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey and job postings from\nDecember’s Indeed data are down from their recent peaks. Temporary-help employment,\nwhich has sometimes been a leading indicator for overall employment, has declined in\nrecent months, but that decrease may be due at least in part to employers opting to hire\nfull-time workers in place of temps to help keep jobs filled.\nA robust labor market, despite modest economic growth, is a plus for workers and\nallows the Fed to focus on lowering inflation. It shows that jobs and income can hold up\nto the effects of higher interest rates, helping the FOMC continue its efforts to lower\ninflation to our 2 percent goal by further tightening monetary policy.\nA potential downside of a tight labor market is if labor costs, which heavily\ninfluence inflation, grow so fast that they slow progress toward the FOMC’s 2 percent\nobjective. Wages and other measures of compensation accelerated as inflation surged in\nthe second half of 2021 and wage growth remained high in 2022. But as overall inflation\nhas begun to moderate in recent months, so have some measures of growth in wages and\nother compensation. For example, the 12-month increase in average hourly earnings hit a\nrecent peak of 5.6 percent in March (which is when the Fed began raising interest rates)\nand has been falling gradually and fairly steadily since then, reaching an annual rate of\n4.6 percent in December. The 3-month annualized change in average hourly earnings—\n\n- 4 -\n4.1 percent in December—is running below the 12-month rate and is thus a signal of\nongoing moderation. These are encouraging signs, but we need to see continued\nimprovement across various measures of labor costs, because additional moderation is\nneeded to bring inflation down to our 2 percent goal and because a significant escalation\nin wage growth could drive up longer-range inflation expectations. Those longer-range\nexpectations have been fairly stable through this period of very high inflation, and we\nwant it to stay that way because escalating expectations could drive inflation higher.\nLet me turn now to the outlook for inflation. Last week’s report on the Consumer\nPrice Index (CPI) showed that inflation continued to moderate in December, which was\nvery welcome news. First, I am going to spell out why this was such good news, and\nthen I am going to turn around and explain why I am still cautious about the inflation\noutlook and supportive of continued monetary policy tightening.\nOverall headline inflation fell a tenth of a percent month over month in\nDecember, the first monthly drop since May 2020. The 12-month change in inflation\npeaked at 9 percent in June, and has fallen every month since, to 6.5 percent in\nDecember.\nA big factor in the monthly decline in headline inflation in December was a\nsignificant drop in energy prices, which more than offset an increase in food prices. The\nFOMC targets headline inflation because food and energy are considerable expenses for\nmost people, but they are more volatile than other components of the index, and by\nfactoring them out, “core” inflation can provide a picture of where inflation is headed.\nHere also, we are seeing some progress. Yearly core inflation was down in December to\n5.7 percent, from 6 percent in November and a peak of 6.6 percent in September. Over\n\n- 5 -\nthe past three months, core CPI inflation has run at an annualized rate of 3.1 percent, a\nnoticeable drop from earlier in 2022.\nAnother encouraging sign is that higher inflation was less concentrated—the share\nof categories of different goods and services with inflation over 3 percent has declined in\nthe past several months, from almost three fourths in early 2022 to less than one half in\nDecember. That’s good news because it indicates that broader inflationary pressure\nacross the economy is easing.\nNow, here’s why I am cautious about these latest results and why I am not ready\nyet to substantially alter my outlook for inflation. Month-over-month core CPI inflation\nactually ticked up in December from November and is pretty much where it was in\nOctober and where it was in March when we began raising interest rates. Although\ninflation measured over 12 months has been falling, December’s reading is still close to\nwhere it was a year ago. Core inflation was 6 percent year over year (YOY) in January\n2022 and was 5.7 percent YOY last month. Thus, it basically moved sideways all year.\nSo, while it is possible to take a month or three months of data and paint a rosy picture, I\ncaution against doing so. The shorter the trend, the larger the grain of salt when\nswallowing a story about the future. Back in 2021, we saw three consecutive months of\nrelatively low readings of core inflation before it jumped back up. We do not want to be\nhead-faked. I will be looking for the recent improvement in headline and core inflation to\ncontinue.\nWages, as I indicated earlier, are another stream of data that I will be watching for\nevidence of continued progress to help ease overall inflation. Though recent hourly\nearnings data are a positive development, I need to see more evidence of wage\n\n- 6 -\nmoderation to sustainable levels. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s Wage Growth\nTracker has been running higher lately and has moderated less. The employment cost\nindex for December won’t be out until the end of this month. Over time, we need to see\nwages grow more in line with productivity growth plus 2 percentage points, consistent\nwith the FOMC’s inflation target.\nThose are reasons that I am cautious about the recent good news, but it is good\nnews. We have made progress. Six months ago, when inflation was escalating and\neconomic output had flattened, I argued that a soft landing was still possible—that it was\nquite plausible to make progress on inflation without seriously damaging the labor\nmarket. So far, we have managed to do so, and I remain optimistic that this progress can\ncontinue.\nI believe that monetary policy should continue to tighten, but using a comparison\nI employed in a speech a couple months ago, the view from the cockpit is very different\nat 30,000 feet than it is close to the ground. When the FOMC began raising the federal\nfunds rate last spring from near zero, it made sense to move quickly. But after front-\nloading monetary policy tightening, with many unprecedented 75 basis point hikes in the\nfederal funds rate target, by early December I believed the policy stance was slightly\nrestrictive, and I supported a decision by the Committee to hike by a still considerable 50\nbasis points.2 To return to the airplane image, after climbing steeply and using monetary\npolicy to significantly raise interest rates throughout the economy, it was apparent to me\nthat it was time to slow, but not halt, the rate of ascent.\n2 Each 75 basis point hike was the largest rate single increase since the FOMC began announcing its rate\ndecisions in 1994. The Committee raised rates at individual meetings by larger amounts in the early 1980s,\nwhen it raised the federal funds rate to near 20 percent.\n\n- 7 -\nAnd in keeping with this logic and based on the data in hand at this moment, there\nappears to be little turbulence ahead, so I currently favor a 25-basis point increase at the\nFOMC’s next meeting at the end of this month. Beyond that, we still have a considerable\nway to go toward our 2 percent inflation goal, and I expect to support continued\ntightening of monetary policy.\nI think that is probably enough from me, so that there will be more time for you to\nask questions. Thank you again to the CFR for the opportunity to be here today.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n3:00 p.m. EDT (Noon PDT)\nOctober 19, 2021\nThe Economic Outlook and a Cautionary Tale\non “Idiosyncratic” Price Changes and Inflation\nRemarks by\nChristopher J. Waller\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nStanford Institute for Economic Policy Research Associates Meeting\nStanford, California\n(via webcast)\nOctober 19, 2021\n\nThank you to the institute for the opportunity to speak to you. Today my goal is\nto explain my outlook for the U.S. economy as well as how that perspective shapes my\nviews on the appropriate approach to monetary policy.1 I have three points I would like\nyou to take away from my comments. First, while there has been a significant slowdown\nin third quarter gross domestic product (GDP) growth, it should rebound in the first half\nof 2022. Second, I believe that substantial progress has been made on both the inflation\nand employment legs of our dual mandate. Hence, I believe that we should soon\ncommence tapering our asset purchases. Finally, the next several months are critical for\nassessing whether the high inflation numbers we have seen are transitory. If monthly\nprints of inflation continue to run high through the remainder of this year, a more\naggressive policy response than just tapering may well be warranted in 2022.\nIn terms of economic growth, data for the third quarter of 2021 show that the\neconomic recovery slowed as the effects of the Delta variant caused consumers and\nbusinesses to start pulling back on some forms of economic activity such as travel and\nleisure. Measures of consumer mobility, which are a good indicator of spending, grew\nstrongly starting last winter but then started falling in June, around when the effects of\nDelta started to become significant. I and most other forecasters expected that real GDP\nwould grow close to the very strong rate posted in the first half of the year, but it now\nappears that GDP growth will be closer to 3 percent at an annual rate.\nThe two major causes of this slowdown have been the extent of the economic\neffects of the Delta surge and the extent of supply constraints, both of which had larger\neffects than I and most forecasters expected. That was due to both the disappointingly\n1 These views are my own and do not represent any position of the Board of Governors or other Federal\nReserve policymakers.\n\n- 2 -\nlow levels of vaccination in some areas and how highly contagious Delta proved to be.\nMeanwhile, we have seen labor shortages in many regions and many sectors that seem\nunwarranted given the level of unemployment and other indicators of slack in the labor\nmarket. And supply constraints have been very widespread, with many causes, only\nsome of them directly related to COVID-19. U.S. imports have been disrupted both at\nthe point of export and at U.S. ports, with backups at major ports larger than some have\never experienced. Thus, a lack of inputs and a lack of labor to use them have created a\ndramatic headwind for GDP.\nFortunately, there is already evidence that the Delta surge has begun to wane and,\nwith the reopening of schools (and the expectation that they will remain open in most\nareas), that the worst effects of Delta, medically and economically, may be behind us.\nLikewise, fears that Delta would lead health officials to mandate more severe business\nrestrictions have not materialized. Furthermore, the spread of the Delta variant has raised\nvaccination rates even in areas where they had been low, which will help contain the\nspread of the Delta variant.\nAll of this recent experience encourages me to believe that the moderation in the\nexpansion of economic activity in recent months that is directly related to the Delta surge\nwill be a temporary phenomenon. I expect that this slowdown has only delayed the\neconomic recovery into the first half of 2022, and thus I moved what I thought would be\nstrong growth in the second half of this year into the first half of next year. This delay\nmeans that my medium-term outlook for economic growth really has not changed much\nat all, and that I forecast the strong recovery will continue.\nThe Labor Market Is Healing\n\n- 3 -\nLet me now turn to the recent job reports. For the month of August, I and many\nforecasters expected the economy would create 700,000 jobs or more, but the initial\nnumber came in at a disappointing 235,000. Hopes turned to September, but that report\ndisappointed as well, with 194,000 jobs created. Despite these unexpectedly low\nnumbers, there is still some good news from the September report—namely, that the\ndisappointing number was due to unexpected declines in employment by state and local\ngovernments that may be attributed to limited labor supply that will work itself out in\ncoming months. Private payrolls increased a healthy 317,000 jobs in September, and the\nJuly and August payrolls were revised up by 169,000 jobs.\nNevertheless, the numbers are concerning, given that as many as 8 million\nworkers may have rolled off unemployment insurance programs in September. It is\ndifficult to imagine that, going forward, these workers will continue to remain on the\nsidelines. This suggests we may be in for very healthy job gains in the last quarter of this\nyear as these workers begin to fill the enormous number of available jobs.\nThe September jobs report also showed the unemployment rate falling four-tenths\nof 1 percent, from 5.2 percent to 4.8 percent. It is striking that, in 16 months, the\nunemployment rate has fallen from 14.8 percent in April 2020 to just 4.8 percent now.\nSo we are clearly most of the way back to the very strong labor market that we achieved\nbefore the pandemic. However, one data series, such as the unemployment rate, is\ninsufficient at capturing the overall status of the labor market. Our assessment of the\nlabor market must be broad based, which is why I look at more comprehensive measures\nof labor market health. Two that I find particularly useful are the Atlanta Fed’s labor\nmarket distributions spider chart and the Kansas City Fed’s Labor Market Conditions\n\n- 4 -\nIndicators.2 The Kansas City chart nicely condenses 24 different measures of the labor\nmarket, and the index is now above its long-run historical value. The Atlanta Fed spider\nchart shows where each of 15 labor market indicators sits relative to different dates, such\nas February 2020 and September 2021. The spider chart reveals that 9 of the\n15 indicators, including those for wages and job openings, are either better than February\n2020 or nearly as good. Consequently, both broad measures of labor market performance\nreveal a significant degree of healing in the U.S. labor market.\nNow let me focus on the Federal Reserve’s goals for monetary policy. As the\nminutes of the September Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting conveyed,\nmany participants judge that we have achieved substantial progress on our inflation goal.3\nWith regard to substantial further progress on our employment objective, I believe we\nhave now met that criterion despite the disappointing jobs reports for August and\nSeptember. We lost 22 million jobs during the early months of the pandemic recession.\nTwo million of those jobs are likely gone forever due to early retirements. We have now\nregained approximately 17 million of those jobs, or 85 percent of what was lost after\nadjusting for early retirements. Furthermore, the September unemployment rate of\n4.8 percent is not that far from the 3.5 percent unemployment rate that was realized in\nFebruary 2020.\nIn summary, the labor market has experienced a healthy recovery, but it is not\nfully healed. While there is still room to improve on the employment leg of our mandate,\n2 The Atlanta Fed’s spider chart and the Kansas City Fed’s measure of labor market conditions can be\nfound on the Reserve Banks’ respective websites at https://www.atlantafed.org/chcs/labor-market-\ndistributions and https://www.kansascityfed.org/data-and-trends/labor-market-conditions-indicators.\n3 The minutes of the September 2021 FOMC meeting are available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.\n\n- 5 -\nI believe we have made enough progress such that tapering of our asset purchases should\ncommence following our next FOMC meeting, which is in two weeks.\nInflation\nInflation has been running higher this year than I and most forecasters expected.\nIt has not been high for just a month or two—it has been high all year. It is important to\nacknowledge that. The unexpected inflation we have observed has raised costs for\nhouseholds and businesses and complicated their planning, which has a real effect on\npeople’s lives. For the Fed, the question is whether higher inflation this year undermines\nmoving toward our economic goals. On that score, I continue to believe that the\nescalation of inflation will be transitory and that inflation will move back toward our 2\npercent target next year. That said, I am still greatly concerned about the upside risk that\nelevated inflation will not prove temporary.\nWe have seen substantial increases in many prices. Lumber prices skyrocketed\nthrough May but have largely retraced that increase in the past few months. Prices for\nused cars rose substantially from mid-2020 to mid-2021 but now seem to have stabilized\nat this higher level. At present, I am closely watching prices for housing services (rent\nand owners’ equivalent rent), which saw modest increases last year but have picked up\nrecently. In addition, energy prices have moved up noticeably in recent months, and\nmarket conditions suggest risk of further increases.\nAs I said earlier, I still see supply and demand working here to moderate price\nincreases so that inflation moves back toward 2 percent. But I also see some upside\npressures on inflation that bear watching. Bottlenecks have been worse and are lasting\nlonger than I and most forecasters expected, and an important question that no one knows\n\n- 6 -\nthe answer to is how long these supply problems will persist. Through our business\ncontacts, we continue to hear stories about bottlenecks at almost every stage of\nproduction and distribution—for example, plants that shut down because of a shortage of\none or more crucial inputs; a poor cotton crop in the United States due to weather, which\nis driving up prices; and clogged ports and trucker shortages. Meanwhile, wage gains\nhave been strong. That apparently has not made its way into prices yet, but how long\nbefore it becomes a factor driving inflation? Firms are reporting that they have more\npricing power now than they have had in many years, as consumers seem to be accepting\nhigher prices.\nThe simple answer is that I believe the next few months will be crucial to\nunderstanding whether elevated rates of inflation last and if that will trigger a lasting\neffect on the U.S. economy. We will know more as time goes on about whether inflation\nin the prices of those goods and services will level off or even fall, as lumber prices have,\nand how other prices will evolve. But, importantly, we will also know whether this\nperiod of higher inflation has started to affect expectations of future inflation.\nA critical aspect of our new framework is to allow inflation to run above our\n2 percent target (so that it averages 2 percent), but we should do this only if inflation\nexpectations are consistent with our 2 percent target. If inflation expectations become\nunanchored, the credibility of our inflation target is at risk, and we likely would need to\ntake action to re-anchor expectations at our 2 percent target.\nThis raises a couple of key questions: Whose inflation expectations do we\nexamine, and how do we determine if they are unanchored? With regard to the first\nquestion, we measure inflation expectations two ways. First, we survey the public and\n\n- 7 -\nask them what they expect the inflation rate to be in coming years. The University of\nMichigan household survey and the New York Fed’s Survey of Consumer Expectations\nare examples of this “survey approach.” Second, we can infer inflation expectations from\ndifferences in yields between Treasury securities that are indexed for inflation and those\nthat are not. These breakeven inflation measures from the Treasury Inflation-Protected\nSecurities market are referred to as “market based” measures of inflation compensation.\nSurvey measures give us an idea of what the average household expects inflation\nto be in the coming years. Presumably, this measure of expectations is important because\nit should influence households’ wage demands as they seek compensation for an\nincreasing cost of living. A key drawback of these measures is that the respondent incurs\nno benefit or cost from the accuracy of their forecast. This is why I have always\npreferred market-based measures of inflation expectations, because they are formed by\ninvestors who are betting with real money about future inflation. In short, they have skin\nin the game.\nThis brings us to another question: Are inflation expectations anchored around\nour inflation target of 2 percent? Survey measures have shown a dramatic increase in\ninflation expectations over the past few months. The recent New York Fed measure has\nshort- and medium-term inflation expectations at 5.3 percent and 4.2 percent,\nrespectively. This is eye opening and a genuine cause for concern should households\nembed these expectations in wage demands. However, market-based measures of\ninflation expectations and the five-year inflation expectations from the New York Fed\nsurvey continue to be anchored near our 2 percent target. I also look at the Board of\nGovernors staff’s common inflation expectations measure, which distills a signal from\n\n- 8 -\nboth surveys and market-based inflation gauges. At this point, at least, it remains near its\naverage over the past decade. This gives me some comfort that the recent run of high\ninflation readings has not led to an unanchoring of inflation expectations. It is important\nto account for all measures of inflation expectations and not “cherry pick” the measure\nthat one finds most comforting.\nI would like to follow up on this last point as it pertains to thinking about\ninflation. As I mentioned earlier, a lot of commentators, including me, have deflected\nconcerns about high inflation readings being the result of “outliers” or “idiosyncratic”\nprice movements. As a result, recent high inflation readings are transitory and not broad\nbased. But there is a fallacy in doing so that one should avoid in judging whether higher\ninflation is indeed transitory.\nA basic tendency of statistical analysis is to exclude outlying or more volatile\ndata. There are sound reasons for this, such as when we exclude volatile food and energy\nprices to get a measure of “core” inflation; that kind of measure often is more stable and\ncan tell us whether the underlying forces behind inflation are moving as rapidly as it\nmight seem from headline inflation. A similar logic applies to trimmed mean measures\nof inflation, such as the Cleveland Fed trimmed mean consumer price index and the\nDallas Fed trimmed mean PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation rate.\nThese measures censor the tails of the price change distribution to avoid having average\ninflation distorted by extreme price movements. However, inflation is distilled from\nmany prices, and those prices do not move uniformly. As a result, we may be led to\n“falsely” dismiss certain price movements and risk being misled as to the true inflation\nrate.\n\n- 9 -\nLet me use a simple example to illustrate this point. Consider a three-good\neconomy with goods A, B and C, and look at how their prices increase over time. In one\nworld, the price of each good goes up 2 percent every year. Thus, average inflation is\n2 percent every year, and there is no reason to question that measure, as it is broad based.\nThis is typically what we have in mind when we think about trend inflation. In this\nworld, inflation is meeting the FOMC’s 2 percent target and there is no need for a policy\nchange.\nNow consider a world in which there are sharp price changes that are staggered\nacross the goods. In year 1, the price of good A goes up 5 percent, while the price of\ngoods B and C increase 2 percent. If we assume equal weights for each good, the\ninflation rate for this economy is 3 percent. This repeats in year 2, with the price of\ngood B increasing 5 percent while the other two have increases of 2 percent. In year 3,\ngood C sees the largest increase. In this economy, inflation averages 3 percent each year,\nwhich is above the FOMC’s 2 percent inflation target.\nNow, one could look at this data and manipulate it in several common ways.\nFirst, if one used a trimmed-mean measure of inflation, you would throw out the highest\nand the lowest readings for each year. What do you get? The average inflation rate\nwould be 2 percent every year. Thus, over a three-year period, a trimmed mean measure\nof inflation would be 2 percent and indicate we are hitting our inflation target when the\ntrue measure would be 3 percent per year.\nA second way of manipulating the data is to say in year 1, “Look, inflation is\nbeing driven by good A, which had an idiosyncratic, outsized price increase. If you\nthrow it out, the underlying inflation rate is 2 percent.” Then in year 2, you say, “Good B\n\n- 10 -\nhad an idiosyncratic price increase, so throw it out.” Repeat for year 3. Again, by\nselectively throwing out unusually high price increases for individual goods, you would\nconclude that inflation over the three-year period is 2 percent and we are hitting the\ninflation target when, in fact, it was 3 percent.\nThird, one can justify throwing out good A in the first year by saying it did not\nreflect a broad-based price increase—the prices of 67 percent of the goods rose 2 percent.\nSo, based on these goods, we are hitting our inflation target. You would be correct but,\nagain, misguided.\nFinally, one could claim, correctly, that the large price increase for good A is\n“transitory”—it went up strikingly in year 1 but then dropped back, meaning inflation\nshould fall back to our inflation target in coming periods. But that will mislead you in\nterms of understanding the true inflation rate, because you are putting zero probability\nthat a large spike in inflation will happen to another good in the future.\nThe moral of this little example is that one needs to be careful when selectively\nignoring data series—be it used car prices, food and energy prices, or household surveys\nof inflation expectations. All of these series convey important information about the\nevolution of inflation, and one should exhibit caution in dismissing data as outliers. We\nmust keep our eyes open to inflationary pressures, wherever they come from, with\nconsistency and rigor and stand ready to adjust policy if we conclude that such a change\nis warranted.\nThis brings me to how I believe monetary policy should evolve in the coming\nmonths, based on the outlook I have described. The near-term decision we face is when\nto begin slowing the pace of asset purchases, which have each month been adding to the\n\n- 11 -\nlevel of financial accommodation provided by the Fed to support the economy. Our test\nfor this step was making “substantial further progress” toward our employment and\ninflation goals. After years of running below 2 percent, the recent and sustained increase\nin inflation clearly represents substantial progress toward our goal. And the continued\ngains in employment, despite a couple of months of a slowdown, along with results\nacross a range of labor market indicators, indicate to me that there has also been\nsubstantial further progress toward maximum employment. I support the FOMC\nbeginning to reduce asset purchases following our meeting in November. Importantly,\nthis action should not tighten financial conditions, since a later 2021 tapering has already\nbeen priced in by most participants.\nOne issue on which we should also be clear is the pace of tapering. I have said in\nthe past that I favor a pace of tapering that would result in the end of asset purchases by\nthe middle of 2022. Of course, if economic conditions and the outlook were to\ndeteriorate significantly, we could slow or pause this tapering. And if the economy were\nto strengthen more than expected, the plan to rapidly end purchases would provide policy\nspace in 2022 to act sooner than now anticipated to begin raising the target range for the\nfederal funds rate.\nBased on my outlook for the economy, however, I do not expect liftoff to occur\nsoon after tapering is completed. The two policy actions are distinct. I believe the pace\nof continued improvement in the labor market will be gradual, and I expect inflation will\nmoderate, which means liftoff is still some time off.\nThat said, as I mentioned earlier, if my upside risk for inflation comes to pass,\nwith inflation considerably above 2 percent well into 2022, then I will favor liftoff sooner\n\n- 12 -\nthan I now anticipate. A major consideration will be my judgment about whether\ninflation expectations are at risk of becoming “unanchored”—rising substantially and\npersistently above 2 percent. My FOMC colleagues and I will be watching all of the data\ncarefully in the coming weeks and months and will adjust policy as needed to help ensure\nthe U.S. economy continues to recover from the effects of COVID, and that we continue\nto make progress toward our economic goals.",

Waller\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\n2023 International Journal of Central Banking Conference\nDublin, Ireland\nJune 22, 2023\n\nThank you, Gabriel, and thank you to the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) for\nhosting this year’s conference. From the outside, central banking can look like the work\nof individual policymakers, parsing the data and making the hard decisions. In truth, it is\na team effort of many people, and that has also been true for editing the International\nJournal of Central Banking (IJCB) and putting together this conference. I have a long\nlist of people to thank who did the lion’s share of that work during the year that I have\nserved as managing editor. But first, for those who may not know it, let me review the\nhistory of the journal and touch on what this conference will address.\nIn the summer of 2004, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the\nEuropean Central Bank, and the Group of Ten central banks agreed to support the\ndevelopment of a new publication focused on the theory and practice of central banking.\nThere was no shortage of research on central banking, and, indeed, central bankers\nthemselves did and continue to publish peer-reviewed research in leading journals, not to\nmention many working papers published by central banks and other outlets. This work\nwas prevalent, but there was a sense that there lacked a place for scholarly research that\nfocused exclusively on central banking and could serve as a forum for the community of\ncentral bankers around the world. The creation of the International Journal of Central\nBanking filled this deficit. The primary objectives of the IJCB are to widely disseminate\nthe best policy-relevant and applied research on central banking and to promote\ncommunication among researchers inside and outside central banks. We do this with\npublication of the journal, which will now be coming out six times a year, and with the\nadded attention of this conference, which presents research on timely policy topics. With\nthe possible exception of myself, the journal has attracted distinguished managing\n\n- 2 -\neditors, including my colleagues from the Federal Reserve and my immediate\npredecessor, Luc Laeven from the European Central Bank. We have the strong support\nnow of 55 sponsoring institutions, including the CBI and the Bank of Canada, which\nhosted last year’s conference.\nIn 2022, we chose the theme for this year’s conference based on events very much\non the minds of central bankers: “Global Supply Shocks, Trade Frictions, and Inflation.”\nGlobal and sectoral supply shocks over the past few years have had significant effects on\ntrade, economic activity, and inflation, and they figured prominently in monetary\npolicymaking. The effects of these shocks have varied across different economies, but a\ncommon theme is elevated inflation. The current economic environment has raised\nseveral policy questions that the papers presented here attempt to answer. These are\nquestions that policymakers, including those of here today, must grapple with, even when\nthe answers are far from apparent. Academic research provides insights into these\nquestions and possible answers, ways to analyze the data, and the foundations for testing\ntheories with economic models.\nThe papers presented here today and tomorrow are ideal examples of the kind of\nwork that can help policymakers do their jobs better, and can facilitate sharing knowledge\naround the world. We have sessions on inflation, of course, and supply chain disruptions,\nand optimal monetary policy, and the important topic of uncertainty, which central\nbankers to some extent always face.\nBefore we get to those presentations, and what I hope will be vigorous\ndiscussions, let me recognize several people who made this event possible. Assisting\nGovernor Makhlouf at the CBI in organizing this conference has been Daragh Clancy.\n\n- 3 -\nDaragh and Robert Kelly at the CBI worked with a subset of IJCB editors to review the\npapers, but let me mention all of those editors, including Klaus Adam, Tobias Adrian,\nHuberto Ennis, Refet Gürkaynak, Òscar Jordà, Keith Kuester, Elena Loutskina, Robin\nLumsdaine, Fernanda Nechio, and Steven Ongena. This conference and the day-to-day\nsmooth running of the journal couldn’t be accomplished without the editorial team at the\nBIS and the Board of Governors as well as Kommaly Dias and Grace Chuan from my\nstaff. And, finally, a big thank you to my adviser Jane Ihrig, who does so much for me\nand who worked very, very hard to oversee the process at IJCB for this past year.\nAnd with that, I will step away from the microphone and put the spotlight where it\nshould be, on the scholars presenting their work today. Thank you, and I believe Daragh\nhas a few words to get us started.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n6:45 p.m. EDT\nJuly 13, 2023\nBig Shocks Travel Fast: Why Policy Lags May Be Shorter Than You Think\nRemarks by\nChristopher J. Waller\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nThe Money Marketeers of New York University\nNew York, New York\nJuly 13, 2023\n\nThank you. Whenever I get such a warm welcome, I always say to myself,\n“Waller, they really aren’t here for you or your sparkling personality. They’re here for\nyour outlook.”1 Which is fine, because accurately communicating my economic outlook\nis an important part of my job. Tonight, in addition to providing new information about\nmy outlook based on new data, I also want to clarify my views on how the economy has\nbeen operating over time and my view of appropriate monetary policy. Doing so can\nhelp the public anticipate how I will react to new developments, not just at the next\nmeeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), but further into the future.\nThat’s crucial, because monetary policy works mostly by influencing the public’s view of\nfinancial and economic conditions well into the future, affecting spending and investment\ndecisions. Whether I say so or not, every time I speak, I am trying to better explain how\nand why I make policy decisions.\nMy plan is to cover three issues. First, by looking over the past few FOMC\nmeetings, I want to describe how my outlook has been shaped by both economic data and\nuncertainty—what we have learned at each point and what we don’t yet know about the\neconomy. Second, I will discuss how I think about lags with which policy affects\neconomic activity and inflation and the impact on the appropriate path of policy. And\nthird, I will review the recent data and discuss how I see policy evolving over the\nremainder of this year.\nRecent Policy Actions\nAt the June meeting, I supported keeping the policy rate unchanged. Based only\non the economic data that was coming in showing a tight labor market and stubbornly\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nhigh inflation, I believe that raising the policy rate 25 basis points was justified.\nHowever, I had lingering doubts about when or if an abrupt tightening of credit\nconditions would occur. I viewed the lingering effects of the banking stresses from\nMarch as a downside risk to cause a tightening of credit conditions. Although there did\nnot appear to be a lot of evidence that a substantial credit crunch was in the works, I felt\nthat waiting another six weeks was prudent risk management. In the end, I believed that\nrisk management concerns slightly outweighed hiking based on the incoming data.\nI also felt more comfortable with this decision given that the median of the\nSummary of Economic Projections (SEP) signaled two additional rate hikes by the end of\nthis year. Early in March, prior to the March FOMC meeting, I had planned to raise my\nterminal rate 50 basis points given the hot data that had come in at that point. But then\ncame the turmoil in the banking sector. My thought was that credit conditions were\ngoing to tighten a lot as a result of the banking turmoil. I believed this tightening would\neffectively replace some of the tightening that otherwise would have been needed through\nmonetary policy. The net result was that in the March SEP, I left my projection of the\nterminal policy rate unchanged from December. But by June, there was little evidence\nthat credit conditions were tightening more than would be expected as a result of\nmonetary policy that had already tightened significantly. This led me to believe policy\nneeded to be tighter relative to what I thought in March. So, I marked up my projected\npath for the federal funds rate at the end of 2023 by 50 basis points.\nSo why did I walk you through this evolution of my thinking of the appropriate\nsetting of policy? First, it highlights how the appropriate setting for monetary policy\nshifts over time. Second, it shows that managing uncertainty and risks is a big part of my\n\n- 3 -\njob. Third, I hope it allows you to better consider how policymakers will adjust the\nsetting of policy in response to incoming data going forward.\nMonetary Policy Lags\nA second issue for the FOMC is how long it takes for changes in monetary policy\nto affect economic activity and inflation. As reported in the minutes of various FOMC\nmeetings, the Committee often discusses these lags. There is a wide range of views\namong researchers and policymakers as to how long it takes for the full effect of\nmonetary policy to register in the economy.\nWhat I would like to discuss is expectations for how long it will take for last\nyear’s sizable monetary policy tightening to show up in the economic data. While there\nis no consensus on an exact length of time, traditional rules of thumb say that the\nmaximum effect of an unexpected policy change, what economists call a “shock,” on the\nreal economy is between 12 and 24 months. There is tremendous uncertainty around this\nestimate. Furthermore, commentary sometimes treats lagged effects as a “Wile E.\nCoyote” moment where nothing happens for a long time and then wham…off the cliff we\ngo as the full force of past policy actions suddenly take effect.\nWhen considering applying this 12- to 24-month rule to last year’s policy actions,\nwe need to ask two questions: (1) When did the policy shock occur? (2) Does the size of\nthe shock matter? What I want to do in the next few minutes is push back against the\nview that the bulk of the effects from last year’s policy hikes have yet to hit the economy.\nLet me start by setting the stage with how the economic models that estimate\nthese lags are developed. Some of this discussion may be a bit geeky, so bear with me.\nEconomists typically use linear or log-linear statistical models that capture how past\n\n- 4 -\nchanges in a variable affect the current realization of that variable. The impact of past\nrealizations of an economic variable on current values is estimated using constant\ncoefficients. For example, if gross domestic product (GDP) increased at a 1 percent\nannual rate last quarter, a model might estimate that 0.9 of that increase will carry\nthrough to GDP in the current quarter and .8 of it will carry forward into the next quarter.\nThese estimates of 0.9 and 0.8 are constant across time and are independent of how big\nthe change is in GDP last quarter—if last quarter’s GDP increased at a 2 percent rate, 0.9\nof that would carry through to the current quarter and 0.8 of it would carry forward into\nthe next quarter. In short, the speed at which past changes feed into current and future\nvalues does not change over time and does not depend on the size of past changes.\nOnce these models are estimated using historical data, the policy exercise then is\nto feed an unexpected, temporary 25 basis point increase in the federal funds rate into this\nsystem of linear equations and simulate the effects on key economic variables. The idea\nis to capture a causal response of the economy to the policy shock. Based on this\nprocess, we can trace out the change over time in a variable, say GDP. Economists call\nthis an impulse response function.\nTypically, these impulse response functions illustrate how the variables move\nrelative to their long-run values. The impulse response functions are normally hump-\nshaped—there is a small effect initially and the effect grows over time with the maximal\nimpact occurring several quarters after the policy surprise. After the peak impact, the\neffect of the policy change on the real economy fades away, with the variables returning\nto their long run steady state values. The hump-shaped impulse response function\nillustrates that there are lagged effects from a policy surprise. There are a wide variety of\n\n- 5 -\nstatistical models one can use for this exercise but looking across these models, one gets\nthe rule of thumb that the maximal effects of monetary policy changes will hit the\neconomy with a 12-month to 24-month lag.\nThere are two key takeaways from this discussion. First, the hump-shaped\nresponse means there are no “cliff effects”—a policy change is not associated with a long\nperiod of no effect that is then followed by an abrupt change in the variable. Second,\neconomic variables respond sluggishly to unexpected policy changes and the\nsluggishness is what generates a lagged response to a policy action. There are many\nexplanations as to why households and businesses respond sluggishly, such as adjustment\ncosts, sticky prices and wages, nominal contracts, habit persistence in consumption, or\nthe fact that there is an option value of waiting when deciding to invest.\nGiven this basic description of how lags are estimated, let me now turn to my\nquestions. First, when did the policy shock occur? In these statistical models, it occurs\nwhen there is an unexpected change in the federal funds rate. In short, from the point of\nview of the model, the FOMC wakes up one morning and surprises markets with a 25-\nbasis point hike.2 While this is a fun exercise to see what happens, it doesn’t really\ncapture how monetary policy works in practice. Only rarely do policymakers try to\nsurprise markets, and in fact, we usually specify our policy intentions well ahead of time\nthrough the use of forward guidance. As I said earlier, forward guidance is one of the\npurposes of this speech. Forward guidance is used to signal future policy actions and,\n2 Typically, economists look at the difference between the actual policy rate change and the expected\nchange from federal funds rate futures. So, if the FOMC raised the policy rate by 25-basis points and the\nmarket expected a 10-basis point hike (meaning the market pricing reflected a 40 percent probability of a\n25 basis point hike and 60 percent probability of no change) this would correspond to a policy surprise of\n15 basis points.\n\n- 6 -\nwhen it is credible, financial markets price those expected actions into today’s interest\nrates. By instantly pricing in future policy, promised rate hikes immediately affect many\nof the costs of financing for households and firms, even though the actual policy rate\nhasn’t moved. As a result, policy tightening occurs with the announcement of policy\ntightening, not when the rate change actually happens.\nAs an illustration, look at how the two-year Treasury yield moved between late\n2021 and March 2022, a time when the FOMC was talking about lifting the policy target\nrange above zero. I have argued in the past that the two-year Treasury yield is a good\nproxy for the stance of monetary policy and captures announcement effects.3 The 2-year\nyield went from 25 basis points in September 2021 to around 200 basis points by the\nMarch 2022 FOMC meeting. Even though we had not raised the policy rate nor did we\nget the policy rate up to 200 basis points until August 2022, the markets priced in a nearly\n200 basis point increase in the expected policy rate before we actually raised it. This\nforward guidance effectively shaved off about 6 months from the usual 12- to 24-month\nlag that one might conjecture would be needed to see the 200 basis points of actual\ntightening affect the economy.4 That is, forward guidance shortens the lag time between\nwhen the policy rate changes and when the effects of actual policy tightening occur.\nNow let me turn to the second question, whether the size of the shock matters for\nestimating lags in policy. In the standard linear models used for these exercises, the size\n3 See Christopher J. Waller (2022), “Reflections on Monetary Policy in 2021,” speech delivered at the 2022\nHoover Institution Monetary Conference, Stanford, Calif., May 6,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20220506a.htm.\n4 Recent analysis by Fed economists shows the announcement effects of policy have in fact led to a\nshortening in monetary policy lags. See Taeyoung Doh and Andrew T. Foerster (2022), “Have Lags in\nMonetary Policy Transmission Shortened?” Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Economic Bulletin,\nDecember 21, https://www.kansascityfed.org/research/economic-bulletin/have-lags-in-monetary-policy-\ntransmission-shortened/.\n.\n\n- 7 -\nof the shock doesn’t matter. The size of the shock basically scales the effect\nproportionately without changing the timing of when past changes affect current values\nof a variable.\nWhat I am going to argue is that the size of the shock may lead to changes in\neconomic behavior that change the coefficients in the statistical models. In less jargony\nwords, the degree of sluggish behavior of economic variables to a policy surprise is not\nconstant but can change with the size and nature of the shock.5\nThere are a lot of reasons to think that “big shocks travel fast,” meaning they elicit\na change in economic behavior that would not be associated with small shocks. In the\npast year the FOMC has raised rates faster than it has in forty years, so we should be\nskeptical about whether statistical models based on historical experience will be reliable\nin estimating lags for such an unusual event. To support this line of reasoning, let me use\nsome examples to illustrate the concept that big shocks travel fast.\nFirst, a large area of economic research focuses on the idea of “rational\ninattention.”6 The basic idea is that households and firms have a limited amount of\nattention that they can dedicate to processing information. It is costly and time\nconsuming to constantly adjust behavior and portfolios in response to small changes in\nprices or interest rates. Consequently, people must decide which data to focus on and\nhow often they look at it. Because households and firms “rationally ignore” certain data\n5 Most economists will recognize this application of the Lucas Critique.\n6 See the recent survey article by Bartosz Maćkowiak, Filip Matějka, and Mirko Wiederholt (2023),\n“Rational Inattention: A Review,” Journal of Economic Literature, vol. 61 (March), pp. 226–73,\nhttps://doi.org/10.1257/jel.20211524.\n\n- 8 -\nand only look at them infrequently, their behavior looks sluggish in how they respond to\nsmall shocks.\nBut this sluggishness does not apply when big shocks hit. For example, large\nchanges in interest rates will get a lot of attention and have a much faster and dramatic\nimpact on consumption, saving and portfolio allocation. The apparently “sluggish\nbehavior” based on small shocks disappears, and households and firms change their\nbehavior much more quickly. Big changes in policy rates will tend to cause more rapid\nchanges in behavior, which implies monetary policy lags will be shorter when changes to\nthe policy rate are large and rapid.\nAs a second example, consider the frequency at which firms change their prices.\nData show that firms typically adjust their prices once a year, which is usually interpreted\nto mean that prices are “sticky.” However, recent evidence shows that because of the big\ninflation shock that occurred over the past two years, prices have changed more\nfrequently as firms tried to keep their relative prices in line with rapidly changing market\nconditions. This fact has important implications for the Phillips curve model that\neconomists use to link unemployment and inflation. The shift in frequency of price\nsetting will affect the slope (the coefficient), which indicates how sensitive inflation is to\na change in unemployment.\nI addressed this issue in a speech earlier this year.7 Using historical data, where\nthe frequency of price adjustment was about once a year, this had the effect of pinning\ndown the slope of the Phillips curve. The Phillips curve was estimated to be very flat.\n7See Christopher J. Waller (2023), “The Unstable Phillips Curve,” speech delivered at Macroeconomics\nand Monetary Policy, a conference sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, San\nFrancisco, Calif., March 31, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20230331a.htm.\n\n- 9 -\nThe implication is that unemployment has to increase a lot to bring inflation down by a\nsmall amount. But, with the more frequent price changes lately, the Phillips curve has\nsteepened. This steepening implies that monetary policy will affect inflation faster and\nwith less effect on the unemployment rate than would occur if price changes were slower.\nSo once again, the lags between changes in monetary policy and inflation should be\nshorter than historical experience tells us, and as is reflected in models.\nWhat is the implication of this economic research? The effects of policy\ntightening last year are feeding through to market interest rates faster than typically\nthought because of announcement effects, and on top of this we have had policy rate\nchanges that have been more dramatic and faster than in the past which most likely has\nled to a more rapid adjustment in the behavior of households and firms. These two points\nsuggest that the effects of the large policy changes that we undertook last year should hit\neconomic activity and inflation much faster than is typically predicted.\nIf one believes the bulk of the effects from last year’s tightening have passed\nthrough the economy already, then we can’t expect much more slowing of demand and\ninflation from that tightening. To me, this means that the policy tightening we have\nconducted this year has been appropriate and also that more policy tightening will be\nneeded to bring inflation back to our 2 percent target. Pausing rate hikes now, because\nyou are waiting for long and variable lags to arrive, may leave you standing on the\nplatform waiting for a train that has already left the station.\nEconomic Outlook\nLet me now turn to my third topic: how I see things standing today. Economic\nactivity reportedly grew 2 percent in the first quarter, and based on economic data\n\n- 10 -\nthrough early July, the Atlanta Fed’s GDP projection suggests growth was a touch higher\nin the second quarter. Recent Institute for Supply Management surveys suggest some\ncontinued slowing in the manufacturing sector, but activity outside that sector is still\ngrowing at a solid pace.\nTurning to the labor market, it has been very tight for a long time and the most\nrecent jobs report showed that employers added 209,000 jobs in June. This number came\nin a little lower than expected, and it is down noticeably from this time last year.\nMeanwhile, data on job openings showed some welcome signs of cooling. The ratio of\njob vacancies to the number of people counted as unemployed has declined on balance so\nfar this year, and the number of people quitting their jobs, which I tend to think of as\nmoving for higher wages, has moved down from its peak last year. However, despite\nthese welcome signs of softening, the labor market is still very robust. Job growth is still\nwell above the pre-pandemic average, the unemployment rate remains quite low, and\nwage growth continues to be above what would support returning inflation to 2 percent.\nYesterday, we received new data on consumer price index (CPI) inflation. After\n5 consecutive monthly readings of core inflation of 0.4 percent or above, this rate\ndropped by half in June, to 0.2 percent. This is welcome news, but one data point does\nnot make a trend. Inflation briefly slowed in the summer of 2021 before getting much\nworse, so I am going to need to see this improvement sustained before I am confident that\ninflation has decelerated.\nIn terms of the latest banking data, the Federal Reserve’s weekly release of assets\nand liabilities of commercial banks (the H.8 data release) suggests that banks are\nresponding in a way that is consistent with monetary policy tightening but not banking\n\n- 11 -\nstress. For example, growth in core loans on banks’ books has decelerated since late\n2022, as banks tightened lending standards and demand slowed amid lagged effects from\nmonetary policy tightening. The deceleration in core loan balances was especially\npronounced in early 2023 even before the Silicon Valley Bank collapse and has\ncontinued afterwards. And we did see discrete effects in deposit outflows in mid-March,\nbut those flows have stabilized. Moreover, banks have been able to replace core deposit\noutflows with large time deposits, Federal Home Loan Bank advances and other sources\nof funding. These actions are leading to a slowdown in credit growth, but one that is in\nline with monetary policy tightening.\nSo, what does this mean for monetary policy? With the banking sector sound and\nresilient, fighting inflation remains my top priority, and I believe we will get there. What\nwill get us there is setting the stance of policy at a level that will continue to help bring\nsupply and demand in the economy into better balance. While I expect inflation to\neventually settle near our 2 percent target because of our policy actions, we have to make\nsure what we saw in yesterday’s inflation report feeds through broadly across goods and\nservices and that we do not revert back to what has been persistently high core inflation.\nThe robust strength of the labor market and the solid overall performance of the U.S.\neconomy gives us room to tighten policy further.\nAs things stand now, my outlook for the stance of monetary policy that will get\ninflation near the FOMC’s 2 percent target is roughly consistent with the FOMC’s\neconomic projections in June. I see two more 25-basis-point hikes in the target range\nover the four remaining meetings this year as necessary to keep inflation moving toward\nour target. Furthermore, I believe we will need to keep policy restrictive for some time in\n\n- 12 -\norder to have inflation settle down around our 2% target. Since the June meeting, with\nanother month of data to evaluate lending conditions, I am more confident that the\nbanking turmoil is not going to result in a significant problem for the economy, and I see\nno reason why the first of those two hikes should not occur at our meeting later this\nmonth. From there, I will need to see how the data come in. If inflation does not\ncontinue to show progress and there are no suggestions of a significant slowdown in\neconomic activity, then a second 25-basis-point hike should come sooner rather than\nlater, but that decision is for the future.",

Waller\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\n2023 Santa Barbara County Economic Summit\nUniversity of California, Santa Barbara Economic Forecast Project\nSanta Barbara, California\n(via webcast)\nMay 24, 2023\n\nThank you, Peter, and thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today. I\nconfess I am not an expert on Santa Barbara County’s diverse economy, beyond my\nabiding interest in the excellent wines you produce. But you will hear more about the\nregional outlook from the other two speakers and so I’ll focus my remarks on a broader\nperspective of the U.S. economy and how the data is shaping my policy views.1 Let me\ncut to the chase—in my view, data since the last meeting of the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC) has not provided sufficient clarity as to what we should do with our\npolicy rate at the next meeting. We still have some major data releases coming up in the\nnext three weeks and I’ll also be learning more about evolving credit conditions, both\nfactors which will inform me on the best course of action. Between now and then, we\nneed to maintain flexibility on the best decision to take in June.\nStarting with the economy, activity has slowed from its pace in the latter half of\nlast year. Real gross domestic product (GDP) is estimated to have grown at a modest rate\nlast quarter, and different data available for the current quarter could be interpreted as\nsuggesting growth is slowing or even accelerating a bit. Real GDP grew at an annual rate\nof 1.1 percent in the first three months of the year. The consensus of private sector\nforecasts tracked by the Blue Chip survey is for annualized growth of only a tenth of a\npercent or two above zero this quarter. By contrast, the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow\nprojection, based on a range of data, is for a 2.9 percent growth rate. Retail sales and\nindustrial production rose in April, though those gains followed two months of declining\nor flat readings. At the same time, April was the second month non-manufacturing\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nbusinesses expanded modestly, according to respondents of the Institute for Supply\nManagement survey.\nDespite this slowing in activity from last year, we have a very tight labor market\nand high inflation. We also are at a period of higher-than-usual uncertainty about how\ncredit conditions are evolving in response to the recent bank failures and stress among\nsome other mid-size banks. Let me talk about each of these three key issues and then\nconclude with how I see these factors playing into my June policy decision.\nA Very Tight Labor Market\nThe employment report for April showed solid job growth, but previous months\nwere revised downward by a significant amount. The unemployment rate fell slightly to\n3.4 percent, reaching its low in recent years, which is the lowest since 1969. The labor\nforce participation rate held steady in April after several months of increases. Average\nhourly earnings rose at their fastest pace this year, and, over the past 12 months, were up\n4.4 percent, slightly higher than the yearly pace in March. These data suggest the labor\nmarket is still powering forward.\nHowever, there are some other signs that the labor market may be cooling.\nTemporary-help employment fell for the third straight month and is considerably down\nfrom last year. Some see this category as a leading indicator for overall employment,\nmeaning we may see some softening in labor demand going forward. Furthermore, job\nvacancies declined by 384,000 in March, and the number of job vacancies for every\nperson counted as looking for a job has declined to 1.6, down from the peak of 2 for\nevery job seeker. This reduction is consistent with a softening in labor demand, but it is\nstill far above the 1-to 1 ratio that was typical before the pandemic. Finally, the rate at\n\n- 3 -\nwhich people are quitting jobs, a sign of confidence in the job market, has fallen and is in\nhailing distance of the level that persisted for the couple of years before the pandemic\nrecession.\nAs I have argued in other speeches, a loosening labor market, to help our fight\nagainst inflation, doesn’t have to mean a recession or big job losses.2 But we do need to\nsee more loosening than we have seen to help take the heat off the inflation rate.\nInflation Is Stubbornly High\nLet’s talk about where we are on inflation. The latest consumer price index (CPI)\nreport showed that headline inflation fell from 5 percent year over year in March to 4.9\npercent in April. But that decline was only due to rounding—the actual decrease was just\nfive one-hundreds of a percentage point, from 4.98 percent to 4.93 percent. Almost no\nprogress.\nThe news on core inflation was similar. Core CPI inflation excludes food and\nenergy and is usually a better guide to the underlying trend for prices. Core was up 5.5\npercent in April from a year before and has been more or less steady in 2023. It is only a\nbit down from around 6 percent a year ago. Whether measured on a three month, six-\nmonth or 12-month basis, it is running too high. Likewise, narrower definitions of\ninflation intended to filter out fluctuations in some prices show little progress in the past\nyear. Six of seven of these alternative measures created by different parts of the Federal\n2 See Christopher J. Waller (2022), “Responding to High Inflation, with Some Thoughts on a Soft\nLanding,” speech delivered at the Institute for Monetary and Financial Stability Distinguished Lecture,\nGoethe University, Frankfurt, Germany, May 30,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20220530a.htm\n\n- 4 -\nReserve System show inflation running between 4 and more than 5 percent over the past\nyear or so.3\nBottom line, I am concerned about the lack of progress in any and all of these\nmeasures, and I have a couple specific concerns about some important components of\ninflation. First, core goods prices, which were among the biggest factors that drove the\nescalation in inflation the past two years, aren’t slowing or retreating as much as we need\nto get inflation down closer to our 2 percent target. We’re hoping there will be a\ncontinued slowdown in goods price increases, but we aren’t seeing deflation in this\ncategory like we had pre-pandemic. A second concern is rent increases, which accounts\nfor most of a category called housing services and is a sizable component of inflation.\nLower rent increases from lease renewals last year are slowly making their way into the\ninflation data, but most recently, a rebound in the housing market is raising questions\nabout how sustained those lower rent increases will be. While housing prices actually\nhave less of a short-term effect on rents than one might think, this upturn in the housing\nmarket, which comes even with significantly higher mortgage rates, has raised questions\nabout whether the benefit from the slowing in rent increases will last as long as we have\nbeen expecting. Lastly, as I think of the service category of inflation, I look to how\nwages are growing, since labor is a large input into production. Though some measures\nof wage increases have begun to slow, I am concerned that inflation won’t be coming\n3See Kevin L. Kliesen (2023), “Measures of ‘Trend’ Inflation,” Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis,\nEconomic Synopses, April 18, https://doi.org/10.20955/es.2023.7.\n\n- 5 -\ndown very much unless average hourly earnings decelerate from the most recent level of\n4.4 percent to a pace a lot closer to 3 percent.4\nOn Friday, we will be getting April inflation data based on personal consumption\nexpenditures and then May CPI data on the first day of the FOMC meeting. These are\ntwo critical pieces of data I will be looking at between now and the June FOMC meeting\nto learn more about inflation dynamics and if we are seeing some easing in inflation\npressures.\nUncertainty about Credit Conditions\nTurning to banking conditions, I want to emphasize that overall, the banking\nsystem is sound and resilient, with strong capital and liquidity. In response to the recent\nstress, the Federal Reserve, working with the Treasury Department and the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation, took decisive action to strengthen confidence in the\nbanking system. Employing financial stability tools in response to liquidity pressures\nallows us to continue to focus on setting monetary policy to achieve our dual mandate of\nmaximum employment and price stability.\nMonetary policy works in large part by setting the target range for the federal\nfunds rate, and this rate transmits to market interest rates and affects household and\nbusiness saving, spending, and investment decisions. So, the FOMC has been raising the\ntarget range for the federal funds rate over the past year with the goal to slow demand for\ngoods, services and labor to bring them into better alignment with supply and put\ndownward pressure on inflation. Financial conditions can also tighten from non-\n4 Of course, I want to see wages grow. But wage growth needs to be at levels that are consistent with our\ntwo percent inflation goal. Otherwise, wage gains will be outstripped by inflation and families effectively\nwill have less take home pay.\n\n- 6 -\nmonetary policy developments. And there has been a lot of discussion about how the\nrecent banking stresses may tighten credit conditions. If lending does slow, this can\nobviate the need for at least some monetary policy tightening. It is important to account\nfor this other form of tightening in setting the stance of monetary policy. If not\nconsidered appropriately, the Fed could tighten too much and needlessly raise the risk of\na recession.\nI am monitoring how credit conditions may be changing, both interest rates and\nnon-rate conditions, such as the number of new loans, the size of loans, and the lending\nterms. Since the bank failures in mid-March, the Fed’s survey of bank loan officers in\nApril showed some moderate tightening of lending conditions to firms over the previous\nthree months, with somewhat more tightening for lending to smaller firms. Officers for\nmany of the banks in the survey said they expected lending conditions to continue to\ntighten further in 2023. Lending conditions had tightened significantly already since\n2021, and it is hard to tell whether the actual and expected incremental tightening in\nstandards in this survey was more of the same or related to the banking stress.\nIn addition to the Fed survey, a variety of financial market participants over the\npast few weeks have also reported that credit tightening is expected to continue. They are\nnot suggesting a credit crunch but are concerned that it could happen, and they say it isn’t\nyet clear how banking terms and conditions will evolve. There are a wide range of\nestimates trying to map this expected credit tightening into policy rate hikes. As of\ntoday, it isn’t clear to me what the effect on the economy will be.\nImplications for Monetary Policy\n\n- 7 -\nLet me turn to the implications for monetary policy. There is a lot of discussion\nabout the next step for policy. There are three options: hike, skip, or pause. Let me\noutline reasons why each of these options may be appropriate.\nOne might lean toward hiking by focusing on the economic data and interpreting\nit to suggest that inflation and economic activity are not consistent with significant and\nongoing progress toward the FOMC’s 2 percent inflation goal. Based solely on the data\nwe have in hand as of today, we are not making much progress on inflation. If one\ndoesn’t believe the incoming data will be much better, one could advocate for another 25-\nbasis-point hike as the appropriate action in June.\nAlternatively, one might view the current and incoming data as supporting a hike\nin June but believe that caution is warranted because there is a high level of uncertainty\nabout how credit conditions are evolving. Another hike combined with an abrupt and\nunexpected tightening of credit conditions may push the economy down in a rapid and\nundesirable manner. This possibility is the downside risk of an additional rate hike in the\ncurrent environment. If one is sufficiently worried about this downside risk, then prudent\nrisk management would suggest skipping a hike at the June meeting but leaning toward\nhiking in July based on the incoming inflation data. There is a little over a month\nbetween the June and July FOMC meetings, and during that time we will learn more\nabout how credit conditions are evolving. Over four months will have passed between\nthe Silicon Valley Bank failure and the July meeting. By then we will have a much\nclearer idea about credit conditions. If banking conditions do not appear to have\ntightened excessively, then hiking in July could well be the appropriate policy.\n\n- 8 -\nLastly, one might want to pause hikes at the June meeting, meaning that the target\nrange is at its terminal rate, if the current stance of policy is thought to be enough to bring\ninflation down over time. Between policy lags and possible tightening credit conditions,\nthe current stance of monetary policy may be seen, at that point, as sufficiently restrictive\nto move us toward the dual mandate. From this viewpoint, the policy rate is high enough\nand we simply need to hold it there to bring inflation down toward our 2 percent target.\nI do not expect the data coming in over the next couple of months will make it\nclear that we have reached the terminal rate. And I do not support stopping rate hikes\nunless we get clear evidence that inflation is moving down towards our 2 percent\nobjective. But whether we should hike or skip at the June meeting will depend on how\nthe data come in over the next three weeks. We will get additional labor market data,\nwith some information about wages, and additional inflation numbers in the next few\nweeks that will continue to shape my view on where we stand relative to the FOMC’s\ndual mandate. During this time, I’ll also be reviewing data on credit conditions to\nevaluate how much potential tightening is coming from the banking sector.\nFighting inflation continues to be my priority. We worked very hard over the past\nyear to quickly raise the target range for the federal funds rate from near zero to about 5\npercent. While we are seeing some tentative signs of cooling in the labor market, I am\ndetermined to continue to use our policy tools as needed to appropriately bring inflation\ndown to 2 percent.\nThank you.",

Waller\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nUniversity of Notre Dame\nNotre Dame, Indiana\nSeptember 6, 2024\n\nThank you, Eric, and thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today.1 My\ntopic is the outlook for the U.S. economy and the implications for monetary policy, a set\nof judgements that have, of course, been influenced by this morning’s jobs report. When\nI scheduled this speech several months ago, I knew it might be challenging to speak a few\nhours after the release of such an important piece of data. But we like to say that\nmonetary policy must be nimble, so that means policymakers must be nimble also. Not\nSimone Biles nimble, but nimble. As you will hear, I believe the data we have received\nthis week reinforces the view that there has been continued moderation in the labor\nmarket. In light of the considerable and ongoing progress toward the Federal Open\nMarket Committee’s 2 percent inflation goal, I believe that the balance of risks has\nshifted toward the employment side of our dual mandate, and that monetary policy needs\nto adjust accordingly.\nLooking back at the economic data over the first six months of 2024, it portrayed\nan economy slowly cooling and not showing signs of significant weakening. The labor\nmarket had been gradually moderating for the past year or so, and although inflation rose\nin the first quarter, it then retreated in the second, and there was a widespread view\nheading into the second half of the year that the FOMC was on track to achieve a much\ndesired but unusual “soft landing.”\nThen the July jobs report came in unexpectedly soft. Job creation slowed and the\nunemployment rate increased by two tenths of a percentage point to 4.3 percent, the\nhighest since October 2021. There was speculation that weather-related issues might\nhave distorted these results and, in fact, the unemployment rate ticked down in this\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nmorning’s release. But, overall, the August report along with other recent labor data tend\nto confirm that there has been a continued moderation in the labor market.\nThe ups and downs in the data over time highlight what I consider the right\napproach to meeting the FOMC’s dual mandate goals—I believe we should be data\ndependent, but not overreact to any data point, including the latest data. When we faced\na period of banking instability in the spring of 2023, there were calls from some to stop\nrate hikes despite inflation still running over 5 percent. But there were other tools in\nhand to deal with that stress, monetary policy did not overreact, and the FOMC continued\ntightening policy. When inflation fell unexpectedly in the second half of last year, we did\nnot overreact and immediately cut the policy rate. Then when inflation accelerated in the\nfirst quarter, we did not overreact and raise rates despite some calls to do so. I will be\nlooking at these last two employment reports in combination with all other data as we\nhead into the September FOMC meeting to decide the best stance of policy. I believe our\npatience over the past 18 months has served us well. But the current batch of data no\nlonger requires patience, it requires action.\nToday’s jobs report continues the longer-term pattern of a softening of the labor\nmarket that is consistent with moderate growth in economic activity, the details of which\nI will get into in a moment. As I said at the outset, considering the progress we have\nmade on getting inflation back to target, I believe that the balance of risks is now\nweighted more toward downside risks to the FOMC’s maximum-employment mandate.\nWhile the labor market has clearly cooled, based on the evidence I see, I do not\nbelieve the economy is in a recession or necessarily headed for one soon. The collective\nset of economic data indicates to me that the labor market and the economy are\n\n- 3 -\nperforming in a solid manner and the prospects for continued growth and job creation are\ngood, with inflation near 2 percent. I continue to believe that this can occur without\nsubstantial harm to the labor market. But I also believe that maintaining the economy’s\nforward momentum means that, as Chair Powell said recently, the time has come to begin\nreducing the target range for the federal funds rate.\nIn the rest of my remarks, I will lay out my reasons for believing that the\neconomy and employment will likely keep growing as inflation moves toward 2 percent.\nThe first of these is the large body of evidence that economic activity is continuing to\ngrow at a solid pace. Real gross domestic product (GDP) grew at a 2.2 percent annual\nrate in the first half of this year and recent data indicates that growth is continuing at\naround this pace in the third quarter.\nRetail sales were stronger than expected in July and showed that households\ncontinue to spend as their finances, in the aggregate, remain healthy. The increase was\nfairly broad based across goods categories. While many online retailers offered discounts\nlast month, this was not a dominant factor in the solid results. Although manufacturing\noutput fell in July and the August Institute for Supply Management manufacturing survey\npointed to weak production and new orders, the similar survey for the larger,\nnonmanufacturing sector was consistent with a modest expansion of activity.\nAs for the labor market, on balance, the data that we have received in the past\nthree days indicates to me that the labor market is continuing to soften but not deteriorate,\nand this judgement is important to our upcoming decision on monetary policy. As I said\nearlier, Wednesday’s report on job openings in July was consistent with a moderating\nlabor market. Meanwhile, the four-week moving average of initial claims for\n\n- 4 -\nunemployment insurance has risen gradually since January but has changed little on net\nin the past two months, with initial claims remaining fairly low.\nThe jobs report for August, released this morning, supported the story of ongoing\nmoderation in the labor market. After rising to 4.3 percent in July, the unemployment\nrate ticked down to 4.2 percent in August. Taking a longer perspective, the\nunemployment rate over the past 16 months has increased gradually but fairly steadily\nfrom 3.4 percent to 4.2 percent in today’s release. Payrolls rose by 142,000 in August\ncompared with 89,000 in July, leaving the three-month average payroll gain at 116,000,\ncompared with the 267,000 average in the first quarter and 147,000 in the second.\nAccounting for revisions to the jobs numbers that we received in August, that level is a\nbit below what I see as the breakeven pace for job creation that absorbs new entrants to\nthe workforce and keeps the unemployment rate constant.2\nJuly marked the first time that the three-month average unemployment rate has\nincreased by at least a half of a percentage point above its 12-month low, which was 3.6\npercent in July 2023. This breached a threshold established by the Sahm rule, which\nobserves that when this has occurred in the past, it has been a reliable indicator of the\neconomy entering a recession.\nWhile this is a correlation that certainly bears attention, I want to make a few\ncautionary points about relying on such rules in deciding that a recession has begun. As\nwe have seen in the recent past with other supposedly reliable recession rules, such as an\n2 The preliminary estimate of the annual benchmark revision to the establishment survey data, which was\nannounced on August 21, suggests that payroll growth between April 2023 and March 2024 will likely be\nrevised down early next year by about 68,000 per month on average. The implications for payroll growth\nbeyond March are less clear.\n\n- 5 -\ninverted yield curve, there is more to forecasting economic outcomes than the\nrelationships between a couple of variables.\nFirst, these rules are nothing more than a mechanical, statistical description of\npast economic outcomes—they do not seek to explain what economic forces drive the\nrelationship between the data, nor are they based on the totality of economic data. All\nrecessions rules do is pick up a correlation between movements in economic data and the\ndates of recessions or other outcomes. A second point is that, setting aside the unusual\ncircumstances of the 1981–82 recession, recessions occur when a major shock hits the\neconomy.3 In the absence of a big negative shock, an inversion of the yield curve or a\ntriggering of the Sahm rule doesn’t necessarily mean we are entering a recession.\nThird, recession rules typically pick up demand-driven recessions. But this is not\nwhy unemployment is rising now. GDP forecasts for the current quarter all show solid\ngrowth, labor market data show lay off rates are stable, and consumer spending is\ngrowing at a healthy rate. These data suggest demand is fairly strong. Instead, most of\nthe increase in the unemployment rate is from workers entering the labor force and not\nfinding jobs right away. So, the recent rise in the unemployment rate appears to be more\nof a supply-side-driven phenomenon, not demand driven.\nAnd lastly, it should be clear to everyone that many pre-pandemic economic\nrelationships have not proven to be good policy guides post-pandemic. Reliance on old\nlessons from inverted yield curves to predict a recession, a Phillips curve to predict\n3 The 1981–82 recession was triggered by tight monetary policy in an effort to fight mounting inflation.\nFor more information about this recession, see Federal Reserve History,\nhttps://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/recession-of-1981-82.\n\n- 6 -\ninflation, or a flat Beveridge curve to predict the movement in the unemployment rate\nhave all led to mistaken economic forecasts.\nWhile I don’t see the recent data pointing to a recession, I do see some downside\nrisk to employment that I will be watching closely. But at this point, I believe there is\nsubstantial evidence that the economy retains the strength and momentum to keep\ngrowing, supported by an appropriate loosening of monetary policy.\nLet me now turn to the outlook for inflation. With the labor market cooling, it\ndoesn’t surprise me that wage growth has slowed to a pace consistent with the FOMC’s\nprice-stability goal, and this is supporting ongoing progress toward that objective. The\nemployment cost index grew at an annualized rate of 3.5 percent from March to June, and\nthe 12-month change was 3.9 percent for private sector workers, the lowest since late\n2021.4 Average hourly earnings, reported in today’s jobs report, rose at a three-month\nannualized pace of 3.8 percent in August, the same as the 12-month change.\nInflation in July continued to show progress toward the FOMC’s goal. The price\nindex for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), the Committee’s preferred inflation\nmeasure, increased at a monthly pace of 0.2 percent in July for both total and core PCE\ninflation. Core PCE inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is a good\nguide to underlying inflation, and it increased 2.7 percent over the past 12 months. Given\nthe downward trajectory of monthly readings, I also look at the 6- and 3-month\nannualized rate. These stand at 2.6 percent and 1.7 percent, respectively. These numbers\nare good news and suggest that our restrictive policy stance has put us on the right path to\nattain our 2 percent inflation target.\n4 The employment cost index is a valuable measure of compensation growth because it covers non-wage\nbenefits and accounts for shifts in the shares of workers in different occupations and industries.\n\n- 7 -\nLooking across the components of inflation, one can see the breadth of the\ndisinflation. Over 50 percent of categories in the total and core market baskets had\nannualized monthly inflation less than 2.5 percent in August. In fact, the index of core\ngoods prices has reverted to its historical pattern of slight deflation, reflecting normalized\nsupply after the disruptions of the pandemic as well as ongoing technological and\nproductivity advances. Meanwhile, services price inflation has slowed as wage growth\nhas slowed, since labor is a large input for much of the service sector. Overall, I see\nsignificant and ongoing progress toward the FOMC’s inflation goal that I expect will\ncontinue over the remainder of this year.\nNow let me discuss the implications of this outlook for monetary policy. As I\nsaid at the outset, considering the achieved and continuing progress on inflation and\nmoderation in the labor market, I believe the time has come to lower the target range for\nthe federal funds rate at our upcoming meeting. Reducing the policy rate now is\nconsistent with many versions of the Taylor rule, which suggest reducing the policy rate\nis appropriate given the data in hand.\nFurthermore, I do not expect this first cut to be the last. With inflation and\nemployment near our longer-run goals and the labor market moderating, it is likely that a\nseries of reductions will be appropriate. I believe there is sufficient room to cut the\npolicy rate and still remain somewhat restrictive to ensure inflation continues on the path\nto our 2 percent target.\nDetermining the appropriate pace at which to reduce policy restrictiveness will be\nchallenging. Choosing a slower pace of rate cuts gives time to gradually assess whether\nthe neutral rate has in fact risen, but at the risk of moving too slowly and putting the labor\n\n- 8 -\nmarket at risk. Cutting the policy rate at a faster pace means a greater likelihood of\nachieving a soft landing but at the risk of overshooting on rate cuts if the neutral rate has\nin fact risen above its pre-pandemic level. This would cause an undesired loosening of\nmonetary policy.\nDetermining the pace of rate cuts and ultimately the total reduction in the policy\nrate are decisions that lie in the future. As of today, I believe it is important to start the\nrate cutting process at our next meeting. If subsequent data show a significant\ndeterioration in the labor market, the FOMC can act quickly and forcefully to adjust\nmonetary policy. I am open-minded about the size and pace of cuts, which will be based\non what the data tell us about the evolution of the economy, and not on any pre-\nconceived notion of how and when the Committee should act. If the data supports cuts at\nconsecutive meetings, then I believe it will be appropriate to cut at consecutive meetings.\nIf the data suggests the need for larger cuts, then I will support that as well. I was a big\nadvocate of front-loading rate hikes when inflation accelerated in 2022, and I will be an\nadvocate of front-loading rate cuts if that is appropriate. Those decisions will be\ndetermined by new data and how it adds to the totality of the data and shapes my\nunderstanding of economic conditions. While I expect that these cuts will be done\ncarefully as the economy and employment continue to grow, in the context of stable\ninflation, I stand ready to act promptly to support the economy as needed.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n12:30 p.m. EST (9:30 a.m. PST)\nFebruary 10, 2023\nThoughts on the Crypto Ecosystem\nRemarks by\nChristopher J. Waller\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nDigital Money, Decentralized Finance, and the Puzzle of Crypto\nThe Global Interdependence Center\nLa Jolla, California\nFebruary 10, 2023\n\nThanks to the conference organizers for inviting me to participate today. It is great to be\nback at a Global Interdependence Center conference. Given recent events in crypto, it is\ncertainly timely to have a day of discussions related to digital assets.1\nBefore diving into today’s talks, which will touch on various parts of the crypto\necosystem, I’d like to clearly define some concepts to ensure we’re all talking about the same\nthings. I think of the crypto ecosystem as consisting of three parts:\na crypto-asset, which generally refers to any digital asset implemented using\no\ncryptographic techniques that is being traded;\na database management protocol used to record trades, commonly referred to as\no\nthe blockchain, which includes both permissioned and permissionless distributed\nledger technologies; and\ntechnology that directly facilitates trading crypto-assets; this includes smart\no\ncontracts and tokenization as a form of data privacy.\nThe latter two parts may facilitate the trading of crypto-assets, but also have much\nbroader applications.\nFirst, let’s consider distributed ledger technology. The technology is simply a database\nmanagement protocol that has various permissions regarding who can write to the database and\nwho can read the database. Although this technology is fundamental for the creation of crypto-\nassets, there is nothing in this technology that restricts it to being used solely in the crypto\necosystem. In fact, distributed ledger technology is being explored to potentially address a wide\nrange of data management problems.\n1 The views expressed here are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of my colleagues on the Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n- 2 -\nNext, there are various technologies related to crypto-assets. One is the use of smart\ncontracts in peer-to-peer trading. Smart contracts also can be used in conjunction with a\ncentralized data management protocol to automate the execution of certain transactions in non-\ncrypto-assets. For example, over time, they could be used to speed up the clearance and\nsettlement of securities transactions. Another emerging technology is tokenization. In any trade\nof assets, there are issues regarding how much personal information you need to provide to\nconduct the trade. For example, some personal information is needed to protect against the\npossibility of anonymous trading, which can promote money laundering. Tokenization, when\ncombined with data vaults to securely store personal information, can be used to trade objects in\na way that protects one’s identity from being exploited for profit. While these technological\ndevelopments are still in their infancy, they have potential applications beyond the crypto\necosystem that could lead to substantial productivity enhancements in other industries.\nThis leaves us with the crypto-assets themselves. The question is, why would someone\nhold such an asset? What is the value proposition of such an asset? The answer isn’t new or\nunique, but rather is based on economic relationships that result in objects having value. One\nreason objects have value is because of their intrinsic properties. For example, the value of corn\nderives in part from the fact that it can be used for food or fuel, or in some cases for\nThanksgiving centerpieces. Intuition suggests that if an object has no intrinsic value, then the\nprice of that object should be zero—why pay for something that has no fundamental value?\nShockingly, it turns out that objects may be valued well above what their intrinsic properties\nwould suggest. Since Paul Samuelson’s seminal work in 1958 on intertemporal consumption\nsmoothing, economists have known that an intrinsically useless object can trade at a positive\n\n- 3 -\nprice.2 Such an object’s value is driven purely by belief. If I believe someone will pay a\npositive price for this object in the future, then I may be willing to pay a positive price now,\ncarry it across time, and sell it when I need to consume other goods and services. Samuelson\nreferred to this concept as “the social contrivance of money.”\nWhile an intrinsically useless object can trade at a positive price, we also know that there\nis always a second equilibrium price for this object, which is zero. What if one day, beliefs\nchange and I no longer believe that someone will pay me for this object in the future? Then I\nclearly shouldn’t pay anything for it today, so its price goes to zero.\nThere are many intrinsically useless objects that still have value. Consider things like\nbaseball cards and celebrity autographs, which are pieces of cardboard and paper with pictures or\nscribbles on them. Based on their fundamental properties, these things have little to no intrinsic\nvalue, yet can be in high demand and command staggering prices. What happens if one day, no\none wants to collect baseball cards? As valuable as they are today, they wouldn’t be worth\nmuch, if anything.\nThis brings us to crypto-assets. To me, a crypto-asset is nothing more than a speculative\nasset, like a baseball card. If people believe others will buy it from them in the future at a\npositive price, then it will trade at a positive price today. If not, its price will go to zero. If\npeople want to hold such an asset, then go for it. I wouldn’t do it, but I don’t collect baseball\ncards, either. However, if you buy crypto-assets and the price goes to zero at some point, please\ndon’t be surprised and don’t expect taxpayers to socialize your losses.\nThe upshot of this is that crypto-assets are risky and many of the firms dealing in them\nare in their infancy. That has come to bear in the past year as several prominent crypto-related\n2 Paul Samuelson, “An Exact Consumption-Loan Model of Interest with or without the Social Contrivance of\nMoney,” Journal of Political Economy, vol. LXVI (December 1958): 467–482.\n\n- 4 -\nfirms have filed for bankruptcy, including payment platforms, exchanges, crypto lenders, and\nhedge funds. The declines in crypto-asset values and associated business failures have led to\nmany investors in the crypto industry getting hurt. As I mentioned in a speech last summer,\nsurveys conducted indicated that somewhere between 12 and 20 percent of U.S. adults have\nowned, traded, or used crypto-assets.3 As losses mount, the debate is turning to whether there\nshould be better investor protections in place. But even institutional investors, with significant\nresources to conduct due diligence of investments, have felt the pain of the so-called crypto\nwinter. For example, it has been reported that at least 15 public pension funds, which manage\npublic employee retirement funds, had investments in the now-bankrupt crypto-asset exchange,\nFTX.4\nWhile I don’t care if people take on risky investments or engage in risky business\nventures, banks and other financial intermediaries must engage in any activity they do in a safe\nand sound manner. I’m supportive of prudent innovation in the financial system, while at the\nsame time concerned about banks engaging in activities that present a heightened risk of fraud\nand scams, legal uncertainties, and the prevalence of inaccurate and misleading financial\ndisclosures. As with any customer in any industry, a bank engaging with crypto customers\nwould have to be very clear about the customers’ business models, risk-management systems,\nand corporate governance structures to ensure that the bank is not left holding the bag if there is a\ncrypto meltdown. And banks considering engaging in crypto-asset-related activities face a\n3 Christopher J. Waller, “Risk in the Crypto Markets” (remarks at the SNB-CIF Conference on Cryptoassets and\nFinancial Innovation, Zurich, Switzerland, June 3, 2022),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20220603a.htm.\n4 “Have Pensions Lost Money on FTX?,” Equable.org, December 1, 2022, https://equable.org/have-pensions-lost-\nmoney-on-ftx/.\n\n- 5 -\ncritical task to meet the “know your customer” and “anti-money laundering” requirements,\nwhich they in no way are allowed to ignore.\nSo far, spillovers to other parts of the financial system from the stress in the crypto\nindustry have been minimal. The lack of spillovers to date may be attributable in part to the\nrelatively limited number of interconnections between the crypto ecosystem and the banking\nsystem. While it is critical that we ensure that the financial stability risks associated with crypto-\nassets are mitigated, it is important that we keep the various parts of the crypto ecosystem\ndistinct in our minds as the debate about if and how to regulate crypto rolls on. Doing so will\nensure we do not unduly limit the development and potential future uses of the positive features\nof the crypto ecosystem.\nWith that, I’d be happy to answer some questions.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n7:35 p.m. EST (6:35 p.m. CST)\nFebruary 22, 2024\nWhat’s the Rush?\nRemarks by\nChristopher J. Waller\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nFinding Forward Speaker Series\nUniversity of St. Thomas\nOpus College of Business\nMinneapolis, MN\nFebruary 22, 2024\n\nThank you, Dean Dunham and the University of St. Thomas for the opportunity to\nspeak to you today.1 Given that this event is co-sponsored by the Notre Dame Club of\nMinnesota, and I taught at Notre Dame for 13 years, I will lead off with this thought: Go\nIrish!\nWhen I last spoke on January 16, the data we had received up to that point was\nvery good—three- and six-month measures of core personal consumption expenditures\n(PCE) inflation were running right at 2 percent, which is our goal for total inflation, the\nlabor market was cooling but still healthy, and real gross domestic product (GDP) was\nlikewise growing but expected to moderate in the fourth quarter. I argued then that the\ndata was “almost as good as it gets.” And I argued that because the economy was doing\nso well, we could take our time and collect more data to ensure that inflation was on a\nsustainable 2 percent path. There was no rush to cut rates any time soon.\nSince then, we received data on fourth quarter GDP as well as January data on job\ngrowth and consumer product index (CPI) inflation. All three reports came in hotter than\nexpected. GDP growth came in at 3.3 percent, well above forecasts. Jobs grew by\n353,000, well over forecasts of less than 200,000, and monthly core CPI inflation came in\nat 0.4 percent, which was much higher than it had been for the previous six months.\nSo, the data that we have received since my last speech has reinforced my view\nthat we need to verify that the progress on inflation we saw in the last half of 2023 will\ncontinue and this means there is no rush to begin cutting interest rates to normalize\nmonetary policy.\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nLast week’s report on consumer prices in January was a reminder that ongoing\nprogress on inflation is not assured. The uptick in inflation in that report was spread\nwidely among goods and services. This one month of data may have been driven by\nsome odd seasonal factors or outsized increases in housing costs, or it may be a signal\nthat inflation is stickier than we thought and will be harder to bring back down to our\ntarget. We just don’t know yet. While I believe inflation is likely on track to reach 2\npercent in a sustainable manner, I am going to need to see more data to sort out whether\nJanuary’s CPI inflation was more noise than signal. This means waiting longer before I\nhave enough confidence that beginning to cut rates will keep us on a path to 2 percent\ninflation.\nFortunately, the strength of output and employment growth means that there is no\ngreat urgency in easing policy, which I still expect we will do this year. More data, and\nmore time, will tell whether January’s CPI report was just a bump in the road to 2 percent\ninflation. The hotter-than-expected data that we received validates the careful risk\nmanagement approach that Chair Powell has advocated in his recent public appearances.\nAnd, with most data indicating solid economic fundamentals, the risk of waiting a little\nlonger to ease policy is lower than the risk of acting too soon and possibly halting or\nreversing the progress we’ve made on inflation.\nLet me start with the outlook for economic activity, including what we have\nlearned from the latest data. As I mentioned, real GDP grew strongly in the second half\nof 2023 and that momentum has led forecasters to predict continued solid growth in the\nfirst months of 2024. After expanding at a 4.9 percent pace in the third quarter last year\nand at a 3.3 percent clip in the fourth quarter, estimates for the first quarter of 2024 range\n\n- 3 -\nfrom 1.7 percent for the Blue Chip average of private sector forecasters to 2.9 percent for\nthe Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow model, which is based on the data in hand.\nAmong that recent data is the Institute for Supply Management’s January survey\nof purchasing managers. For non-manufacturing businesses, the index increased to a\nlevel consistent with moderate growth. Meanwhile, the manufacturing index, while still\ncontractionary, rose to its highest level since October 2022, with rising orders and\nproduction, continued improvement in delivery times, and inventory positions among\ncustomers all pointing to favorable growth in demand.\nWhile the balance of the evidence is that growth has continued at a moderate rate,\nseveral indicators suggest some slowing. Retail sales fell 0.8 percent in January, after\nrising 0.4 percent in December. While some of this drop is likely due to bad weather and\ntechnical issues related to seasonal adjustment, it was a surprise. It may indicate that\nconsumer spending which ran higher than I expected in the second half of 2023 is finally\nshowing the effects of higher interest rates and a depletion of excess savings.\nI will be watching to see whether spending stays robust. A positive sign is that\nconsumer confidence has continued to rise. One reason for that might be the labor\nmarket, whose surprising strength continued in January. As I mentioned, the U.S.\neconomy created 353,000 jobs in January, and 333,000 in December, well above the\n255,000 a month average in 2023 and also well above what most estimate to be consistent\nwith population growth. Job growth in January was widespread across different sectors\nof the economy. There were job increases in three large sectors that have faced sharp\nlabor shortages: health care and social assistance, leisure and hospitality, and state and\nlocal government. But there were also significant job increases in parts of the economy\n\n- 4 -\nthat tend to rise and fall with changes in the pace of economic activity—manufacturing,\nconstruction, retail trade and professional business services. The gains in manufacturing\nand professional services were at or near the highest posted in the previous 12 months.\nUnemployment was steady at 3.7 percent, nearly as low as it has been in 50 years.\nAnd while there were signs of slackening demand for labor over the course of 2023, those\nsigns haven’t been so clear recently. The 12-month growth rate in average hourly\nearnings fell from 4.7 percent in July to 4.3 percent in December and then rose to 4.5\npercent in January. I have been focused on the number of job openings for the past two\nyears as an indicator of labor demand. Job openings fell from 12 million in April 2022 to\n9 million in December 2023. We won’t get data on job openings in January for a couple\nof weeks, but openings unexpectedly ticked up in December, and the rate of people\nquitting their jobs held steady, both indications that moderation in the labor market may\nhave stalled. One data point does not make a trend, and these strong job reports come\nafter a year of more or less steady loosening in the labor market, with supply increasing\nrelative to demand. But it does tend to support the idea of continued moderate growth in\neconomic activity. I will be looking for signs of continued loosening in the labor market,\nwhich by most measures is still considerably tighter than it was before the pandemic.\nEverything about the outlook that I have mentioned so far is important for what it\ntells us about continued progress toward the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC)\n2 percent inflation goal. Last week’s high reading on CPI inflation may just be a bump in\nthe road, but it also may be a warning that the considerable progress on inflation over the\npast year may be stalling. While 12-month CPI inflation improved a bit to 3.1 percent, it\nwas higher than expected, as was the 3.9 percent rise in core inflation that excludes\n\n- 5 -\nvolatile food and energy prices. Both the three-month and six-month changes in core CPI\nincreased in January. The FOMC’s preferred inflation gauge, based on personal\nconsumption expenditures, isn’t out yet for January, but an estimate factoring in producer\nprices is that core PCE inflation rose to a 12-month rate of 2.8 percent, and three- and\nsix- month rates rose to 2.4 percent and 2.5 percent respectively.\nWhile this uptick isn’t a welcome development, let’s take a deep breath and put it\ninto perspective. A year ago, core CPI inflation was 6.4 percent and core PCE inflation\nwas 4.9 percent. Inflation has fallen by more than half since then, and the progress\ncontinued all the way through December. Also, there was good news in the annual\nseasonal adjustment factors this month to the past year of inflation data. In early 2023,\nthese revisions had revealed that inflation in 2022 was a lot worse than initial estimates,\nand I was worried this would happen again this year. But the revisions on February 9 did\nnot change the picture of a dramatic improvement in inflation in 2023. It is comforting to\nknow that the progress we made was real and not a mirage.\nIn judging whether January inflation was noise or a sign of slowing progress, one\nthing I will be looking at are measures of wages and compensation. I mentioned the\nincrease in average hourly earnings last month. It is true that there was some moderation\nin average wages over the second half of last year, but I still consider them to be\nsomewhat elevated to achieve our 2 percent goal. Other measures of compensation show\nslow but continuing progress toward that target. The Bureau of Labor Statistics’\nquarterly Employment Cost Index showed moderation in both salaries and bonuses in the\nfinal three months of 2023. And the Atlanta Fed’s Wage Growth Tracker continued its\nvery gradual decline in January. Payroll costs are the largest expense for most\n\n- 6 -\nbusinesses, and I will be watching to see whether wages and other compensation continue\nto moderate or if they become a factor preventing progress toward our inflation goal.\nWhile I focus on the overall inflation numbers, it is still useful to look how the\ndifferent components of inflation have moved. A big factor in the improvement of\ninflation over the past year has come from goods prices which fell during 2023. Goods\nprices represent almost 25 percent of core CPI inflation. Even at times of very low\ninflation, goods deflation is modest in a growing economy, so one question is whether\nthis contribution to progress on inflation will continue.\nAnother big contributor to CPI inflation is the cost of housing services, which\nmeasures the estimated costs of renting or the equivalent for owning a home. Housing\ncost inflation represents about 45 percent of core CPI inflation. There was a fairly steady\nmoderation in housing services inflation in 2023, as the slowing in market rent increases\nsince 2022 began to gradually show through to the housing services price index. But we\nsaw an unexpected jump in housing services inflation in the January CPI data. I plan to\nbe watching to see if housing costs continue to run at a higher rate than expected.\nThe remaining component of core CPI inflation is services excluding housing.\nThis category is about 30 percent of the index. Inflation in this category moderated over\nthe course of 2023 but in January there was a broad-based increase. Since business\nservices are heavily reliant on labor input, this segment of prices is naturally significantly\ninfluenced by labor compensation, such as wages and benefits. So, one question is\nwhether relatively elevated labor costs prevent moderation in this large component of\ninflation.\n\n- 7 -\nAs I consider all these aspects of inflation, I have to say that I see predominately\nupside risks to my general expectation that inflation will continue to move toward the\nFOMC’s 2 percent goal. On the flip side, I see little reason to expect that inflation will\nrun below 2 percent for an extended period given the strong economic fundamentals we\nare observing in GDP and employment. For these reasons, I am going to need to see a\ncouple more months of inflation data to be sure that January was a fluke and that we are\nstill on track to price stability.\nThis brings me to the implications of this outlook for monetary policy. Let me\npause here and say that typically the FOMC considers easing policy only when there are\nfairly clear signs that the economy could be in or close to a recession. But, based on the\npicture of the economy that I have painted today, it should be as clear to you as it is to me\nthat there are no indications of an imminent recession. By that I don’t mean that the\npicture of the economy is crystal clear. Sifting through the data, I see evidence of\nongoing robust growth in output and employment, but also some signs that growth may\nbe slowing. One thing that is clear is that by many metrics, the U.S. economy is healthy\nand well positioned to continue growing and adding jobs. This is a good outcome, and\nour job is not to stop it but rather to ensure that economic fundamentals grow in a manner\nconsistent with inflation at 2 percent.\nThat makes the decision to be patient on beginning to ease policy simpler than it\nmight be. I am going to need to see at least another couple more months of inflation data\nbefore I can judge whether January was a speed bump or a pothole. I will be watching\nwages and compensation, and the components of inflation that I outlined today to see\nwhether broad progress on inflation continues or stalls. I will also be monitoring\n\n- 8 -\neconomic activity and employment, attentive as always to any unexpected warning signs\nof a recession, but also paying close attention to whether growth in each is consistent\nwith continued progress toward 2 percent inflation.\nI still expect it will be appropriate sometime this year to begin easing monetary\npolicy, but the start of policy easing and number of rate cuts will depend on the incoming\ndata. I likewise don’t know whether the economy and employment will continue to\nbarrel ahead, or whether both will slow in a manner that I expect will support progress\ntoward 2 percent inflation. But the upshot is that I believe the Committee can wait a little\nlonger to ease monetary policy.\nCommentators often argue that by delaying rate cuts for a meeting or two we run\nthe risk of having overtight policy that can cause a recession in the near term. While I\nfind this narrative to be interesting, I also find it to be somewhat puzzling. The reason is\nas follows. When rates are going up, most of the discussion is on the long and variable\nlags of monetary policy with rate hikes not having a serious impact on the economy for\n18 months or more. But when it comes to delaying rate cuts for a short period of time,\nwe supposedly risk suddenly driving the economy into a recession. This supposed\nasymmetry in the lagged effects of rate hikes versus rate cuts is puzzling and not\nsupported by any economic model I am aware of.\nHow do we square the circle on this narrative? I think the explanation is that, as I\nnoted earlier, rate cuts tend to occur after major economic shocks that cause, or threaten\nto cause, a recession. Historically, large and rapid rate cuts are highly correlated with\nrecessions, and this leads to the inference that policy was too tight and actually caused a\nrecession. But it is very difficult to untangle the effects of tight monetary policy from a\n\n- 9 -\nmajor economic shock when looking at past U.S. recessions. We do not have the\ncounterfactual of what impact delayed rate cuts would have had on the economy in the\nabsence of the economic shock. My conjecture is that, in the absence of a major\neconomic shock, delaying rate cuts by a few months should not have a substantial impact\non the real economy in the near term. And, I think I have shown that acting too soon\ncould squander our progress in inflation and risk considerable harm to the economy.\nIn conclusion, the strength of the economy and the recent data we have received\non inflation mean it is appropriate to be patient, careful, methodical, deliberative – pick\nyour favorite synonym. Whatever word you pick, they all translate to one idea: What’s\nthe rush?",

So, I will try to keep this short to leave enough time for a robust\ndiscussion afterward, which I hope my remarks will generate.\nMy topic tonight is “The Unstable Phillips Curve.”1 This is not intended to be a\ndeep academic analysis but rather to present some thoughts for discussion. I know that I\nam walking into the Phillips curve lion’s den, given the number of researchers in the Bay\nArea who work on Phillips curve estimation. But in my current job, I am used to people\ndisagreeing with me.\nThe Phillips curve, a relationship between price or wage inflation and some\nmeasure of economic slack, has been the foundation of monetary policy for decades. A\ncommon way to estimate it is to look at output price inflation and the unemployment rate.\nOne theory, or story, is that as aggregate demand increases, labor demand will increase as\nwell. As a result, prices of goods and services will rise and firms will hire more workers,\nas long as there is some stickiness in nominal wages. Consequently, this story implies\nthat the unemployment rate will fall. So, there is a negative relationship between price\ninflation and unemployment.\nAnother story, based on the New Keynesian model, is that monopolistically\ncompetitive firms set prices for some period of time. Firms may have “sticky prices”\nbecause of menu costs. That is, firms face costs to adjust their prices and so choose to\nreset their prices only when the benefits outweigh the costs. Because firms are not\n1 The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nidentical, only a share of firms adjust their prices each period. So, when aggregate\ndemand increases, firms with set prices agree to supply the goods demanded at their\ncurrent prices. Firms that find it worthwhile to adjust their prices will increase their\nprices. As a result, inflation will arise from the firms that adjusted their prices.\nMeanwhile, higher employment will come from the sticky price firms, and, implicitly,\nhigher employment goes along with lower unemployment. Once again, we obtain a\nnegative relationship between output price inflation and unemployment. The slope of\nthis relationship hinges on the fraction of firms adjusting their prices in response to the\naggregate demand shock. Put another way, the frequency of price changes determines\nthe slope of the Phillips curve.\nIn both these stories, expectations of future inflation play a critical role. In the\nsticky nominal wage story, workers will seek to maintain their real wages by setting their\nwage demands based on what they think future inflation will be. In the New Keynesian\nmodel, firms set their output prices based on what they think aggregate price inflation\nwill be in the future, and how often and at what pace they expect to change prices.\nRegardless of whether you think nominal wages are sticky or output prices are sticky,\ninflation expectations play a critical role in how unemployment responds to changes in\nthe inflation rate.\nThis explanation is all about the short run. In either model, in the long run,\nnominal rigidities, or stickiness, disappear and expectations of inflation converge to trend\n\n- 3 -\ninflation. As a result, in most models of nominal rigidities the long-run Phillips curve is\nvertical.2\nWhat do economic data tell us about this relationship? We all know that if you\nsimply plot inflation against the unemployment rate over the past 50 years, you get a\nblob. There does not appear to be any statistically significant correlation between the two\nseries. In the 1980s and 1990s, so-called freshwater macroeconomists, who tended to\nwork at universities in the middle of the country, argued the data showed that stories\nabout nominal wage or price stickiness were simply wrong and we should quit talking\nabout Phillips curves of any type. Diehard believers in the Phillips curve, the saltwater\neconomists working on the East and West coasts, argued that the data blob was the result\nof unstable inflation expectations. If inflation expectations were not stable, then the\nPhillips curve would shift around in such a way that you could not observe the true\nrelationship in the data.\nWhat would cause inflation expectations to be unstable? Kydland and Prescott\n(1977) provided an explanation, later popularized by Barro and Gordon (1983), that\nblamed the central bank. If the central bank’s promises to keep inflation low were not\ncredible, then private agents’ inflation expectations would be different than what the\ncentral bank promised, which in turn would cause the Phillips curve to shift around. As a\nresult, the idea that the central bank had to make credible promises to keep inflation low\nbecame a bedrock principle of central banking that holds to this day.\n2 But there is a debate that the long-run Phillips curve is positively sloped. Friedman (1977) provides an\nintuitive explanation for a positive slope while Berentsen, Menzio and Wright (2011) derive it formally in a\nNew Monetarist model.\n\n- 4 -\nInflation targeting provided a framework for making promises of low inflation\ncredible, and since the late 1990s it has proved to be very successful in practice. With a\ncentral bank strongly committed to inflation targeting, promises to keep inflation at 2\npercent are credible in large part because the central bank is observed taking action to\nkeep it near 2 percent, regardless of what is happening to the unemployment rate. When\nthese promises are credible, the Phillips curve should be relatively flat.\nWhat have we seen in the recent data? Let’s consider a Phillips curve based on\nthe price index for personal consumption expenditures, which is the Federal Open Market\nCommittee’s (FOMC) preferred measure. As shown in figure 1, the Phillips curve was\nvery flat for the 20-plus years before the pandemic, consistent with the story that the\nFederal Reserve was credible at keeping inflation low.3\nThen in the spring of 2021, after more than a decade of hibernation, inflation\ncame roaring back to life. As the economy recovered from the pandemic shutdowns,\ninflation increased each month of the year and was running at more than double the Fed’s\n2 percent target throughout the latter half of 2021. Meanwhile, unemployment fell quite\nrapidly in 2021, from 6.3 percent at the start of the year to 3.9 percent in December,\nwhich was surprising given the long, slow recoveries after recent recessions. Based on\nthe flatness of the Phillips curve in recent decades, some commentators argued that\nunemployment would have to rise dramatically to bring inflation back down to 2 percent.\nOthers argued that, based on analysis of the Beveridge curve, inflation could be brought\n3 The FOMC began using an explicit 2 percent inflation target in 2012, but before then it was presumed to\nbe targeting 2 percent.\n\n- 5 -\ndown without a significant rise in unemployment, although this conjecture was not\nwithout controversy.4\nBut considering the data for 2021, as shown in figure 2, the Phillips curve\nsuddenly looked relatively steep. That is, the labor market became extremely tight as the\nU.S. economy emerged from pandemic lockdowns. Figure 3 shows that since January\n2022, the Phillips curve is essentially vertical: The unemployment rate has hovered\naround 3.6 percent, and inflation has varied from 7 percent (in June) to 5.3 percent (in\nDecember).\nThe recent experience raises the question: What happened to the Phillips curve\nthat it is acting so differently now than in the pre-pandemic period? Freshwater\nmacroeconomists would once again argue that this difference shows the Phillips curve is\na statistical anomaly and should not be used as a foundational element guiding monetary\npolicy. Having grown up in the profession surrounded by freshwater macroeconomists, I\nam very sympathetic to this argument.\nBut setting that view aside for now, let’s consider the two other possible stories\nI’ve mentioned to explain the data. The first story relies on inflation expectations\nbecoming unanchored and causing the short-run Phillips curve to shift around. This\ntheory is illustrated in figure 4. There is a vertical long-run Phillips curve anchored at\nU*, which is the rate of unemployment that occurs in the absence of price stickiness, and\nrealized inflation is equal to inflation expectations. And there is a downward sloping\nshort-run Phillips curve that shows a tradeoff between inflation and unemployment due to\n4 See Figura and Waller (2022) for a discussion of how much unemployment necessarily needed to rise to\nbring inflation down toward the FOMC's 2 percent target. This view was not universal, see Blanchard,\nDomas and Summers (2022).\n\n- 6 -\nsome nominal price or wage stickiness in the economy. The short-run Phillips curve\nassumes a given level of inflation expectations. If inflation expectations increase, the\nshort-run Phillips curve shifts up. So, if inflation expectations have increased in recent\nhistory, we would move from a lower to a higher Phillips curve, as shown by the vertical\nshift up in the dots. These shifting dots generate what, on the surface, looks like an\nessentially vertical Phillips curve, thereby matching the 2022 data.\nThe second possible explanation follows from the New Keynesian Phillips curve\nwhere there is a sudden increase in the frequency of price changes.5 In that model, the\nslope of the Phillips curve is determined by the frequency of price changes—the more\noften prices change, the steeper is the Phillips curve. This dynamic is illustrated in figure\n5. An increase in the frequency of price changes steepens the short-run Phillips curve\neven if inflation expectations are well anchored at 2 percent. If in recent years the\nfrequency of price changes has increased, we would move from a flatter to a steeper\nshort-run Phillips curve. On the surface, moving from the blue to red dot, it again looks\nlike an essentially vertical Phillips curve, but just as in the first story, the data are\nshowing us points on different Phillips curves.\nWhat does this suggest about the relationship between inflation and labor market\nslack and the implications for monetary policy? The answer depends on data about\ninflation expectations and the frequency of output price changes. Let’s look at each of\nthese factors.\n5 Hall (2023) suggests that in times of high volatility of price determinants—costs and productivity—, like\naround the time of the pandemic, firms will adjust their prices more frequently than in other times.\n\n- 7 -\nFigure 6 reproduces two charts on inflation expectations from the Federal\nReserve’s March 2023 Monetary Policy Report.6 The charts show that the behavior of\ninflation expectations depends on the data one uses to measure those expectations.7 The\nleft panel reports survey-based measures, while the right panel captures market-based\ninflation expectations over a variety of time horizons.\nOn the left, we see that shorter-run inflation expectations followed observed\ninflation up and down in recent years, with a notable increase in 2021 before reversing\ncourse in 2022 and into early 2023. But inflation expectations over a longer horizon\nremained within the range of values seen in the years before the pandemic and appear\nbroadly consistent with the FOMC’s longer-run 2 percent inflation objective. Similarly,\nin the right panel, market-based measures of longer-term inflation compensation are also\nbroadly in line with readings seen in the years before the pandemic. So, overall,\nmeasures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained contained, while shorter-\nterm expectations had moved up in 2021 and have partially reversed their earlier\nincreases. These data suggest that changes in inflation can be associated with an\nunanchoring of inflation expectations if we believe price-setting behavior is influenced\nby changes in shorter-term inflation expectations.\nLet’s now look at the data on the frequency of output price changes in 2021 and\n2022. Preliminary work by Montag and Villar Vallenas (2023) uses U.S. Consumer Price\nIndex micro-data to examine about 90,000 individual prices each month and determines\n6 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2023), Monetary Policy Report (Washington:\nBoard of Governors, March),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/20230303_mprfullreport.pdf.\n7 Gorodnichenko (2023) recently argued at the U.S. Monetary Policy Forum that inflation expectations of\nhouseholds and firms have become unanchored.\n\n- 8 -\nif there was a change and, if so, was the change an increase or decrease. Figure 7\nsummarizes their findings. The monthly price change frequency (the black line)\nincreased from about 10 percent of the sample in 2019 to around 20 percent by the end of\n2021 and held around that level in 2022. The increase in price change frequency is\nprimarily driven by firms upwardly adjusting their prices (the red dashed line) during this\nperiod. Furthermore, anecdotal evidence I have received from market contacts is\nconsistent with the view that firms were quicker to change prices over 2021-22 than they\nwere in the previous decade. So, hard and soft data suggest that the frequency of price\nchanges is contributing to what looks like a steep Phillips curve in recent years.\nOther than providing for a fun academic discussion, what does this analysis mean\nfor monetary policy makers? If unanchored inflation expectations were driving what\nlooks like a shifting Phillips curve, this would be extremely problematic for central\nbankers because it could require dramatic actions by the FOMC to lower inflation\nexpectations to shift the Phillips curve back down. In current circumstances, one would\nneed to believe it is shorter-term expectations that matter for price setters. If this belief is\ntrue, I take some comfort in the fact that short-term inflation expectations have moved\ndown reasonably fast over the past year. However, I am not sure how much weight to put\non this story.\nThe higher-frequency-of-price-changes story is a more encouraging guide for\ncentral bankers. A steep Phillips curve means inflation can be brought down quickly\nwith relatively little pain in terms of higher unemployment. Recent data are consistent\nwith this story.\n\n- 9 -\nTo conclude, it may not surprise you all that I like story number two a lot better.\nBut we will need more data to conclude which story is right—which is what a data-\ndependent central bank does to implement appropriate monetary policy. With that, I will\nstop talking, and I look forward to a robust discussion with lots of good arguments telling\nme I am wrong.\nReferences\nRobert J. Barro, David B. Gordon.

While there are\nmany concepts of r*, I interpret it to be the real policy interest rate that is neither\nstimulating nor restricting economic activity with inflation anchored at the central bank’s\ninflation target. In the short term, policymakers must judge whether a given policy\nsetting is restrictive or otherwise, and while this judgment is made with some idea of r*, a\nnumber of factors can influence the economy in the near term so that the current setting\nof policy usually differs from the value of r*. At the same time, policymakers\ncontinually update their view of the appropriate value of r*. Recently, for example,\ndiscussions have focused on whether or not r* has risen, which has important\nimplications for the conduct of monetary policy.\nFor the purposes of this discussion, I am going to be talking about the long-run,\nreal value of r*, when inflation and employment have reached the Federal Open Market\nCommittee’s (FOMC) goals. Because of that, an estimate of r* points toward where\nmonetary policy is headed over the longer run. This is important for policymakers\ndeciding the best way to get there and also for investors and other members of the public\nwho make decisions in the near term based on their expectations of future economic\nconditions.\nMuch has been written on this topic, and different methods have been developed\nto estimate r*. My goal today is not to debate which statistical estimate of r* is best but\nrather describe what I believe are the economic factors behind the secular behavior of r*.\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nIn particular, I want to address two questions. First, what drove the decline in r* over the\npast 40 years? Second, what are the factors that may cause it to rise? I am certain some\nof you will disagree with my answers to these two questions, but that is the nature of\ngood intellectual debate and how we advance our understanding of the world around us.\nOne vital fact about r* is that it is a theoretical concept without any reliable and\nstraightforward way to determine its value. There are economic models that are used to\nestimate the value of r* and also surveys of market participants or policymakers such as\nthe FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections. But r* is not a precise number, unlike\nthe unemployment rate, which can be measured directly. For these reasons, all of the\nmodel and survey estimates come with large degrees of uncertainty.2 That’s why we\nalways need to be humble in citing a numerical value for r*.\nOne thing that is evident from these different estimates, and additionally clear\nbased on the performance of the economy at different policy settings over the past couple\nof decades, is that the value of r* changes over time.3 The change is slow moving, and I\ntend to think of it as related to the movement in factors that we can see affecting the\neconomy over time. Though hard to precisely measure, having some understanding of\nthe current level of r* is a matter of obvious importance for monetary policy, so I will\nfocus today on factors that have contributed to the apparent decline in r* over the past\nseveral decades and look at how they may influence its value going forward.\n2 Estimates from econometric models, whether using macroeconomic data, financial market data, or both,\ntypically exhibit large uncertainty bands for any given study. And even these estimates are sensitive to\nmodel specification, sample period, data revisions, and more. Approaches that emphasize the underlying\ndeterminants of r* also have difficulty in identifying shifts in r* because the important movements in these\nfactors typically occur only at very low frequencies. Information from surveys (at least partially) reflects\nthe estimates from all of these approaches and so cannot speak definitively to movements in r*.\n3 One can see the movement in estimates of r* from the models of Laubach-Williams and Holston-\nLaubach-Williams reported on the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s website at\nhttps://www.newyorkfed.org/research/policy/rstar.\n\n- 3 -\nTo get some indication of how r* has evolved over time, it is helpful to look at the\nreal, or inflation-adjusted, yield of the 10-year Treasury security, the most widely held\nsafe and liquid asset. Let me pause here and explain why this is a good real-world proxy\nfor the theoretical value of r*.\nThink of r* as the level of the real federal funds rate once all the cyclical ups and\ndowns of the economy have been factored out, including near-term policy tightening or\nloosening that sometimes is necessary to move employment and inflation back to the\nFOMC’s goals. Someone buying or selling a 10-year Treasury security must determine\nthe appropriate price (or yield) by thinking about not only the near-term policy rate, but\nalso how the policy rate will evolve over the next 10 years. Thinking about the evolution\nof the policy rate, most forecasts expect near-term shocks to die out and the economy to\nmove toward the FOMC’s goals, so the policy rate—absent future shocks—will move\ntoward and eventually reach r*. This means the 10-year Treasury yield embeds a value\nof r*. Since 10-year Treasury securities are widely traded, their price (and yield) is\nreflective of current market views of the value of r*.4\nWith that stipulated, let’s look at how the real yield on the 10-year Treasury\nsecurity has evolved. In figure 1, I plot two measures. One is a series starting in the\n1980s using the nominal 10-year Treasury yield and subtracting out the Michigan\nsurvey’s view of expected inflation over the next 5 to 10 years (the solid black line). The\nsecond measure is a market-based measure, Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, or\nTIPS, which started trading in the late 1990s (the red dashed line).\n4 The 10-year real Treasury yield is the sum of current and expected real short-term Treasury yields and a\nterm premium. Both near-term real short rates and term premiums that are affected by current economic\nconditions must be taken into consideration when teasing out a value of r* from the 10-year Treasury yield.\n\n-4 -\nThese series clearly show a downward trend in the real yield of the 10-year\nTreasury over most of the period, supporting the idea that r* declined over the past 30 to\n40 years. Looking at the past few years, the two series show a recent increase. This is\nthe source of recent questions about whether r* has risen, which I will address later.\nI want to pause here and show another measure of longer-term interest rates that\nsome people use to gauge the value of r*—the real return on capital. In my view, this is\nnot the appropriate interest rate to use for discussing r* because it includes some measure\nof riskiness of business activity and is not directly related to the stance of monetary\npolicy. As you can see in figure 2, these accounting-based measures of the realized real\nreturn on capital, as measured by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (the black line) or\nresearchers (the blue dashed line), do not show the longer-term downward trend that we\nsaw in the real 10-year Treasury yield. Also, these values have not necessarily moved up\nin the recent past either. I look at these measures of the return on capital and conclude\nthat, unlike the 10-year Treasury, there is no secular decline in the real return to capital.\nOne could argue about how this private return is measured, but recent work, accounting\nfor a myriad of factors, finds only modest changes in this return.5\nThis divergence—the longer-term decline in the real 10-year government yield\nuntil recently and the relatively flat real return on capital—holds across countries. Many\nresearchers have documented the decline in government yields around the world, so I will\n5 See, for example, Ricardo Reis (2023), “The Future Long-Run Level of Interest Rates,” presentation at\nthe SUERF Conference, Vienna, Austria, December, https://www.suerf.org/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2023/09/l_c5ab0bc60ac7929182aadd08703f1ec6_47133_suerf.pdf; and Emmanuel Farhi\nand Francois Gourio (2018), “Accounting for Macro-Finance Trends: Market Power, Intangibles, and Risk\nPremia,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Fall, 147–223, https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/\nuploads/2018/09/Farhi-Gourio_final-draft.pdf.\n\n-5 -\nnot here. Meanwhile, figure 3 shows a chart from a paper by Monge-Naranjo and others\nwhere the median real return on capital (the white line) across countries has been roughly\nsteady since 1980.6 And, in fact, the blue region, which represents the dispersion of this\nreturn across countries, has narrowed over the years.\nTo me, these data raise a very clear question: What are the factors or events that\nhave driven a wedge between these two rates of return, causing the real 10-year yield to\ndecline but the return on capital to be relatively constant? And what does this say about\nr*?\nLet me start by discussing what is not responsible for this difference in yields.7\nFirst, it cannot be caused by longer-run trends in productivity. Trend productivity affects\nthe real return on capital first and foremost. So even if trend productivity growth was\nfalling over time, both rates of return would have fallen. But, clearly, the real return to\ncapital has not fallen over time. So falling productivity growth cannot be an explanation.\nSecond, this difference in yields cannot be the result of declining population\ngrowth. Again, this would also lower the real return to capital since there are fewer\nworkers to use productive capital, which means the existing capital stock is underutilized,\nthereby lowering its real return.\nSo, what drove the decline of the real return on government debt? It is obvious\nthat what makes U.S. government debt different from the real return on capital and other\ninterest rates is its safety and global liquidity. I will briefly discuss several factors that\n6 See Alexander Monge-Naranjo, Juan M. Sánchez, and Raül Santaeulàlia-Llopis (2019), “Natural\nResources and Global Misallocation,” American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics, vol. 11 (April), pp.\n79–126.\n7 For further review of how different factors are at play, see Ricardo J. Caballero, Emmanuel Farhi, and\nPierre-Olivier Gourinchas (2017), “Rents, Technical Change, and Risk Premia Accounting for Secular\nTrends in Interest Rates, Returns on Capital, Earning Yields, and Factor Shares,” American Economic\nReview, vol. 107 (May).\n\n- 6 -\nhave influenced the supply and demand for safe, liquid assets. I will try to make the case\nthat the demand for safe, liquid assets outgrew the supply over the past 40 years, which\ndrove a secular increase in the price of U.S. Treasury securities and, thus, a secular\ndecline in their real yield. At the same time, the safety and liquidity of U.S. Treasury\nsecurities was actually increasing, which made them even more attractive to global\ninvestors.\nTo be clear, I am not focusing on day-to-day movements in interest rates from\nidiosyncratic events that will ultimately unwind. Instead, I am thinking about factors that\nhave long-term consequences for short-term market interest rates and, hence, r*. I will\nalso consider how these factors may be influencing r*’s value today and in the future.\nLet me first explain why I believe the safety of U.S. Treasury securities increased\nover the past 40 years. By this I am not referring to default risk, which has been and will\nbe zero. By “safer” I mean greater stability in the real return from holding U.S.\nTreasuries. I believe this occurred for two reasons. First, from 1980 to 2020 there was a\nsignificant decline in the level and volatility of U.S. inflation. Second, the Great\nModeration during this period meant economic performance in the United States was less\nvolatile, which meant less variability in the monetary policy rate. This lowered the\ninterest rate risk from holding Treasuries. As a result, the opportunity to hold a default-\nfree asset with less risk of inflation and economic volatility made U.S. Treasuries more\nattractive.\nSupport for this proposition comes from looking at the term premium on 10-year\nTreasuries over the past 40 years, as is shown in figure 4. The term premium measures\nthe compensation investors must receive to accept risk from holding Treasuries. As you\n\n- 7 -\ncan see, there is a clear secular decline in the term premium on 10-year Treasuries. I\ninterpret this to mean that the inflation risk and real risk of holding Treasury securities\nmade them safer to hold as time went on.\nNow let me turn to five factors that I believe played a role in causing the demand\nfor safe, liquid assets to grow faster than the supply of these assets, pushing down\nTreasury yields and r*. Some of these factors are contributing to the downward trend in\nU.S. longer-term rates, while others affect global longer-term interest rates more broadly.\nThe first factor is the liberalization and globalization of capital markets starting in\nthe 1990’s. This increased the global demand for safe liquid assets to investors around\nthe world who previously did not have access to U.S. Treasuries. Financial and capital\nmarkets and trade around the world were liberalized, and information technology saw\nadvances that aided the global movement of capital, which resulted in an explosion of\ncross-border finance. For example, the share of external financial claims and external\nfinancial liabilities as a share of annual global gross domestic product grew from around\n100 percent in 1990 to over 400 percent today. That change reflects the fact that an\nincreasingly large share of the world’s wealth is invested abroad, much of it in U.S. debt,\nincluding Treasury securities. The rise in foreign official and private purchases of\nTreasury securities resulted in an increase in the price of U.S. Treasury securities, driving\ndown yields.\nThe second factor causing demand for Treasury securities to grow more than\nsupply was the large buildup of official reserves that started after the reforms that\nfollowed the 1998 financial crisis in Asia. One consequence of removing capital controls\nand other financial market liberalization in other countries over the past 30 years has been\n\n- 8 -\nto make foreign governments more vulnerable to sudden capital outflows and financial\ncrises. Many countries have responded by building up their foreign exchange reserves to\nhelp weather such stress. Global foreign exchange reserves have increased from around\n$1 trillion in the early 1990s to $12 trillion today.\nNotwithstanding the drumbeat of warnings from some that the U.S. dollar is in\ndanger of losing its primacy in global trade and finance, it remains by a very large margin\nthe world’s reserve currency. U.S. government debt, likewise, remains the primary form\nof low-risk asset, which is reflected in the huge stock of Treasury securities held as\nforeign exchange reserves around the world. The resulting demand for Treasury\nsecurities has contributed to pushing down yields and, thus, lowering r*.\nThe third factor driving prices up and yields down for Treasuries and similarly\naffecting r* is sovereign wealth funds. In addition to foreign exchange reserve holdings,\nsovereign wealth funds from some economies, especially those rich in natural resources,\nhave become an increasingly important way for governments to invest abroad and\ndiversify their national wealth. They are an increasingly significant force in global\nfinancial markets. Although sovereign wealth funds are diverse in their holdings, U.S.\ngovernment debt is typically a sizable share of these funds. Sovereign wealth funds have\ngrown from $1 trillion in assets in 2000 to $11 trillion last year, and a lot of those assets\nare presumably in U.S. Treasuries. For example, Norway’s sovereign wealth fund\nholdings of Treasuries grew from $5.6 billion to $132.4 billion over this period.8 The\ngrowth in Treasury holdings by sovereign wealth funds has clearly contributed to the\ndecline in Treasury yields.\n8 See Global SWF’s website at https://globalswf.com.\n\n- 9 -\nThe fourth factor that is thought to have influenced Treasury yields and r* over\nthe past couple of decades is the aging of the population in the United States and around\nthe world. The argument here is that as people move past their prime working years,\ntheir demand increases for safe, liquid investments that ensure their principal is preserved\nfor their needs in retirement. U.S. Treasuries fill this need. Aging has been driven by the\nfact that Americans are living longer, and another big factor has been the aging of the\nlarge baby-boom generation, born between 1946 and 1964. The share of the U.S.\npopulation aged 65 or older has increased from 12 percent in 1990 to 17 percent today,\nwhich is 1 in 6 people. There is evidence that the large number of baby boomers who are\nretired or planning to do so soon has boosted demand for Treasury securities.9 Outside\nthe United States, population aging is accelerating even faster.\nThe fifth factor that increased the demand for Treasuries came from many new\nfinancial regulations implemented after the 2008 global financial crisis. Regulators in the\nUnited States and abroad increasingly wanted banks to hold safer and more liquid assets\nas part of their balance sheets. For example, the implementation of the Liquidity\nCoverage Ratio requirement for larger financial institutions in the United States considers\nTreasury securities preferable to other liquid assets such as mortgage agency debt and\nmortgage-backed securities. This rule has boosted demand for Treasuries. In the years\nleading up to the deadline for compliance with the rule, Treasury holdings by large banks\n9 For a model that shows how the evolution of the baby boomer generation has affected r* over the past few\ndecades, see Etienne Gagnon, Benjamin K. Johannsen, and David Lopez-Salido (2016), “Understanding the\nNew Normal: The Role of Demographics,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2016-080\n(Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, October),\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2016.080.\n\n- 10 -\nincreased notably.10 Regulators have also focused on the safety and liquidity of U.S.\nmoney market mutual funds, and there has been a dramatic shift in this industry away\nfrom prime money funds, which hold private debt instruments, to government money\nfunds that hold U.S. Treasury debt obligations. Thus, we saw a significant increase in\nregulatory-driven demand for safe, liquid U.S. Treasuries over the past 15 years. On top\nof this, the Federal Reserve shifted from a limited- to ample-reserves regime to\nimplement monetary policy effectively at the onset of the Global Financial Crisis.11 This\nregime shift resulted in more Treasury securities permanently held by the Federal\nReserve. These policy choices have resulted in higher demand from the public and the\nFederal Reserve and put downward pressure on yields and r*.\nAs I mentioned earlier, there has been a lot of debate during the past year as to\nwhether or not r* has increased. If you believe the narrative I have just provided as to\nwhat drove down r* over the past 40 years, one must ask which of those factors have\nreversed. I do not believe any of these factors can explain the possible recent increase in\nr*, but some may conceivably be a contributing factor to an increase in r* in the future.\nLet’s consider each factor. First, demographics are such that between 2015 and\n2050 the proportion of the world’s population over 60 will nearly double from 12 percent\nto 22 percent. This will continue to put downward, not upward, pressure on r*.\n10 See figure 1 in Jane Ihrig, Edward Kim, Cindy M. Vojtech, and Gretchen C. Weinbach (2019), “How\nHave Banks Been Managing the Composition of High-Quality Liquid Assets?” Federal Reserve Bank of St.\nLouis, Review, vol. 101 (Third Quarter), pp. 177–201,\nhttps://files.stlouisfed.org/files/htdocs/publications/review/2019/07/12/how-have-banks-been-managing-\nthe-composition-of-high-quality-liquid-assets.pdf.\n11 Policy actions taken at the onset of the Global Financial Crisis caused the Federal Reserve to implement\npolicy with an abundant level of reserve balances in the banking system. It was not until 2019 that the\nFOMC formally announced its plan to implement policy with ample reserves over the longer run.\n\n- 11 -\nSecond, is it possible for liberalization of capital markets to reverse due to\nincreased geopolitical frictions? Possibly, but not yet to any significant degree.\nThird, is it likely that central banks and sovereign wealth funds around the world\nwill dramatically decrease their holdings of U.S. Treasuries? Not likely, although the\ngrowth in their demand may slow. As I have argued more extensively elsewhere, I do not\nexpect the dollar to lose its status or influence anytime soon, and recent developments, if\nanything, point more to increased influence for the dollar than to any significant\ndecline.12 On top of this, I don’t expect other countries to emerge as substantive issuers\nof safe and liquid assets to rival Treasuries as an investment, nor any change in the\napproach of the countries with sovereign wealth funds that would lead them to pull back\nfrom their foreign investments.\nFinally, is it possible that regulatory pressures forcing financial institutions to\nhold more safe and liquid government debt will recede and raise r*? The current\nregulations are likely here to stay, and banks are compliant with the rules. So the growth\nin regulatory demand for Treasury securities could slow (not increase) substantially. Of\ncourse, as financial innovation occurs regulations evolve, so we should watch how this\nfactor as well as all the others can affect r* in the future.\nLet’s now turn our attention to the supply of Treasury securities and ask if this\ncan possibly explain why r* may be increasing now or in the future. The U.S.\ngovernment issues Treasuries to finance deficit spending, which obviously impacts\nTreasury supply. Deficit spending and the federal debt have been increasing since the\n12 See Christopher J. Waller (2024), “The Dollar’s International Role,” speech delivered at “Climate,\nCurrency, and Central Banking,” a conference sponsored by the Global Interdependence Center and the\nUniversity of the Bahamas, Nassau, Bahamas, February 15,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240215a.htm.\n\n- 12 -\n1990s. I believe the factors increasing demand that I just reviewed have outstripped the\nincrease in supply over the past few decades, leaving r* lower. But if the growth in the\nsupply of U.S. Treasuries begins to outstrip demand, this will mean lower prices and\nhigher yields, which will put upward pressure on r*.\nIt is probably not news to many people that the U.S. is on an unsustainable fiscal\npath.13 The latest outlook from the Congressional Budget Office paints a challenging\npicture of the future, with debt expected to grow at an unprecedentedly high rate for an\neconomy at full employment and not involved in a major war.14\nAll of these financing pressures may contribute to a rise in r* in coming years, but\nonly time will tell how large a factor the U.S. fiscal position will be in affecting r*.\nLooking ahead, as a policymaker, it is important to understand what is driving any\nmovement in r* to justify using it to guide my policy deliberations. One cannot simply\nclaim r* has risen based on gut feelings—there must be a reasonable economic\nexplanation for why it has risen or fallen. My objective here today was to provide some\narguments for what has moved r* over the past several decades and what could move it in\nthe future.\n13 Discussion of growing U.S. deficits is not new. For a discussion of the growing deficit at that time, see,\nfor example, Ben S. Bernanke (2005), “The Global Saving Glut and the U.S. Current Account Deficit,”\nspeech delivered at the Sandridge Lecture, Virginia Association of Economists, Richmond, Virginia, March\n10, https://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2005/200503102.\n14 As reported in February, the Congressional Budget Office projects debt as a share of GDP to reach\n116 percent by 2034, which is an amount greater than at any point in the nation’s history; see\nCongressional Budget Office (2024), The Budget and Economic Outlook: 2024 to 2034 (Washington:\nCBO, February), https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2024-02/59710-Outlook-2024.pdf.\n\nSome Thoughts on r*: Why Did it\nFall and Will it Rise?\nChristopher Waller\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nDelivered at the Reykjavik Economic Conference\nReykjavik, Iceland\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.

Waller\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe Third Conference on the International Roles of the U.S. Dollar,\nhosted by the Federal Reserve Board\nWashington, D.C.\nMay 20, 2024\n\nThank you, Beth Anne, and thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today.1\nI would like to welcome everyone to this Third Conference on the International Roles of\nthe U.S. Dollar, which is jointly organized by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and\nthe Federal Reserve Board.\nWhen people talk about the “dollar,” they are referring to a number of roles it\nplays on the world stage—including a physical currency used worldwide, financial assets\ndenominated or redeemable in U.S. dollars, or a settlement unit used in transactions. In\nall of these, the role of the U.S. dollar in global finance and its economic and financial\nstability implications are of elementary importance to Federal Reserve. Participants in\nthe first and second installments of this conference discussed the different roles the dollar\nplays in the global economy and how the primacy of the dollar benefits not only the\nUnited States but also the rest of the world. U.S. households, for instance, benefit from\nlower transaction and borrowing costs, while U.S. businesses and the U.S. government\nbenefit from deep financial markets, including a large pool of creditors and investors.\nHouseholds and businesses in foreign economies also benefit from access to this broad\npool of lenders and investors, which reduces their financing costs and fosters global\neconomic growth.\nDespite all the benefits the dollar provides the United States and global economies\nand the efforts to mitigate some of the financial stability challenges posed by its dominant\nrole, there has, for some time, been commentary predicting that the dollar is destined for\ndemise—potentially an imminent demise. Such predictions have not materialized.2 The\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 See Christopher J. Waller, “The Dollar’s International Role,” speech delivered at “Climate, Currency, and\nCentral Banking,” a conference sponsored by the Global Interdependence Center and the University of the\n\n- 2 -\ndollar remains, by far, the most widely used currency across a variety of metrics,\nincluding as a store of value and a medium of exchange. However, the role of the United\nStates in the world economy is changing, and finance is always changing, so I think it is\nimportant for policymakers to regularly consider if and why the dollar’s role might\nchange as well.\nThis conference is a good venue to discuss some of the challenges and\nopportunities for the international use of the dollar in this ever-changing financial\nlandscape. For instance, one of those challenges is the complex relationship between the\ndollar and geoeconomics, commonly defined as the interplay between economic and\ngeopolitical tools and objectives. Rising geopolitical tensions, sanctions against Russia,\nChina’s efforts to bolster usage of the renminbi, and economic fragmentation all can\naffect the international use of the dollar, most visibly as a store of value and reflected in\nits use in official foreign exchange reserves.\nThese same factors can also affect the dollar’s role as a medium of exchange,\nsuch as in its use in trade invoicing, global banking, international debt issuance, and\nforeign exchange transactions. These topics will be addressed by two of our presenters\ntoday. Linda Goldberg will present a paper addressing the effects of geoeconomic\ntensions, focusing on the dollar’s use in official foreign exchange reserves. Linda and her\ncoauthors find that financial sanctions and geopolitical distance from the United States\nare associated with lower dollar shares in foreign exchange reserves. Looking more\nbroadly, Ryan Chahrour will present work exploring the potential effects of escalating\nconflict and protectionism on the dollar’s dominance in connection with efforts to\nBahamas, Nassau, Bahamas, February 15, 2024,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240215a.htm.\n\n- 3 -\npromote the use of other currencies such as the renminbi. He and his coauthors find that\nboth sanctions and policies that directly support the international role of the renminbi\nmay reduce the prominence of the dollar if these sanctions and policies are long-lasting.\nThe shifting cross-border payments landscape—including the rapid growth of\ndigital currencies—could also pose challenges to the dominant role of the U.S. dollar.\nAngelo Ranaldo will provide an overview of aspects of that payments landscape,\nfocusing on the world’s largest multicurrency cash settlement system for foreign\nexchange, the Continuous Linked Settlement payment system, and its role in facilitating\ncross-border payments by reducing settlement risk. In the panel moderated by Michelle\nNeal this afternoon, the panelists will take a broader look at the current landscape of\ncross-border payment systems and how new technologies such as central bank digital\ncurrencies and faster transactions could potentially affect U.S. dollar usage and global\ncapital flows. Stijn Claessens, in his keynote address, will expand on similar themes and\npose questions that still need to be explored by researchers engaged on this topic.\nWhile recognizing that the U.S. dollar may face some challenges to its dominance\nin the future, we, as policymakers, are also attuned to the potential financial stability\nchallenges that the current broad use of the U.S. dollar can pose for financial systems in\nthe United States and the rest of the world. For example, past experiences show that\nforeign shocks can transmit to the United States when investors and governments seek a\nsafe haven to protect the value of their assets in periods of stress. Such a “flight to the\ndollar” means that dollars are in especially high demand in funding markets around the\nglobe during these episodes, as we saw during the Global Financial Crisis and the\nfinancial turmoil at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Federal Reserve supports\n\n- 4 -\nthe use of dollars internationally through our liquidity facilities, including the central\nbank liquidity swap lines, which provide foreign central banks with the capacity to\ndeliver U.S. dollar funding to institutions in their jurisdictions. Scott Davis and Moritz\nLenel will discuss the effectiveness of these swap lines in their respective papers. Using\ndifferent approaches, they find that the availability of U.S. dollars through central bank\nswap lines mitigates the appreciation of the dollar with respect to other currencies in\nepisodes of stress and reduces deviations from covered interest rate parity. This evidence\nsuggests that the central bank swap lines not only ensure that credit continues to flow to\nU.S. households and businesses, but also that these swap lines have effects that enhance\nfinancial stability and, thus, the standing of the U.S. dollar as the dominant global\ncurrency.\nIn closing, I would like to reiterate the importance of understanding how changes\nin the global landscape may affect the central role of the dollar in the global economy and\nfinancial system. I also want to thank you for taking the time to join the discussion over\nthe next two days. This conference brings together world-class researchers, practitioners,\nand policymakers dedicated to understanding and addressing these important topics.",

Waller\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nMid-Size Bank Coalition of America\nLos Angeles, California\n(via webcast)\nMarch 2, 2023\n\nThank you, Raj, and thank you to the coalition for the invitation to be with you—\nvirtually, at least. I don’t want to take up too much of the time for our discussion but let\nme frame a few of the issues around inflation and the economic outlook.1\nLast month we received a barrage of data that has challenged my view in January\nthat the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) was making significant progress in\nmoderating economic activity and reducing inflation. I’m not the only one whose\noutlook has shifted. Since the end of January, financial market participants have revised\ntheir outlooks in a way that has led them to mark up their expectations for the federal\nfunds rate at the end of 2023 by about a half percentage point.\nThe shift in the data started with a bang on February 1, with a big increase in the\nnumber of job openings in December that reversed the gradual easing over several\nmonths in what is a key indicator of tightness in the labor market. Part of the FOMC’s\nplan to lower inflation is reducing this excess tightness, which has been driving elevated\nwage growth and contributing to high inflation. The Job Openings and Labor Turnover\nSurvey data can be noisy so, at times, there is a tendency to downplay large moves. But\nthen on February 3, the job report for January showed a stunning 517,000 increase in\nemployment and the unemployment rate moved down to a level not seen in over 50\nyears.2 These data indicated that, instead of loosening, the labor market was tightening.3\nA little over a week later, on Valentine’s Day, instead of a box of chocolates, we got the\n1 These remarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 Some have argued that the large change in payroll employment should be discounted because of\nunusually warm weather; however, estimates of weather-adjusted employment are also quite large. See\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (2023), “Weather-Adjusted Employment Change,” webpage,\nhttps://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/indicators-data/weather-adjusted-employment-change.\n3 Of course, more people finding jobs is good. But in the context of ongoing labor market tightness, this\nabove trend number can complicate efforts to move the economy toward price stability, on which my\nremarks go into more detail.\n\n- 2 -\nconsumer price index (CPI) inflation report for January and revisions to 2022. By this\nmeasure, not only had inflation stopped declining in January, it also slowed a lot less in\nthe second half of last year than previously reported.4 Later that week, data on producer\nprices and last week’s report on personal consumption expenditures (PCE) prices\nreinforced these two points. Retail sales for January also came in much stronger than\nexpected, suggesting the economy was slowing less than it had appeared just a month\nearlier, a picture that was confirmed by data on personal spending, which represents\nalmost 70 percent of gross domestic product. Continuing progress on inflation depends\non lowering demand and moderating economic activity, and the retail sales and spending\ndata suggest that progress on reducing aggregate demand may have stalled.\nWhether or not subsequent data confirm the setback in progress last month, the\nFOMC will do what is needed to reduce inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent objective\nover time. It is possible there may be some bumps on that path, but I assure you, the\nFOMC’s dual mandate objectives will be achieved. Inflation has been elevated for nearly\ntwo years due to an excess of aggregate demand relative to supply. Even though the\nfiscal stimulus and goods supply constraints that contributed to that imbalance have\nmostly unwound and the FOMC has rapidly raised the target range for the federal funds\nrate, the labor market remains very tight and aggregate demand has proved resilient to\nconsiderable increases in interest rates. One implication of the strong labor market is that\nthe FOMC’s maximum employment goal has been achieved and monetary policy can be\nutterly focused on fighting inflation. Any fear that we might face two-sided risk in\nachieving our dual mandate was blown away by the January employment numbers. But\n4 Each year, with the release of the January CPI, the Bureau of Labor Statistics recalculates seasonal\nadjustment factors. This adjustment resulted in noticeable revisions to 2022 seasonally adjusted CPI prices.\n\n- 3 -\nan excessively tight labor market complicates the path toward achieving price stability,\nbecause wages are growing faster than they have in decades, at a pace that may contribute\nto keeping inflation elevated. We see this excess pressure in the fast growth of services\nprices, where labor costs are a higher share of overall input costs and shortages of\nworkers are reportedly most acute.\nAlthough inflation has been coming down since the middle of last year, the recent\ndata indicate that we haven’t made as much progress as we thought. That assessment\ngoes for both overall inflation, and “core” inflation, which strips out volatile energy and\nfood prices and is a good guide to future price increases. And this holds for both CPI and\nPCE measures of inflation. Core CPI inflation over the last three months of 2022 was\nrevised up from 3.1 percent (at an annual rate) to now be 4.3 percent. Similarly, the 2022\nfourth quarter PCE inflation data was revised from 2.9 percent to 3.6 percent. And the\nthree-month rates increased in January; even measures that trim out the largest and\nsmallest price changes saw increases. These data underscore the view, as laid out in the\nFOMC’s December Summary of Economic Projections, that the fight to bring inflation\ndown to our 2 percent target will be slower and longer than many had expected just a\nmonth or two ago.\nI don’t want to brush aside the fact that we have made progress in reducing\ninflation, and there are indications that further improvement is coming. The three-month\ninflation rate is running below the 12-month rate, which highlights the progress. And\nthere are reasons to be optimistic about continued improvement, including a sharp\ndeceleration in rent increases since the middle of last year, which will start to get\ncaptured in inflation statistics only in the coming months.\n\n- 4 -\nBut recent data suggest that consumer spending isn’t slowing that much, that the\nlabor market continues to run unsustainably hot, and that inflation is not coming down as\nfast as I had thought. It could be that progress has stalled, or it is possible that the\nnumbers released last month were a blip, perhaps associated with unusually favorable\nweather, and that forthcoming data will show that economic activity and inflation\nresumed their decline.\nFortunately, we will get the next employment report and CPI release ahead of the\nMarch 21–22 FOMC meeting, information that will affect my assessment of the\nappropriate next step for monetary policy. If job creation drops back down to a level\nconsistent with the downward trajectory seen late last year and CPI inflation pulls back\nsignificantly from the January numbers and resumes its downward path, then I would\nendorse raising the target range for the federal funds rate a couple more times, to a\nprojected terminal rate between 5.1 and 5.4 percent.5 On the other hand, if those data\nreports continue to come in too hot, the policy target range will have to be raised this year\neven more to ensure that we do not lose the momentum that was in place before the data\nfor January were released.\nI would be very pleased if the data we receive on inflation and the labor market\nthis month show signs of moderation, which would suggest that the February data\nreleases were just a bump in the road and that progress is continuing. But wishful\nthinking is not a substitute for hard evidence, in the form of economic data. After seeing\npromising signs of progress, we cannot risk a revival of inflation. Policymakers must\nremain data dependent, so my view will depend on what the data say.\n5 This estimate of the terminal rate would align with the central tendency of FOMC participants’\nprojections of the federal funds rate at the end of 2023.",

One of my key roles as a policymaker is to help\ndetermine what stance of policy will move the economy closer to that reality. To do that,\nI need to try to understand where the economy stands and where it is headed. And to do\nthat, I look at a variety of economic and financial data.\nI have a team of advisers who help me compile and analyze data. But you don’t\nneed your own team of economists to get a good idea of what’s happening in the U.S.\neconomy. The staff here at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis has created an easy-to-\nuse interactive tool that brings economic data to your fingertips. FRED (Federal Reserve\nEconomic Data) allows the public to access, plot, and analyze thousands of economic\ndata series. I often use FRED myself when I want to look up current and historical data.\nIn fact, I thought for today’s talk, I could use FRED to show some of the data\nseries I consult when thinking about the economy. I’ll start with some slides on\neconomic activity and then move on to the labor market and inflation. I’ll tell you how I\nam interpreting these data, what they have meant for policy to date, and offer a few\ncaveats we should all keep in mind when using data.

    "text": "For release on delivery\n3:15 p.m. EST\nDecember 2, 2024\nCut or Skip?\nRemarks by\nChristopher J. Waller\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Building a Better Fed Framework”\nAmerican Institute for Economic Research\nMonetary Conference\nWashington, D.C.\nDecember 2, 2024\n\nThank you, Lydia, and thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today. I\nthought I might use my time with you to address the Federal Open Market Committee’s\n(FOMC) ongoing effort to return inflation to our 2 percent target while keeping the labor\nmarket and the economy strong.1\nAfter significant progress in reducing inflation and evident moderation in the\nlabor market, in September the Committee judged that the time had come to begin easing\nmonetary policy toward a more neutral setting to limit the risk of unduly weakening the\nlabor market as progress continues toward 2 percent inflation. After reducing the policy\nrate 75 basis points since our September meeting, I believe that monetary policy is still\nrestrictive and putting downward pressure on inflation without creating undesirable\nweakness in the labor market. I expect rate cuts to continue over the next year until we\napproach a more neutral setting of the policy rate.\nBut recent data have raised the possibility that progress on inflation may be\nstalling at a level meaningfully above 2 percent. This risk has raised concerns that the\nFOMC should consider holding the policy rate constant at our upcoming meeting to\ncollect more information about the future path of inflation and the economy. Based on\nthe economic data in hand today and forecasts that show that inflation will continue on its\ndownward path to 2 percent over the medium term, at present I lean toward supporting a\ncut to the policy rate at our December meeting. But that decision will depend on whether\ndata that we will receive before then surprises to the upside and alters my forecast for the\npath of inflation.\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nLet me turn to the economic outlook. Real gross domestic product (GDP) grew at\na strong annual pace of 2.8 percent in the third quarter of 2024, and indications are that\ngrowth in the fourth quarter will be a bit slower. An average of private sectors forecasts\npredicts 2.2 percent, while based on fairly limited data so far, the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow\nmodel currently predicts 3.2 percent.\nOn the consumer side of the economy, real personal consumption expenditures\n(PCE) increased 0.1 percent in October after a 0.5 percent rise in September. Given the\nrecent volatility in these numbers, I won’t read too much into the monthly swing. The\nmodest increase in October might partially reflect some payback to the stronger growth in\nSeptember. Overall, household balance sheets continue to be in generally good shape,\nand this position should help maintain spending going forward.\nOn the business side of the economy, the S&P Global U.S. manufacturing\npurchasing managers index (PMI) rose slightly in November but still stands at a level\nindicating a slight deterioration in overall business conditions among manufacturers for\nthe fifth straight month. Today’s Institute for Supply Management manufacturing survey\nhad a similar leaning. These readings are consistent with industrial production data for\nmanufacturing remaining flat, as it has been for the past several months.\nBut these aggregate data mask quite different performances for interest-sensitive\nsectors and other businesses not so affected by rates. In the spring of 2022, when the\nFOMC began raising interest rates, production by more interest rate–sensitive\nmanufacturers, such as business equipment, grew at about the same rate as production by\nless rate-sensitive manufacturers. But starting around the middle of 2023, when the\npolicy rate hit its peak, those stories diverged, and production by interest-sensitive\n\n- 3 -\nmanufacturing declined, while other manufacturing rose, driving a sizable gap between\nthe two types of industries. This divergence is an indication to me that, even after the\nCommittee cut rates 75 basis points, restrictive policy is working the way it is intended\nto, affecting production in sectors where rates matter. It is also a reminder that there is\nstill some distance to go in reducing the policy rate to neutral. As that occurs, I expect\nthe gap between the two types of industries will narrow. As for the service sector, which\nis the larger share of business activity, the November S&P Global U.S. PMI continued to\nincrease, extending the strong momentum for services over the past year or two.\nWhile the picture for economic activity is pretty clear right now across the major\ndata that we look at, things aren’t as clear in recent data on the labor market. As\nexpected, the October employment report showed very little increase in the number of\njobs, but likely because of the temporary effects of the recent hurricanes and the strike at\nBoeing, which also affected businesses serving Boeing and its workers. The strike is\nover, and it is likely that most of the job losses from the hurricane have reversed. So I do\nexpect a rebound in payroll data in the November employment report that is due out later\nthis week, but it may take more time for the full swings in the payroll data to fully wash\nout.\nFor that reason, I am leaning on other metrics to reveal what is really going on in\nthe labor market. And when I look at a broader range of data, it tells a fairly consistent\nstory over the past year about moderating demand relative to supply, consistent with\ncontinued progress toward 2 percent inflation and without an undesirable weakening in\nthe labor market.\n\n- 4 -\nThe unemployment rate started 2024 at 3.7 percent and climbed gradually, briefly\nhitting 4.3 percent before falling back down to 4.1 percent in September and October.\nWhile that is still quite low in historical terms, it indicates a labor market significantly\nlooser than we saw from the middle of 2022 to the middle of 2023, when unemployment\nwas close to 3.5 percent and fast wage growth contributed to high inflation. Other data\nsharpen this image of a looser but still-strong labor market. The share of workers\nvoluntarily quitting their jobs, an indication of tightness in the labor market, has trended\ndown to levels lower than before the pandemic. The number of job openings continues to\ngradually fall, another sign of moderating demand relative to supply, but the number of\nlayoffs is still low, consistent with a healthy labor market.\nGrowth in wages and other forms of compensation has moderated at the same\ntime that labor productivity has grown strongly. This story is very different than a couple\nof years ago when, for example, average hourly wages grew at an annual rate above\n5 percent in 2022, at the same time that the productivity of workers was declining. This\ndouble whammy put significant upward pressure on inflation. But over the second and\nthird quarters of 2024, average hourly wages have grown at less than a 4 percent annual\nrate, while productivity has grown around 2 percent. The math is pretty simple—4\npercent wage growth minus the 2 percent gain from higher productivity tells you that\nwage growth is consistent with bringing inflation down to 2 percent.2\nWhile I am pleased at how well the labor market has held up under restrictive\nmonetary policy, I am less pleased about what the data have been telling us the past\ncouple of months about inflation. After making a lot of progress over the past year and a\n2 A similar story holds true if one looks at growth in labor productivity and hourly compensation from the\nProductivity and Cost release. Here the wedge between the two series has narrowed over this time period.\n\n- 5 -\nhalf, the recent data indicate that progress may be stalling. Inflation based on the\nCommerce Department’s measure of prices for PCE rose more than expected in\nSeptember and October and so did “core” PCE inflation, which excludes more volatile\nfood and energy prices and is a better guide to future inflation. Three-month annualized\ncore PCE inflation has risen over the past two months, while six-month annualized\ninflation has made only a small improvement. These rates now stand at 2.8 percent and\n2.3 percent, respectively. These recent readings have contributed to 12-month core PCE\ninflation of 2.8 percent in October.\nIf we compare components of core inflation this October with last October, we\nsee 12-month housing services inflation has softened and goods inflation has moved to\nslight deflation, but there has been an increase in nonmarket core services excluding\nhousing. Overall, I feel like an MMA fighter who keeps getting inflation in a choke hold,\nwaiting for it to tap out yet it keeps slipping out of my grasp at the last minute. But let\nme assure you that submission is inevitable—inflation isn’t getting out of the octagon.\nWhile the recent increase and the level of inflation raise concerns that it may be\ngetting stuck above the FOMC’s 2 percent goal, let me emphasize that this is a risk but\nnot a certainty. I take the recent inflation data seriously, but we saw a similar uptick in\ninflation a year ago that was followed by a continued decline, so I also don’t want to\noverreact. And I expect housing services inflation to continue to moderate and I do not\ntake much signal from the elevated inflation for other non-market services.\nNow let me turn to the implications for monetary policy based on my assessment\nof the underlying economic outlook. While some near-term aspects of the outlook may\nbe a little unclear, something that is clear is the direction for monetary policy and our\n\n- 6 -\npolicy rate over the medium term, which is down. This downward trajectory reflects the\nfact that the level of aggregate demand in the economy, relative to supply, has moderated\nsignificantly over the past year—it is plainly visible in the data on spending and the labor\nmarket. Inflation over that time is also significantly lower, so it makes sense to be\nmoving policy rates toward a more neutral setting.\nAnd there is a ways to go. In September, the median of the projections of FOMC\nparticipants was that the federal funds rate would be 3.4 percent at the end of next year,\nwhich is about 100 basis points lower than it is today. That number can and probably\nwill change over time, but whatever the destination, there will be a variety of ways to get\nthere, with the speed and timing of cuts determined by economic conditions we encounter\non the way.\nThe motivation for continuing to cut the policy rate at the FOMC’s next meeting\nbegins with how restrictive the current setting is. After we cut by 75 basis points, I\nbelieve the evidence is strong that policy continues to be significantly restrictive and that\ncutting again will only mean that we aren’t pressing on the brake pedal quite as hard.\nAlthough monthly core inflation has flattened out in recent months, there is no indication\nthat the pace of price increases for key service categories such as housing and nonmarket\nservices should remain at their current levels or increase. Another factor that supports a\nfurther rate cut is that the labor market appears to finally be in balance, and we should\naim to keep it that way.\nConversely, based on what we know today, one could argue that there is a case\nfor skipping a rate cut at the next meeting. Monthly readings on inflation have moved up\nnoticeably recently, and we don’t know whether this uptick in inflation will persist, or\n\n- 7 -\nreverse, as we saw a year ago. Due to strikes and hurricanes, recent labor market data are\ngiving us a cloudy view of the true state of the labor market that won’t be clearer for a\ncouple of months. As a result, one could advocate for not changing the policy rate at our\nupcoming meeting and adjusting our policy stance in a measured way going forward. In\nfact, if policymakers’ estimates of the target range at the end of next year are close to\ncorrect, then the Committee will most likely be skipping rate cuts multiple times on the\nway to that destination.\nIn deciding which of these two approaches to take at the FOMC’s next meeting, I\nwill be watching additional data very closely. Tomorrow, we get the Labor Department’s\nJob Openings and Labor Turnover Survey. On Friday, we get the employment report,\nwhich, as I noted, may have misleading payroll data. Then next week, we get consumer\nand producer price indexes for November, which will allow a good estimate of PCE\ninflation for the month. Finally, on the first day of the FOMC meeting, we receive retail\nsales data for November that will give us an idea of how consumer spending is holding\nup.\nAll of that information will help me decide whether to cut or skip. As of today, I\nam leaning toward continuing the work we have started in returning monetary policy to a\nmore neutral setting. Policy is still restrictive enough that an additional cut at our next\nmeeting will not dramatically change the stance of monetary policy and allow ample\nscope to later slow the pace of rate cuts, if needed, to maintain progress toward our\ninflation target. That said, if the data we receive between today and the next meeting\nsurprise in a way that suggests our forecasts of slowing inflation and a moderating but\nstill-solid economy are wrong, then I will be supportive of holding the policy rate\n\n- 8 -\nconstant. I will be watching the incoming data closely over the next couple weeks to help\nme make my decision as to what path to take.",

Waller\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nUniversity of New South Wales\nMacroeconomic Workshop\nSydney, New South Wales, Australia\nFebruary 17, 2025\n\nThank you, Bruce, and thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today. It’s\ngreat being back in Sydney and seeing old friends—like the Opera House!\nAs I look at the U.S. economy today, I see that the real side is doing just fine but\nprogress on lowering inflation has come in fits and starts.1 After two good months of\ninflation data for November and December, January once again disappointed and showed\nthat progress on inflation remains uneven. I continue to believe that the current setting of\nmonetary policy is restricting economic activity somewhat and putting downward\npressure on inflation. If this winter-time lull in progress is temporary, as it was last year,\nthen further policy easing will be appropriate. But until that is clear, I favor holding the\npolicy rate steady.\nSpending by households and businesses has proved to be resilient, we have solid\ngrowth in real gross domestic product (GDP) and the latest data on employment,\nincluding revisions to most of 2024, support the view that labor market is in a sweet spot.\nMeanwhile, last week’s January inflation data have a similar feel to that of January 2024,\nalbeit to a smaller degree; they surprised on the high side and raised concerns that the\nprogress we made in pushing inflation toward our 2 percent goal would stall out. But\nonce we got past the first quarter of last year, we did see continued progress in reducing\ninflation in the latter part of the year. The question now is if we will see progress again\nlater this year, as we did in 2024.\nProgress on inflation is an important consideration in policymakers’ judgment\nabout whether monetary policy needs adjustment in the near term. The continued solid\nlabor market is one reason why I supported the Federal Open Market Committee’s\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\n(FOMC) decision at the end of January to hold our policy rate steady. After two good\ninflation reports for November and December there was concern about a January bounce\nback in inflation. So based on good labor market data and concerns about a seasonal\nshock to inflation not fully adjusted in the data, I felt it was prudent to stand pat at our\nJanuary meeting. Given last week’s inflation report, that concern was warranted.\nLet me pause here for a moment to address some commentary after the FOMC\nmeeting that cited uncertainty about the new Administration’s policies as a leading reason\nfor that decision. We must keep in mind that there is always a degree of uncertainty\nabout economic policy, and we need to act based on incoming data even when facing\ngreat uncertainty about the economic landscape. We have done this in the past and will\ncontinue to do so in the future.\nLet me provide two recent examples where the FOMC acted in the face of great\nuncertainty. In March 2022, inflation was roaring, and rate hikes were on the table. Then\nRussia invaded Ukraine, which created tremendous economic uncertainty around the\nglobe. Not only did the FOMC raise the policy rate in March 2022 for the first time since\n2019, but in subsequent meetings we also implemented large rate hikes for several\nmeetings. We could not wait for uncertainty about the war to be resolved.\nThe second episode was in March of 2023 when stresses emerged in the U.S.\nbanking system, stemming in part from the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Credit\nSuisse, with the latter occurring the weekend before our March FOMC meeting. There\nwas great uncertainty as to whether these events would lead to financial instability and a\nsignificant contraction of credit that could trigger a recession. Many forecasters\nprojected a recession would hit in the second half of 2023 as a result. Consequently,\n\n- 3 -\nthere were calls to stop hiking the policy rate due to a tremendous amount of financial\nand banking uncertainty. But the Federal Reserve worked in concert with other\ngovernment agencies and used its financial stabilization tools to deal with the banking\nissues and continued raising the policy rate to deal with inflation.2 So the moral of this\nstory is that monetary policy cannot be put on hold waiting for these types of uncertainty\nto resolve.\nPutting uncertainty aside, let me turn to my view of the economic data. As I\nnoted, real GDP continued to grow solidly in the fourth quarter, at a pace of 2.3 percent,\nand would have been nearly 1 percentage point stronger without a reduction in\ninventories, which tend to be volatile. Personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which\nare typically two-thirds of GDP, grew a robust 4.2 percent in the fourth quarter. As was\nnoted in the Fed’s latest Monetary Policy Report to Congress, households have a solid\nlevel of liquid assets to sustain their spending. Based on the limited data we have for the\nfirst quarter of 2025 this solid growth seems to be continuing. The employment report\nfor January, which I will focus on in a moment, indicated a continued strong labor\nmarket, which should support consumption. Retail sales are reported to have fallen back\nin January after a strong rise in December, but given how volatile these data can be, and\ngiven that the cold weather in January probably held down sales, I’m not putting much\nweight on that reading for the time being. Business sentiment, as reflected in surveys of\npurchasing managers in both manufacturing and non-manufacturing, was among the most\nconsistently positive in a while. The index for manufacturing businesses was 50.9, the\n2 See my March 2022 speech for a discussion of how the Federal Reserve oversees financial stability and\nmacroeconomic stability using different tools. Speech by Governor Waller on the economic outlook -\nFederal Reserve Board\n\n- 4 -\nfirst time since October 2022 that these results topped 50, as sentiment indicators about\norders, production, and employment were all expanding. The corresponding index for\nthe large majority of businesses outside manufacturing also indicated expansion, as it has\nfor some time. The Blue Chip consensus of private forecasters and the Atlanta Fed’s\nGDP Now forecast based on the data in hand predict growth this quarter similar to that of\nthe end of last year. To circle back to my message earlier, many people predicted that\ntariffs proposed by the Administration on February 1 would have a significant effect on\ntrade and consumption in the first quarter, not to mention prices, but after the\npostponement of some of those tariffs, it is unclear to me if and when that might show up\nin the data. I will, of course, be watching closely, but I haven’t altered my outlook based\non what has been implemented to date.\nAs I noted earlier, data on the labor market indicate that it is in a good spot, with\nemployers having an easier time filling jobs than earlier in the expansion but with still\nample demand for new workers and new jobs being created. The unemployment rate\nticked down to 4 percent, which is just about where it has been for the past year.\nEmployers added a net 143,000 jobs in January, down some from a 204,000 average for\nthe final three months of 2024 but right around the 133,000 average for the quarter before\nthat. Two factors that may have held down this number a bit were cold weather and the\nfires in Los Angeles, which prevented thousands of people from getting to or performing\ntheir jobs. Beyond payrolls, the ratio of job vacancies to the number of unemployed\npeople stands at 1.1, close to the level before the pandemic.\nWage growth continues to be strong, and it has considerably outpaced price\nincreases, but is down from two years ago, and for a few reasons, I don’t judge recent\n\n- 5 -\ndata as indicating that wages are a factor preventing inflation from making continued\nprogress toward 2 percent. Though the January reading of average hourly earnings was a\nbit elevated, this series is pretty volatile and the reading may have been held up by\nweather-related issues. Smoothing through the monthly fluctuations, we see wage\ngrowth fairly steady at 4 percent a month over the past year. Broader measures of worker\ncompensation show a more distinct moderation in growth. The Labor Department’s\nemployment cost index has fallen gradually but consistently from 4.2 percent at the end\nof 2023 to 3.8 percent at its last reading.\nAs for whether 4 percent wage growth is consistent with 2 percent inflation, I will\nnote, as I have before, that productivity has grown at roughly a 2 percent annual rate\nsince the advent of the pandemic—and slightly faster than that in 2023 and 2024. Unless\nthat productivity trend changes a lot, wage growth is consistent with bringing inflation\ndown to 2 percent.\nTurning to inflation, last week’s data taken as a whole were mildly disappointing\nbut not nearly so disappointing as a focus on the consumer price index (CPI) alone would\nhave indicated. Total CPI inflation for January came in hot at 0.5 percent, and core was\n0.4 percent, which brings the 12-month changes to 3.0 percent and 3.3 percent,\nrespectively. These 12-month readings are lower than we had in January 2024, so we\nhave made some progress over the past year, but they are still too high.\nHowever, we also received producer price data last week, and, combining that\ninformation with the CPI data, forecasts for January PCE inflation aren’t as alarming as\nthe CPI inflation data. Estimates for total PCE inflation, the FOMC’s preferred measure,\nare about 0.3 percent and that for core PCE inflation was around 0.25 percent. These\n\n- 6 -\nnumbers will mean a bump-up in the monthly pace of core inflation of about one-tenth of\n1 percentage point from readings of under 0.2 percent in November and December. And\nthis would leave the 12-month and 6-month average core PCE inflation around 2.6\npercent and 2.4 percent, respectively. These rates are lower than where they stood in\nJanuary 2024, which is good, but progress has been slower than I expected on reducing\ninflation to our 2 percent target.\nAs a policymaker, I rely on these data to help me judge how close we are to\nmeeting our inflation target. And I’m thinking hard about how to interpret these recent\nnumbers because there seems to be some pattern over the past few years of higher\ninflation readings at the start of the year. This pattern brings into question whether the\ninflation data have “residual seasonality,” which means that statisticians have not fully\ncorrected for some apparent seasonal fluctuations in some prices. Many firms reset their\nprices at the beginning of each year, and the Commerce Department tries to factor this in,\nbut even after this adjustment, there is a consensus among economists that some\nseasonality remains. Incidentally, this probably isn’t just a problem in January. Some\nrecently updated research by the Fed staff shows that inflation in the first months of the\nyear has been higher than in the second half for 16 of the last 22 years.3 I’m alert to this\nissue and will watch the data over the next few months to evaluate if we are having what\nlooks like a repeat of high first quarter inflation data that could be followed by lower\nreadings later in the year.\n3 For a fuller discussion of residual seasonality in inflation data, see Ekaterina Peneva and Nadia Sadée\n(2019), “Residual Seasonality in Core Consumer Price Inflation: An Update,” FEDS Notes (Washington:\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, February 12),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/residual-seasonality-in-core-consumer-price-\ninflation-an-update-20190212.html.\n\n- 7 -\nBefore I get to my outlook for monetary policy, I want to address a topic of some\ndebate recently, which is the divergence between long-term interest rates and the\nFOMC’s policy rate since we started cutting rates in September. While the FOMC has\nreduced the policy rate 100 basis points since then, yields on the benchmark 10-year\nTreasury security have increased by a noticeable amount. In theory, longer-term rates\nshould follow the expected path of the overnight policy rate set by the FOMC. But this\nrelationship is based on the classic economic assumption of ceteris paribus, or “all other\nfactors remaining constant.” The 10-year Treasury security trades in a deep, liquid global\nmarket, and its yield is affected by a variety of factors other than the path of the policy\nrate. This means that all other factors are not constant and that the 10-year Treasury yield\nmay not follow the federal funds rate.\nPerhaps the most famous example of the divergence of market interest rates and\npolicy rates began in the mid 2000’s. The FOMC was tightening monetary policy from\n2004 to 2006 and raised the policy rate 425 basis points. Over that time, Treasury yields\nbarely moved. This was so surprising that Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan referred to it as\na “conundrum.” At about the same time, future Chair Ben Bernanke identified what he\ncalled a “global savings glut” that was pushing up foreign demand for Treasury securities\nand putting downward pressure on yields. Over time, this has come to be seen as a\nsignificant factor for the conundrum then and as a factor for low Treasury yields\nsubsequently. This example is just to illustrate that the 10-year Treasury yield may not\nrespond to the policy rate as expected because of a variety of factors that are beyond the\ncontrol of the FOMC.\n\n- 8 -\nSo, what does my economic outlook mean for monetary policy? The labor market\nis balanced and remarkably resilient. If you want an example of a stable labor market\nwith employment at its maximum level, it looks a lot like where we are right now. On\nthe other side of the FOMC’s mandate, inflation is still meaningfully above our target,\nand progress has been excruciatingly slow over the last year. This tells me that we\nshould currently have a restrictive setting of policy, as we do—to continue to move\ninflation down to our goal—but that setting should be getting closer to neutral as inflation\nmoves closer to 2 percent and should allow the labor market to remain in a good place.\nSo for now, I believe a pause in rate cuts is appropriate. Assuming the labor\nmarket continues to be in rough balance, I can wait and see if the higher inflation\nreadings in January moderate, as they have in the past couple of years. If so, I’ll have to\ndecide if this reflects residual seasonality that will go away later in the year and if the\nunderlying trend in inflation is toward 2 percent, or if there is a different issue holding up\ninflation and how that may play out. Whichever case it may be, the data are not\nsupporting a reduction in the policy rate at this time. But if 2025 plays out like 2024, rate\ncuts would be appropriate at some point this year.\nAnd while we are waiting on data to understand how the economy is moving\nrelative to our objectives, we will learn more about Administration policies. My baseline\nview is that any imposition of tariffs will only modestly increase prices and in a non-\npersistent manner. So I favor looking through these effects when setting monetary policy\nto the best of our ability. Of course, I concede that the effects of tariffs could be larger\nthan I anticipate, depending on how large they are and how they are implemented. But\nwe also need to remember that it is possible that other policies under discussion could\n\n- 9 -\nhave positive supply effects and put downward pressure on inflation. At the end of the\nday, the data should be guiding our policy action—not speculation about what could\nhappen. And if the incoming data supports further rate cuts or staying on pause, then we\nshould do so regardless of how much clarity we have on what policies the Administration\nadopts. Waiting for economic uncertainty to dissipate is a recipe for policy paralysis.",

Waller\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nA Very Stable Conference\nSan Francisco, California\nFebruary 12, 2025\n\nThank you for inviting me to speak today about stablecoins, an important\ninnovation for the crypto ecosystem with the potential to improve retail and cross-border\npayments.1 A little over three years ago, I outlined my views on the benefits and risks of\nstablecoins.2 I can think of no better place than this conference to discuss the maturing\nstablecoin market and examine potential challenges that could impede stablecoins from\nreaching their full potential.\nFor the purposes of this speech, I define stablecoins as a type of digital asset\ndesigned to maintain a stable value relative to a national currency and backed at least\none-to-one with safe and liquid assets. Specifically, a pool of assets is held in reserve so\nthat stablecoins can be redeemed for traditional currency in a timely fashion.\nStablecoins—as with any means of payment—must demonstrate 1) a clear use\ncase and 2) a clear commercial case to be economically viable. These terms are often\nconflated, but they are different, and both are necessary. Having a use case is how you\nattract consumers and businesses, while a business model is necessary for issuers of\nstablecoins to continue operating. As private sector innovators look to expand on the use\ncases of stablecoins and seek to achieve scale, what might emerge as challenges or\nroadblocks? This is a question I will explore today, including from a public sector\nperspective. Of course, as a policymaker, I am not here to endorse any of these use cases\nor business models, and what follows is not advice or recommendations. Rather, I am\ndiscussing them to underscore the varied ecosystem that policymakers must understand.\n1 Thank you to Marc Rodriguez, Alex Sproveri, Sonja Danburg, and David Mills of the Federal Reserve\nBoard for their assistance in preparing this text. The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily\nthose of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board.\n2 See Christopher J. Waller, “Reflections on Stablecoins and Payments Innovations” (speech at \"Planning\nfor Surprises, Learning from Crises\" 2021 Financial Stability Conference, Cleveland, OH, November 17,\n2021), https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20211117a.htm.\n\n- 2 -\nI will begin by explaining some of the use cases of stablecoins, including those\nthat are well established and those that are still emerging. The primary use of stablecoins\nis as a safe crypto store of value. In the early days of crypto trading, buying and selling\ncrypto meant trading one crypto-asset for another crypto-asset. As we have seen, crypto\nprices can fluctuate substantially, which means crypto-assets that are not anchored as\nstablecoins suffer from price risk. All financial markets crave the existence of a safe,\nlow-risk asset which allows traders to move out of risky positions into safe ones where\nthe safe asset price is known and stable. The beauty of financial innovation is that if a\nmarket demands such an asset, someone will figure out how to supply it. Thus,\nstablecoins were born.\nA stablecoin’s value is tied to a national fiat currency, with the U.S. dollar being\nthe fiat currency of choice for most stablecoins. In this sense, stablecoins are synthetic\ndollars. In our everyday life, the dollar serves as a medium of exchange and a unit of\naccount. By their tie to the dollar, stablecoins are the medium of exchange and unit of\naccount in the crypto ecosystem.\nBut how does one trade a “real” dollar for a “synthetic” dollar, like a stablecoin?\nExchanges already allowed agents to move in and out of the crypto ecosystem but doing\nso took time and money. Stablecoins provided a marketplace solution to this problem—a\nmeans to represent dollars on exchanges so that transactions could be carried out more\nquickly and efficiently. Currently, stablecoins are involved in over 80 percent of trading\nvolume on major centralized crypto exchanges.3\n3 See “Share of Trade Volume by Pair Denomination,” The Block, last modified February 10, 2025,\nhttps://www.theblock.co/data/crypto-markets/spot/share-of-trade-volume-by-pair-denomination.\n\n- 3 -\nA second stablecoin use case is providing a means to access and hold U.S. dollars.\nToday, around 99 percent of stablecoin market capitalization is denominated in U.S.\ndollars, and the vast majority of digital asset trades are priced in U.S. dollars.4 This is no\nsurprise given the primacy of the U.S. dollar in global finance and trade, and I believe\nthat stablecoins have the potential to maintain and extend the role of the dollar\ninternationally.5 U.S. dollar stablecoins could be particularly appealing to those in high\ninflation countries or to those without easy or affordable access to dollar cash or banking\nservices.\nA third use case is cross-border payments. For example, we are hearing increased\nindustry focus on the “stablecoin sandwich” model of cross-border payments, in which\nfiat currency in one country is converted first into a U.S. dollar stablecoin, then that\nstablecoin is transferred to another individual, and then finally the stablecoin is converted\nback into the local fiat currency at its destination. This has the potential to reduce the\ncomplexity of a series of correspondent banking networks, improving transparency, cost,\nand timeliness. As this use case develops, it is critical that market participants implement\nall anti-money laundering and relevant consumer safeguards.\nThe last use case I will describe is in retail payments. At present, stablecoin use\nfor retail payments is very limited. However, I am seeing a lot of new, private sector\nentrants looking to find ways to support the use of stablecoins for retail payments. For\nexample, firms that provide point-of-sale technology are acquiring innovative fintechs or\ndeveloping their own capabilities to accept stablecoins for retail purchases. This provides\n4 See “DefiLlama-Defi Dashboard,” https://defillama.com/.\n5 See Christopher J. Waller, “The Dollar’s International Role” (speech at \"Climate, Currency, and Central\nBanking,\" Nassau, BS, February 15, 2024),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240215a.htm.\n\n- 4 -\nconsumers with yet another option. Firms are also looking to incorporate stablecoins—\nand crypto more broadly—into peer-to-peer payment apps.\nIt remains to be seen whether stablecoins will scale for retail payment use cases.\nSuch an evolution would require both a substantial number of consumers to shift their\npreferences toward using stablecoins and a significant number of businesses to make\nnecessary investments to receive payments via stablecoins. We know that consumer\nretail payments behavior is sticky, and when behavior does change, it generally happens\nover a long period. If retail payments use cases do increase, it would probably take years\nto have a significant impact. That said, if stablecoins reduce transaction fees or allow\nmerchants to attract customers, then merchants could have an incentive to accept them.\nUltimately, the market will sort out whether consumers and businesses have the\nincentives to use stablecoins in this way.\nIn addition to stablecoins having clear cut use cases, issuers must have a viable\nbusiness model. To cite one famous example, Red Lobster’s endless shrimp deal was\npopular with customers, but it did not turn out to be a sustainable model for the restaurant\nchain. Let me describe what I think are the incentives for stablecoin issuers, but I am\nhere today to learn more.\nTo date, most stablecoin issuers appear to generate revenue primarily by earning\nhigher returns on their reserve assets than they incur in expenses. They issue a zero-\ninterest liability and use the proceeds to acquire interest earning assets, thereby profiting\nfrom the spread. As with bank deposits, the interest rate environment will have a\nsignificant effect on the profitability of firms issuing stablecoins. Higher interest rates\ngenerally mean higher rates of return on reserve assets, which generates revenue for the\n\n- 5 -\nissuer. However, higher interest rates also have the potential to make non-interest\nbearing assets less attractive for consumers to hold. That said, users who hold stablecoins\nas an accessible, safe store of U.S. dollar denominated value may not be particularly\nsensitive to the interest rate environment, a phenomenon we already see today with some\nholders of physical U.S. dollars.\nAn additional way stablecoin issuers can generate revenue is through fees. This\ncould include charging minting and burning fees, which occur when a customer acquires\na new stablecoin for a real dollar or wants to redeem it for real dollars. This is very much\nlike the foreign exchange market in fiat currencies that most of us are familiar with.\nAlternatively, as occurs with most payments firms, the issuer could earn money from\ntransaction fees.\nFinally, stablecoin issuers may use stablecoins as part of a broader strategy to\nattract customers to whom they may sell other products and services. In that case,\nstablecoins could be seen as a “loss leader” to entice customers to use other products or\nservices offered by the stablecoin issuer that are much more profitable.\nWith the exception of the last example, the viability of the other business models\nwill depend on the ability of stablecoins to scale as a means of payment and on how\nconsumers and businesses respond. For example, if the stablecoin issuer decides to pass\nthrough interest earnings on its assets, that will make the stablecoin more attractive, but it\nwill reduce the profits from issuing a stablecoin. The smaller the interest rate spread, the\nmore important scale becomes. For the fee-based models, free entry into this space will\ndrive down fees as it does in any other market, which will reduce the revenue from\nissuing a stablecoin.\n\n- 6 -\nWithin this market, scale is important for achieving certain use cases as well as\nsatisfying certain business models. For example, stablecoins are unlikely to become a\nviable option for retail payments if consumers question whether stablecoins will be\nwidely accepted as a means of payment, while stablecoin issuers cannot generate\nsignificant revenue from interest on backing assets or fees without scale. I call this the\n“Field of Dreams” problem—if you build it, will they come?\nWith all of that in mind, let’s now dive into some of the potential challenges or\nroadblocks that will need to be overcome for stablecoins to achieve their full potential.\nThe first theme I will explore is one that I have discussed in the past—the safety\nand soundness of stablecoins and the need for a clear regulatory regime for stablecoins in\nthe United States.6 Stablecoins are forms of private money and, like any form of private\nmoney, are subject to run risk, and we have seen “depegs” of some stablecoins in recent\nyears. Additionally, all payment systems face risk of failure, and stablecoins are subject\nto clearing, settlement, and other payment system risks as well. At the same time, it is\nimportant to note that the risks faced by stablecoin issuers are not the same risks faced by\nbanks. The stablecoin market would benefit from a U.S. regulatory and supervisory\nframework that addresses stablecoin risks directly, fully, and narrowly. This framework\nshould allow both non-banks and banks to issue regulated stablecoins and should\nconsider the effects of regulation on the payments landscape, including competing\npayment instruments.\nI want to reiterate that I think it is important that U.S. legislation makes provision\nfor the supervision and regulation of stablecoin issuers that is proportionate to the risks\n6 See Chrisopher J. Waller, “Reflections on Stablecoins and Payments Innovations.”\n\n- 7 -\nthey pose, without stifling their innovative potential while the marketplace is still\ndeveloping. I believe in the power of the private sector to develop solutions that benefit\nbusinesses and consumers, with the job of the public sector to create a fair set of rules for\nmarket participants to operate within, including guardrails that ensure safety for\nconsumers and the financial system as a whole. Having a level of certainty is important\nfor businesses looking to invest in new products and services as well as for consumer\nconfidence and assurance.\nFragmentation is the next theme I’ll explore, first from a technical perspective.\nCurrently, several popular blockchain networks are designed as distinct from one another.\nFirms looking to scale across blockchains are seeking technical solutions to achieve\ncross-chain interoperability. Will this ultimately prove efficient, especially in a world\nwith multiple stablecoin providers operating within potentially different combinations of\nblockchain networks? Or will there be multiple, competing ecosystems, for example\nwhere one stablecoin dominates on certain blockchains, and another stablecoin dominates\non others? Alternatively, a stablecoin market featuring a high degree of interoperability\ncould support a variety of stablecoin issuers and blockchain networks, providing\nconsumers a choice in stablecoins and technologies. It is not yet clear how these\ndynamics will ultimately impact business models and use cases for stablecoins, but it is\nan issue that bears watching as firms work to scale and mature their businesses.\nFragmentation around the use and acceptance of stablecoins will also act as an\nimpediment to scaling and will impact how stablecoin use cases develop. As I noted,\nstablecoins will prove useful as a means of payment insofar as holders of a specific\nstablecoin expect that others will accept them. The more people will accept a stablecoin,\n\n- 8 -\nthe more convenient a stablecoin will be. For the retail payment use case, how easy will\nit be for me as a consumer to pay with stablecoins at the point of sale, either in-person or\nonline? From the merchant perspective, what incentives will firms have to accept\nstablecoins? Similarly, for cross-border payments, how widely will different firms (and\ntheir banking partners) transact in stablecoins? And, more broadly, could stablecoins\nhave the potential to recreate and potentially exacerbate the current challenges associated\nwith correspondent banking, further fragmenting the marketplace? Or could stablecoins\nmature in such a way to change the market structure of cross-border payments?\nFragmentation in regulation also has the potential to hold stablecoins back from\nreaching their full potential. As I already discussed, the stablecoin market does not have\na clear regulatory framework in the United States. While there have been efforts to\ndevelop some international standards, the emergence of different global stablecoin\nregulatory regimes creates the potential for conflicting regulation domestically and\ninternationally.7 This regulatory fragmentation could make it difficult for U.S. dollar\nstablecoin issuers to operate at a global scale. And as I have noted, scale is vital for any\nmeans of payment to achieve its full potential.\nFor example, under Europe’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation, stablecoin\nissuers can earn interest on their reserve assets as a business model, whereas other\nregulatory models being discussed would require reserves for stablecoins deemed\nsystemically important to be held as non-interest-bearing central bank deposits, limiting\n7 See Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures and Board of the International Organization of\nSecurities Commissions, Application of the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures to stablecoin\narrangements (Basel: Bank for International Settlements, July 2022),\nhttps://www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d206.pdf.\n\n- 9 -\nstablecoin issuers into a specific business model. Domestically, state regulators have\nbeen key players in the development of the stablecoin market, and several states are in the\nprocess of developing state laws or finalizing new regulations related to stablecoin\nissuance. There is a risk that state regulations may conflict, which could prevent the use\nof the same stablecoin across all states and reduce stablecoin scalability. As with the\nUnited States’ dual banking system, a complementary framework with state and federal\nregulators working together can allow innovation to flourish while achieving some of the\nbenefits of scale that come with a harmonized set of market rules.\nDifferent regulatory regimes are also creating separate reserve asset and\nredemption requirements for stablecoin issuers—a further potential regulatory regime\nfragmentation. In Europe, non-systemic stablecoin issuers are required to hold a\nminimum of 30 percent of their backing assets in bank deposits, and regulators have\nfurther proposed concentration limits per bank.8 This differs from the requirements of\nsome U.S. state-regulated issuers.9 To operate at a global scale, stablecoin issuers would\ntherefore have to issue the same stablecoin under multiple regimes with separate reserve\n8 See Regulation (EU) 2023/1114 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 May 2023 on\nmarkets in crypto-assets, and amending Regulations (EU) No 1093/2010 and (EU) No 1095/2010 and\nDirectives 2013/36/EU and (EU) 2019/1937. See European Banking Authority, Draft Regulatory\nTechnical Standards to specify the highly liquid financial instruments with minimal market risk, credit risk\nand concentration risk under Article 38(5) of Regulation (EU) 2023/1114 (Paris: European Banking\nAuthority, June 2024), https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-06/d92b94f8-8260-43b6-abae-\nd21e022414ed/Final%20report_draft%20RTS%20to%20specify%20the%20HLFI%20in%20the%20reserv\ne%20of%20assets%20Article%2038%205.pdf and European Banking Authority, Draft Regulatory\nTechnical Standards to further specify the liquidity requirements of the reserve of assets\nunder Article 36(4) of Regulation (EU) 2023/1114 (Paris: European Banking Authority, June 2024),\nhttps://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-06/580db2f3-8370-4927-baa3-\n0f995722b417/Final%20report_draft%20RTS%20further%20specifying%20the%20liquidity%20requireme\nnts%20Article%2036%204.pdf.\n9 For example, see “Virtual Currency Guidance,” New York State Department of Financial Services, last\nmodified June 8, 2022,\nhttps://www.dfs.ny.gov/industry_guidance/industry_letters/il20220608_issuance_stablecoins.\n\n- 10 -\nasset and redemption requirements. Will this be efficient and ultimately prove workable\nif the number of regulatory regimes domestically and internationally continue to grow?\nWill we expect a stablecoin issuer to rebalance its reserves when a stablecoin is\ntransferred between users in different countries or U.S. states? Creating consistency at\nthe federal level could allow federal authorities to negotiate with foreign counterparts to\nensure global regulations serve the interests of U.S. consumers and businesses and allow\nthe U.S. to be a regulation setter for an asset class primarily denominated in our national\nunit of account.\nIn conclusion, my hope is that the stablecoin market will grow or diminish on the\nmerits of their benefits to consumers and the broader economy. For the private sector,\nthat means continuing to develop innovative solutions that fit a market need while\nbuilding sustainable business models. And for the public sector, it means setting clear\nand targeted legal and regulatory frameworks and coordinating those frameworks across\nstates and national boundaries to enable private sector innovation at a global scale.\nThank you.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n10:30 a.m. EDT (4:30 p.m. local time)\nMay 11, 2023\nClimate Change and Financial Stability\nRemarks by\nChristopher J. Waller\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nIE University – Banco de España – Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Conference\nCurrent Challenges in Economics and Finance\nMadrid, Spain\nMay 11, 2023\n\nThank you for inviting me to speak today.\nClimate change is real, but I do not believe it poses a serious risk to the safety and\nsoundness of large banks or the financial stability of the United States.1 Risks are risks.\nThere is no need for us to focus on one set of risks in a way that crowds out our focus on\nothers. My job is to make sure that the financial system is resilient to a range of risks.\nAnd I believe risks posed by climate change are not sufficiently unique or material to\nmerit special treatment relative to others.2 Nevertheless, I think it’s important to continue\ndoing high-quality academic research regarding the role that climate plays in economic\noutcomes, such as the work presented at today’s conference.\nIn what follows, I want to be careful not to conflate my views on climate change\nitself with my views on how we should deal with financial risks associated with climate\nchange. I believe the scientific community has rigorously established that our climate is\nchanging. But my role is not to be a climate policymaker. Consistent with the Fed’s\nmandates, I must focus on financial risks, and the questions I’m exploring today are about\nwhether the financial risks associated with climate change are different enough from\nother financial stability risks to merit special treatment. But before getting to those\nquestions, I’d like to briefly explain how we think about financial stability at the Federal\nReserve.\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board.\n2 While the actions the Federal Reserve has taken to date are mostly in an exploratory spirit, they could lead\nto the perception that we intend to give climate change special treatment in the future. For example, recent\nactions include the organization of a Supervision Climate Committee and a Financial Stability Climate\nCommittee, the issuance of Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial\nInstitutions in December 2022, and the pilot Climate Scenario Analysis exercise initiated with the issuance\nof scenarios in January 2023.\n\n- 2 -\nFinancial stability is at the core of the Federal Reserve and our mission. The\nFederal Reserve was created in 1913, following the Banking Panic of 1907, with the goal\nof promoting financial stability and avoiding banking panics. Responsibilities have\nevolved over the years. In the aftermath of the 2007-09 financial crisis, Congress\nassigned the Fed additional responsibilities related to promoting financial stability, and\nthe Board of Governors significantly increased the resources dedicated to that purpose.\nEvents in recent years, including the pandemic, emerging geopolitical risks, and recent\nstress in the banking sector have only highlighted the important role central banks have in\nunderstanding and addressing financial stability risks. The Federal Reserve’s goal in\nfinancial stability is to help ensure that financial institutions and financial markets remain\nable to provide critical services to households and businesses so that they can continue to\nsupport a well-functioning economy through the business cycle.\nMuch of how we think about and monitor financial stability at the Federal\nReserve is informed by our understanding of how shocks can propagate across financial\nmarkets and affect the economy. Economists have studied the role of debt in the\nmacroeconomy dating all the way back to Irving Fisher in the 1930s, and in the past 40\nyears it has been well established that financial disruptions can reduce the efficiency of\ncredit allocation and have real effects on the broader economy.3 When borrowers’\nfinancial conditions deteriorate, lenders tend to charge higher rates on loans. That, in\nturn, can lead to less overall lending and negatively affect the broader economy.4 And in\n3 For example, Bernanke (1983) showed how financial disruptions can reduce the availability of credit and\nreduce aggregate demand, and Diamond and Dybvig (1983) showed how bank runs can affect the real\neconomy.\n4 In their articulation of the financial accelerator, Bernanke, Gertler, and Gilchrist (1999) demonstrate\nconcepts like this.\n\n- 3 -\nthe wake of the 2007-09 financial crisis, we’ve learned more about the important roles\ncredit growth and asset price growth play in “boom-bust” cycles.5\nFundamentally, financial stress emerges when someone is owed something and\ndoesn’t get paid back or becomes worried they won’t be paid back. If I take out a loan\nfrom you and can’t repay it, you take a loss. Similarly, if I take out a mortgage from a\nbank and I can’t repay it, the bank could take a loss. And if the bank hasn’t built\nsufficient ability to absorb those losses, it may not be able to pay its depositors back.\nThese dynamics can have knock-on effects on asset prices. For example, when people\ndefault on their home mortgage loans, banks foreclose and seek to sell the homes, often at\nsteep discounts. Those foreclosure sales can have contagion effects on nearby house\nprices.6 When a lot of households and businesses take such losses around the same time,\nit can have real effects on the economy as consumption and investment spending take a\nhit and overall trust in financial institutions wanes. The same process works when\nmarket participants fear they won’t be paid back or be able to sell their assets. Those\nfears themselves can drive instability.\nThe implication is that risks to financial stability have a couple of features. First,\nthe risks must have relatively near-term effects, such that the risk manifesting could result\nin outstanding contracts being breached. Second, the risks must be material enough to\ncreate losses large enough to affect the real economy.\nThese insights about vulnerabilities across the financial system inform how we\nthink about monitoring financial stability at the Federal Reserve. We identify risks and\n5 For example, see Schularick and Taylor (2012); Jorda, Schularick, and Taylor (2013); and Kiley (2021).\n6 For example, Harding, Rosenblatt, and Yao (2009) identify a contagion discount on properties close to\nforeclosed properties.\n\n- 4 -\nprioritize resources around those that are most threatening to the U.S. financial system.\nWe distinguish between shocks, which are inherently difficult to predict, and\nvulnerabilities of the financial system, which can be monitored through the ebb and flow\nof the economic cycle. If you think about it, there is a huge set of shocks that could hit at\nany given time. Some of those shocks do hit, but most do not. Our approach promotes\ngeneral resiliency, recognizing that we can’t predict, prioritize, and tailor specific policy\naround each and every shock that could occur.7\nInstead, we focus on monitoring broad groups of vulnerabilities, such as\novervalued assets, liquidity risk in the financial system, and the amount of debt held by\nhouseholds and businesses, including banks. This approach implies that we are\nsomewhat agnostic to the particular sources of shocks that may hit the economy at any\npoint in time. Risks are risks, and from a policymaking perspective, the source of a\nparticular shock isn’t as important as building a financial system that is resilient to the\nrange of risks we face. For example, it is plausible that shocks could stem from things\nranging from increasing dependence on computer systems and digital technologies to a\nshrinking labor force to geopolitical risk. Our focus on fundamental vulnerabilities like\nasset overvaluation, excessive leverage, and liquidity risk in part reflects our humility\nabout our ability to identify the probabilities of each and every potential shock to our\nsystem in real time.\nLet me provide a tangible example from our capital stress test for the largest\nbanks. We use that stress test to ensure banks have sufficient capital to withstand the\ntypes of severe credit-driven recessions we’ve experienced in the United States since\n7 There are also unanticipated risks, which makes it all the more important to be comprehensive and\neffective in mitigating known risks.\n\n- 5 -\nWorld War II.8 We use a design framework for the hypothetical scenarios that results in\nsharp declines in asset prices coupled with a steep rise in the unemployment rate, but we\ndon’t detail the specific shocks that cause the recession because it isn’t necessary. What\nis important is that banks have enough capital to absorb losses associated with those\nhighly adverse conditions. And the losses implied by a scenario like that are huge: last\nyear’s scenario resulted in hypothetical losses of more than $600 billion for the largest\nbanks. This resulted in a decline in their aggregate common equity capital ratio from\n12.4 percent to 9.7 percent, which is still more than double the minimum requirement.\nThat brings us back to my original question: Are the financial risks stemming\nfrom climate change somehow different or more material such that we should give them\nspecial treatment? Or should our focus remain on monitoring and mitigating general\nfinancial system vulnerabilities, which can be affected by climate change over the long-\nterm just like any number of other sources of risk? Before I answer, let me offer some\ndefinitions to make sure we’re all talking about the same things.\nClimate-related financial risks are generally separated into two groups: physical\nrisks and transition risks. Physical risks include the potential higher frequency and\nseverity of acute events, such as fires, heatwaves, and hurricanes, as well as slower\nmoving events like rising sea levels. Transition risks refer to those risks associated with\nan economy and society in transition to one that produces less greenhouse gases. These\ncan owe to government policy changes, changes in consumer preferences, and technology\ntransitions. The question is not whether these risks could result in losses for individuals\n8 The conditions characterized by severe post-war recessions with steep rises in unemployment rates and\ndeclining asset prices tend to put significant stress on the balance sheets of the largest banks, making them\nwell suited for a capital stress test.\n\n- 6 -\nor companies. The question is whether these risks are unique enough to merit special\ntreatment in our financial stability framework.\nLet’s start with physical risks. Unfortunately, like every year, it is possible we\nwill experience forest fires, hurricanes, and other natural disasters in the coming months.\nThese events, of course, are devastating to local communities. But they are not material\nenough to pose an outsized risk to the overall U.S. economy.\nBroadly speaking, physical risks could affect the financial system through two\nrelated channels. First, physical risks can have a direct impact on property values.\nHurricanes, fires, and rising sea levels can all drive down the values of properties. That\nin turn could put stress on financial institutions that lend against those properties, which\ncould lead them to curb their lending, and suppress economic growth. The losses that\nindividual property owners can realize might be devastating, but evidence I’ve seen so far\nsuggests that these sorts of events don’t have much of an effect on bank performance.9\nThat may be in part attributable to banks and other investors effectively pricing physical\nrisks from climate change into loan contracts. For example, recently researchers have\nfound that heat stress—a climate physical risk that is likely to affect the economy—has\nbeen priced into bond spreads and stock returns since around 2013.10 In addition, while it\nis difficult to isolate the effects of weather events on the broader economy, there is\nevidence to suggest severe weather events like hurricanes do not likely have an outsized\neffect on growth rates in countries like the United States.11\n9 Blickle, Hamerling, and Morgan (2021) study FEMA disasters and find that they have an insignificant or\nsmall effect on U.S. banks’ performance.\n10 See Acharya, Johnson, Sundaresan, and Tomunen (2022).\n11 See Linder, Peach, and Stein (2013) for a study of the effect of Hurricane Sandy on the economy.\n\n- 7 -\nOver time, it is possible some of these physical risks could contribute to an\nexodus of people from certain cities or regions. For example, some worry that rising sea\nlevels could significantly change coastal regions. While the cause may be different, the\nexperience of broad property value declines is not a new one. We have had entire\nAmerican cities that have experienced significant declines in population and property\nvalues over time. Take, for example, Detroit. In 1950, Detroit was the fifth largest city\nin the United States, but now it isn’t even in the top 20, after losing two-thirds of its\npopulation. I’m thrilled to see that Detroit has made a comeback in recent years, but the\nrelocation of the automobile industry took a serious toll on the city and its people. Yet\nthe decline in Detroit’s population, and commensurate decline in property values, did not\npose a financial stability risk to the United States. What makes the potential future risk\nof a population decline in coastal cities different?\nSecond, and a more compelling concern, is the notion that property value declines\ncould occur more-or-less instantaneously and on a large scale when, say, property\ninsurers leave a region en masse. That sort of rapid decline in property values, which\nserve as collateral on loans, could certainly result in losses for banks and other financial\nintermediaries. But there is a growing body of literature that suggests economic agents\nare already adjusting behavior to account for risks associated with climate change.12 That\nshould mitigate the risk of these potential “Minsky moments.”13 For the sake of\nargument though, suppose a great repricing does occur; would those losses be big enough\nto spill over into the broader financial system? Just as a point of comparison, let’s turn\n12 For example, in addition to the previously mentioned Acharya et al. paper, in a recent paper Meisenzahl\n(2023) shows that banks have reduced lending in areas more affected by climate change.\n13 Based on the work of economist Hyman Minsky, this is the sudden onset of a market crash when\nsentiment shifts following a period of rapid speculative growth.\n\n- 8 -\nback to the stress tests I mentioned earlier. Each year the Federal Reserve stresses the\nlargest banks against a hypothetical severe macroeconomic scenario. The stress tests\ndon’t cover all risks, of course, but that scenario typically assumes broad real estate price\ndeclines of more than 25 percent across the United States. In last year’s stress test, the\nlargest banks were able to absorb nearly $100 billion in losses on loans collateralized by\nreal estate, in addition to another half a trillion dollars of losses on other positions.14\nWhat about transition risks? Transition risks are generally neither near-term nor\nlikely to be material given their slow-moving nature and the ability of economic agents to\nprice transition costs into contracts. There seems to be a consensus that orderly\ntransitions will not pose a risk to financial stability.15 In that case, changes would be\ngradual and predictable. Households and businesses are generally well prepared to adjust\nto slow-moving and predicable changes. As are banks. For example, if banks know that\ncertain industries will gradually become less profitable or assets pledged as collateral will\nbecome stranded, they will account for that in their loan pricing, loan duration, and risk\nassessments. And, because assets held by banks in the United States reprice in less than\nfive years on average, there is ample time to adjust to all but the most abrupt of\ntransitions.16\nBut what if the transition is disorderly? One argument is that uncertainty\nassociated with a disorderly transition will make it difficult for households and businesses\n14 Total losses were $612 billion, of which losses on first-lien mortgages, home equity, and commercial real\nestate loans were $98.8 billion. See https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/2022-dfast-results-\n20220623.pdf.\n15 In their reports on climate-related risks to the financial system, both the Financial Stability Board (2020)\nand the Financial Stability Oversight Council (2021) indicate that risks to the financial system associated\nwith an orderly transition are most likely contained.\n16 Drechsler, Savov, and Schnabl (2021) estimated the average asset repricing maturity between 1997 and\n2013 was 4.23 years.\n\n- 9 -\nto plan. It is certainly plausible that there could be swings in policy, and those swings\ncould lead to changes in earnings expectations for companies, property values, and the\nvalue of commodities. But policy development is often disorderly and subject to the\nuncertainty of changing economic realities. In the United States, we have a long history\nof sweeping policy changes ranging from revisions to the tax code to things like changes\nin healthcare coverage and environmental policies. While these policy changes can\ncertainly affect the composition of industries, the connection to broader financial stability\nis far less clear. And when policies are found to have large and damaging consequences,\npolicymakers always have, and frequently make use of, the option to adjust course to\nlimit those disruptions.\nThere are also concerns that technology development associated with climate\nchange will be disorderly. Much technology development is disorderly. That is why\ninnovators are often referred to as “disruptors.” So, what makes climate-related\ninnovations more disruptive or less predictable than other innovations? Like the\ninnovations of the automobile and the cell phone, I’d expect those stemming from the\ndevelopment of cleaner fuels and more efficient machines to be welfare-increasing on\nnet.\nSo where does that leave us? I don’t see a need for special treatment for climate-\nrelated risks in our financial stability monitoring and policies. As policymakers, we must\nbalance the broad set of risks we face, and we have a responsibility to prioritize using\nevidence and analysis. Based on what I’ve seen so far, I believe that placing an outsized\nfocus on climate-related risks is not needed, and the Federal Reserve should focus on\nmore near-term and material risks in keeping with our mandate.\n\n- 10 -\nI’d be happy to take a few questions.\n\n- 11 -\nReferences\nAcharya, Viral V., Timothy Johnson, Suresh Sundaresan, and Tuomas Tomunen. 2022.\n“Is Physical Climate Risk Priced?

    "text": "For release on delivery\n9:00 a.m. EDT\nMay 21, 2024\nLittle by Little, Progress Seems to be Resuming.\nRemarks by\nChristopher J. Waller\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nPeterson Institute for International Economics\nWashington, D.C.\nMay 21, 2024\n\nThank you, Adam, and thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today.1 The\nPeterson Institute is renowned for its valuable contributions to research and its influence\non economic policy. There really is no better place for a central banker to come and talk\nabout the outlook for the U.S. economy and the implications for monetary policy. It truly\nis a pleasure to be here. Peterson was also the host for my first speech as a governor back\nin early 2021, which unfortunately, was virtual.2 So, after an eventful three years, it’s\nnice to be back and in person.\nAfter a run of great data in the latter half of 2023, it seemed that significant\nprogress on inflation would continue and that rate cuts were not far off. However, the\nfirst three months of 2024 threw cold water on that outlook, as data on both inflation and\neconomic activity came in much hotter than anticipated. Initially it seemed like the bad\ndata might be simply a “bump” in the road, but as the data continued to point in the\nwrong direction, the narrative quickly turned towards concerns that the economy was not\ncooling as needed to keep inflation moving down toward the Federal Open Market\nCommittee’s (FOMC) 2 percent goal. Progress on inflation appeared to have stalled and\nthere were fears that it might even be accelerating. Suddenly, the public debate became\nwhether monetary policy was restrictive enough and if rate hikes should be back on the\ntable.\nBut more recent data on the economy indicate that restrictive monetary policy is\nhelping to cool off aggregate demand and the inflation data for April suggests that\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee.\n2See Christopher J. Waller (2021), “Treasury–Federal Reserve Cooperation and the Importance of Central\nBank Independence,” speech delivered at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, Washington,\nD.C. (via webcast), March 29, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20210329a.htm.\n\n- 2 -\nprogress toward 2 percent has likely resumed. Central bankers should never say never,\nbut the data suggests that inflation isn’t accelerating, and I believe that further increases\nin the policy rate are probably unnecessary.\nNow let me turn to the data we have seen since the last FOMC meeting. Real\ngross domestic product (GDP) grew at about a 4 percent annual pace in the second half of\n2023, and that stepped down to 1.6 percent in the first quarter on this year. That looked\nlike the kind of moderation that would support progress on inflation, but it was mostly\ndue to two components that tend to be volatile and not reflect fundamental growth—trade\nin goods and services and additions to inventories. Private domestic final purchases—\nwhich is often a better signal of the underlying strength of demand in the economy—\ngrew 3.1 percent in the first three months of this year, almost exactly the pace in the\nsecond half of 2023. I will be watching closely to see whether this measure of economic\nactivity in the first quarter continues in the second. The Blue Chip consensus of private-\nsector forecasts projects real GDP growth of 2.1 percent this quarter, with only a slight\nmoderation in personal consumption expenditures (PCE) from the first quarter. Others,\nlike the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow model, have a higher forecast.\nNevertheless, there are several reasons why I do expect some moderation in\neconomic activity. One sign of moderation is that retail sales were flat in April and\nrevised down in the previous two months. Retail sales are an important component of\nconsumer spending, so this suggests that consumers may be tempering their purchases.\nWe have also seen credit card and auto loan delinquency rates rise above their pre-\npandemic levels, which indicates that some consumer segments are under stress to\n\n- 3 -\nsupport their spending levels. That said, services spending data are continuing to look\nsolid and should hold up overall spending in this quarter.\nAnother sign of moderation in the economy comes from the Institute for Supply\nManagement’s (ISM) survey of purchasing managers, those who make spending and\ninvestment decisions for businesses. For the first time in four years, the indexes for\nsurveys of both manufacturing and non-manufacturing businesses slipped below 50 in\nApril, indicating that production in these businesses was contracting. This wasn’t\nsurprising for manufacturing businesses, since they have been reporting weakness in\nemployment and inventories for some time. The surprise was that the survey of non-\nmanufacturing businesses, representing the lion’s share of U.S. output, fell below 50,\nindicating a deceleration in activity. This has not happened since December 2022. ISM\nresults can move around from month to month, but if these numbers are sustained, it\nwould be indicative of slowing economic activity beyond manufacturing.\nOne month does not constitute a trend, but this data suggests that policy is doing\nits job to moderate aggregate demand, which will support renewed progress in lowering\ninflation.\nNow let me speak about the labor market. The labor market is still relatively\nstrong and supporting a solid pace of job creation, but after progress in bringing demand\nand supply into better balance in 2023, this rebalancing seemed to stall at the beginning\nof this year.\nThen in the past month or two, the easing of demand, relative to supply seems to\nhave resumed. The hiring rate, reported by the Labor Department, slowed relative to the\nprevious three months. In March, the share of workers who voluntarily quit their jobs\n\n- 4 -\ndeclined, with the quits rate falling below pre-pandemic levels. This is a sign that fewer\nworkers are jumping to a new and usually higher-paying job. That means firms are in\nless need to fill vacancies and offer relatively high starting salaries, something that could\nsupport moderating wage increases.\nJob creation fell from 315,000 in March to 175,000 in April. A big reason for the\ndecline was a sharp drop in the pace of job creation by state and local governments that is\nunlikely to be repeated, but private sector job creation also fell, another indication that\ndemand for workers continues to slow. That was also the message I take from the\nunemployment rate in April, which ticked up to 3.9 percent. It was the 27th consecutive\nmonth that unemployment has been below 4 percent, the longest stretch in decades, but it\nstands noticeably higher than the 3.4 percent rate last April. Meanwhile, the ratio of job\nvacancies to people looking for work fell to 1.3, just a tenth of a point above the pre-\npandemic level and a sign that the relative shortage of workers related to the pandemic is\nclose to over.\nWage growth is still a bit higher than I believe is needed to be consistent with our\n2 percent target, but it’s not that high and recent average hourly earnings data suggest that\nwage growth is moderating. And some measures of wage growth that tend to be forward-\nlooking have also continued to slow on balance.\nJust like the data on economic activity, I see the labor market data supporting\nrenewed progress in lowering inflation, so now let me turn to the outlook for inflation.\nLast week’s report on consumer price index (CPI) inflation in April was a\nwelcome relief after three months without progress toward 2 percent. That said, the\nprogress was so modest that it did not change my view that I will need to see more\n\n- 5 -\nevidence of moderating inflation before supporting any easing of monetary policy. If I\nwere still a professor and had to assign a grade to this inflation report, it would be a C+—\nfar from failing but not stellar either.\nHeadline CPI inflation rose 0.31 percent month over month. That barely budged\nthe 12-month total CPI inflation reading to 3.4 percent in April from 3.5 percent in\nMarch. More importantly for the inflation outlook, core CPI inflation, which excludes\nfood and energy prices, came in at 0.29 percent, down from 0.36 percent in March and\n12-month core CPI fell to 3.6 percent from 3.8 percent.\nAccounting for price data from the report last week on the producer price index,\nforecasts are predicting both monthly headline and core inflation based on personal\nconsumption expenditures, the FOMC’s preferred gauge, rose a bit less than CPI last\nmonth. Most forecasts seem to be in the range of 0.23 to 0.26 percent, which is less than\nMarch’s monthly increase of 0.32 percent. Although both March and April may round to\n0.3 percent, it is good to see monthly inflation falling, even if it requires looking out to\nthe second decimal point.\nLooking across these estimates, they suggest three-month annualized core PCE\ninflation could decline around 1 percentage point to about 3.4 percent as the outsized\nJanuary increase rolls off the 3-month average. Like the CPI inflation numbers, this is\nnot where I want to see inflation. But, after having these three-month readings accelerate\nin January, February, and March, I’m happy to see a reversal of this recent pattern. It\nleaves me hopeful that progress toward 2 percent inflation is back on track.\nBefore I say more about the implications for policy, this seems like a good\nmoment to make a few points about a bedrock principle of monetary policy—data\n\n- 6 -\ndependence. The appropriate setting of monetary policy requires understanding how the\neconomy is performing and some idea of where we think it is going. The latter typically\nmeans making a forecast or projection, based on standard macroeconomic models, of key\nvariables and what that implies for policy. But that forecast must be validated by the\nincoming data. The economy is dynamic, and sometimes new or revised data can\nsignificantly change one’s understanding of economic conditions and the outlook, which\nhas implications for monetary policy. One data point alone should not change one’s view\nof the economy, and that is why changes in one’s outlook and the appropriate path for\npolicy tend to emerge gradually and over time. While you may have confidence in your\nforecast, incoming data may challenge that confidence. You neither want to overreact to\nincoming data nor do you want to ignore it.\nI am bringing this up because I hear from some quarters the claim that the FOMC\nhas become “overly data dependent.” This is a phrase that honestly doesn’t make much\nsense to me but is apparently supposed to mean that we are over-reacting to data and\nallegedly sending confusing messages about the stance of monetary policy.\nI don’t see how that argument applies to the views of the FOMC, if one looks at\nthe Summary of Economic Projections (SEP). Between the March SEP in 2023 and\nMarch 2024 SEP, the Committee median was relatively consistent in projecting around\nthree rate cuts in 2024. This was in the face of some pretty dramatic shocks to the\neconomy. There were the bank failures and wider stress in the financial system in the\nspring of 2023, when it was far from clear what the ultimate effects would be on the\neconomy. There were significant fluctuations in inflation, which was hot in the first half\nof last year and then dramatically cooler in the second half. There was the revelation,\n\n- 7 -\nover time and in different data, that a surge in immigration was augmenting labor supply\nand allowing a surge in job growth with very little upward pressure on wages and\ninflation. And then there were geopolitical developments, such as the threat that war in\nthe Middle East might spread to become a wider conflict.\nAgainst this backdrop, the median FOMC participant only gradually reduced their\nexpectation for the unemployment rate at the end of 2024 and essentially left inflation\nunchanged. Associated with this outlook, the median projection for the appropriate level\nof the federal funds rate at the end of 2024 moved by at most 50 basis points between the\nfour SEPs over 2024, and more or less held to the median of three 25 basis point rate cuts\nover the past year. This hardly seems like an “overly data dependent” Fed to me. For\nillustration purposes, contrast that with how the private sector reacted to developments in\n2023. The implied federal funds rate based on overnight interest swap quotes for the end\nof 2024 see-sawed between 2 rate cuts and 10 cuts—for a few days, markets even\npredicted 11 cuts—and by the end of 2023 ended up implying 6 cuts.\nI make this comparison not to denigrate what markets were doing—they were\nsimply revising their forecasts and accompanying risk outlook based on the data to\nmaximize the value of their trading books. My point is that the approach of the FOMC is\nto set policy appropriately to achieve our dual mandate and typically that requires us to\nmove gradually, extract the signal from noise from the incoming data and then adjust\npolicy accordingly. Based on the evidence over the past year, I see nothing excessive\nabout our data dependence when projecting the appropriate policy path.\nLet me now turn to the implications for monetary policy of my outlook for the\nU.S. economy. With the labor market as strong as it is, my focus remains bringing\n\n- 8 -\ninflation down toward the FOMC’s 2 percent goal. The latest CPI data was a reassuring\nsignal that inflation is not accelerating and data on spending and the labor market suggest\nto me that monetary policy is at an appropriate setting to put downward pressure on\ninflation. While the April inflation data represents progress, the amount of progress was\nsmall, reflected in the fact that I needed to report the monthly numbers to two decimal\nplaces to show progress. The economy now seems to be evolving closer to what the\nCommittee expected. Nevertheless, in the absence of a significant weakening in the labor\nmarket, I need to see several more months of good inflation data before I would be\ncomfortable supporting an easing in the stance of monetary policy. What do I mean by\ngood data? What grade do I need to give future inflation reports? I will keep that to\nmyself for now but let’s say that I look forward to the day when I don’t have to go out\ntwo or three decimal places in the monthly inflation data to find the good news.\nThank you.",

One way is by influencing the labor market, so\nnext I will give an update about labor market conditions and how I expect them to evolve.\nI’ll then turn to the outlook for inflation, where we saw moderation in some measures in\nOctober, but to a level that remains unacceptably high. I’ll finish up with how I expect\nmonetary policy will evolve in the coming months to reduce inflation and return it to the\nFederal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) 2 percent goal.\nEconomic growth in the United States has slowed significantly in 2022, and I\nexpect that slow growth to continue into next year. After shrinking slightly in the first\nhalf of this year, real gross domestic product rebounded in the third quarter to a 2.6\npercent annual growth rate. But all indications are that this was a temporary boost, and\nthat weak growth has returned in the last quarter of this year and will persist into 2023.\nConsumer and business spending has softened, amid deteriorating business sentiment in\nmost sectors of the economy and near-record-low readings on surveys of consumer\nattitudes about the economy. There is no secret about why—inflation is very high,\nsomething people are reminded of every day when they see the prices of things they buy\ngo up. On top of that, higher interest rates are raising borrowing costs for businesses and\nhouseholds.\n\n- 2 -\nAt any other time, I would be pretty unhappy about slowing growth, but not now.\nIf you believe, as I do, that supply bottlenecks in the economy have mostly abated and\nthat elevated inflation is primarily a function of high demand, then slowing down\neconomic growth is absolutely necessary to bring inflation down to our 2 percent target.\nThis slowing in activity is a sign that actions taken by the Federal Reserve this year to\nreduce inflation are working. Let me take a few minutes to explain how.\nThe Federal Reserve tightens monetary policy to reduce inflation primarily by\nraising short-term interest rates, which has the effect of boosting interest rates throughout\nthe economy. Higher borrowing costs curtail spending and investment by households\nand businesses. Since the FOMC pivoted in late 2021 in response to upwardly revised\nlabor data and higher than anticipated inflation data, rates for 30-year fixed-rate home\nmortgages are up from around 3 percent to 7 percent today. Rates for triple-B corporate\nbonds have roughly doubled in 2022, and rates on higher yield debt have increased even\nmore. As a result, there is a slowdown in the volume of financing in most markets, with\nsome effect on various prices.\nThe sector that has seen the most significant slowing is housing. New home\nconstruction and new and existing home sales, which grew strongly before and during the\npandemic, have all fallen in 2022. As purchases of homes fall, so does demand for goods\nthat typically accompany purchases—new carpeting, new furniture, new lawn mowers\nand so on. So slowing home sales will decrease demand for goods that complement the\npurchase of a new home and that will put downward pressure on the prices of those\ngoods.\n\n- 3 -\nFurthermore, housing prices that were increasing at an annual rate of 20 percent\nas late as May slowed to about a 2 percent rate in October, according to data from Zillow.\nHousing may be the first but won’t be the last sector of the economy where higher\ninterest rates will have the effect of dampening demand and will ultimately help moderate\nprice increases. Our goal is to rein in demand, bringing demand and supply into better\nbalance, which will help reduce upward pressure on inflation.\nOne sector where improving this balance will be crucial is the labor market. Even\nas economic output has slowed, the labor market remains very tight. While there was\nroughly one job vacancy for every job seeker in what was a strong labor market before\nthe pandemic, now there are almost two jobs for every person looking for work. Wages\nhave been rising more quickly than they have in decades, much faster than productivity\ngrowth plus 2 percentage points that I think of as consistent with the FOMC’s 2 percent\ninflation objective. But I do see tentative signs of some cooling in the labor market,\nwhich is vital to keep rising labor costs from putting upward pressure on inflation.\nThe employment report published November 4 showed that payrolls grew by\n261,000 in October. This increase, while large, was a step down from the pace earlier\nthis year, when payrolls grew an average of 539,000 per month in the first quarter,\n340,000 per month in the second quarter and 381,000 per month in the third quarter. At\nthe same time, we also saw the unemployment rate tick up to 3.7 percent, though still\nclose to its more than 50-year low.\nOther labor market data are also showing evidence of slight cooling. Various\nsurveys of job vacancies are down from their peaks reached in March but are still\nhistorically very high. There have been some tech layoffs, which had been one of the\n\n- 4 -\nfastest growing parts of the economy, but so far not in other sectors. And quits—which\nare mainly workers switching jobs for higher pay—are also down from their peak late last\nyear.\nThese tentative signs of cooling are mixed with many stories of continued labor\nmarket tightness. Business contacts tell me of empty offices and idle production capacity\nbecause employers cannot find workers. Retailers who hire seasonal workers say they\nwill try to hold onto these employees after the holidays to fill future vacancies from\nattrition. And that is even with some expectation of slower sales growth in the next\ncouple quarters.\nThat said, we are starting to see some tentative signs of a moderation in wage\ngrowth. The 12-month increase in average hourly earnings continued to slow in October\nand the 3-month change continued to run lower than the 12-month rate, a promising\nsignal of ongoing moderation. Wage growth has been a contributing factor to inflation,\nespecially in the service sector, so it is important to get the labor market into better\nbalance to bring future wage growth down to a more sustainable level that will assist in\nmoving overall inflation lower.\nLet me now turn to the outlook for inflation. Last week’s consumer price index\n(CPI) report was a very welcome moderation in the pace of increasing prices. Headline\ninflation rose 0.4 percent from September to October, the same pace as the month before,\nand was up 7.7 percent over the previous 12 months, down from 8.2 percent in September\nand 9.1 percent as recently as June. Core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices,\nincreased 0.3 percent in October from September, a marked step-down from the 0.6\npercent readings in the previous two months and the average of 0.5 percent over the first\n\n- 5 -\nnine months of 2022. On a twelve-month change, core inflation came in at about 6.3\npercent, down from 6.6 percent the previous month. The step down in October was\nwidespread, involving both a deceleration in services prices and the first decline in core\ngoods prices since March.\nThough welcome news, we must be cautious about reading too much into one\ninflation report. I don’t know how sustained this deceleration in consumer prices will be.\nBut, as a snapshot, the 0.3 percent increase in core CPI inflation in October from\nSeptember, (actually 0.27 percent rounded up) works out to an annualized rate of about\n3.25 percent. I focus on core over headline inflation because I believe it is a better\nindication of future inflation. This increase is much improved from the past several\nmonths but still very far from our 2 percent target. Looking at the categories that make\nup the CPI, we see that about half still have inflation over 3 percent. And, if you weight\nthe categories by their contributions to the CPI, over 70 percent of the CPI basket\ncontinues to see inflation above 3 percent.\nI cannot emphasize enough that one report does not make a trend. It is way too\nearly to conclude that inflation is headed sustainably down. In 2021, monthly core CPI\ninflation fell during the summer—it fell from 0.9 percent in April 2021 to 0.2 percent in\nAugust 2021 before accelerating back to 0.6 percent and 0.5 percent in October and\nNovember of that year. More recently, monthly core CPI inflation fell from 0.7 percent\nin June 2022 to 0.3 percent in July, only to rebound to 0.6 percent the next two months.\nWe’ve seen this movie before, so it is too early to know if it will have a different ending\nthis time.\n\n- 6 -\nInflation remains too high relative to the FOMC’s target, and I thought it would\nbe helpful to offer some detail of what I will be looking at to see continuing improvement\nin the inflation outlook. One area is goods inflation, where there was a widespread\ndeceleration across durables and nondurables in October. With drops in core import\nprices and processed materials excluding food and energy over the past few months, I’m\nlooking for continued downward pressure on core goods prices going forward.\nHousing, which is a large share of expenses for households, is another sector I\nwill be watching closely in the months ahead as an indicator of the direction of overall\ninflation. As I discussed in a recent speech, escalating rents have played a large role in\ndriving up inflation this year, and because turnover of leases occurs only periodically, I\nexpect measures of rents and the equivalent for homeowners will continue to increase\nsignificantly for at least several more months.1 But I will be watching for signs of\nmoderation.\nFinally, I will be looking for a slowing in price increases in non-housing services,\nwhich have been quite robust in recent months and running at about twice their pre-\npandemic level. As I said a moment ago, the inflation outlook for this sector will partly\ndepend on the growth of wages. I will be looking closely for continued slowing in wage\ngrowth back to a more sustainable rate. Given that medium- and longer-term inflation\nexpectations remain stable, an indication that investors and consumers retain confidence\nin the Fed’s commitment and ability to achieve its inflation goal, I believe we can expect\nwage growth to slow.\n1 See Christopher J. Waller (2022), “The Economic Outlook with a Look at the Housing Market,” speech\ndelivered at the Mark C. Berger Workshop Series, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky, October\n6, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20221006a.htm.\n\n- 7 -\nSo, the recent CPI report is a positive development, but I’ll need to see further\nprogress. Like many others, I hope this report is the beginning of a meaningful and\npersistent decline in inflation. But policymakers cannot act based on hope. I will not be\nhead-faked by one report and will continue to watch the data between now and the\nDecember FOMC meeting before deciding on the next step for policy.\nNow let me turn to the implications of this outlook for monetary policy. Since my\nlast outlook speech in October, we have gotten some additional data that reinforces my\nsense that the labor market may be loosening, and that inflation pressure may be easing.\nBut as I said a moment ago, this hasn’t been sufficient to significantly alter my outlook or\nmy view of appropriate monetary policy. Achieving the FOMC’s dual mandate of\nmaximum employment and price stability is still a one-sided campaign. With the labor\nmarket still strong and extremely tight, the Committee does not face a trade-off between\nemployment and inflation. Inflation has been running significantly above our objective\nfor more than a year, so monetary policy can and must be used aggressively to reduce it.\nTo pursue that goal, the Federal Reserve has been aggressive. In nine months, we\nhave raised the target range for the federal funds rate from near zero to 3-3/4 to 4 percent,\na historically rapid pace of increases. In addition to that, the Fed is continuing to reduce\nits balance sheet each month by allowing the runoff of maturing securities, which\nsupports the tightening of financial conditions.\nDespite these actions, I believe that policy is barely in restrictive territory today,\nso more interest rate hikes are needed to get inflation down. In the FOMC’s November\nstatement, the Committee added two new sentences on its view of the future path of\n\n- 8 -\npolicy, elaborating on our “reaction function,” which is the basis for those future\ndecisions. 2 Let me explain how I view this new language.\nThe first new sentence is about “where we are going,” which is the level of\ninterest rates at which it will be appropriate to stop hiking. If asked what that sentence\nmeans, I would say that, with the current strength and outlook for the labor market, my\ndecision for the “terminal rate” for policy will focus on progress toward our inflation\ngoal. So, assuming the labor market and financial stability remain in check, the endpoint\nof the tightening path is highly dependent on the evolution of the inflation data.\nThe second new sentence in the statement is about “how” we will get to the\nterminal rate—that is, the pace of rate increases to arrive at that destination. The FOMC\nlanguage notes the pace will depend on several factors. The first is “the cumulative\ntightening of monetary policy.” I have noted how significant and aggressive this\ntightening has been. We have gone from a low interest rate economy to one with fairly\nsignificant interest rates (although in historical terms, rates are still not that high for a\ntightening cycle). There is a tendency for Fed watchers to view each meeting’s policy\ndecision as solely determined by what has happened in the preceding six weeks. For me,\nthis new sentence is an important reminder that each decision we make in the coming\nmonths will be heavily influenced by the significant, cumulative effect of the decisions\nwe made earlier this year.\nAnother factor listed by the Committee was “the lags with which monetary policy\naffects economic activity and inflation.” In my view, the Committee will reach the\n2 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2022), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC\nStatement,” press release, November 2,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/monetary20221102a1.pdf.\n\n- 9 -\nterminal rate well before inflation reaches 2 percent because of the abundance of\nevidence that it takes months, and perhaps even longer, for the full effects of a rate\nincrease to work through the economy.\nConsidering the cumulative effect of tightening and the likely lags for policy\ndoesn’t mean these factors are more important than new information about the economy.\nOn the contrary, new data, especially on inflation, are much more important now, well\ninto the tightening cycle, than when the only direction for the federal funds rate to go was\nup— and up by a lot.\nI am going to take a considerable risk here and employ an airplane simile to\nillustrate how I think of our past policy actions and where we are going. When an\nairplane is taking off, the pilot fires the engines as much as possible to get off the ground.\nThe goal is to get to cruising altitude quickly, so the initial ascent is steep. But as the\nplane gets closer to cruising altitude, the pilot slows the rate of ascent, while continuing\nto climb. The final cruising altitude will depend on many factors, most notably details\nabout the weather. Turbulence may force you to a higher or lower altitude, but you adjust\nas you go to have a smooth ride.\nThis is similar to our policy actions this year. When the Fed was faced with\nrapidly escalating inflation and a strong labor market, it lifted rates aggressively off the\neffective lower bound including several 75-basis-point steps. But as the policy rate gets\nhigher, the stronger is the case for slowing the rate of ascent while continuing to\nclimb. This would correspond to slowing to 50-basis-point hikes. At a certain point,\npolicy will reach an optimal cruising altitude, but we don’t know exactly what that level\nwill be because it depends on the data. Maybe new data will point to a shallower climb\n\n- 10 -\nand a lower cruising altitude, which would suggest stepping down to 25-basis point hikes.\nOr maybe it could be necessary to continue climbing a little longer to a higher final\nattitude by implementing a sequence of 50 basis point hikes. In the end, the higher we\nraise the policy rate, the more pressing it is to think about the terminal rate and how\npolicy should be adjusted to get there, but that will depend on the incoming data.\nLooking toward the FOMC’s December meeting, the data of the past few weeks\nhave made me more comfortable considering stepping down to a 50-basis-point hike.\nBut I won’t be making a judgement about that until I see more data, including the next\nPCE inflation report and the next jobs report.\nIf the FOMC were to step down to a 50-basis-point increase, it is important to\nremember that this would still be a very significant tightening action—in other words,\njust pulling back on the rate of ascent a little bit. At this angle of ascent, with policy\nalready in restrictive territory, the federal funds rate can still be increased quite rapidly\nwith several 50-basis-point increases, a pretty aggressive path for policy.\nSo, although I believe we are seeing some progress in the economy to dampen\ndemand that will help moderate inflation, we have not yet made enough progress. As I\nhave said recently, I expect that getting inflation to fall meaningfully and persistently\ntoward our 2 percent target will require increases in the federal funds rate into next year.\nWe still have a ways to go. Until then, I support continued rate increases and ongoing\nreductions in the Fed’s balance sheet to restrain aggregate demand. When we reach our\nterminal rate, how long we stay at that level will largely be driven by our progress in\nbringing down inflation.",

Waller\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nLectures of the Governor\nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development\nParis, France\nJanuary 8, 2025\n\nThank you, Alvaro, and thank you for the honor of initiating this new series of\nlectures from central bankers.1 I will begin with a few words on the U.S. economic\noutlook and the implications for monetary policy. But on this occasion, I thought it\nappropriate to then widen my perspective, to address what I see as the leading challenges\nthat OECD economies face that are of particular importance to central bankers in how we\napproach monetary policy and our other responsibilities.\nI continue to believe that the U.S. economy is on a solid footing. Real gross\ndomestic product (GDP) growth has been above 2 percent for eight of the last nine\nquarters and is expected to grow above 2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2024. Despite\nthis robust economic growth, the labor market softened over 2024, and employment is\nnow near what I judge to be the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) maximum-\nemployment objective. I have seen nothing in the data or forecasts that suggests the labor\nmarket will dramatically weaken over coming months.\nWith regard to inflation, after a period of rapid disinflation in 2022 and 2023,\nprogress appears to have stalled in the final months of 2024. Our latest reading of core\npersonal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation is 2.8 percent for the 12 months\nending in November. This is down just a bit from where it was a year earlier, at 3.2\npercent. This minimal further progress has led to calls to slow or stop reducing the policy\nrate. However, I believe that inflation will continue to make progress toward our 2\npercent goal over the medium term and that further reductions will be appropriate.\nLet me explain why I expect inflation to continue toward our goal. First, as we\nsaw a year ago when inflation briefly increased, progress has been uneven, but\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\ndisinflation is more apparent if one smooths through the recent upticks. To tease out the\nunderlying trend in inflation, I often look at the six-month percent change in core PCE\nprices, which is 2.4 percent at an annual rate for November and has mostly been moving\ndown toward 2 percent over the course of the year. Second, the monthly reading for\nNovember came in much lower than expected at 0.11 percent after rising 0.26 percent in\nOctober. Third, inflation in 2024 has largely been driven by increases in imputed prices,\nsuch as housing services and nonmarket services, which are estimated rather than directly\nobserved and I consider a less reliable guide to the balance of supply and demand across\nall goods and services in the economy. These two categories represent about one-third of\nthe core PCE basket. If you look at the prices associated with the other two-thirds of core\nPCE, they on average increased less than 2 percent over the past 12 months through\nNovember. I don’t support ignoring our best measures of prices for housing and non-\nmarket services, but I find it notable that imputed prices, rather than observed prices,\nwere driving inflation in 2024 and thus expectations of the policy rate path. Finally, the\nhigher inflation readings from early in 2024 will begin to drop out of inflation numbers in\nJanuary. This should result in a significant step-down in the 12-month inflation numbers\nthrough March.\nLooking further forward, geopolitical conflict could boost prices, as it has at times\nin recent years. In addition, tariff proposals raise the possibility that a new source of\nupward pressure on inflation could emerge in the coming year. Projections of the\neconomic impact of these possible policy changes vary widely. If, as I expect, tariffs do\nnot have a significant or persistent effect on inflation, they are unlikely to affect my view\n\n- 3 -\nof appropriate monetary policy. Of course, we need to see what policies are enacted\nbefore we can seriously consider their effects.\nSo what is my view? If the outlook evolves as I have described here, I will\nsupport continuing to cut our policy rate in 2025. The pace of those cuts will depend on\nhow much progress we make on inflation, while keeping the labor market from\nweakening. Based on the most recent Summary of Economic Projections, the median of\npolicymakers’ expected appropriate policy rate this year implies two 25 basis point cuts.2\nBut the range of views is quite large, from no cuts to as many as five cuts for different\nFOMC participants. As always, the extent of further easing will depend on what the data\ntell us about progress toward 2 percent inflation, but my bottom-line message is that I\nbelieve more cuts will be appropriate.\nLet me now turn to what I consider some of the leading challenges that will frame\nmonetary policy actions for OECD members in 2025 and beyond. Each of the issues I\nraise are sizable challenges for all OECD countries, but some are bigger challenges in\nsome places than others. I have not tried to rank these challenges in importance, so\nplease don’t take any signal from the order in which they are raised.\nI will start with the ongoing challenge all central banks face in reaching our\ntargets for inflation. While 12-month measures of headline inflation are close to target in\nmost jurisdictions, most central banks target inflation in the medium term, and indicators\nof the trajectory of future price changes, such as core inflation, are still running\npersistently above target. Like the Federal Reserve, most central banks in OECD\neconomies are gradually easing monetary policy as inflation falls. I believe policy is still\n2 The most recent Summary of Economic Projections is available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.\n\n- 4 -\nrestrictive in most cases, which should support the goals of policymakers to have\ninflation at their targets going forward.\nThis common challenge, in the months ahead, has its roots, as we all know, in the\ncommon experience of the COVID-19 pandemic. Economic conditions before and\nduring the pandemic varied widely across OECD economies, as did the focus, timing, and\nforcefulness of policy responses. The surge in inflation during the pandemic was the\nresult of both supply and demand factors, and while the timing of the inflation surge\nvaried across countries, the COVID inflation was largely a global phenomenon, as shown\nby research conducted by Federal Reserve staff.3\nA common factor that drove inflation across our economies was the disruption of\ngoods production and delivery.4 Shortages of key components and waves of COVID\nvariants repeatedly disrupted supply chains, causing inflation to persist. Fortunately,\nthese disruptions have receded, and delivery times have returned to pre-pandemic levels.\nThat said, there are many geopolitical factors that are still keeping deliveries of supplies\nvolatile, which potentially could affect economic activity and inflation.\nAnother common experience has been the fiscal response to the pandemic. The\nextent to which the fiscal policies rolled out in support of households and businesses\n3 For example, Cascaldi-Garcia and others (2024) document that both the core and noncore components of\nheadline inflation measures co-moved strongly across countries during the pandemic and inflation episode;\nsee Danilo Cascaldi-Garcia, Luca Guerrieri, Matteo Iacoviello, and Michele Modugno (2024), “Lessons\nfrom the Co-movement of Inflation around the World,” FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of\nthe Federal Reserve System, June 28), https://doi.org/10.17016/2380-7172.3543.\n4 For an early account of the role of supply chain disruptions in fueling the global rise in producer and\nconsumer prices, see Ozge Akinci, Gianluca Benigno, Ruth Cesar Heymann, Julian di Giovanni, Jan J.J.\nGroen, Lawrence Lin, and Adam I. Noble (2022), “The Global Supply Side of Inflationary Pressures,”\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York, Liberty Street Economics (blog), January 28,\nhttps://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2022/1/the-global-supply-side-of-inflationary-pressures. On\nthe transmission of supply disruptions to global value chains, see François de Soyres, Alexandre Gaillard,\nAna Maria Santacreu, and Dylan Moore (2024), “Supply Disruptions and Fiscal Stimulus: Transmission\nthrough Global Value Chains,” AEA Papers and Proceedings, vol. 114 (May), pp. 112–17.\n\n- 5 -\nduring the pandemic contributed to inflation is the subject of ongoing debate.5\nRegardless of their effects on inflation, fiscal policy actions across OECD countries led to\na doubling and tripling of budget deficits as a percentage of GDP with even larger\npercentages in some places. Those deficits have steadily fallen since then but are still\nhigher in many countries than before the pandemic, and debt levels have grown for many\nOECD members.\nAnother recent challenge for OECD economies is the widespread weakness in\nmanufacturing. Manufacturing boomed in many places with the onset of the pandemic,\nwhen consumers switched their spending from in-person services to goods. But as\nbusinesses and economies reopened with the easing of pandemic-related restrictions, the\nswing to service spending by consumers began what has been a sustained slide in\nmanufacturing in OECD economies. This slide has been compounded by three other\nfactors. First, because manufacturing is capital intensive, interest rate increases over the\npast couple of years raised capital costs in this sector. As monetary policy eases across\ncountries, this effect may unwind. Also, higher energy costs after Russia’s attack on\nUkraine have hurt manufacturing more than other sectors. And lastly, China’s push to\nreduce its reliance on imports and expand its global market share in sectors such as autos\nhas had a big impact across OECD economies. While the manufacturing sector is a\n5 See, for example, Robert J. Barro and Francesco Bianchi (2023), “Fiscal Influences on Inflation in OECD\nCountries, 2020-2023,” NBER Working Paper Series 31838 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of\nEconomic Research, November; revised January 2025), https://www.nber.org/papers/w31838;\nDomenico Giannone and Giorgio Primiceri (2024), “The Drivers of Post-Pandemic Inflation,” NBER\nWorking Paper Series 32859 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic Research, August),\nhttps://www.nber.org/papers/w32859; and Karen Dynan and Doug Elmendorf (2024), “Fiscal Policy and\nthe Pandemic-Era Surge in US Inflation: Lessons for the Future,” PIIE Working Papers 24-22\n(Washington: Peterson Institute for International Economics, December),\nhttps://www.piie.com/publications/working-papers/2024/fiscal-policy-and-pandemic-era-surge-us-\ninflation-lessons-future.\n\n- 6 -\nsmaller share of economic activity in the United States than in some other OECD\ncountries, we shall see whether the weakness in global manufacturing is affected by the\nprospect of changes in trade policy in the U.S. and elsewhere. The extent and timing of\ntariffs are highly uncertain, as are the effects. Overall, the evolution of manufacturing\nadds uncertainty to the forecasts of central bankers’ outlooks.\nA short-to-medium-term challenge that is and will remain widespread among\nOECD countries is geopolitical risk. Indexes of geopolitical risk suggest that risks are\nelevated, but not nearly as high as they were when Russia invaded Ukraine in February\n2022. Today however, you certainly can’t see much evidence for geopolitical risk\naffecting financial markets. But geopolitical risk will nevertheless remain a challenge\nthat central bankers will need to keep in mind. The outbreak of war in Europe and, more\nrecently, in the Middle East were shocking developments that continue to reverberate, as\nwe have seen recently in Syria. It is unclear how these events will ultimately affect\nsecurity, trade, and migration flows around the world. The fact that these conflicts have\nnot affected the global economy to a greater extent than they have so far doesn’t mean\nthey can’t and won’t. Research shows that higher levels of geopolitical risk, and\neconomic uncertainty more broadly, tend to foreshadow lower investment and\nemployment.6 I expect that central bankers in OECD economies will continue to\nconsider geopolitical risk in the medium term.\nThe next challenge for central bankers that I would like to address also has both\nshorter and long-term dimensions to it, and that is something that I will refer to as a\n6 See Dario Caldara and Matteo Iacoviello (2022), “Measuring Geopolitical Risk,” American Economic\nReview, vol. 112 (April), pp. 1194–225; and Juan M. Londono, Sai Ma, and Beth Anne Wilson\n(forthcoming), “The Global Transmission of Real Economic Uncertainty,” Journal of Money, Credit and\nBanking.\n\n- 7 -\n“rethink of globalization.” For close to a decade now, many countries have been\nreexamining the costs and benefits from steadily freer global movement in capital, labor,\nand goods that was the norm over previous decades. Although global trade has not\ndecreased in the last decade, we have clearly seen changes in trade patterns, with more\ncountries and firms putting greater emphasis on rerouting trade flows and shortening\nsupply chains to avoid geopolitical risk and tariffs. This isn’t simply the result of some\nfailed ministerial meeting or bilateral conflict. Rather, it has been a persistent and\nwidespread trend that has been under way for some time. The presumption that the\nincreasingly tighter global integration of our economies and financial markets would\ninevitably continue is no longer as safe as it long was.\nAt the same time, I have refrained from calling this development, as some have,\nthe “end of globalization,” because I don’t believe that this will be the outcome. As I\nthink about the 38 governments represented by the OECD and consider how this\norganization has grown in size and in the depth of its engagement on different issues, I\nwould say that globalization is not going away. What I do expect, however, is there will\nbe more thought and consideration among our leaders for how globalization affects the\npeople we serve, with a more careful weighing of both the potential costs of closer\nintegration and the potential benefits. As these decisions by governments are made,\ncentral bankers will need to be prepared to respond appropriately in setting monetary\npolicy and promoting financial stability.\nAnother longer-term challenge involves demographic trends. What I mean here is\nthe aging of populations in OECD countries, and, to some extent, everywhere else.\n\n- 8 -\nWhile this is mainly a problem for fiscal authorities, it does have some ramifications for\ncentral bankers in terms of long-run growth rates, productivity, and asset prices.\nIn the United States, those between the ages of 16 and 54 were 72 percent of the\npopulation in 2003, 62.7 percent in 2023, and are projected to be 61 percent in 2033.\nAging is happening even more quickly in some other OECD countries. This is a slow-\nmoving development but, as populations age and move from working to retirement,\nemployment and economic output fall. This by itself lowers per capita GDP, which can\naffect consumption, investment and inflation. As aging populations sell accumulated\nassets to support consumption, asset prices and interest rates will adjust as well, with the\nlatter potentially affecting the central bank’s estimate of the neutral policy rate. There are\nmitigants to soften the effect of aging populations, such as an increase in retirement age,\nimmigration and higher productivity growth for younger workers. Again, these\ndemographic factors are more important for fiscal policy, but there are spillovers to\nmonetary policy.\nProductivity growth is another issue facing central bankers and I know has been\nthe subject of conversations at OECD gatherings this past year. According to one set of\nestimates, labor productivity growth is responsible for more than half of the cumulative\nGDP growth in the United States since the end of 2019, compared to much smaller shares\nin other countries. Productivity growth is notoriously volatile and, even years later, it is\nhard to say exactly what technological and other factors caused it.7 Having some\nunderstanding of the trajectory of productivity growth is helpful for policymakers\n7 For a discussion of factors affecting productivity growth in the U.S. and whether they can contribute to\nsustained growth, see Christopher J. Waller (2024), “There’s Still No Rush,” speech delivered at the\nEconomic Club of New York, New York, March 27,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240327a.htm.\n\n- 9 -\nthinking about how fast their economies can grow without inducing inflation. Central\nbankers must keep their eyes on productivity in judging whether wages can grow quickly\nwithout igniting inflation or whether potential growth has increased. Productivity growth\nalso plays a role in assessing the real neutral policy rate, otherwise known as r*. Higher\nproductivity growth is often associated with a higher value of r* for some policymakers\nand thus has implications for the interpretation of the degree of monetary accommodation\nor restrictiveness for policy.8\nOne way to try to understand some of the factors affecting productivity is to\ncompare the United States to other OECD countries. While it is not particularly new for\nproductivity to grow faster in the U.S. than in other advanced economies, some\ndifferences in our economies may have been particularly salient during and after the\npandemic.9 First, there was more disruption in employment in the United States during\nCOVID than in many other OECD countries and after the pandemic subsided this may\nhave led to better matching of workers with new jobs at which they could be more\nproductive. Second, during the acute U.S. labor shortages in 2022 and 2023, I heard\nnumerous anecdotes that firms had to invest more in worker training to raise skill levels\nto what was necessary for positions. This raises labor productivity with a delay, and it\nmay have been an important factor recently. Third, business creation is, by all evidence,\n8 For a discussion of the relationship between these series, see Thomas Laubach and John C. Williams\n(2003), “Measuring the Natural Rate of Interest,” Review of Economics and Statistics, vol. 85 (November),\npp. 1063–70; and Kathryn Holston, Thomas Laubach, and John C. Williams (2023), “Measuring the\nNatural Rate of Interest after COVID-19,” Staff Reports 1063 (New York: Federal Reserve Bank of New\nYork, June),\nhttps://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr1063.pdf?sc_lang=en.\n9 For a discussion of factors explaining faster real GDP growth in the U.S. than Europe post COVID, which\nincludes many factors affecting productivity, see Francois de Soyres, Joaquin Garcia-Cabo Herrero, Nils\nGoernemann, Sharon Jeon, Grace Lofstrom, and Dylan Moore (2024), “Why Is the U.S. GDP Recovering\nFaster than Other Advanced Economies?” FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System, May 17), https://doi.org/10.17016/2380-7172.3495.\n\n- 10 -\neasier in the United States, and new firms often are more productive than existing firms.\nThere was a surge in U.S. business creation after COVID, which could reasonably have\nled to a more productive re-allocation of labor.\nThere may have been other factors. I don’t think that artificial intelligence (AI)\nwas one of them. AI investment will take place over many years and most likely has not\ndone much yet to add to productive capacity. While it is possible AI could increase\nlonger-run productivity growth, that remains to be seen. But the other possible reasons—\nthe flexibility of labor rules, ease of business entry, barriers to innovation, lower\nregulatory hurdles—would sound familiar to people attending OECD discussions a\ndecade ago. The barriers to innovative risk-taking are probably lower—and the rewards\nhigher—in the United States.\nSo while I am skeptical that AI is already making significant contributions to\nproductivity growth, I have little doubt that it will do so. AI and allied innovations in\ncomputing have the potential to bring productivity advances to high-skill labor-intensive\nservices, akin to the way robotics transformed high-skill manufacturing. If such advances\ndo occur, one challenge for governments will be fostering an economy in which those\ndislocated by such a shift can obtain new skills and find productive and meaningful\nemployment. As ever, prudent regulation should be balanced with support for innovation\nthat has the potential to deliver widespread improvements in living standards. But\nregulatory policy should not strangle innovation in its infancy.\nSo, at the end of this list of challenges, how should central banks meet them?\nThere will always be new challenges, but the right approach to monetary policy hasn’t\nchanged, nor should it. In every case, the answer begins with sticking to our mandates\n\n- 11 -\nand resisting the temptation to go beyond them. We must closely monitor economic and\nfinancial conditions and look in every direction, and down the road, for emerging risks.\nIn keeping to our mandates, we concede that seeing all these risks clearly is hard, so we\nneed to remain focused.\nWe also need to be nimble in responding to unfamiliar risks and be prepared to\nuse our monetary policy tools in new ways to prepare for unprecedented challenges that\nmay present themselves. When conditions are uncertain, as they often are, we must move\ndeliberately but also be ready to act quickly and decisively when the situation demands it,\nas we did in subduing inflation. Effective monetary policy depends on clearly\ncommunicating our intentions so that the public will act on those intentions. That also\nrequires credibility, and this is most effectively maintained when monetary policy\ndecisions are made according to our mandates and in the longer-term interest of a healthy\neconomy and stable financial system. Guided by these basic principles, I believe that\ncentral bankers are up to the considerable challenges of today, and those we will face in\nthe years ahead.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n7:15 p.m. EDT (4:15 p.m. PDT)\nMay 6, 2022\nReflections on Monetary Policy in 2021\nRemarks by\nChristopher J. Waller\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“How Monetary Policy Got Behind the Curve and How to Get Back:\nA Policy Conference”\nHoover Institution\nStanford, California\nMay 6, 2022\n\nI want to thank the organizers for inviting me to speak here today. The discussion\nhas focused on the following question: “How did the Fed get so far behind the curve?”\nMy response is to relate how my view of the economy changed over the course of 2021\nand how that evolving view shaped my policy position. When thinking about this\nquestion, there are three points that need to be considered. First, the Fed was not alone in\nunderestimating the strength of inflation that revealed itself in late 2021. Second, to\ndetermine whether the Fed was behind the curve, one must take a position on the\nevolving health of the labor market during 2021. Finally, setting policy in real time can\ncreate what appear to be policy errors after the fact due to data revisions.\nLet me start by reminding everyone of two immutable facts about setting\nmonetary policy in the United States. First, we have a dual mandate from the Congress:\nmaximum employment and price stability. Whether you believe this is the appropriate\nmandate or not, it is the law of the land, and it is our job to pursue both objectives.\nSecond, policy is set by a large committee of up to 12 voting members and a total of\n19 participants in our discussions. This structure brings a wide range of views to the\ntable and a diverse set of opinions on how to interpret incoming economic data and how\nbest to respond. We need to reconcile those views and reach a consensus that we believe\nwill move the economy toward our mandate. This process may lead to more gradual\nchanges in policy as members have to compromise in order to reach a consensus.\nBack in September and December 2020, respectively, the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC) laid out guidance for raising the federal funds rate off the zero lower\nbound and for tapering asset purchases. We said that we would “aim to achieve inflation\nmoderately above 2 percent for some time” to ensure that it averages 2 percent over time\n\n- 2 -\nand that inflation expectations stay anchored. We also said that the Fed would keep\nbuying $120 billion per month in securities until “substantial further progress” was made\ntoward our dual-mandate objectives. It is important to stress that views varied among\nFOMC participants on what was “some time” and “substantial further progress.” The\nmetrics for achieving these outcomes also varied across participants.\nA few months later, in March 2021, I made my first submission for the Summary\nof Economic Projections as an FOMC member. My projection had inflation above 2\npercent for 2021 and 2022, with unemployment close to my long-run estimate by the\nsecond half of 2022. Given this projection, which I believed was consistent with the\nguidance from December, I penciled in lifting off the zero lower bound in 2022, with the\nsecond half of the year in mind. To lift off from the ZLB in the second half of 2022, I\nbelieved tapering of asset purchases would have to start in the second half of 2021 and\nconclude by the third quarter of 2022.\nThis projection was based on my judgment that the economy would heal much\nfaster than many expected. This was not 2009, and expectations of a slow, grinding\nrecovery were inaccurate, in my view. In April 2021, I said the economy was “ready to\nrip,” and it did.1 I chose to look at the unemployment rate and job creation as the labor\nmarket indicators I would use to assess whether we had made “substantial further\nprogress.” My projection was also based on the belief that the jump in inflation that\noccurred in March 2021 would be more persistent than many expected.\n1 See Jeff Cox (2021), “Fed’s Waller Says the Economy Is ‘Ready to Rip’ But Policy Should Stay Put,”\nCNBC, April 16.\n\n- 3 -\nThere was a range of views on the Committee. Eleven of my colleagues did not\nhave a rate hike penciled in until after 2023. With regard to future inflation,\n13 participants projected inflation in 2022 would be at or below our 2 percent target. In\nthe March 2021 SEP, no Committee member expected inflation to be over 3 percent for\n2021. As I argued in a speech last December, this view was consistent with private-\nsector economic forecasts.2\nWhen inflation broke loose in March 2021, even though I had expected it to run\nabove 2 percent in 2021 and 2022, I never thought it would reach the very high levels we\nhave seen in recent months. Indeed, I expected it would eventually fade, due to the\nnature of these shocks. All the suspected drivers of this surge in inflation appeared to be\ntemporary: the one-time stimulus from fiscal policy, supply chain shocks that previous\nexperience indicated would ease soon, and a surge in demand for goods. In addition, we\nhad very accommodative monetary policy that I believed would end in 2022. The issue\nin my mind was whether these factors would start fading away later in 2021 or in 2022.\nOver the summer of 2021, the labor market and other data related to economic\nactivity came in as I expected, and so I argued publicly that we were rapidly approaching\n“substantial further progress” on the employment leg of our mandate. In the June\nSummary of Economic Projections, seven participants had liftoff in 2022 and only five\nparticipants projected liftoff after 2023. Also, unlike the March SEP, every Committee\nparticipant now expected inflation to be over 3 percent in 2021 and just five believed\ninflation would be at 2 percent or below in 2022. In addition, the vast majority of\n2 See Christopher J. Waller (2021), “A Hopeless and Imperative Endeavor: Lessons from the Pandemic for\nEconomic Forecasters,” speech delivered at the Forecasters Club of New York, New York, December 17,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20211217a.htm.\n\n- 4 -\nparticipants now saw risks associated with inflation weighted to the upside. The June\n2021 minutes also describe the vigorous discussion about tapering asset purchases.\nNumerous participants said that new data indicated that tapering should begin sooner than\nanticipated.3 Thus, in June, after observing high inflation for only three months, the\nCommittee was moving in a hawkish direction and was considering tapering sooner and\npulling liftoff forward.\nAt the July FOMC meeting, the minutes show that most participants believed that\n“substantial further progress” had been made on inflation but not employment.4 Tapering\nwas not viewed as imminent by most participants. Again, individual participants had\ndifferent metrics for evaluating the health of the labor market, and this approach\ninfluenced how each thought about policy. So, in my view, one cannot address the\nquestion of “how did the Fed get so far behind the curve?” without taking a stand on the\nhealth of the labor market as we moved through 2021.\nBased on the incoming data over the summer, my position was that we would\nsoon achieve the substantial further progress needed to start tapering of asset purchases—\nin particular, our purchases of agency mortgage-backed securities—and that we needed to\n“go early and go fast” on tapering our asset purchases to position ourselves for rate hikes\nin 2022 should we need to tighten policy.5 I also argued that, if the July and August job\nreports came in around the forecast values of 800,000 to 1 million job gains per month,\nwe should commence tapering our asset purchases at the September 2021 FOMC\n3 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2021), “Minutes of the Federal Open Market\nCommittee, June 15–16, 2021,” press release,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20210707a.htm.\n4 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2021), “Minutes of the Federal Open Market\nCommittee, July 27–28, 2021,” press release,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20210818a.htm.\n5 See Ann Saphir (2021), “Fed’s Waller: ‘Go Early and Go Fast’ on Taper,” Reuters, August 2.\n\n- 5 -\nmeeting. The July report was indeed over 1 million new jobs, but then the August report\nshocked us by reporting only 235,000 new jobs when the consensus forecast was for\n750,000. I considered this a punch in the gut and relevant to a decision on when to start\ntapering.6 Nevertheless, the September FOMC statement noted that the economy had\nmade progress toward the Committee’s goals and that, if progress continued, it would\nsoon be time to taper.7\nUp until October, monthly core personal consumption expenditures (PCE)\ninflation was actually slowing. As shown in Figure 1, it went from 0.62 percent in April\nto 0.24 percent for the month of September. The September jobs report was another\nshock, with only 194,000 jobs created. So, up until the first week of October 2021, the\nstory of high inflation being temporary was holding up, and the labor market\nimprovements had slowed but were continuing. Based on the incoming data, the FOMC\nannounced the start of tapering at its early November meeting.8\nIt was the October and November consumer price index (CPI) reports that showed\nthat the deceleration of inflation from April to September was short lived and year-over-\nyear inflation had topped 6 percent. It became clear that the high inflation realizations\nwere not as temporary as originally thought. And the October jobs report showed a\nsignificant rebound with 531,000 jobs created and big upward revisions to the previous\ntwo months.\n6 Of course, as we all know, these employment data would be revised upward substantially, but that was not\nknown to policymakers at the time, and it’s important to explicitly make that point now—the data were\nchoppy and did not lend themselves to a clear picture of the outlook.\n7 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2021), “FOMC Statement,” press release,\nSeptember 22, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20210922a.htm.\n8 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2021), “FOMC Statement,” press release,\nNovember 3, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20211103a.htm.\n\n- 6 -\nIt was at this point—with a clearer picture of inflation and revised labor market\ndata in hand—that the FOMC pivoted. In its December meeting, the Committee\naccelerated tapering, and the SEP showed that each individual participant projected an\nearlier liftoff in 2022 with a median projection of three rate hikes in 2022. These\nforecasts and forward guidance had a significant effect on raising market interest rates,\neven though we did nothing with our primary policy tool, the federal funds rate, in\nDecember 2021. It is worth noting that markets had the same view of likely policy—\nfederal funds rate futures in November and December called for three hikes in 2022,\nindicating an economic outlook that was similar to the Committee’s.\nGiven this description of how policy evolved over 2021, did the Fed fall far\nbehind the curve?\nFirst, I want to emphasize that forecasting is hard for everyone, especially in a\npandemic. In terms of missing on inflation, policymakers’ projections looked very much\nlike most of the public’s. For example, as shown in table 1, the median SEP forecast for\n2021 Q4/Q4 PCE inflation was very similar to the consensus from the Blue Chip, which\nis a compilation of private sector forecasts. In short, nearly everyone was behind the\ncurve when it came to forecasting the magnitude and persistence of inflation.\nSecond, as I mentioned, you cannot answer this question without taking a stand\non the employment leg of our mandate. There was a clear difference in views on this and\non what indicators should be looked at to determine whether we had met the ‘substantial\nfurther progress” criteria we laid out in our December 2020 guidance. Some of us\nconcluded the labor market was healing fast and we pushed for earlier and faster\nwithdrawal of accommodation. For others, data suggested the labor market was not\n\n- 7 -\nhealing that fast and it was not optimal to withdraw policy accommodation soon. Many\nof our critics tend to focus only on the inflation aspect of our mandate and ignore the\nemployment leg of our mandate. But we cannot. So, what may appear as a policy error\nto some was viewed as appropriate policy by others based on their views regarding the\nhealth of the labor market.\nThird, one must account for setting policy in real time. The Committee was\ngetting mixed signals from the labor market data in August and September. Two\nconsecutive weak job reports didn’t square with a rapidly falling unemployment rate.\nLater that fall, and then with the Labor Department’s 2021 revisions, we found that\npayrolls were quite steady over the course of the year. As shown in table 2, revisions to\nchanges in payroll employment since late last summer have been quite substantial. From\nthe original reports to the current estimate, the change in payroll employment has been\nrevised up nearly 1.5 million. As the revisions came in, a consensus grew that the labor\nmarket was much stronger than we originally thought. If we knew then what we know\nnow, I believe the Committee would have accelerated tapering and raised rates sooner.\nBut no one knew, and that’s the nature of making monetary policy in real time.\nFinally, if one believes we were behind the curve in 2021, how far behind were\nwe? In a world of forward guidance, one simply cannot look at the policy rate to judge\nthe stance of policy. Even though we did not actually move the policy rate in 2021, we\nused forward guidance to start raising market rates starting with the September 2021\nstatement, which indicated tapering was coming soon. The 2-year Treasury yield, which\nI view as a good market indicator of our policy stance, went from approximately 25 basis\npoints in late September 2021 to 75 basis points by late December. That is the\n\n- 8 -\nequivalent, in my mind, of two 25 basis point policy rate hikes for impacting the financial\nmarkets. When looked at this way, how far behind the curve could we have possibly\nbeen if, using forward guidance, one views rate hikes effectively beginning in September\n2021?\n\nSlides for “Reflections on\nMonetary Policy in 2021”\nChristopher J.

    "text": "For release on delivery\n1:00 p.m. EDT\nOctober 15, 2025\nInnovation at the Speed of AI\nRemarks by\nChristopher J. Waller\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nDC Fintech Week\nArlington, Virginia\nOctober 15, 2025\n\nThank you for the opportunity to speak to you today about artificial intelligence\n(AI).1 AI is a powerful and rapidly advancing technology that has captured everyone’s\nattention. If you’ve watched enough sci-fi, you know that major technological change is\nusually either dystopian or utopian—the robots either take over the world or improve it.\nThese polarized views are also common among economists and technologists. On one\nside, there are the doomers—those convinced that new technologies will destroy jobs,\nwiden inequality, and concentrate power. On the other, there are the techno-optimists—\nthose convinced we’re on the brink of an unprecedented leap in productivity, growth, and\ncreativity if we let the technology proliferate. As usual, the truth about AI is probably\nsomewhere in between. The job of an economic policymaker is to separate hype and\nhyperbole from hard data and sound analysis and understand what AI really means for\ngrowth, productivity, and the broader economy.\nI will focus on three aspects of major technological change that “repeat” through\nhistory. First, technological change is a constant in our lives, and it is almost always\ndisruptive. It upends the way we work and socialize. Second, it alters existing power\nrelationships in unsettling ways. Finally, technological change reliably raises\nproductivity and our standard of living while improving the quality of our lives. My\nintent is to describe how AI is likely to affect our lives along these lines and how it\ndiffers from past technological changes.\nWe have always had technological changes that dramatically transform the\neconomy and our daily lives. In the 1880s, electricity was a curiosity reserved for a few\nwealthy urban people and some limited industrial uses. By 1920, half of homes had\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nelectricity, by 1940 nearly half had a refrigerator, and by 1945, 85 percent of homes were\nelectrified. Automobile use also rose swiftly. Auto registrations rose from 140,000 in\n1906 to 23 million in 1929, at a time when the total number of households was fewer than\n30 million. These advances changed daily life in profound ways. Another aspect of\ntechnological change is the speed at which new technologies are being adopted. In the\nlast 50 years, we’ve experienced adoption of new technologies twice as fast: Personal\ncomputers were widespread within 20 years—the internet in 12 years—and it only took 6\nyears for smartphones to be universal. And now AI is moving even more rapidly. I tend\nto believe that the transition for workers affected by AI will be accelerated also, but no\none really knows. Such predictions are certainly beyond my powers as an economic\npolicymaker, so I will limit myself to the here and now. The point of this discussion is\nthat technological change is a constant in our lives—it is always happening and will\ncontinue to happen—and AI seems to be following the pattern of ever-faster adoption and\nchange.\nAlthough it is a constant in our lives, technology also disrupts our lives every time\na new innovation appears. The way that we work and produce changes. Jobs disappear,\nand new ones appear. Our social lives are disrupted as well, often in good ways—but\nsometimes not so good. We used to write letters and mail them to communicate with\nloved ones. This took time and was expensive. Now we text or use FaceTime or Zoom\nto communicate with friends and family members anytime. This makes it easier to\nmaintain relationships across geography and time. But it can also undermine those social\nconnections. When I walk into a party and see half of the people there staring at their\nscreens, I can see that technology can lead to less social interaction, not more.\n\n- 3 -\nTechnological disruption, like anything else, has benefits and costs. But, as I will argue\nlater, I believe that we need to let this disruption occur to recognize the benefits alongside\nthe costs, to enable us to lead better lives.\nMy second point was that technological innovation can alter power relationships\nin profound ways. When Gutenberg invented the printing press, he took away the\nCatholic Church’s power over the written word and democratized it. When personal\ncomputers appeared, power shifted from those who managed mainframes to individual\nusers. When the internet arrived, the control of news, information, and opinion pieces\nshifted from major news outlets to anyone with a webpage. AI will do the same. It will\ntake power from “experts” and shift it to “nonexperts.” Much like Gutenberg’s printing\npress, AI will likely democratize expertise. Tools that once required specialized training\nare already becoming accessible to a much wider range of people. We see this happening\nwith software coding already. A nurse using an AI diagnostic tool or a technician relying\non a generative model to troubleshoot complex equipment can perform higher-order tasks\nmore efficiently. It will likely do the same for scientific discovery. Those who collected\neconomic rents, or excess payments, from the control of power will lose those rents. But\nthis will improve our lives in the process.\nWhenever a new technology emerges, the first question economists get is about\njobs: Will this replace people or make them more productive? The challenge is that,\nwith innovation, there is often a time inconsistency between the costs and the benefits.\nThe disruptions come first; the benefits take time. When a new technology appears, it’s\nalways easier to see the jobs that are likely to disappear, but it’s much harder to see the\nones that will be created. When automobiles came on the scene, it was easy to see that\n\n- 4 -\nsaddlemakers’ jobs would disappear. But it wasn’t obvious that the saddlemaker’s skills\ncould be used to make car seats and that higher-productivity auto production would\ncreate many more and much higher paying jobs. Ten years ago, if I had said something\ncalled TikTok would arrive soon, no one would likely have been able to imagine that, or\nthat social media would create what is now an established occupation—influencer.\nThe pattern appears to be repeating—only faster. A recent study by Stanford\neconomists found that employment has fallen about 13 percent in occupations most\nexposed to AI, relative to those less affected.2 Those contractions have appeared mainly\nin support and administrative roles—fields that tend to be automated first. This early\neffect from AI is consistent with what I have been hearing from business contacts.\nRetailers in particular are cutting back on employment for call centers and IT-related\noccupations. So far, most say this is being handled through attrition, but a number of\nretailers say that there is the potential for downsizing next year. That is also a message\nfrom a New York Fed survey that finds very few businesses are reporting AI-induced\nlayoffs; they are instead using the technology to retrain employees.3 That said, AI is\ninfluencing recruiting for these firms, with some scaling back hiring because of AI and\nothers adding workers who are proficient in its use. Looking ahead, however, layoffs and\nreductions in hiring plans due to AI use are expected to increase, especially for workers\nwith a college degree.\n2 Erik Brynjolfsson, Bharat Chandar, and Ruyu Chen (2025), “Canaries in the Coal Mine? Six Facts about\nthe Recent Employment Effects of Artificial Intelligence,” working paper, Stanford Digital Economy Lab,\nAugust, https://digitaleconomy.stanford.edu/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2025/08/Canaries_BrynjolfssonChandarChen.pdf.\n3 Ben Hyman, Jaison R. Abel, Natalia Emanuel, Nick Montalbano, and Richard Deitz (2025), “Are\nBusinesses Scaling Back Hiring Due to AI?” Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Liberty Street Economics\n(blog), September 4, https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2025/09/are-businesses-scaling-back-\nhiring-due-to-ai.\n\n- 5 -\nReturning to my final point, history has shown us that technology improves\nproductivity and our standard of living. We initially always talk about how it will be a\nsubstitute for labor. This was the basic premise behind Marx’s theory of capitalism—\nmachines would replace humans in production, which would raise unemployment so high\nthat social revolution would occur, leading to the end of capitalism and the rise of a\nsocialist utopia. Yet this theory makes the fundamental mistake of failing to see that\ncapital and labor are complements, not substitutes. More machines mean a firm can\nproduce more output, but that also requires more labor as well. This is obvious just\nlooking at economic data. The U.S. capital stock, measured in constant prices, is seven\ntimes larger than it was in 1950. Yet the unemployment rate in September 1950 was 4.4\npercent, and it is 4.3 percent as of August 2025. This is why economists are typically\ntechno-optimists—history has repeatedly shown that adopting new technologies leads to\neconomic growth and greater employment, not less. Technological disruption is one\nform of a concept that economists have studied since Joseph Schumpeter named it in\n1942: creative destruction. This topic has never been more relevant, and I note that just\nlast week a share of the Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to two economists who\nexplored how productivity-enhancing disruption raises living standards.4\nThere will surely be losers and winners from AI, but aside from questions about\nhow AI’s gains will be distributed, there is the more fundamental matter of how they will\nbe measured, even at a macro level. Firms are using AI to increase productivity, which\nallows for greater output based on the same level of inputs. This gain is counted in gross\ndomestic product (GDP) and its corollary, gross national income.\n4 The other half of the prize was awarded to Joel Mokyr for work that emphasized the importance of society\nbeing open to new ideas and allowing change as an engine of economic development.\n\n- 6 -\nIn America, one common feature of great technological innovations has been an\nonslaught of competition that has rapidly driven down costs and resulted in rapid and\nwidespread adoption. If hardware and software innovation continue to drive down the\ncost of AI, then I see few barriers to its ongoing proliferation throughout the economy.\nThat prospect, clearly, is driving the surge of AI investment we have seen. Will it\ncontinue? That will depend, in part, on whether AI delivers on the productivity increases\nthat some believe it will bring.\nLabor productivity measures output per hour of work. The data is volatile, but\naverage growth over the past few years is slower than over the past decade or several\ndecades. A crucial question is whether AI will contribute to a resurgence in productivity\ngrowth. Any sustained productivity growth above 2 percent will tend to support rising\nreal incomes and living standards without inflation pressure. As a monetary policymaker,\nI’m hoping that AI delivers.\nWhile we often focus on how technology enhances market activity and\nproductivity, it also enhances the value of non-market-based activities. For example,\nGoogle Maps allows me to navigate foreign cities easier and faster when I am\nsightseeing. While this value is a not market-based activity and does not show up in\nGDP, it clearly makes my life better. Agentic AI has the potential to save me lots of\nleisure time that would have otherwise been spent planning vacations, paying bills, or\nmaking medical appointments. This increase in my well-being is not directly measured\nin GDP. But if these time-saving AI activities free me up to do more market-based\nproduction, then GDP will increase. I have no doubt that AI will boost GDP and national\nincome, but many of its benefits may be in improving our nonmarket activities.\n\n- 7 -\nEvery technology that changes how we live and work brings both promise and\nrisk. AI is no exception. Fraud, disinformation, bias, and cybersecurity threats are\nalready emerging. Any tool powerful enough to improve lives can also be misused. The\ntask for policymakers is to manage those risks without slowing the innovation that drives\ngrowth. History shows that adaptation, not avoidance, is what sustains progress. Each\nwave of technology has disrupted industries and employment, but over time it has also\nlifted productivity, raised real incomes, and improved living standards.\nWe see different approaches to managing the disruption that occurs with\ntechnological change. Europe has often chosen to regulate first—to contain potential\nharms before the technology fully develops. The United States is taking a different path,\nleaning on its tradition of experimentation and market dynamism. That openness has\nlong been a competitive advantage. It allowed the United States to lead in earlier waves\nof technology—from the internet to advanced computing—and it can do the same with\nAI. Over time, that willingness to experiment has translated into faster productivity\ngrowth and stronger economic performance than many of our peers, including Europe.\nThirty years ago, the United States embraced a new and disruptive technology—\nthe World Wide Web. Europe was more cautious, weighed down by regulations and\nlegacy industries that sought to control this innovation. The result, of course, is that\nAmerica led a global technological revolution that disrupted media and other industries\nbut also delivered jobs and broadly shared prosperity that handily outpaced the European\nUnion over those thirty years. Perhaps the most important legacy of the American-led\ninnovation of networked communications and computing was the culture of\nentrepreneurship and innovation it fostered, one that, in fact, has greatly contributed to\n\n- 8 -\nAmerica’s leadership in AI. The American tradition is to invent and make use of\ntechnology, not shrink from it. Where there are risks, we take reasonable steps to\nmitigate them, rather than seek to avoid them altogether. Risk-taking is at the heart of\nour market economy; it fuels innovation, and we must preserve it.\nMuch like the leaders in this audience, the Federal Reserve is also learning by\ndoing. I have championed a System-wide approach to continually educate our teams and\nenable experimentation with the latest wave of innovations—from large language models\nand agentic AI to applications in coding and payments. That’s why, on October 21, I’m\nconvening industry leaders to discuss AI in Payments as part of our Payments Innovation\nConference. These engagements, combined with our own hands-on technical research,\nallow us to apply these technologies within the Fed and to support innovation across the\nprivate sector.\nTo conclude, AI is moving faster than previous waves of innovation. That\nvelocity means both the disruptions and the benefits will arrive sooner. The challenge is\nto keep pace—to help workers and firms adjust so the gains in efficiency translate into\nhigher real wages and sustained growth across the economy. For policymakers, we must\nlet the disruption occur and trust that the long-run benefits will exceed any short-run\ncosts.\nThank you.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n1:45 p.m. EST (12:45 CST)\nFebruary 8, 2023\nThe Inflation Rate for Necessities: A Look at Food, Energy and Shelter Inflation\nRemarks by\nChristopher J. Waller\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n2023 Arkansas State University Agribusiness Conference\nJonesboro, Arkansas\nFebruary 8, 2023\n\nThank you, Bert, and thank you for the opportunity to talk about where the\neconomy is heading, what the Federal Reserve is doing to get inflation back down to our\n2 percent goal, and how all that is likely to affect American agriculture.1\nThe big picture is that the U.S. economy is adjusting well so far to the higher\ninterest rates that are necessary to rein in inflation. But inflation remains quite elevated,\nand so more needs to be done. Although economic activity slowed in 2022, I expect the\nFed will need to keep a tight stance of monetary policy for some time to slow activity\nfurther in 2023. That is what I believe is needed to bring demand and supply into better\nalignment and lower inflation toward the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) 2\npercent target. Some believe that inflation will come down quite quickly this year. That\nwould be a welcome outcome. But I’m not seeing signals of this quick decline in the\neconomic data, and I am prepared for a longer fight to get inflation down to our target.\nSo, what is my take on the recent data? It looks like the economy grew at a solid\npace in the final quarter of the year, the labor market remained tight, and inflation\ncontinued to retreat. After adjusting for inflation, personal consumption grew at around a\n2 percent rate, though it contracted in the last two months of the year amid some pretty\nsignificant headwinds.\nOne of those headwinds was high inflation, including for food and agricultural\nproducts. After accounting for inflation, spending on food consumed at home fell in\n2022 after rising strongly in 2020 and 2021, the effect of both large price increases over\n1 I am grateful to Katia Peneva for assistance in preparing these remarks. These remarks represent my own\nviews, which do not necessarily represent those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board and the\nFederal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nthe past year and the normalization of spending on groceries, which surged when people\nstayed home during the pandemic and reversed when they returned to restaurants.\nLooking forward, I expect personal consumption will grow modestly and price\nincreases will moderate, and I think such outcomes would bode well for the agricultural\nsector this year. It looks as though economic activity may be moderating further in the\nfirst quarter of 2023, but I expect the U.S. economy to continue growing at a modest pace\nthis year, supported by a strong labor market and by encouraging progress in lowering\ninflation.\nThough we have made progress reducing inflation, I want to be clear today that\nthe job is not done. Inflation is still too high relative to the price stability goal of the dual\nmandate assigned to the Federal Reserve by Congress. The Fed has defined that goal as 2\npercent annual inflation, as measured by the change in the price index for personal\nconsumption expenditures, but another yardstick you could use is when high prices for\ngroceries and other things are no longer front page news, and when farmers can worry\nless about rising costs for fertilizer and other inputs.\nThat is where we intend to get to, and thus the FOMC last week increased the\ntarget range for the federal funds rate by another 25 basis points, to 4½ to 4¾ percent.\nOur intention is to tighten financial conditions, including raising the cost of credit, to\ndampen demand and spending to further reduce inflation. Of course, we know that\nhigher interest rates pose challenges for farmers and ranchers who must borrow to\nsmooth out the costs and returns from agriculture over the year. But excessive inflation is\na larger challenge because it has the potential to become a lasting problem weighing on\neconomic growth, undermining living standards, and hurting consumers, who farmers\n\n- 3 -\ndepend on. That is why I am determined to get the job done, get high inflation off the\nfront pages, and back to being something that households and businesses don’t think too\nmuch about when making decisions.\nContinued upward pressure on inflation comes, in part, from a very tight labor\nmarket. The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey for December continued to show\nthat the demand for workers remains robust, with job openings increasing by over\n500,000 at the end of last year. Based on last Friday’s initial estimate, we learned that the\nU.S. economy created a whopping 517,000 jobs in January, 330,000 more than the solid\ngrowth that was expected by economic forecasters. Furthermore, the unemployment rate\nticked down to 3.4 percent, the lowest level since 1951.\nSuch employment gains mean labor income will also be robust and buoy\nconsumer spending, which could maintain upward pressure on inflation in the months\nahead. For employers, the very strong labor market makes it hard to find and retain\nworkers. One effect of this tightness is seen in wages and other compensation, which\nultimately show up in the prices that consumers pay for goods and services. For\nexample, last year the Employment Cost Index (ECI), which tracks movements in labor\ncosts, including both wages and benefits, increased over 5 percent, the highest rate since\n1984. We want to see wages grow but at a pace that is consistent with our goal of stable\nprices.\nWe have seen some moderation in compensation growth in recent months but not\nenough. The ECI for hourly compensation for private industry workers increased at an\nannual rate of 4 percent over the three months ending in December, a step down from the\n4.3 percent gain recorded over the three months ending in September and the 6.3 percent\n\n- 4 -\nincrease in June but still a strong increase. More recently, the 12-month change in a\nnarrower measure of labor costs, average hourly earnings, was about 4½ percent in\nJanuary, continuing its slow deceleration from 5½ percent last summer. The data are\nmoving in the right direction, but I will watch for further slowing because we don’t want\nexcessive wage increases to be a potential source of higher inflation in the future.\nSo now let’s talk about inflation. I will start with overall inflation and then focus\non the different components, including food. I will talk about what those components can\ntell us about the direction of overall inflation and how I look at the different parts of\ninflation in my approach to monetary policy.\nFigure 1 depicts inflation measured by two common indexes. No matter how one\nmeasures it, inflation has been running too hot for too long. “Overall” or “headline”\ninflation indexes are measured as the rate of increase in the average price level of a broad\ngroup of goods and services, called a market basket. Government statistics on the\ninflation rate will be a function of the specific goods and services included in the market\nbasket. Including a different set of goods and services in the market basket will result in\na different overall inflation rate.\nProbably the most often-discussed inflation measure in the United States is one\nbased on the consumer price index (CPI). The CPI is widely used as a cost-of-living\nindex to adjust Social Security and other payments. The CPI puts considerable weight on\nthe prices of food, energy, and shelter. These three items account for about 50 percent of\nthe expenditures in the CPI basket.2\n2 Food at home, energy and housing represent 49 percent of the CPI basket, whereas all food, energy and\nhousing are 54 percent of the market basket.\n\n- 5 -\nA second measure that is frequently watched is the one I mentioned earlier, the\npersonal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, which places less weight on food,\nenergy and shelter—they make up about 30 percent of the expenditures in the PCE\nbasket. The FOMC chose the PCE index over the CPI for its inflation target in part\nbecause it includes a broader set of goods and services in its market basket and is widely\nbelieved to better capture changes in the mix of goods and services purchased by\nconsumers.\nMonetary policy works with a lag, and after the Federal Reserve started raising\ninterest rates last March, inflation peaked in the middle of 2022 and has been falling\ngradually since then. Twelve-month PCE inflation hit a high of 7 percent in June but\nended the year at 5 percent. By comparison, over the final three months of 2022,\nheadline inflation was much lower, running at an annualized rate of just 2.1 percent. The\ndifference between the three-month and 12-months changes is a signal of ongoing\nmoderation. As has been the case since the summer, falling energy prices are a big\nreason for lower inflation in the last few months, though food price inflation also\nmoderated in the final few months of 2022.\nThese improvements are welcome news, but we need to keep them in perspective.\nAs we can see in the figure, though PCE inflation is down from its peak, it is still quite\nelevated. And while the recent trend is encouraging, the improvements over the past year\nhave been coming in ebbs and flows and it likely will continue this way. I need to be\nconfident that inflation is declining in a sustained manner towards our 2 percent target, so\nI will need to see continued moderation in inflation before my outlook changes.\n\n- 6 -\nSo where do I think inflation is heading? You will often hear economists talk\nabout core inflation, which strips out energy and food prices, which tend to be volatile.\nThe core measure is considered a better guide to the direction of future inflation. You\nmight wonder why it is that the Fed doesn’t just target core inflation in measuring\nprogress toward our price stability goal. There are some good reasons for keeping the\nfocus on overall inflation, and in front of an audience of people who pay a lot of attention\nto food price inflation, I thought I would take a couple minutes to explain why I consider\nfood and all of the components of inflation to be so important in my approach to setting\nmonetary policy.\nThe argument for stripping out food and energy prices is that they tend to be quite\nvolatile, with big ups and downs tending to equal out over time, and thus do not provide a\nclear signal of how inflation in these categories will evolve. One can see the recent\nvolatility in figure 2 that reports 12-month rates of inflation for food and energy. Energy\nprices were decreasing for most of 2020 (they fell 10 percent during that period) but then\nswitched to very large increases in 2021 and the first half of 2022. In mid-2022 we saw\nenergy prices up about 40 percent from the year before. By December, that retraced to\nless than a 7 percent increase over 2021. And I’m sure I don’t have to tell anyone that\nfood inflation has been quite high relative to its pre-pandemic average. Of course, food\nprices haven’t increased as much as energy prices, but food inflation has risen notably in\n2021 and 2022 and has been running above 10 percent recently, which is unusually high.\nI know that farmers have been dealing with sharply rising input costs, and that is a\nsignificant factor driving up wholesale and retail prices for many food products. As\nshown in figure 3, inflation for agricultural chemicals, such as fertilizer, skyrocketed in\n\n- 7 -\n2021 and continued up in early 2022 and, though this inflation has moderated in recent\nmonths, the price level of agricultural chemicals remains very high.\nCore inflation, as shown in Figure 4, didn’t rise as much as headline inflation in\nthis recent period of high food and energy price increases, and lately it hasn’t moderated\nas much. Core inflation stood at 4.4 percent in December, over double the Fed’s 2\npercent target for headline inflation. Core inflation includes a measure of housing\nservices, which is what households pay for rent or the equivalent for those who own their\nhomes. Housing services inflation has been stubbornly high for all of 2022 and is a big\nfactor driving up core inflation. There is good reason to believe rents will moderate\nsignificantly over this year and so some people have suggested that the focus should be\non a “super core” measure of inflation that excludes food, energy, and housing. That\nwould make inflation look not nearly as bad over the last year or two and also likely not\nshow much improvement in the coming months.\nBut there are a few reasons why I don’t let these stripped-down measures of\ninflation shape my views of the inflation environment. First, yes, historically food and\nenergy prices have been volatile, and it has not been unusual to see price increases\nfollowed by price declines over fairly short periods of time, but that isn’t the recent\nhistory. In the last two years, prices for these goods and services have been moving\nlargely in one direction—up—and even the decline in energy prices we saw in the second\nhalf of 2022 hasn’t offset the huge increases earlier.\nThe second reason that I wouldn’t exclude food, energy, and housing prices, or\nwant to move toward a narrower inflation target, is that, by any measure of headline\ninflation, they constitute a large share of expenses paid by people. Excluding this large\n\n- 8 -\nshare of consumer spending doesn’t give you an accurate picture of what consumers are\nfacing in their everyday lives, and that is a perspective that policymakers should never\nforget.\nThe third reason to include, rather than exclude, these prices in considering\ninflation is that they make up an even larger share of expenses for lower-income people,\nwho have less savings and other means to deal with the ups and downs of their finances\nand the economy. Recent research indicates that the share of overall spending that lower-\nincome households dedicate to food, energy and housing is about 1.2 times (or 20 percent\nmore) than the share spent by higher-income households. Because of this disparity, when\ninflation peaked last summer, lower-income households effectively faced inflation that\nwas a percentage point higher than was paid by higher-income households.3\nLastly, and this is really the bottom line, the Fed has stated that its target for\ninflation is headline PCE prices. So, to meet the Fed’s price stability objective,\npolicymakers are accounting for all the categories of goods and services that affect\nhouseholds.\nWith that context, let me take a few minutes on each of the three big categories to\nhighlight how they have been moving, and I think there is some good news. Let’s look at\neach category in the order of how much consumers spend on them each month. Housing\nservices are about 15 percent of the PCE basket. Figure 5 shows how housing inflation\nhas been evolving both when measured on a 12-month basis (left panel) and 3-month\nbasis (right panel). As I just noted, housing inflation has been stubbornly elevated. This\nis true if you look at inflation over the past year or just at recent months. But high\n3 Based on work by Jake Orchard (2022) that matches consumption spending by income with CPI data.\nSee https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4033572\n\n- 9 -\nfrequency measures of market rents (for new leases by new tenants) have slowed sharply,\nsuggesting an upcoming slowing in the rate of inflation in this part of the PCE basket.\nBecause rents usually don’t change until leases run out, these recent declines in market\nrent inflation will only show through to the official inflation measure with a delay. So I\nexpect, over time, that housing inflation will move down to be more in line with core\ninflation.\nTurning to food, which represents about 7.5 percent of consumption in the PCE\nbasket, figure 6 shows that the 12-month change in PCE food prices has greatly outpaced\nthat of core PCE inflation over the past couple of years. More recently, we can see that\nthe 3-month change in the PCE price index for food has slowed considerably, which is a\ngood sign. But food inflation is still above the average annual pace of 1.1 percent over\nthe ten years preceding the pandemic. This ongoing elevated food inflation likely reflects\npassthrough of the past strong increases in food commodity prices, rising labor and fuel\ncosts, as well as supply-chain bottlenecks in packaging and transportation that have\nlimited supplies amid strong demand. For example, as seen in figure 7, spot prices for\ncattle and soybeans are well above their levels at the onset of the pandemic, likely\nboosted by the sharply rising input costs farmers have been facing, which I discussed\nearlier. However, futures prices for these commodities suggest limited movements in\nthese prices through year end. If this plays out, with a slowdown in wage increases that\nshould occur because of tighter monetary policy, this should help continue to moderate\nfood inflation over the next few years.\nFinally, let’s turn to energy inflation. Households spend less than 5 percent of\ntheir PCE basket on gasoline, electricity, and heating but, as seen in the left panel of\n\n- 10 -\nfigure 8, the energy price index skyrocketed over the past couple of years, reflecting a\nsurge in crude oil prices after the pandemic recession which was exacerbated by Russia’s\ninvasion of Ukraine. Turning to the 3-month change (the right panel) energy prices have\nbeen declining sharply recently and we expect them to continue to decline this year,\nreflecting the path of crude oil futures prices and the expectation that unusually elevated\ngasoline margins will, on average, decline over the remainder of this year.\nSo, what do I take away from all this? I think there are practical implications for\ngetting a clear picture of the economy and setting appropriate monetary policy, and also a\nreminder for me about the trust I bear as a public official.\nMost practically, if I had focused on core inflation over the last two years and tended\nto look past increases for food and energy, and especially for housing, I would have\nmissed an alarming increase in inflation, and reacted more slowly than my Federal\nReserve colleagues and I appropriately did to start bringing down inflation. The Federal\nOpen Market Committee raised interest rates more quickly than it had in more than forty\nyears, and I think the progress we have made on inflation shows how important it was to\nact so urgently.\nJust as importantly, excluding those prices would have neglected how much hardship\nthis high inflation has been for many people, especially lower-income individuals and\nfamilies. High inflation is a very different experience when you are effectively paying a\nhigher rate than others, when a higher share of your expenses and income are spent on\nnecessities, and when you have little in savings to draw on, as lower-income people do.\nWhen I talk about how important it is to win this inflation fight, it is partly in recognition\nof this inescapable reality for many millions of people.\n\n- 11 -\nFortunately, there are signs that food, energy, and shelter prices will moderate this\nyear. An important factor has been the Federal Reserve’s ongoing fight to lower inflation\nthrough tighter monetary policy. We are seeing that effort begin to pay off, but we have\nfarther to go. And, it might be a long fight, with interest rates higher for longer than\nsome are currently expecting. But I will not hesitate to do what is needed to get my job\ndone.\n\nThe Inflation Rate for Necessities: A Look\nat Food, Energy, and Shelter Inflation\nChristopher J.

    "text": "For release on delivery\n9:15 a.m. EDT\nAugust 19, 2024\nOpening Remarks\nby\nChristopher J. Waller\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nSummer Workshop on Money, Banking, Payments, and Finance\nWashington, D.C.\nAugust 19, 2024\n\nThank you, Matt. I am delighted to welcome you all in person to the 2024\nSummer Workshop on Money, Banking, Payments, and Finance, jointly organized by the\nFederal Reserve Board, the Bank of Canada, and the Study Center Gerzensee.1 I want to\nthank the organizers for putting together such an interesting program and also thank the\nparticipants for their contributions.\nThe evolving nature of money and banking creates new channels through which\nfinancial markets and institutions can affect the economy, with implications for all five of\nthe Federal Reserve’s functions, which are monetary policy, financial stability,\nsupervision and regulation, payment systems, and consumers and communities.\nRelatedly, the emergence of new technologies can generate complex economic\ninteractions, and theoretical research and analytical work are crucial to understanding the\nimplications.\nMany of the concepts underlying such economic interactions have for years been\nthe study of this workshop. When I was research director at the Federal Reserve Bank of\nSt. Louis, I put together several iterations of this gathering. As the organization of the\nworkshop has passed to a new generation, I continue to find it to be a leading venue for\nstudying the economic mechanisms through which money, financial markets, contracts,\nand institutions affect economic activity and economic welfare. Past participants have\nadvanced modern money and banking theory, bringing new insights to real-world\neconomic problems and policy analysis. Numerous research papers presented in these\nworkshops have been published in prestigious economics journals and influenced\nscholarship in this area.\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nIf I had to describe the work that has been presented at this conference over the\nlast 20-plus years, I would say it focuses on the economics of exchange and payment.\nWalrasian supply and demand models describe how an equilibrium quantity and price are\ndetermined but it is silent on two key questions: how do the goods get from seller to\nbuyer and how is payment made from buyer to seller? In short, standard supply and\ndemand analyses have nothing to say about the actual exchange process and how\npayment is made—in a sense, exchange and payment are viewed as trivial issues. By\ndelving into the micro-foundations of exchange and payment, researchers in this area\nwere able to identify key frictions that make exchange and payment far from trivial.\nThis is not just a theoretical issue that is only relevant to economists in ivory\ntowers. Payments and the exchange process are multibillion-dollar businesses and\nprivate sector firms are constantly innovating in this area to overcome the types of\nfrictions that are well-known to this group. The knowledge that I have gained from\ninteracting with researchers in this area for the last 20 years has aided me in one of my\nroles as a Federal Reserve governor, supporting the Fed’s oversight of the U.S. payment\nsystem. It also guides my thinking about how to make global payments cheaper and\nfaster, which is a key objective adopted by the G20 countries in 2020 and is one fully\nsupported by the Federal Reserve.\nKeeping with the tradition of studying exchange and payment, several papers to\nbe presented this year focus on how frictions in financial markets, such as asymmetric\ninformation or asset illiquidity, matter for the transmission and implementation of\nmonetary policy as well as unemployment and inflation. Similarly, it is great to continue\nseeing work studying frictional intermediation in asset markets and the implications for\n\n- 3 -\nasset prices and the efficient sharing of risk. These contributions push the frontier of our\nknowledge, facilitate our understanding of real-world complexities, and inform policy\nthinking.\nThe workshop’s focus on broader financial stability issues is also very important.\nFinancial stability vulnerabilities, such as run risk, excessive leverage, and bubbly\nvaluations, could amplify the effect of adverse shocks, potentially resulting in big\neconomic losses and a slowdown in economic activity. Understanding the mechanisms\nthat allow these vulnerabilities to grow and transmit stress to the rest of the financial\nsystem requires rigorous theoretical research and solid micro-foundations. Over the\ncourse of this week, we will hear interesting work on this topic that includes research\nquestions such as how a central bank can balance interventions for financial stability and\ninterventions to achieve a certain stance of monetary policy, how banks take risks, and\nunderstanding the risk of runs on banks, non-banks, and stablecoins.\nOther concepts are newer and more novel. As the monetary and financial\necosystem has evolved, so has this workshop, bringing together many perspectives and\nmodeling approaches to money and banking theory and its applications. One recurring\ntheme has been to pay special attention to micro-foundations and institutional details,\nwhich is important to rigorously analyze and understand today’s financial innovations\nand evaluate their implications for welfare and policy.\nThis year’s workshop continues in that innovative spirit, keeping an eye on the\nfuture of money and banking.

    "text": "For release on delivery\n11:00 a.m. EDT (9:00 a.m. MDT)\nJuly 14, 2022\nMonetary Policy in a World of Conflicting Data\nRemarks by\nChristopher J. Waller\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nRocky Mountain Economic Summit\nGlobal Interdependence Center\nVictor, Idaho\nJuly 14, 2022\n\nThank you, Mike, and thank you to the Global Interdependence Center for the\ninvitation to speak to you today.1 Let me start at the place that all remarks about U.S.\nmonetary policy should start, which is with the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate of\nmaximum employment and price stability.2\nAs I discuss below, we have a very strong labor market, with an unemployment\nrate that is below the median of policymakers’ expected longer-run level, and high\ninflation that is far above our target.3 We are achieving our mandate when it comes to\nmaximum employment, but we are far from achieving our goal of stable prices.\nConsequently, while any monetary policy decision has implications for achieving\nmaximum employment, and I will address those implications in a moment, the FOMC is\nnow, and must be, utterly focused on moving inflation down toward our 2 percent target.\nWe must be focused on reducing inflation because, despite a lot of talk about\nrecession lately, the evidence from the labor market indicates the economy is on track,\nwhile inflation continues to be far too high. It must be our focus because high inflation is\nthe biggest challenge to sustaining our employment goal, and the greatest burden for\nindividuals and families, especially lower- and moderate-income households that dedicate\na larger share of their spending to necessities. Inflation has to be our focus, every\nmeeting and every day, because the spending and pricing decisions people and businesses\nmake every day depend on their expectations of future inflation, which in turn depend on\nwhether they believe the Fed is sufficiently committed to its inflation target.\n1 This speech is dedicated to the memory of my dear friend Berthold Herrendorf, who passed away the day\nbefore I delivered this speech.\n2 These views are my own and do not represent any position of the Board of Governors or other Federal\nReserve policymakers.\n3 The June Summary of Economic Projections reports a median longer-run level of unemployment of 4.0\npercent while the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimate is 3.6%.\n\n- 2 -\nSo let me be clear: I am going to vote to set policy in a manner that will reduce\ninflation and achieve our price stability goal, and today I will explain why I don’t see that\nprogress conflicting with our maximum-employment goal. Let me start with my view of\nthe labor market and inflation, then turn to the implications for monetary policy, and\nconclude with where I think the economy is headed.\nA Puzzle: Very Tight Labor Market but Declining GDP\nAs many economists are discussing, recent economic data have created a puzzle.\nThe labor market continues to be very strong, but the real economy appears to be\nfaltering. How might gross domestic product (GDP) fall in the first half of 2022 while\nthe economy created 2.7 million jobs in the same time period? Is the labor market not as\nstrong as it appears or is the economy doing better than the data suggests?\nTo assess the strength of the labor market, there are numerous indicators of its\nhealth, and sometimes they point in different directions. Today isn’t one of those times.\nBased on every major labor market indicator, the labor market is very strong and, in\nhistorical terms, very tight. The timeliest evidence for this strength was the jobs report\nthat came out last Friday for the month of June, which found that the economy created\n372,000 jobs. Now, I will admit my vision isn’t what it used to be, but with revisions to\nMay and April, it is hard to see any slowing in the pace of monthly job creation since\nFebruary: 398,000 in March, then 368, 384, and 372. In the first half of 2022, the\neconomy has created 2.7 million jobs. That isn’t a picture of a weakening job market.\nThe unemployment rate in June was steady at 3.6 percent. It is often said that this is\n“close to a half-century low” and that is true, but you really have to go back 69 years, to\n\n- 3 -\n1953, to find the unemployment rate more than a couple tenths of a point lower than it\nwas in June. This is about as good a job market as any worker has ever seen.\nThe June job report is consistent with other labor market indicators. Job\nvacancies—an indicator I have highlighted in past speeches—are unprecedentedly high,\nwith nearly two jobs for every person looking, and that hasn’t changed very much this\nyear. Job postings, measured by the Labor Department for May and by Indeed for June,\nhave fallen a bit in recent months but are still at historically high levels, consistent with a\nvery tight labor market. As a share of the labor force, weekly initial claims for\nunemployment insurance are near record lows and have been fairly steady all year.\nBusinesses continue to report that jobs are plentiful and small business owners say that\njobs are very hard to fill.4 Looking more broadly across 24 labor market metrics\nsummarized by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, we see that activity is above its\npre-pandemic level, and the Atlanta Fed’s labor market distributions spider chart shows\nthat the vast majority of labor market indicators are about as tight or tighter than just\nbefore the pandemic.5 The broad range of data showing a very strong labor market\nindicate that this isn’t a mismeasurement issue.\nTurning to GDP, there are signs of slowing in economic activity. The Commerce\nDepartment estimates that there was a modest contraction in real GDP for the first quarter\nof the year, and “nowcasting” projections of economic activity, such as the Atlanta Fed’s\n4 The measure of job availability is reported by the Conference Board, which calculates the difference\nbetween the share of survey respondents who report that jobs are plentiful and the share who report that\njobs are hard to get. The measure of job-filling difficulties is reported by the National Federation of\nIndependent Business, based on the share of small businesses reporting that they have at least one job\nopening that they are having difficulty filling.\n5 The Kansas City Fed’s measure of labor market conditions and the Atlanta Fed’s spider chart can be\nfound on the Reserve Banks’ respective websites at https://www.kansascityfed.org/data-and-trends/labor-\nmarket-conditions-indicators and\nhttps://www.atlantafed.org/chcs/labor-market-distributions.\n\n- 4 -\nGDPNow tracker, foresee a similar contraction in the second quarter.6 There is also\nsoftness in recent spending data, which has been widespread across consumer spending,\nbusiness investment, housing, and government purchases, as well as some weaker\nindicators for the manufacturing sector and a deterioration in consumer sentiment, which\nby some measures are at historically low levels. Some argue that a recession has already\nstarted.\nBut I don’t see how that squares with the job creation data, the low\nunemployment rate, and overall strong labor market that I described earlier. In addition\nto the contrasting evidence in the labor market, there are several other reasons why I am\nvery cautious about acting on the GDP estimates and on projections of an output\nslowdown. One is that while first quarter real GDP is now estimated to have shrunk by\n1.6 percent, according to another estimate, real gross domestic income (GDI) increased\nby 1.8 percent. GDP and GDI are basically measuring the same activity in different\nways, and in the past when such wide gaps in the two numbers have appeared initially,\nthey tend to move toward each other when the data are finalized. We know that there\nwere some unusual trade-related reasons for the low GDP number in the first quarter that\nare unlikely to be repeated, and revisions in both GDP and GDI could largely erase that\ncontraction in output.\nAnd, the data that point to some slowing don’t convince me that it will damage\nthe labor market. Measures of manufacturing activity and indicators of future activity,\nsuch as the purchasing manager’s index, have moderated but are still in expansionary\nterritory. Rather than a recession, the softening data seem consistent with the pandemic-\n6 The GDPNow forecast is available on the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s website at\nhttps://www.frbatlanta.org/cqer/research/gdpnow.\n\n- 5 -\nrelated transition underway since last year among consumers from spending on goods to\nspending on services. And we should expect that as policy tightening feeds through the\neconomy it will dampen household and business spending decisions—that is the\nobjective of our policy tightening.\nPast experience has shown that job creation and the unemployment rate are timely\nindicators of a recession, more timely than quarterly GDP. I will watch all the data\ncarefully, but the factors I just cited, along with the evident strength across different\nmeasures of the labor market, leave me feeling fairly confident that the U.S. economy did\nnot enter a recession in the first half of 2022 and that the economic expansion will\ncontinue.\nPersistently High Inflation\nNow let’s talk about inflation. Yesterday’s report on the consumer price index\n(CPI) for June was a major league disappointment. On a twelve-month basis, total\ninflation stood at 9.1 percent, the highest in 40 years. Core, which came down slightly in\nthe last couple months, has averaged over 6 percent this year, and is too high as well. No\nmatter how you look at the data, inflation is far too high and my job is to move it down\ntoward our 2 percent target.\nWe know that supply shortages and bottlenecks, including the tight labor market,\nhave contributed to the high inflation readings we are observing. We also know that the\nsurge in demand during the pandemic that was driven by excess saving, significant fiscal\nstimulus, and accommodative monetary policy also has contributed to the high inflation\nwe are now experiencing. There is some research estimating how much of this inflation\n\n- 6 -\ncame from supply problems and how much from high demand.7 The main point is that\nboth played a large part in driving the inflation that we have seen over the past year.\nBut the causes of inflation don’t affect my approach to policy because in writing\nthe FOMC’s mandate, Congress did not say “Your goal is price stability unless inflation\nis caused by supply shocks, in which case you are off the hook.” We want to reduce\nexcessive inflation, whatever the source, in part because whether it comes from supply or\ndemand, high inflation can push up longer-run inflation expectations and thus affect\nspending and pricing decisions in the near term. These decisions can then push up prices\neven more and make inflation harder to get under control.\nI pay attention to both surveys of the public’s inflation expectations and measures\nof inflation expectations derived from trading of inflation-indexed securities. I prefer the\nlatter market-based measures, which are down from recent peaks but still elevated. The\nBoard staff combines various surveys and market-based measures in our Index of\nCommon Inflation Expectations, which has moved up slightly in recent months after\nbeing flat for a long time. We need to avoid expectations rising so much that they\nbecome a factor that drives inflation higher.\nThe Path of Monetary Policy\nSo, based on persistently high inflation and the very tight labor market that I have\ndescribed, let’s talk about the implications for monetary policy. Since March, the FOMC\n7 A recent paper estimates that two-thirds of U.S. inflation is demand driven, while one-third is due to\nsupply disturbances; see Julian di Giovanni, Sebnem Kalemli-Ozcan, Alvaro Silva, and Muhammed\nYildirim (2022), “Global Supply Chain Pressures, International Trade, and Inflation,” paper presented at\nthe ECB Forum on Central Banking 2022, Sintra, Portugal, June 27–29,\nhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/conferences/ecbforum/shared/pdf/2022/Kalemli-Oezcan_paper.pdf. Also\nsee Adam Hale Shapiro (2022), “How Much Do Supply and Demand Drive Inflation?” FRBSF Economic\nLetter 2022-15 (San Francisco: Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, June),\nhttps://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-letter/2022/june/how-much-do-supply-\nand-demand-drive-inflation.\n\n- 7 -\nhas raised the federal funds rate three times for a cumulative 150 basis points. This is the\nfastest pace of tightening in close to 30 years. At our last meeting, we raised the policy\nrate by 75 basis points, which is a large move by historical standards. That size increase\nwas not an over-reaction to one data point on inflation—it was primarily the response to a\nsequence of excessively high inflation readings since the beginning of the year. It was\nappropriate given the lack of progress on inflation and clearly signals the FOMC’s\ncommitment to get inflation under control as soon as possible.\nThe response of financial markets to the FOMC’s policy actions and\ncommunications indicate to me that the Committee retains the credibility and the public\nconfidence that is needed to make monetary policy effective. Longer-term interest rates\nhave moved up to levels not far from those reflected in Committee members’ estimates of\nthe final destination for the federal funds rate in this tightening cycle, effectively\nimplementing policy ahead of time. The average rate for a 30-year conforming fixed rate\nhome mortgage has increased by more than two percentage points since the end of 2021.\nWhile there is some slowdown in home sales, lenders and borrowers are still doing\nbusiness at these rates, which indicates that they believe the FOMC’s policy intentions\nare credible, as broadly reflected in the interest rate paths in the Summary of Economic\nProjections (SEP).\nAs I have said before, with inflation so high, there is a virtue in front-loading\ntightening so that policy moves as soon as is practical to a setting that restricts demand.\nGetting there sooner will bolster the public’s confidence that we can get inflation down\nand it will preserve options for adjusting the pace of tightening later if needed.\n\n- 8 -\nWith this view, it should not be surprising that looking toward the FOMC’s next\nmeeting July 26-27, and with the CPI data in hand, I support another 75-basis point\nincrease, bringing the target range for the federal funds rate to 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent\nbefore August. I judge that level is close to neutral, by which I mean a level that neither\nstimulates nor restricts demand, assuming that the economy is growing moderately (at its\npotential) and unemployment is roughly where it is now.\nHowever, my base case for July depends on incoming data. We have important\ndata releases on retail sales and housing coming in before the July meeting. If that data\ncome in materially stronger than expected it would make me lean towards a larger hike at\nthe July meeting to the extent it shows demand is not slowing down fast enough to get\ninflation down.\nBased on what we know about inflation today, I expect that further increases in\nthe target range will be needed to make monetary policy restrictive, but that will depend\non economic data in the coming weeks and months. Between the end of July and the\nFOMC’s September meeting, we will get two employment and CPI reports with data for\nJuly and August. I will be looking for signs that inflation has started its move down\ntoward our 2 percent target on a sustained basis.\nI anticipate a decline in inflation will come as actual and anticipated hikes by the\nFOMC cool demand for products and labor, which will help demand and supply come\ninto a better balance. The decline in the rate of inflation will also be assisted by\ncontinued improvement in goods supply bottlenecks, which is occurring in some sectors,\nand an increase in labor force participation, which is still significantly lower than it was\nbefore the pandemic. I hope these supply recoveries happen, but my expectations for\n\n- 9 -\npolicy don’t rely on it. I expect rate increases will continue after July at a pace that is\ndependent on the incoming data.\nAfter the July meeting, further increases will be restricting demand. Looking\nfurther in the future, I will need to see how the tightening this year is affecting the\neconomy and bringing inflation down toward our 2 percent target. Based on my forecast\nfor the economy, I expect monetary policy to be restrictive until there has been a\nsustained reduction in core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) inflation, which\nexcludes food and energy. Food and energy prices tend to be volatile, so focusing on\ncore PCE inflation is a good guide to inflation pressures in the near and medium term.\nImportantly, as futures prices for commodities—food, energy, raw materials—have\ndeclined recently, I am expecting total PCE inflation to decline in coming months. But\nuntil I see a significant moderation in core prices, I support further rate hikes.\nIn talking about where monetary policy is headed, it is helpful to get a fix on\nwhere it is right now. I mentioned the concept of a “neutral” interest rate, and the belief\nthat the federal funds rate will be close to neutral after another 75-basis point increase at\nthe end of this month. But some would argue that monetary policy is actually further\naway from neutral, based on the fact that current inflation is so much higher than the\nfederal funds rate.\nIn my view, that rests on a flawed idea of how monetary policy affects spending\ndecisions. That’s because spending decisions that require borrowing are based on an\noutlook that extends several years. This means taking into consideration longer-term real\nrates, which are tied to the expected path of policy and inflation over the next several\nyears.\n\n- 10 -\nAs a result, I think that estimates of the real federal funds rate should be based on\nthe expected policy rate one to one and a half years in the future. Based on trading in\ninflation-indexed Treasury securities of different maturities (compared to nominal\nTreasury securities), investors see federal funds rates above expected inflation starting\nabout six months from now and steepening thereafter. Primary securities dealers\nsurveyed by the New York Fed likewise estimate the real federal funds rate will be a\npositive 0.7 percent in mid-2023 and 1 percent by mid-2024. This gives me some\nconfidence that tightening now anticipated by markets and expected by FOMC\nparticipants will be sufficient to reduce demand and inflation.\nEvolution of the Economy\nThe FOMC’s plan for getting inflation under control depends on a view of the\neconomic outlook. As I have noted in past speeches, accurate economic forecasting is\nvery hard, especially when unusual factors, like a war, and unprecedented factors, like a\npandemic, buffet the global economy.8 FOMC participants record their individual\noutlooks that are presented every three months in the SEP. At our June meeting, the\nlatest SEP shows that there is some expectation among participants for what is often\nreferred to as a soft landing. With a policy path like what I described for this year and a\nbit more tightening next year, the median SEP respondent projected that total PCE\ninflation is expected to fall from its current elevated level today to 2.2 percent in the\nfourth quarter of 2024. At the same time, the unemployment rate is projected to rise to\n8 See Christopher J. Waller (2021), \"A Hopeless and Imperative Endeavor: Lessons from the Pandemic for\nEconomic Forecasters,\" speech delivered at the Forecasters Club of New York, New York, December 17,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20211217a.htm.\n\n- 11 -\n3.7 percent at the end of this year and to 4.1 percent by the end of 2024, while GDP\nwould grow below its long-run trend for the next two years.\nOf course, we can’t be very certain about the path of the economy more than a\nfew months in the future, but this medium-term view of a soft landing is very plausible. I\nsay this based on the optimistic view I expressed earlier about the strength of the labor\nmarket and on my analysis of the relationship between job vacancies and the\nunemployment rate. In a recent speech, I noted that we have an historically high number\nof job vacancies compared to the number of unemployed people.9 Some people have\nargued that past experience indicates we cannot reduce this large number of vacancies\nwithout a big increase in the unemployment rate. But I have showed that past experience\nactually indicates that a reduction in vacancies can take place without a big loss of\nemployment, and this is the kind of soft landing anticipated by FOMC participants. So,\nwhile some data measures suggest the chances of recession have increased, I believe it\ncan be avoided.\nUncertainty over how the pandemic could afflict the economy in the future, and\nglobal economic risks related to the war in Ukraine are considerable. These factors could\nmake future policy decisions more difficult than they are today. However, for the reasons\nI have laid out, and considering the evidence on the state of the economy and the outlook,\nI don’t find it difficult to reaffirm my strong conviction that continued policy tightening\nwill be appropriate to move inflation down toward our 2 percent target. I think we need\n9 For a discussion of the Beveridge curve and how the data on vacancies show a soft landing is possible, see\nChristopher J.

Waller\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nEconomic Forecast Project\nUniversity of California, Santa Barbara\nSanta Barbara, California\nFebruary 24, 2022\n\nThank you Peter, and thank you to the UCSB Economic Forecast Project for the\ninvitation to speak today. My plan is to start with my outlook for the U.S. economy in\n2022, and then describe what I consider the appropriate path of monetary policy to keep\nthe economy on a healthy and sustainable course.1 But, before I get into that discussion,\nlet me comment on what I think is on everyone’s minds today, Russia’s attack on\nUkraine. Obviously, there are people in harm’s way and we shouldn’t lose sight of them.\nIt is far too early to judge how this conflict will affect the world, or the world economy,\nand what the implications will be for the U.S. economy. But this situation adds\nuncertainty to my outlook and will be something I will be monitoring very closely. As\nmy speech will say, we will need to carefully look at the incoming data, especially during\na time of heightened uncertainty.\nTurning to my outlook for the economy, my greatest concern is continued\nelevated inflation. Inflation is too high, and I think concerted action is needed to rein it\nin. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has multiple tools to tighten monetary\npolicy, and I will go into some detail about how I believe the Fed should approach\nincreasing the target range for the federal funds rate and reducing the size of the balance\nsheet.\nBut let me start with the outlook for economic activity. I expect the economy to\ncontinue expanding at a healthy rate this year, slower than in 2021 but still at a solid pace\nthat will keep employment growing strongly. While there are some signs that the effects\nof the Omicron variant have dampened economic growth in the last month or two, it does\nnot appear to have affected hiring, given the healthy jobs report for January. Even\n1 These views are my own and do not represent any position of the Board of Governors or other Federal\nReserve policymakers.\n\n- 2 -\nCOVID-sensitive sectors such as leisure and hospitality saw big job gains last month.\nWith COVID cases dropping sharply, I expect this latest surge in infections will not be a\nmajor factor affecting the economy in 2022. Supply bottlenecks and labor shortages,\nsome of them related to the pandemic, continue to weigh on economic output, but I\nexpect those to diminish later this year.\nThe combination of strong consumer demand and supply constraints has produced\nvery high inflation. The consumer price index (CPI) was up 7.5 percent for the 12\nmonths through January, the highest yearly rate in 40 years. With appropriate monetary\npolicy, and the expected easing in supply constraints, I am hopeful inflation will move\ndown over the course of this year, even with the recent geopolitical developments.\nNevertheless, the path of inflation is the biggest risk to my outlook.\nAs we move through this year, I can’t emphasize enough how much this outlook,\nand the appropriate stance of monetary policy, will be influenced by the data that we see\nabout the performance of the economy. I know, I know. Saying you need to be data\ndependent is like saying you are for motherhood and apple pie—who would disagree?\nBut in the current situation, it is urgently important to be data dependent. For example,\nlike most people, I expected the Omicron surge would hammer job creation in January,\nbut the data showed that this didn’t happen. The ups and downs in forecasts during the\npandemic should be evidence enough that policy decisions this year, more than ever, will\nneed to be guided by the data, and not by what past experience suggests should happen.2\n2 In December, I discussed lessons from the pandemic for economic forecasters, which included a review of\nforecasting misses for output and inflation. See Christopher J. Waller (2021), “A Hopeless and Imperative\nEndeavor: Lessons from the Pandemic for Economic Forecasters,” speech delivered at the Forecasters\nClub of New York, New York, December 17,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20211217a.htm.\n\n- 3 -\nMissouri, which is home for me, is the Show Me State, so if you want to know how my\noutlook will evolve, show me the data. With that in hand, I will evaluate the outlook with\nrespect to the Fed’s dual mandate in determining the appropriate setting for monetary\npolicy.\nThe Labor Market\nLet’s start with where the economy stands with respect to maximum employment.\nIn December, I said that we were “closing in” on this objective.3 Since then, the labor\nmarket has continued to strengthen. I now believe we have achieved the FOMC’s\nobjective of maximum employment. So, what has changed and made me more certain\nabout that?\nA big factor was the jobs report for January, which included very strong data for\nthat month, upward revisions for November and December, and revisions for all of 2021.\nWhat we learned from those changes was that a reported slowdown in job creation in the\nsecond half of the year never happened, and that in fact job creation was remarkably\nsteady throughout the year, averaging 555,000 a month and never deviating very far from\nthat trend. These revisions helped explain why we saw such large and steady declines\nover the year in the unemployment rate, which fell from 6.4 percent in January 2021 to 4\npercent in January 2022, which happens to be the median of FOMC participants’\nDecember estimates of the longer-run unemployment rate. Accounting for retirees\nleaving the workforce, I estimate that employment is close to the levels of February 2020,\nright before the pandemic shock hit the economy and when the target range for the\nfederal funds rate was much higher than the current target range.\n3 See Waller, “A Hopeless and Imperative Endeavor,” in note 2.\n\n- 4 -\nThe January job numbers were just one monthly report, but one reason I have the\nconfidence to declare that maximum employment has been reached is the message\nJanuary sent about the durability of the continuing recovery. Based on recent data,\nincluding a big increase in retail sales in January, it sure looks like a very significant\nsurge in COVID has failed to derail or even appreciably slow the economy. It has been\nhazardous to predict much about the economic effects of the pandemic more than a\nmonth or two out, but I’m comfortable saying we are at maximum employment in part\nbecause of the evidence that the labor market is continuing to strengthen.\nAnother message from the January report, including the revisions to each month\nof 2021, is that, so far at least, labor shortages do not seem to be having a huge effect on\nthe economy’s capacity to create jobs. Job creation didn’t slow appreciably in November\nand December as originally reported; it actually was higher than the average for the rest\nof the year. Labor force participation isn’t growing as much as one would expect with\nthe hot job market, but apparently it’s growing enough to keep the job creation machine\nhumming.\nAnother factor that signals we are at maximum employment is the continued rise\nin measures of labor compensation. The broadest measure of labor compensation,\ncovering wages and benefits, is the employment cost index, which for private sector\nworkers rose at a 4.7 percent annual rate in October, November and December, the fastest\npace in 20 years. Average hourly earnings also continue to grow more strongly than they\nhave in decades, and the gains are widespread across sectors. Job vacancies also indicate\nlabor demand is exceptionally strong with nearly 3 million more vacancies than\nindividuals looking for work.\n\n- 5 -\nInflation\nWhile I will continue to watch data on the labor market, I am focusing most of my\nattention on inflation, which is far too high and needs to come down. In December, some\npeople were a little surprised to hear me say that inflation was “alarmingly high,” but\nafter the latest inflation numbers, I think we all should be alarmed. It is alarming because\nhigh inflation is especially painful for lower- and middle-income people, who don’t have\na choice about paying more for gasoline, groceries, shelter, and other necessities. It is\nalarming because of the risk that high inflation could become ingrained in people’s\nexpectations and prove difficult to rein in, undermining economic growth.\nThe 7.5 percent increase in the CPI in January came after a 7.1 percent increase in\nDecember. It was the 11th consecutive month that inflation exceeded 2 percent. The\nFOMC targets another measure of inflation, the price deflator for personal consumption\nexpenditures (PCE), which will be reported tomorrow. But for both measures, inflation\nhas been increasingly broad-based for quite some time. For the CPI, better than 70\npercent of items measured are up 3 percent or more in the last 12 months, and for PCE\ninflation, 60 percent of items were up that much in December.\nHigh inflation is a significant problem for individuals and families, and it makes it\ndifficult for businesses to control costs and adjust prices. There is also the risk that the\npublic’s expectations of future inflation rise significantly, which affects spending\ndecisions in the short term and thus can have the effect of driving inflation even higher.\nKeeping longer-term inflation expectations anchored is vitally important for monetary\npolicy. In fact, the FOMC’s Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy\nStrategy emphasizes that longer-term inflation expectations that are well anchored at 2\n\n- 6 -\npercent foster price stability and enhance the Committee's ability to promote maximum\nemployment in the face of significant economic disturbances.\nSurveys of consumers’ expected inflation over the next year moved up quite\nnotably through 2021 and are currently elevated. And the public’s expectations of\ninflation over the next five years have risen as well. That said, five-year inflation\nexpectations are where they were over the past couple of decades when inflation stayed\nlow. Importantly, longer-term expectations are much more stable. For example, future\ninflation measured by investors trading inflation-adjusted securities has 5-to10-year\nimplied compensation around 2.2 percent, which, adjusted for the FOMC’s preferred\nmeasure, PCE, is close to 2 percent. In the same way that expectations of much higher\ninflation can drive a cycle of ever-increasing inflation, when expectations are “anchored”\nand don’t move significantly, it can have the effect of helping moderate surges in\ninflation, such as the one we have seen over the past year.\nAs for what inflation does next, I think anyone who makes a forecast has to own\nthe fact that very few of us foresaw how much inflation would increase in 2021. We\nunderestimated the extent to which supply constraints—from bottlenecks to labor supply\nshortages—and strong demand would drive up inflation, and we thought bottlenecks and\nshortages would begin to resolve sooner than now. I think we have a clearer idea today\nof the effect of those factors on inflation but going forward we need see how geopolitical\neffects influence energy, commodity, and other prices. With some humility, while I am\nalarmed about the level of inflation and a bit uncertain about how the near-term may play\nout, I am hopeful that these factors and their price effects are likely to ease in the second\n\n- 7 -\nhalf of 2022 and that with appropriate monetary policy, inflation will be coming down\nsignificantly by year end.\nI will be watching closely the data on supply pressures and how those feed into\ntotal consumer prices, and I’ll be monitoring carefully to see whether expectations rise\nout of a range that would suggest they are becoming unanchored. As I said earlier, it is\ntoo soon to know how Russia’s attack on Ukraine will affect the U.S. economy, and it\nmay not be much easier by the time of our March meeting.\nAppropriate Monetary Policy\nNow let me spell out what my outlook implies for appropriate monetary policy\nover the course of 2022. Based on the inflation data in hand, I believe the Fed needs to\nact promptly to begin tightening monetary policy. As I said earlier, I believe that we\nhave achieved our employment goal and that the labor market will keep improving,\nwhich means there should be no delay in responding to inflation that is significantly\nabove our target.\nThe FOMC has already taken actions to end asset purchases in early March, and I\nbelieve that the recent inflation and jobs reports have made the case to begin raising the\ntarget range for the federal funds rate at our March FOMC meeting.\nBased on my outlook, my preference is to increase the target range 100 basis\npoints by the middle of this year. That is, I expect inflation to remain elevated and only\nshow modest signs of deceleration over the next several months. As a result, I believe\nappropriate interest rate policy brings the target range up to 1 to 1.25 percent early in the\nsummer. That would be a bit below where rates were at the outbreak of the pandemic,\n\n- 8 -\nwhen inflation was considerably lower, and before we more than doubled the Fed’s\nbalance sheet, so I consider this a necessary and prudent start to tightening policy.\nThe pace of tightening will depend on the data. One possibility is that the target\nrange is raised 25 basis points at each of our next four meetings. But if, for example,\ntomorrow’s PCE inflation report for January, and jobs and CPI reports for February\nindicate that the economy is still running exceedingly hot, a strong case can be made for a\n50-basis-point hike in March. In this state of the world, front-loading a 50-point hike\nwould help convey the Committee’s determination to address high inflation, about which\nthere should be no question. Of course, it is possible that the state of the world will be\ndifferent in the wake of the Ukraine attack, and that may mean that a more modest\ntightening is appropriate, but that remains to be seen. With the economy at full\nemployment and inflation far above target, we should signal that we are moving back to\nneutral at a fast pace based on the performance of the economy, and a 50-basis point hike\nwould help do that. Consequently, should the data break against us in the coming weeks,\nwe need to be prepared to hike the policy rate by 50-basis points.\nNo matter the near-term path of reducing accommodation, the FOMC must\nrespond decisively to the data so as to maintain our credibility that we will bring down\ninflation. We constantly say we have the tools to fight inflation, and now we must\ndemonstrate the will to use them.\nWhile I believe that we should raise the target range by 1 percentage point over\nthe next several months, I will be assessing the incoming data to decide whether further\nrate increases in 2022 are warranted and, if so, at what pace they should be implemented.\nIf high inflation persists, then I would most likely support that we continue hiking, and\n\n- 9 -\npotentially increase the pace of tightening. If inflation moderates in the second half of\nthe year, as I expect, and as market participants expect, then we can slow the pace of\ntightening or even pause. As I said earlier—show me the data.\nTurning to balance sheet policy, as I noted, the Committee has decided to end\nasset purchases in early March. Initially, we will be keeping the size of the Fed’s balance\nsheet constant by reinvesting the proceeds of maturing securities. The FOMC has not\ndecided when to begin the reduction in the size of the balance sheet, but we issued a set\nof principles last month that make it clear that changing the target range of the federal\nfunds rate is our principal monetary policy tool, and that balance sheet reductions through\nthe “runoff” from maturing securities would commence after rate hikes have begun.\nI support starting this process no later than the July FOMC meeting. The pace of\nthe reduction in asset holdings has not been determined but will be consistent with\npromoting the FOMC’s employment and inflation goals and will be communicated well\nin advance to the public so that the plan is predictable.\nThe last time we reduced our balance sheet we did the following: First, we waited\ntwo years after our first-rate hike before commencing balance sheet runoff. Second, we\nimposed monthly caps on the amount of maturing securities that we would let run off.\nThese caps started out very low and were gradually lifted over a period of 12 months.\nSo, why not follow the same strategy this time?\nFirst, back in 2017 and 2018 we had never intentionally reduced our balance sheet\nbefore. This was new territory for the Fed, so we went slow. Second, the Committee\nwas considering moving to an ample reserves regime for conducting monetary policy,\nwhere we wanted to keep the banking system flush with reserves. Thus, we had no idea\n\n- 10 -\nhow far we could let reserves fall before we might cause an unwelcome shortage of\nreserves. Third, the economy was in a much different place; in particular inflation was\nmuch lower. Finally, we only expected to run off about $2 trillion of securities from our\nbalance sheet. In that environment it made sense to go slow and gradual in terms of\nbalance sheet reduction.\nFast forward to today. This is now the second time we have done balance sheet\nreduction and we learned from experience and can go faster than before. Policymakers\nand markets have a good understanding now of how the process works.\nIn terms of the appropriate size of the caps, I believe they can be larger than last\ntime for several reasons. First, we have a very large balance sheet—securities holdings\nhave increased $4.5 trillion since the start of the pandemic and the balance sheet is nearly\n$9 trillion. So even with a hefty reduction in holdings over the next year, we will still\nhave a balance sheet that will be more than sufficiently large enough to conduct monetary\npolicy. Second, the Fed’s overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility, put in place to\nhelp conduct monetary policy, receives a large amount of deposits each day. The daily\naverage take-up of $1.6 trillion so far in 2022 tells me that there is tremendous excess\nliquidity in financial markets. Large redemption caps will assist in removing this excess\nliquidity. Third, we have learned a lot about operating in an ample reserves regime over\nthe past decade. And we learned lessons from the 2019 experience in reducing reserves.\nIn the first quarter of 2019 the ratio of reserves to nominal gross domestic product (GDP)\nwas approximately 8 percent and financial markets worked well and banks were flush\nwith liquidity. Right now, reserves are far more than ample, standing at 17 percent of\nGDP. When evidence suggests that we are getting closer to a more appropriate and\n\n- 11 -\nsustainable level of reserves, we can slow the pace of redemptions. Finally, we have the\nnewly established standing repurchase facility, which acts as a backstop to buffer any\nunexpected liquidity needs. This facility can help assist us with any unexpected bumps\nalong the way.\nWith large caps and sizable amounts of securities maturing over the course of the\nnext year or two, I do not see the need to consider asset sales anytime soon. However,\nbecause the Fed’s mortgage-backed securities (MBS) holdings have long maturities and\nare quite sizable, prepayments are unlikely to bring these holdings down to de minimis\nlevels over the next decade. So, MBS sales could be something the Committee considers\ndown the road to satisfy our balance sheet principles long run goal of holding primarily\nTreasury securities. But that is a conversation for another day. In the meantime, I would\nsupport having no caps on MBS redemptions so our MBS holdings decline as fast as\nprepayments allow, which would modestly assist in moving us toward an all-Treasury\nportfolio.\nThinking about possible monetary policy actions in 2022, I expect it will be a\nvery fluid year. The Chair has said we will be nimble. I believe nimble describes how\nwe acted in 2021 as well, when nimbleness and good communications served the FOMC\nwell. Think back to the middle of 2021. Just last June, markets expected tapering to\nbegin sometime in 2022, the majority of FOMC participants called for liftoff in 2023, and\nprimary dealers surveyed in July by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York predicted a\ndecline in the balance sheet wouldn’t start until the middle of 2025. Wow, how things\nhave changed.\n\n- 12 -\nOver the course of the second half of last year, market expectations of the taper’s\nbeginning quickly moved to November, and then a month after it started, markets\npredicted it would be completed this March. Soon after, markets were pricing liftoff in\nMarch, with several rate hikes over the course of 2022. And now markets are also\nfocused on the start of the decline in the balance sheet sometime this year. It is\ninteresting to note that these dramatic changes in actual and anticipated monetary policy\nhave occurred without volatility or strain in financial markets. I believe the FOMC has\nbeen highly effective in communicating its shifting outlook for the economy and\nappropriate policy actions as the data revealed that inflation was increasing much more\nthan forecasters expected.\nAnother point to make about the big changes in actual and anticipated monetary\npolicy is that they are showing up in the financial data today. Financial conditions are\ntighter, I believe, because of the credible, forward guidance policymakers have\ncommunicated to the public. Although the Fed hasn’t started raising rates or reducing the\nbalance sheet, interest rates have moved up notably. For example, the 2-year Treasury\nyield is more than 1 percentage point higher today than at the start of the third quarter of\nlast year. The 10-year Treasury yield is up 1/2 percentage point, and the 30-year fixed\nmortgage rate is up about 1 percentage point over this period. Going forward,\npolicymakers will adjust policy as needed, which will reinforce the Fed’s credibility.\nLet me conclude by saying I hope my remarks today contribute to the Fed’s\neffective and credible communications. One message you should take away is that the\ncourse of policy is not pre-set, and the course I favor will be determined by my\ninterpretation of new data. In the past couple months, inflation and employment data\n\n- 13 -\nhave been sending the same, unequivocal message—it is time to start tightening\nmonetary policy. We need to take the first step in March to get off the effective lower\nbound. Then we should continue with hikes as well as begin to reduce our balance sheet.\nI will continue to monitor the geopolitical situation to assess the appropriate timing of\nthis near-term monetary policy tightening. These actions will get us into the second half\nof the year, when we will have six months of inflation data, and we can assess what the\nappropriate path will be for the rest of 2022. Our goal is a soft landing for the economy\nthat keeps output and employment growing at a healthy pace and inflation moving toward\nthe FOMC’s 2 percent objective.",

Waller\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nPayments Innovation Conference\nFederal Reserve Board\nWashington, D.C.\nOctober 21, 2025\n\nThank you, Susan, and good morning, everyone. It is my pleasure to welcome\nyou to the Federal Reserve Board for our first Payments Innovation Conference. 1 My\nobjective in creating this conference is twofold. First, I wanted to have a conference that\nfocused on the new technologies that have come from the defi and crypto worlds and how\nthey are entering the mainstream payments ecosystem. My goal is to have a vibrant\ndiscussion about payments between the traditional payment incumbents and the new\nentrants from the defi world. Second, I wanted to send a message that this is a new era\nfor the Federal Reserve in payments—the defi industry is not viewed with suspicion or\nscorn. Rather, today, you are welcomed to the conversation on the future of payments in\nthe United States and on our home field—something that would have been unimaginable\na few years ago.\nAs you all know, we are well into a technology-driven revolution in payments,\nand I am here to say that the Federal Reserve intends to be an active part of that\nrevolution.\nA number of technological advances are transforming the payment system.\nStablecoins and tokenized assets making use of distributed ledger technology. The rapid\nadoption of artificial intelligence (AI). And, increasingly, the convergence between these\ninnovations and the traditional financial ecosystem. This includes the institutions and\ninfrastructure that our economy has long depended on to operate a safe and efficient\npayment system. And, yes, this also includes the Federal Reserve. The revolution\ntransforming payments is demanding change everywhere, and I will say more in a\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nmoment about some new ideas that the Federal Reserve is studying to support these\ninnovations.\nI have spoken before about what I see as the two broad models of payments\ninnovation in our market economy.2 The first is private-sector-driven innovation. Most\ninnovation comes from the private sector, which is motivated and best positioned to\nallocate resources and take risks to explore new technologies. The second model is when\npublic-sector entities such as the Fed build platforms and provide services that enable the\nprivate sector to more readily and rapidly expand new services to its customers. This\nshould be done rarely and in limited circumstances where it addresses a specific market\nneed. The posture of public institutions, including the Federal Reserve, should be to\nacknowledge and embrace private-sector innovation that can improve the payment\nsystem while preserving its safety and stability, which are as essential to the new\ngeneration of innovators as they are to legacy institutions.\nLet me pull back a moment and remind everyone how we got here. Since nearly\nits founding, the Federal Reserve System has worked to facilitate payment and settlement\nsystem efficiency alongside the private sector. From the beginning, the clearing services\nprovided by Reserve Banks obviated the need for daily movements of cash in armored\ncars with heavily armed guards. Long before we started speaking of the “payment rails”\nthat are facilitating the kind of innovation we will be discussing today, the Fed was\nrunning trains on steel rails to deliver and clear paper checks traveling across the country.\nFedwire began conducting interbank transfers through telegraph wires in the early 20th\n2 See Christopher J. Waller (2025), “Technological Advancements in Payments,” speech delivered at the\nWyoming Blockchain Symposium 2025, Teton Village, Wyoming, August 20,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250820a.htm.\n\n- 3 -\ncentury. Fast forward to today, where we have multiple infrastructures that settle\ninterbank transfers in real time.\nToday’s conference will focus on private-sector-driven innovation. We have\nassembled 100 private-sector innovators who are leveraging cutting-edge technology to\ncreate new possibilities in the payments landscape. Our panelists are engaged in\nintegrating traditional financial payment rails with distributed ledgers, developing new\nproducts and services in the digital asset ecosystem, and leveraging AI in the payments\nlandscape.\nIt’s worth noting that the firms engaged in these activities include banks, asset\nmanagers, retail payments firms, technology companies, as well as crypto-native fintechs.\nThis is an acknowledgement that distributed ledgers and crypto-assets are no longer on\nthe fringes but increasingly are woven into the fabric of the payment and financial\nsystems.\nBefore we hear from these innovators, I would like to touch on the roles that the\nFederal Reserve plays to support the private sector. These include serving as a convener\nto solve coordination problems and operating core payment and settlement infrastructure.\nWe are also looking ahead, conducting hands-on research on tokenization, smart\ncontracts, and the intersection of AI and payments for use in our own payment systems.\nWe do this to understand the innovation happening within the payment system as well as\nto evaluate whether these technologies could provide opportunities to upgrade our own\npayment infrastructures and to enable us to have deeper conversations with the industry\non these new technologies.\n\n- 4 -\nWhile this is a good start, I believe we can and should do more to support those\nactively transforming the payment system. To that end, I have asked Federal Reserve\nstaff to explore the idea of what I am calling a “payment account.” Today, Federal\nReserve Banks provide access to master accounts and financial services to legally eligible\nentities following our Guidelines for Evaluating Account and Services Requests. The\npayment account would be available to all institutions that are legally eligible for an\naccount and could be beneficial for those focused primarily on payments innovations.\nThis payment account concept would be targeted to provide basic Federal Reserve\npayment services to legally eligible institutions that right now conduct payment services\nprimarily through a third-party bank that has a full-fledged master account. There are\nmany eligible firms engaged in substantial payments activities that may not want or need\nall the bells and whistles of a master account, or access to the full suite of Federal\nReserve financial services, to successfully innovate and provide services to their\ncustomers. The idea is to tailor the services of these new accounts to the needs of these\nfirms and the risks they present to the Federal Reserve Banks and the payment system.\nAccordingly, and importantly, these lower-risk payment accounts would have a\nstreamlined timeline for review. Payments innovation moves fast, and the Federal\nReserve needs to keep up.\nTo be more concrete, let me describe a possible prototype for this type of payment\naccount or, as I sometimes call it, a “skinny” master account. The account would provide\naccess to the Federal Reserve payment rails while controlling for various risks to the\nFederal Reserve and the payment system. To control the size of the accounts and\nassociated impacts on the Fed’s balance sheet, the Reserve Banks would not pay interest\n\n- 5 -\non balances in a payment account, and balance caps may be imposed. These accounts\nwould not have daylight overdraft privileges—if the balance hits zero, payments will be\nrejected. They would not be eligible for discount window borrowing or have access to all\nFederal Reserve payment services for which the Reserve Banks cannot control the risk of\ndaylight overdrafts. I want to be clear that this is just a prototype idea to provide some\nclarity on how things could change. The upshot is that, in my view, the payments\nlandscape, as well as the types of providers, has evolved dramatically in recent years,\nand, accordingly, a new payments account could better reflect this new reality.\nAs Federal Reserve staff examine this idea, we will engage with all interested\nstakeholders to hear perspectives on the benefits and drawbacks to this approach. You\nwill be hearing more about this shortly.\nLet me wrap up here so we can get to the really exciting part of this conference,\nwhich is about innovation and the future of payments. Thank you to the panelists who\ntook the time to participate, those in the audience who agreed to be here, and the many\nothers watching online. And a special thanks to Fed staff, who moved very fast to get\nthis together quickly to fit into a very busy fall at the Fed. On with the conference!",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n10:15 a.m. EST\nMarch 1, 2024\nThoughts on Quantitative Tightening, Including Remarks on the Paper\n“Quantitative Tightening around the Globe: What Have We Learned?”\nRemarks by\nChristopher J. Waller\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\n2024 U.S. Monetary Policy Forum\nNew York, New York\nMarch 1, 2024\n\nThank you, it is great to be here. I’m pleased to participate in this panel to discuss\na policy action now being implemented by central banks around the globe: quantitative\ntightening (QT).1 I want to thank Kristin, Matt, and Wenxin for putting together a great\npaper that provides an overview of the effects of QT across seven central banks.\nOften called “large-scale asset purchases” (LSAPs) by central bankers, the view\nof quantitative easing, or QE, as a tool to add monetary policy accommodation and QT to\ntighten policy has changed over time. When it was used during and after the Global\nFinancial Crisis, QE was deemed an “unconventional” tool in central banks’ arsenals.\nBut QE has now been used numerous times in the past two decades for extended periods\nwhen the policy rate was at the effective lower bound, so I would say it is no longer\nunconventional.\nGiven the role of QE and QT in the policy toolkit, it is good to have researchers\nand policymakers examine how asset purchases work and talk about current issues\nassociated with their implementation. This paper is very timely and thorough in looking\nacross countries and their experiences with QE and QT. There is a lot packed into this\nwork that makes it a little difficult to fully assess in the time we have today. So I will\nfocus my comments on four points: (1) the evidence that the effects of QE are\nasymmetric to the effects of QT; (2) the execution of QE versus the execution of QT in\nthe United States; (3) the role of announcement effects of QT; and, finally, (4) who has\ntaken the Fed’s place in buying assets when we withdraw from the market. I will then\nend with some thoughts about issues facing the Federal Reserve as we move forward with\nnormalizing our balance sheet.\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nThe Asymmetry of Quantitative Easing versus Quantitative Tightening\nFor me, one of the most interesting results of the paper is that the announcement\neffects of quantitative easing are much larger than the announcement effects of\nquantitative tightening. The authors find that announcements of QT have a small but\nstatistically significant effect in increasing government bond yields—about 4 to 8 basis\npoints. But this effect is much smaller, in absolute terms, than the prevailing estimates of\nthe decrease in yields from announcements of QE. The conclusion is that the interest rate\neffects of QE and QT are asymmetric. For an economist, this result may seem\npuzzling—why would changing the sign on an action lead to asymmetric effects on\nprices and real variables?\nEver since central banks initiated QE in response to the Global Financial Crisis,\nacademics have debated its effectiveness. One view is that it has a very limited effect in\nsituations where a central bank is swapping zero interest-bearing reserves for zero\ninterest-bearing shorter-term Treasury securities. Because the two assets would seem to\nbe nearly perfect substitutes, there can be no price effects from altering the composition\nof the two assets. The central bank is simply swapping two $10 bills for a twenty. If this\nis true, then undoing the trade via QT has no effect either. It should be symmetrical.\nThe alternative view, based on market segmentation or preferred habitat theory, is\nthat when a central bank uses reserves to pay for government securities, it is decreasing\nthe supply of these securities to private investors, which will bid up the price and lower\nthe interest rate on government securities.2 By lowering interest rates on longer-maturity\n2 There are several theories for how QE works. The market segmentation theory suggests that assets of\ndifferent maturities are imperfect substitutes, so a lower supply of long-term assets and a higher supply of\nshort-term assets would imply that long-term interest rates fall and short-term interest rates rise. The\n\n- 3 -\nassets, which pay a higher interest rate than reserves, the central bank can stimulate the\neconomy in a manner similar to lowering the policy rate. But by this logic, when QT\nreverses QE, asset prices should fall and yields should rise in equal magnitude. Thus, any\npositive effects derived from QE would be reversed when QT occurs. This suggests that\nQE and QT may cancel each other out in welfare terms. But if there are no net benefits\nfrom the action, what is the point of doing it? To illustrate this point, suppose someone is\ngiven a weight-loss drug and they lose 80 pounds, but then the drug is taken away and\nthey regain the 80 pounds. What was the point of the exercise if there was no net welfare\ngain?\nTo me, for QE to be beneficial on net, there has to be asymmetry in the effects of\nQE relative to QT. My thinking on this has long been guided by the conclusions of a\npaper I wrote with Alex Berentsen about optimal stabilization policy, which is what QE\nand QT ultimately should be about.3 The gist of the argument is that when shocks and\nfrictions to trading arise suddenly, the central bank can take actions such as injecting\nreserves to ease trading frictions or credit constraints and improve welfare. But by\nwaiting until the frictions and shocks dissipate before undoing the injections, the positive\neffects are not reversed. As an example, when a house is on fire, pouring water on the\nfire will put it out, which has great benefits for all. But when the fire is out, draining the\nwater away does not reignite the fire—the initial benefits are not undone. The punchline\nhere is that QE is conducted under different market conditions than those that occur when\npreferred habitat theory suggests that financial market participants prefer certain asset maturities over\nothers and the price (or interest) rate needs to adjust to change their desired mix of holdings.\n3 For details of the model and results, see Aleksander Berentsen and Christopher Waller (2011), “Price-\nLevel Targeting and Stabilization Policy,” Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, vol. 43, Supplement 2\n(October), pp. 559–80.\n\n- 4 -\nQT is done, so it is not surprising that the effects will be different. The authors’ findings\nthat QE has asymmetric effects compared to QT is not a puzzle but an indication that\ncentral banks timed QE and QT in the right manner such that society was better off.\nThe Execution of Quantitative Easing versus Quantitative Tightening\nTurning to the impact of QE and QT on interest rates, analysis often focuses on\nthe term premium. There are three key elements of asset purchases that change the term\npremium: (1) the expected path of QE, which includes the amount and timing of\npurchases; (2) the length of time the central bank is expected to hold the additional\nsecurities; and (3) the expected path of QT, including the amount and timing of\nredemptions, which importantly depends on the desired ultimate size of securities\nholdings (and reserve balances) of the central bank. As soon as an asset purchase\nprogram is announced, these expectations are formed, resulting in the term premium\neffect, or TPE, on interest rates.\nOver time, the TPE will change, based on both the passage of time and any\nupdates to the public’s expectations for the components I just mentioned. Let me talk\nabout three factors that affect both the expected path of asset purchases and interest rates.\nThese factors are things to keep in mind for future policy decisions.\nFirst, there are two ways that QE can be implemented, and they have different\nimpacts on interest rates. These are what I call closed- or open-ended QE programs.\nClosed-ended QE programs involve an announcement of a fixed stock of purchases over\na fixed period of time. An example of this type of asset purchase program was initiated\nby the Fed in March 2009.4 Open-ended QE simply gives a purchase amount per month\n4 An example of a closed-ended program is from March 2009, when the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC) noted that “to help improve conditions in private credit markets, the Committee decided to\n\n- 5 -\nbut no calendar endpoint, so the expected size of the program is unspecified. A set of\neconomic conditions for reducing or ending purchases may be stipulated, but when they\nwill occur is not perfectly predictable. Here, one can think of the Fed’s most recent asset\npurchase program.\nAt the time of an asset purchase announcement, it will be easier for markets to\nfully price in a closed-ended program, since its purchase amount and end date are given,\nwhereas the open-ended program’s pricing will depend on market expectations for the\nevolution of the economy. So if one wants a particular impact on interest rates at the\nannouncement date, one might lean toward a closed-ended program or be aware that\nadditional guidance on the expected path of the open-ended program will be needed.\nAs time passes and the economy evolves, the two programs work differently.\nOne might prefer an open-ended program over time because it dynamically responds to\nthe evolution of economic conditions. The program could be halted or extended as\nconditions improve or worsen, unlike a closed-ended program. But, of course, the\ncriteria set in the open-ended program must be carefully considered. As I said in a recent\nFEDS Note and in several speeches, the 2020 criteria for when to begin QT may have\nbeen too restrictive and did not allow the Committee to taper as soon and as gradually as\npurchase up to $300 billion of longer-term Treasury securities over the next six months”; see paragraph 3\nof the March 2009 FOMC statement, which is available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm. An example of an open-ended\nprogram is from December 2020, when the FOMC stated it would keep buying $120 billion per month in\nsecurities “until substantial further progress has been made toward the Committee’s maximum employment\nand price stability goals”; see paragraph 4 of the December 2020 FOMC statement, which is available on\nthe Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.\n\n- 6 -\ndesired.5 Setting the appropriate criteria ahead of time to create the flexibility needed to\nrespond to changing economic and financial conditions is very hard to do.\nThe second factor affecting the path of asset purchases is that it is very important\nthat QE be credibly followed by QT. If QE is viewed as nothing more than a permanent\ninjection of money into the economy, it would likely create inflation. This was widely\npredicted back in 2009, but the inflation didn’t happen. Why? In my view, it didn’t\nhappen because the Fed credibly committed to withdrawing the injected reserves at a\nlater date. Pre-committing to QT is what allows the injection of reserves into the\neconomy without inflation or other longer-run distortions of market pricing. So when\nstarting asset purchases or weighing how to approach asset runoff or sales, it is important\nthat the central bank commit to normalizing its balance sheet.\nThe third factor is that it is important for a central bank to move carefully as it\ncomes to the end of QT and the desired level of ample reserves. The endpoint should be\nrelated to the expectation of the banking system’s demand for reserves. In the United\nStates, we saw stresses in money markets in the fall of 2019, when the Fed reduced the\nlevel of reserves during balance sheet normalization through July and then there was\nheavy issuance of Treasury securities in September. The level of reserves likely went a\nbit too low.6 Learning from our experiences and trying to understand how the demand\nfor reserves has changed over time suggests moving carefully toward the endpoint of QT.\n5 See Jane Ihrig and Chris Waller (2024), “The Federal Reserve’s Responses to the Post-COVID Period of\nHigh Inflation,” FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, February\n14), https://doi.org/10.17016/2380-7172.3455.\n6 For a discussion of the September 2019 experience, see Sriya Anbil, Alyssa Anderson, and Zeynep\nSenyuz (2020), “What Happened in Money Markets in September 2019?” FEDS Notes (Washington:\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, February 27), https://doi.org/10.17016/2380-\n7172.2527.\n\n- 7 -\nFor this reason, even if QE is an open-ended program, QT is more likely to\nresemble a closed-ended program. Central banks usually have an idea of how large they\nwant their balance sheet to be when QT ends; therefore, once the pace of QT is\nannounced, markets should be able to effectively price in the entire program at the\nannouncement of the plan. After that, the actual execution of QT is simply validating the\nbeliefs that market participants had at the announcement. This is why many refer to QT\nas merely draining unneeded reserves, which should be as interesting as watching paint\ndry.\nQuantitative Tightening in the United States\nLet me now turn more directly to the authors’ paper and two of their findings.\nFirst, as I mentioned earlier, they find central banks’ QT announcements have only a\nsmall effect on interest rates. To conduct this analysis, the authors do an event study\naround QT announcements, which requires them to identify “surprises” in the QT\nannouncements. As the authors acknowledge, this is not a trivial exercise. My comment\nhere is to point out why identifying a QT announcement surprise is challenging when\nconsidering examples in the United States.\nLet me walk through the evolution of the Fed’s QT communications in the spring\nof 2022 to consider how various communications affected the expected path of QT.7\nRecall that QE ended in March 2022.8 Heading into April, it was likely that markets\n7 Prior to the spring announcements, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) began discussions on\npolicy normalization as reported in the December 2021 FOMC minutes. It was noted that some\nparticipants observed that the balance sheet could potentially shrink faster than the previous experience.\nThe 10-year Treasury yield moved up several basis points around the release of the minutes.\n8 In March 2022, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) indicated that it “expects to begin reducing\nits holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities at a coming\nmeeting”; see paragraph 3 of the March 2022 FOMC statement, which is available on the Board’s website\nat https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm. This language signaled the Fed\n\n- 8 -\nexpected a redemption path somewhat like the Fed’s 2017–2019 QT plan.9 That plan\nphased in redemptions over 12 months and ultimately allowed, at most, $30 billion of\nTreasury securities and $20 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) to be\nredeemed each month. On April 5, 2022, then-Vice Chair Lael Brainard gave a speech\nthat noted the balance sheet would shrink considerably more rapidly than in the previous\ncase of QT; specifically, she said that “significantly larger caps and a much shorter period\nto phase in the maximum caps compared with 2017–2019.”10 The next day, the Federal\nOpen Market Committee (FOMC) minutes provided additional information on the\nexpected maximum monthly caps and phase-in period, saying participants generally\nagreed to a three-month phase-in and caps of $60 billion and $35 billion for Treasury\nsecurities and agency MBS, respectively.\nOver those two days in April, the markets likely updated their expected QT plans\nto have sooner and larger redemptions. This change would be associated with a less\nnegative term premium effect, meaning a rise in Treasury yields. The 10-year Treasury\nyield rose 19 basis points over the two days of the Vice Chair’s speech and the FOMC\nminutes—that is, 12 basis points on the day of her speech and another 7 basis points on\nthe day of the FOMC minutes—and a total of 37 basis points over that week.\nwould be holding the peak amount of securities on its balance sheet for just a short period of time, which\nturned out to be between March and the end of May.\n9 In January 2022, the Federal Open Market Committee provided a statement on “Principles for Reducing\nthe Size of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet,” but it did not provide information about the timing or\npace of redemptions; the statement is available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20220126c.htm.\n10 See Lael Brainard (2022), “Variation in the Inflation Experiences of Households,” speech delivered at\nthe Spring 2022 Institute Research Conference, Opportunity and Inclusive Growth Institute, Federal\nReserve Bank of Minneapolis, Minneapolis, April 5,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20220405a.htm.\n\n- 9 -\nAbout a month later, on May 4, 2022, the FOMC communicated its “Plans for\nReducing the Size of the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet.” The plan was consistent with\nthe FOMC minutes from April, and there was little change in the 10-year Treasury yield\nthat day and week (negative 4 basis points on the day of the announcement and 2 basis\npoints over the five-day period). So, when doing event studies, it may be difficult to\nestimate the full impact of QT announcements by simply looking at the formal\nannouncement of the QT plan.\nLet me turn to a second point of the paper, about which types of investors have\nincreased their securities holdings as the Fed has reduced its holdings. When a central\nbank steps away from asset purchases and begins to shrink its balance sheet, a common\nquestion is, who will step in and take the central bank’s place in buying securities? I\nalways respond by saying, “Why is this important?” If the government bond market is\nbroad and deep, there will be plenty of buyers—there is no need to worry about who will\nbuy the government debt. If the government bond market is not broad or deep, however,\nthen the central bank’s actions can have adverse and unwanted effects on prices and\nmarket functioning. This would then affect how fast the central bank can reduce its\nbalance sheet and whether it can do so passively or actively.\nOne could also argue that it matters because knowing the buyers helps one\nunderstand the transmission of QT to asset prices and interest rates. Does it matter if it is\nbanks or nonbank financial firms that are doing the buying? Does it matter if it is hedge\nfunds, pension funds, or actual households doing the buying? One needs to have a better\nunderstanding of why the question is being asked before one can fully understand the\nanswers to the question.\n\n- 10 -\nThe authors focus on the reduction in aggregate securities holdings of central\nbanks and find that households and broker-dealers are the main investors absorbing the\nredeemed securities. For my discussion today, I decided to dig a bit deeper into the\nFinancial Accounts of the United States in two ways. First, I decided to look at each type\nof security (Treasury securities and agency MBS) individually.11 For Treasury securities,\nI also find that since the 2022 start of QT, households have boosted their market share the\nmost, and broker-dealers have also increased their share. For agency MBS, not only has\nthe market shares of those two investor types increased, but so has the market shares of\nmoney market funds.\nSecond, I dug into the household category a bit more. As currently categorized,\nthe Financial Accounts household category includes hedge funds. The Federal Reserve\nBoard is working to segregate hedge funds in this data set. In the interim, the Board\npublishes separate data on the balance sheets of domestic hedge funds.12 Using this\nsupplemental data, I find that it is not the hedge funds that are responsible for the increase\nin household market share. This means the increase is driven by the other household\ninvestors: actual households and nonprofit organizations.\nWhat do I make of this finding? My interpretation is that it reinforces the view\nthat the demand for U.S. Treasury securities is broad and deep—the buyers are not a\nnarrow set of deep-pocketed, sophisticated investors but rather the American public. As\na result, the pace of runoff is not a problem. As we have seen with the current phase of\n11 My calculations look at how investor types’ market shares change over time, as is done in Seth\nCarpenter, Selva Demiralp, Jane Ihrig, and Elizabeth Klee (2015), “Analyzing Federal Reserve Asset\nPurchases: From Whom Does the Fed Buy?” Journal of Banking and Finance, vol. 52 (March), pp. 230–\n44.\n12 Data on the balance sheet of hedge funds is available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/20231207/html/b101f.htm.\n\n- 11 -\nQT, runoff up to $95 billion a month is not causing substantial strains in financial\nmarkets—something that a few years ago would have surprised a lot of people, given the\nworries about QT that were common prior to 2022.\nNormalization\nLet me conclude with a few comments on where I believe the Fed should be\nheading as it continues to normalize its balance sheet. By “normalizing” I mean reducing\nthe size of the balance sheet but retaining enough assets to manage monetary policy using\nan ample-reserves regime.\nAs the Federal Reserve continues its QT program, I support further thinking about\nhow many more securities to redeem. We have an overnight reverse repurchase\nagreement facility with take-up of more than $500 billion, and I view these funds as\nexcess liquidity that financial market participants do not want, so this tells me that we can\ncontinue to reduce our holdings for some time.\nIn addition, it is important to remember that we now have a standing repurchase\nagreement facility (SRF). The SRF serves as a backstop in money markets, since it takes\nin Treasury securities as well as agency MBS and puts reserves in the banking system.\nThis facility may allow banks to lower the level of reserves below what reserves would\nbe without the facility, and it may provide a signal for when reserves are getting close to\nample.\nChair Powell has noted that the FOMC will begin to discuss slowing our\nredemptions at our FOMC meeting this month, which will help us transition into\nwhatever definition of “ample” we deem appropriate. Changing our pace of redemptions\nwill occur when the Committee makes a decision to do so, and the timing will be\n\n- 12 -\nindependent of any changes to the policy rate target. Balance sheet plans are about\ngetting liquidity levels right and approaching “ample” at the correct speed. They do not\nimply anything about the stance of interest rate policy, which is focused on influencing\nthe macroeconomy and achieving our dual mandate.\nThinking about longer-term issues related to the Fed’s portfolio, I want to\nmention two things. First, I would like to see the Fed’s agency MBS holdings go to zero.\nAgency MBS holdings have been slow to run off the portfolio, at a recent monthly\naverage of about $15 billion, because the underlying mortgages have very low interest\nrates and prepayments are quite small. I believe it is important to see a continued\nreduction in these holdings.\nSecond, I would like to see a shift in Treasury holdings toward a larger share of\nshorter-dated Treasury securities. Prior to the Global Financial Crisis, we held\napproximately one-third of our portfolio in Treasury bills.13 Today, bills are less than 5\npercent of our Treasury holdings and less than 3 percent of our total securities holdings.\nMoving toward more Treasury bills would shift the maturity structure more toward our\npolicy rate—the overnight federal funds rate—and allow our income and expenses to rise\nand fall together as the FOMC increases and cuts the target range. This approach could\nalso assist a future asset purchase program because we could let the short-term securities\nroll off the portfolio and not increase the balance sheet.14 This is an issue the FOMC will\nneed to decide in the next couple of years.\n13 A Treasury bill is a security backed by the U.S. Treasury Department with a maturity of up to 52 weeks.\nA bill is sold at a discount, and at maturity the investor receives the par value of the security.\n14 There may be other considerations for holding a sizable share of bills in the Fed’s portfolio. For\nexample, Vissing-Jorgensen (2023) argues for considering the convenience yield impact of bills; see\nAnnette Vissing-Jorgensen (2023), “Balance Sheet Policy above the ELB,” paper presented at the ECB\nForum on Central Banking, held in Sintra, Portugal, June 26–28.\n\n- 13 -\nIn conclusion, let me be clear that this is a great paper that will serve as a major\nreference for researchers and central banks. The authors’ analysis will surely have a\nmuch longer shelf life than my discussion of it.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n10:45 a.m. EST\nNovember 19, 2021\nEconomic Outlook\nRemarks by\nChristopher J. Waller\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nAt the\nCenter for Financial Stability\nNew York, New York\nNovember 19, 2021\n\nIt is a pleasure to speak today at the Center for Financial Stability, and I look\nforward to our conversation. Let me take the next several minutes to speak about the\ncontinued improvement of the U.S. economy, recent inflation data, and their implications\nfor monetary policy.1 I will also discuss the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC)\nrecent decision to begin reducing monthly purchases of securities and how incoming data\nmay affect the pace of tapering. Finally, I will address issues concerning the size of our\nbalance sheet.\nLet me start with my views on the economy. Since I last spoke on the subject\nexactly a month ago, the basic shape of my outlook hasn’t changed: The economy\ncontinues to grow and add jobs at a strong pace, making steady progress toward the\nFederal Reserve’s goal of maximum employment. New data shows that employment\ngains were better than first reported in August and September and were back to a strong\nlevel in October. But we also have learned that supply constraints—both bottlenecks and\nlabor shortages—are having a larger and more persistent effect on the economy. Due to a\ncombining of those supply constraints with strong demand, inflation pressures are\nbecoming more widespread and may last longer into 2022 than I thought they would.\nThese factors haven’t dented my optimism that the strong recovery will continue but they\nhave raised the risks that supply constraints may limit job gains and output growth, and\nthat inflation may complicate the FOMC’s management of monetary policy in 2022.\nThese factors weighed on output growth in the third quarter, which was down\nconsiderably from the three months before but which I expect will rise again to a strong\nrate in the fourth quarter. The explanation for the downturn is the same story we have all\n1 These views are my own and do not represent any position of the Board of Governors or other Federal\nReserve policymakers.\n\n- 2 -\nbeen living through since March 2020: the ups and downs of the pandemic. The Delta\nvariant and supply chain problems threw the economy off its very strong growth track in\nthe third quarter, but I anticipate it will return to that path in the fourth quarter, as society\ncontinues to learn how to manage the disease and ever-improving treatments reduce the\nlikelihood of death and hospitalization. Assuming another damaging COVID-19 variant\ndoes not arise this winter, I expect gross domestic product (GDP) to resume its robust\ngrowth not only in the fourth quarter of 2021 but also in the first half of 2022.\nIn terms of the job market, households and businesses perceive that conditions are\nas tight as or tighter than they were pre-COVID, even though the unemployment rate is\nmore than a percentage point higher. There are certainly ample data showing labor\ndemand is very strong. Job openings remain at a record level. New businesses are\nstarting up at a much higher pace than they did from 2017 to 2019. People are quitting\njobs, either to take new ones or because they are confident that they can find new ones,\nlikewise at a record rate. The improvement I expect in managing COVID should drive\ndemand higher but also provide a boost to labor supply as those who have been on the\nsidelines return to a job market that keeps improving.\nWith respect to employment data, revisions to the August and September job\nnumbers indicated that the summer slowdown in job gains wasn’t nearly as bad as initial\nreports suggested. Job creation averaged 442,000 a month from August to October, down\nfrom the 641,000 average for the other seven months of 2021. Nevertheless, this is a\nhealthy pace for job creation and will speed the recovery of the labor market if it\ncontinues. Adjusting for early retirements, we are only 2 million jobs short of where we\nwere in February 2020. Regarding the unemployment rate, in October the rate stood at\n\n- 3 -\n4.6 percent. Compared with one year ago, that rate has fallen 2.3 percentage points. If\nthe decline continues at about that pace in coming months, the unemployment rate could\nbe below 4 percent before too long. In light of these data, in my view, the labor market is\nrapidly approaching maximum employment. But I will be watching for factors, from\ncontinued supply bottlenecks and a winter surge of COVID cases, that could slow this\nprogress.\nTurning to inflation, inflation has escalated substantially this year, along with a\nsignificant rise in inflation expectations. The October consumer price index report\nshowed an unexpected surge in inflation. The monthly print corresponds to an\nannualized rate exceeding 10 percent, while the year-over-year increase was 6.2\npercent—the highest since December 1990. Despite the highest wage gains in years,\ninflation this year has wiped out any real wage increase for the average worker. High\ninflation is painful to Americans who have little choice about the goods and services they\nbuy for everyday living. Prices are up significantly at the grocery store, which is a major\nproblem for many individuals and families. Unlike earlier this summer, price pressures\nare no longer concentrated in a few categories, they appear to have broadened.2 There\nhas been a notable increase in the prices of energy, food, goods, and services as well as\nthe cost of owning a home. Even trimmed mean measures of inflation that exclude some\nbig price increases, such as the Cleveland Fed and the Dallas Fed measures, report\ninflation rates above the Fed’s 2 percent target. Diffusion indexes of price changes,\nwhich are often useful in detecting turning points in the data, show an increasing number\n2 See Fernando M. Martin (2021), “How Widespread Are Price Increases in the U.S.?” On the Economy\nBlog, October 19, https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2021/october/how-widespread-price-\nincreases.\n\n- 4 -\nof categories with 3 or 12-month inflation exceeding 3 percent, compared with earlier this\nyear.\nI expect that these pressures are related to both supply constraints, which may be\nbeginning to improve, and strong demand, which shows no sign of abating. Wages\ncontinue to grow quickly on a more sustained basis than they have in more than 20 years,\nmost recently reflected in a striking increase in the employment cost index, which\nconsiders both pay and benefits. Wages and employment costs seem to be widespread\nacross industries and among businesses of different sizes. Crucial to the path of inflation\nwill be whether we see input cost increases consistently reflected in final goods prices.\nOur business contacts report that companies are comfortable passing along these cost\nincreases to their customers.\nIt has been argued that because price pressures connected to supply constraints are\ntransitory, they will come to an end, so monetary policy does not need to respond to\ntemporary price pressures. I find this argument puzzling for a few reasons. First, all\nshocks tend to be transitory and eventually fade away; by this logic, the Fed should never\nrespond to any shocks, but it sometimes does, as it should. Second, the macroeconomic\nmodels we use to guide policy typically have cost shocks built in that cause inflation to\nmove. In those models, appropriate monetary policy responds to these inflation\nmovements; it doesn’t ignore them, even though they are transitory. Finally, the choice\nto take a policy action depends on how large the shocks are and how long they are\nexpected to persist. To make this point clearer, consider a snowfall, which we know will\neventually melt. Snow is a transitory shock. If the snowfall is one inch and is expected\nto melt away the next day, it may be optimal to do nothing and wait for it to melt. But if\n\n- 5 -\nthe snowfall is 6 to 12 inches and expected to be on the ground for a week, you may want\nto act sooner and shovel the sidewalks and plow the streets. To me, the inflation data are\nstarting to look a lot more like a big snowfall that will stay on the ground for a while, and\nthat development is affecting my expectations of the level of monetary accommodation\nthat is needed going forward.\nInflation expectations on the part of the public also play a role in the conduct of\nmonetary policy. Two surveys of consumers—by the University of Michigan and the\nNew York Fed—show medium inflation expectations running over 4 percent, and bond\ninvestors are requiring over 3 percent compensation for future inflation and inflation\nrisks. It is very concerning to me that households and markets are no longer expecting us\nto keep inflation near our 2 percent target over the next three to five years. Now, it is true\nthat there is some evidence that these consumer survey measures of future inflation tend\nto move around a lot based on changes in current inflation. So I hope these large\nmovements in inflation expectations are—wait for it—transitory and will come back\ndown as bottlenecks and labor shortages resolve themselves over the coming months.\nBut if these measures were to continue moving upward, I would become concerned that\nexpectations would lead households to demand higher wages to compensate for expected\ninflation, which could raise inflation in the near term and keep it elevated for some time.\nThis possibility is a risk to the inflation outlook that I’m watching carefully.\nSo, what are the implications of all these considerations for monetary policy? The\neconomy made faster progress in 2021 than most of us expected back in December 2020.\nThis substantial progress toward our dual mandate goals allowed us to begin reducing the\n$120 billion a month in asset purchases that are aiding the recovery by steadily providing\n\n- 6 -\naccommodation to financial conditions. When we started tapering a few days ago, it\nhappened several months earlier than was expected by market participants in the early\nmonths of 2021. We cut both the amount of Treasury securities purchases to $70 billion\nper month from $80 billion per month, and the amount of agency mortgage-backed\nsecurities (MBS) to $35 billion from $40 billion. We will make another $10 billion and\n$5 billion cut to the monthly purchases in mid-December.\nThe next few months will be critical, however, in determining how the tapering\nprocess plays out. The Committee has been very clear, in the months leading up to our\ndecision, and in making that decision, that the pace of reducing asset purchases would\ndepend on progress toward our dual mandate goals. If COVID or some other factor\nsubstantially slows the recovery, hindering the progress toward maximum employment,\nthe FOMC could slow the taper. But if the economy makes quick progress toward\nmaximum employment or inflation data show no signs of retreating from their currently\nhigh readings, the Committee may choose to speed up the taper, which would position it\nto accelerate subsequent steps in tightening monetary policy if necessary. The timing of\nany policy action is a decision for the FOMC, but for my part the rapid improvement in\nthe labor market and the deteriorating inflation data have pushed me towards favoring a\nfaster pace of tapering and a more rapid removal of accommodation in 2022.\nAnother policy action already being discussed in public by market participants is\nthe timing of the first increase, or liftoff, of the target range for the federal funds rate.\nThe FOMC has described the conditions that must be met to consider liftoff. They are\nwhen the economy has reached maximum employment, and when inflation has risen to 2\npercent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. Assuming\n\n- 7 -\ninflation expectations are well-anchored, I judge that the timing of liftoff is any time after\nboth of these conditions have been met.\nI believe the condition for inflation has been met and we are making great strides\ntowards achieving the employment leg of our mandate. I will be looking at the incoming\ndata to determine when we have achieved both these criteria. After that point, whenever\nthe Committee ultimately decides to raise the target range for the federal funds rate from\nzero, monetary policy will still be providing an extraordinary extent of support for the\neconomy—short-term interest rates will still be very low, and the large amount of\nsecurities holdings on the Fed’s balance sheet will continue to put significant downward\npressure on longer-term interest rates.\nThis fact leads to another policy action that the FOMC needs to consider: when to\nbegin reducing securities holdings. It is important to remember that the FOMC makes\nmonetary policy decisions with the best interest of the American people in mind and not\nbased on how these actions affect the balance sheet. Between March of 2020 and today,\nthe Fed’s securities holdings have increased by $4.2 trillion to stand a bit over $8 trillion.\nThese holdings are about 35 percent of the level of annual real GDP. This percentage\nsounds quite large, but the Fed’s share is not out of line with what is found on the balance\nsheets of other advanced foreign economies’ central banks. For example, our share is\nlarger than that of the Bank of Canada, but it is about the same as the Bank of England’s,\nand much smaller than the shares of the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan.\nOne must remember that there is no economic theory that tells us what the\noptimal size of a central bank balance sheet should be. So, just because our balance sheet\nis “large” does not mean there is anything wrong with it. However, arguments can be\n\n- 8 -\nmade that we should reduce the size of our balance sheet. First, we expanded it for\nemergency reasons due to the pandemic. As the emergency passes, we can undo those\nactions and get the balance sheet down to something close to its pre-pandemic trend.\nSecond, by doing so, we free up balance sheet space in the event we need to expand it in\nthe future to deal with economic shocks. Third, the private sector appears to be\ninundated with liquidity, as evidenced by the large take-up at our overnight reverse\nrepurchase agreement facility. Draining some of this liquidity would help maintain\nsmooth market functioning.\nGoing forward, the Committee will need to decide what type of reinvestment\npolicy to have in place. Currently, when securities on the Fed’s balance sheet mature, the\nproceeds are reinvested in new securities, keeping the balance sheet growing in line with\nnet purchases. Under this policy, when net asset purchases cease, reinvestment will keep\nthe balance sheet constant at the size at that time. Based on past experience, an effective\nway to gradually reduce the balance sheet to a more efficient level is to change that\nreinvestment policy to limit, or cease, reinvestment. Allowing this “runoff” was the main\nway the FOMC shrank the balance sheet before the pandemic.\nI expect the reinvestment strategy will be heavily influenced by the Fed’s\nexperience with this policy between 2017 and 2019. During that time, the FOMC\nrecognized that the monthly maturity of securities was lumpy; some months there were\nmany securities maturing, and others few. The FOMC ensured a gradual and predictable\nroll-off of securities that allowed market participants to plan for the Fed’s gradual retreat\nfrom the Treasury and MBS markets, which was done by instituting monthly redemption\n\n- 9 -\ncaps that gradually increased over time. I would support a similar process when the time\ncomes to alter reinvestment policy.\nAs securities holdings declined, so did reserves in the banking system. In mid-\nSeptember 2019, upward pressures emerged in funding markets as reserves dropped to\nabout $1.4 trillion or 6.6 percent of GDP at that time. Most thought the Fed’s balance\nsheet could be reduced further. In fact, the median of the respondents to the June 2019\nprimary dealer survey conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York indicated\nreserves could fall to $1.2 trillion.3 But, the underlying level of reserves wanted by\nfinancial markets seemed to be more than we anticipated. In response to the emerging\npressures at that time, the Fed stopped redemptions and instituted a number of actions\nover a few days that boosted reserves to at least the level seen in early September of that\nyear.4\nWith this experience in hand, we will need to proceed with caution with future\nsecurities redemptions. That said, clearly today’s balance sheet is elevated, and we can\ndecrease our holdings. Should we drain reserves too quickly, we have a new tool to help\ncorrect this action should our pace of runoff prove to be too fast again. The standing\nrepurchase agreement facility provides a backstop in cases where demand for liquidity is\n3 In June 2019, the median of the respondents to the Survey of Primary Dealers indicated a $1.2 trillion\nlevel of reserve balances in 2025. Responses to the survey are available on the Federal Reserve Bank of\nNew York’s website at https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/markets/survey/2019/jun-2019-\nspd-results.pdf.\n4 Against a backdrop of declining reserves and high levels of Treasury securities outstanding, in mid-\nSeptember 2019, imbalances in the supply of and demand for short-term funding led to pressures in the\nrepurchase agreement (repo) market. In response to elevated rates, the Federal Reserve began conducting\nrepo operations to help stabilize money markets and provide reserves to keep the federal funds rate within\nits target range. These operations boosted reserves to levels averaging about $1.6 trillion in early 2020. For\na detailed discussion of the pressures in money markets and the Fed’s response, see Sriya Anbil, Alyssa\nAnderson, and Zeynep Senyuz (2020), “What Happened in Money Markets in September 2019?” FEDS\nNotes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, February 27),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/what-happened-in-money-markets-in-september-\n2019-20200227.htm.\n\n- 10 -\nmore than the Fed otherwise thought. Counterparties can come to the facility and obtain\nfinancing for their Treasury securities. Of course, I do not anticipate reducing reserves to\na level where this tool would be used, but it is nice to know that, as we move forward, we\nhave an additional support available to us that we did not have in 2019.\nTo close, I have outlined how I see the economy evolving and mentioned several\npolicy steps in the future that underly that outlook. The tapering of our asset purchases\nhas started and should continue over coming months. Then the Fed will turn to\nnormalizing other aspects of monetary policy as the economy continues to recover from\nthe severe COVID shock we encountered last year. I believe that policy may need to\npivot to a faster taper based on incoming data that I will be monitoring.",

Waller\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Monetary Policy at a Crossroads,” a panel discussion hosted by\nthe Dallas Society for Computational Economics\nDallas, Texas\nJune 18, 2022\n\nThank you, Meredith and Cullum and thank you to the Society for the invitation\nto speak to you today. This week, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) took\nanother significant step toward achieving our inflation objective by raising the Federal\nFunds rate target by 75 basis points. In my view, and I speak only for myself, if the data\ncomes in as I expect I will support a similar-sized move at our July meeting. The Fed is\n“all in” on re-establishing price stability, and part of that effort involves understanding\nthe forces that have boosted inflation and also examining how policymakers responded.\nToday, I intend to look back on monetary policy in 2020 and 2021, as I have before in\nrecent speeches, but go a bit further and try to discern some lessons learned.1\nIn addition to the Federal Reserve’s emergency lending programs, the monetary\npolicy actions taken during this time were deemed extraordinary. We swiftly lowered the\ntarget range for the federal funds rate to close to zero—the effective lower bound—and\nmade an open-ended commitment to purchasing securities. It was only the second time\nthat the Fed had taken such dramatic steps. But the first time for these actions was\nscarcely a decade ago, and there is good reason to think such a response may not be\nextraordinary anymore. Structural changes in the economy have tended to lower interest\nrates and limit the room that the Federal Reserve will have to cut rates during a\nslowdown.2 I hope we never have another two years like 2020 and 2021, but because of\n1See Christopher J. Waller (2022), “Reflections on Monetary Policy in 2021,” speech delivered at the 2022\nHoover Institution Monetary Conference, Stanford, California, May 6,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20220506a.htm; and Christopher J. Waller\n(2021), “A Hopeless and Imperative Endeavor: Lessons from the Pandemic for Economic Forecasters,”\nspeech delivered at the Forecasters Club of New York, New York, December 17,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20211217a.htm. These remarks represent my\nown views and not any position of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 Research has suggested a large number of developments may have contributed to a decline in the\nequilibrium real interest rate, focusing on factors that may have shifted aggregate savings and/or investment\n\n- 2 -\nthe low-interest-rate environment we now face, I believe that even in a typical recession\nthere is a decent chance that we will be considering policy decisions in the future similar\nto those we made over the past two years. Because of that likelihood, it is especially\nuseful to consider the lessons learned.\nLet’s start at the beginning, when the United States was faced with the economic\nshock from COVID-19. Over several weeks starting in early March 2020, the FOMC\nlowered the target range for the federal funds rate to the effective lower bound and began\npurchasing Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS). Meanwhile, the\nFed established numerous liquidity and credit market facilities.3 All these actions were\ntaken to support liquidity in the financial system and keep credit flowing to households,\nbusinesses and state and local governments. Asset purchases were undertaken in\nresponse to disruptions in financial markets, particularly in the normally stable U.S.\nTreasury market. Besides supporting smooth market functioning, asset purchases also\naided in the transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions.\nFinancial markets stabilized relatively quickly. Over the course of 2020, the\nFed’s liquidity and credit facilities saw reduced demand and most of the emergency\nin a manner that depresses the real interest rate required to equilibrate savings and investment. For\nexample, lower trend economic growth likely lowers aggregate investment, while demographic factors such\nas an increase in life expectancy may increase savings. Other research has emphasized an increase in\ndemand for safe assets among emerging market economies, which depresses interest rates in advanced\neconomies. For a review and references, see Michael Kiley (2020), “The Global Equilibrium Real Interest\nRate: Concepts, Estimates, and Challenges,” Annual Review of Financial Economics, vol. 12 (1), pp. 305–\n26.\n3 Supported by funds provided by the CARES Act, the Federal Reserve created, with the authorization of\nthe U.S. Treasury Department, a number of emergency lending facilities. The extraordinary ‘dash for cash’\nearly in the pandemic threatened the orderly functioning of money markets as well as the flow of credit to\nemployers. The Board responded with a set of emergency lending facilities that, collectively supported the\nflow of credit throughout the economy both by providing backstops and, in some cases, by more directly\nsupplying funding. Future downturns are unlikely to see the same global, sharp, and intense demand for\nliquidity, and thus not warrant the same kind of emergency lending. For more details on the Fed’s facilities\nto support households, businesses, and municipalities during the COVID crisis see the November 2020\nFinancial Stability Report at Financial Stability Report (federalreserve.gov)\n\n- 3 -\nprograms were decommissioned around year end. Perhaps the most straightforward\ntakeaway for monetary policy is that in times of severe stress, lending facilities, along\nwith sharp cuts to the federal funds rate and the introduction of large-scale asset\npurchases, are very effective in reviving the economy.\nThere are some other lessons, I think, from the experience of tightening monetary\npolicy, a process which was put in motion by the guidance that the FOMC issued in 2020\nabout how long it would keep the federal funds rate at the effective lower bound and\ncontinue asset purchases. In September and December of 2020, the FOMC provided\ncriteria or conditions in the meeting statement that would need to be met before the\nFOMC would consider raising interest rates and begin to reduce asset purchases,\nrespectively. These conditions were, in effect, the FOMC’s plan for starting the process\nof tightening policy. This guidance was short term, specific to the task of when to tighten\npolicy in this current cycle, and focused on specific tools.\nLet me make an important distinction here. A bit earlier, in August 2020, the\nCommittee completed a multi-year review of our overall strategy for achieving and\nsustaining our economic goals. The strategy statement is very different than the\ntightening guidance—it is about longer-run goals, not specific actions related to the\ncurrent circumstances. The goals in the strategy statement apply in all economic\ncircumstances and don’t include any details on the settings of policy tools. I mention this\ndistinction because some have argued that the FOMC’s new strategy was a factor that led\nthe Committee to wait too long to begin tightening monetary policy. A bit later, I will\nexplain why I do not believe this is the case, and I will explain how the guidance for\n\n- 4 -\ntightening policy, laid out in the FOMC’s post-meeting statements, was the basis for our\ndecisions.\nSo, let’s think about how the economy evolved and how the criteria for that\nguidance steered the path of policy. In early 2021, the Committee began noting whether\nthe economy was making progress toward our employment and inflation goals, and thus\ngetting closer to decisions on unwinding our highly accommodative policy. Based on\nour positive experience with unwinding after the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), we\nthought it would be appropriate to use the same sequence of steps: taper asset purchases\nuntil they ceased, then lift rates off the effective lower bound, then gradually and\npassively reduce our balance sheet by redeeming maturing securities. Most importantly,\nthrough various communications, we made it clear that tapering of asset purchases would\nhave to be completed before rate liftoff to avoid the conflict that would occur by easing\nvia continuing asset purchases versus tightening through rate hikes.\nIn the previous episode of tightening policy after extraordinary accommodation,\nthis process was very gradual. Tapering of asset purchases took 11 months, and then the\nfirst rate hike did not occur until more than a year after purchases ended. Balance sheet\nreduction began more than a year and half after that. This gradualism worked well then,\nand it surely influenced the Committee’s approach this time.\nImplementing this approach required two pieces of guidance: first, criteria for\nbeginning the tapering process, and, second, criteria to begin raising the policy rate from\nthe effective lower bound. Through explicit language in FOMC statements, we told the\npublic the necessary conditions that needed to be met before we would adjust these two\npolicies.\n\n- 5 -\nFor asset purchases, the Committee declared that tapering would wait “until\nsubstantial further progress has been made toward the Committee’s maximum\nemployment and price stability goals.”4 Meanwhile, the FOMC said that it would keep\nrates near zero until our employment goal had been reached and until inflation had\nreached 2 percent and was “on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.”5\nA fair question is: what did these words mean? And, in particular, what did the\nphrases “substantial further progress” for tapering and “for some time” for liftoff mean?\nIn large part the interpretation hinged on how the Committee viewed the economy would\nrecover from the pandemic. Looking across forecasts at the time by Committee\nparticipants and the private sector, no one expected substantial progress toward both our\ngoals to happen very soon. The economy had begun the recover, but at the end of 2020\nCOVID was bad and getting worse and vaccines were just arriving, so we didn’t know\nhow soon schools would reopen and people would get back to work. In November and\nDecember 2020, the unemployment rate was 6.7 percent and inflation seemed to be in\ncheck: 12-month personal consumption expenditures inflation was declining, and core\ninflation, which excludes volatile energy and food prices, was more or less steady at 1.5\npercent. The Summary of Economic Projections by FOMC participants in December\n2020 had the unemployment rate moving down to 4.2 percent at the end of 2022 and\n4 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2021), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC\nStatement,” press release, June 16,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20210616a.htm\n5 This phrase echoed a new detail in our monetary policy strategy that recognized the 12 years that inflation\nhad run persistently below 2 percent and noted that as a result, “appropriate monetary policy will likely aim\nto achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.” See Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System (2020), “2020 Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy,” policy\nstatement, August 27, https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review-of-monetary-policy-strategy-\ntools-and-communications-statement-on-longer-run-goals-monetary-policy-strategy.htm.\n\n- 6 -\ninflation moving up to 2 percent only in 2023. Only one participant had liftoff occurring\nby the end of 2022.\nBased on this SEP, the Committee did not expect the economy to recover quickly.\nAnd, looking at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of Primary Dealers\nback in January of 2021, the median respondent thought tapering would start in the first\nquarter of 2022 and liftoff wouldn’t be until the end of 2023 or later.\nTo move forward, policymakers had to evaluate “substantial further progress” and\n“for some time.” The phrases, admittedly, are not concrete in their meaning. Inflation\naveraging doesn’t define how much above 2 percent is moderate and how long some\nvalue of elevated inflation should be tolerated. In addition, for assessing progress on the\nhealth of the labor market, different policymakers will prefer different measures that may\nnot provide the exact same signal. On top of this, the data used to measure progress in\nthe labor market can revise substantially and reshape the evaluation of the strength of this\nmarket quite quickly. For example, a key input—payroll data—in the latter half of 2021\npainted a picture of a slowing labor market. But revised data over several subsequent\nmonths revealed that the slowdown never happened. Instead, job gains were quite robust.\nIn particular, initial reports of job creation between August and December were a\ncumulative 1.4 million, but by February of this year that number was revised up to nearly\n2.9 million.\nOverall, the economy evolved rapidly in 2021. I won’t get into the month-by-\nmonth details, as I have in recent speeches, but by October and November, policymakers\nthought the economy had improved enough to meet the criteria to start tapering at the\nearly November meeting. Then, later that month, data indicated inflation was\n\n- 7 -\naccelerating, so the Committee hastened the pace of tapering at the December meeting,\nmaking a plan to wind down purchases by early March. Between December and March\nof this year inflation data came in very elevated, and at that point there was no question\nthat inflation had been above 2 percent for “some time.” Given continued improvement\nin the labor market and the high inflation readings, the Committee began raising interest\nrates in March, as soon as asset purchases were completed.\nWith these actions in the rearview mirror, we can now ask: knowing what we\nknow now, should we have done anything differently? To be clear, by asking this\nquestion my intent is not to criticize the decisions of the Committee. Rather, it is to\nassess our policy strategies should we be confronted with another crisis in the future.\nOne question to ask is whether the guidance we issued was too “restrictive”; in\nother words, did it allow enough flexibility for the FOMC to begin raising the policy rate\nwhen it was appropriate to? Recall, we had decided that raising the policy rate would not\noccur until the tapering of asset purchases had finished. But to finish, tapering must\nstart—for a given pace of tapering, the longer it takes to start tapering, the longer it will\nbe before the policy rate can be raised. Of course, one can keep the liftoff date fixed and\nsimply taper at a much faster rate, including the possibility of a hard stop of asset\npurchases. But concerns about financial market functioning, including the ability of\nmarkets to absorb the purchases the Fed stops making, typically limits how fast the\ntapering can be, particularly given the amount of asset purchases we were making at the\ntime ($120 billion per month).\nGiven the tapering criteria and subsequent data, we ultimately had to pivot hard to\naccelerate the tapering pace and, in fact, completed the tapering of purchases just a few\n\n- 8 -\ndays before we lifted off. Unlike the normalization timeline after the financial crisis, we\ndid not have flexibility to raise the target range sooner. However, if we had less\nrestrictive tapering criteria and had started tapering sooner, the Committee could have\nhad more flexibility on when to begin raising rates.6 So, by requiring substantial further\nprogress toward maximum employment to even begin the process of tightening policy,\none might argue that it locked the Committee into holding the policy rate at the zero\nlower bound longer than was optimal.\nMy takeaway is that a less restrictive tapering criteria would have allowed more\nflexibility to taper “sooner and gradually,’ as opposed to the relatively “later and faster”\napproach that occurred. Experience has shown that markets need time to adjust to a turn\nfrom accommodation to tightening, and that surely was a factor for FOMC statements\nover the years in framing criteria for key policy actions during the recovery from the\nGFC and the pandemic. So, I’m supportive of issuing such criteria but we need to be\ncareful to use language that allows the Committee the flexibility it needs to respond to\nchanging economic and financial conditions.\nNow let’s turn to the liftoff criteria. It was also quite restrictive. The liftoff\ncriteria required the economy to be in a situation where our dual mandate had been\nachieved. It can be argued that this meant getting the economy back to its 2019 state with\nvery low unemployment and inflation near 2 percent. But the policy rate in 2019 was\nwell above zero and close to its neutral value. Consequently, if the state of the economy\n6 There are a couple of reasons why a less restrictive tapering criteria can create more policy space. First, a\nless restrictive tapering criteria allows policymakers to reduce the amount of purchases, perhaps more than\nonce or even potentially end purchases, all while a more restrictive criteria may not even be triggered.\nSecond, if policymakers believe that market functioning considerations constrain the dollar amount that\nFed purchases can be reduced in a given month, then a policy with less restrictive criteria that has started\ntapering may be able to end purchases before one with a more restrictive criteria.\n\n- 9 -\nis telling you to be at neutral and you are at zero, then any Taylor rule would say the\npolicy rate needs to rise much faster than was typically done in the past.\nSo, it should not have been a surprise that the policy rate would rise fast in 2022.\nRate hikes would need to be larger and more frequent, relative to the 2015-2018\ntightening pace, to get back to neutral. Looking back, should the Committee have\nsignaled a steeper rate path once the liftoff criteria had been met? Perhaps another lesson\nis that giving forward guidance about liftoff should also include forward guidance about\nthe possible path of the policy rate after liftoff.\nIn closing, I hope that our country is not faced with another crisis as severe as the\none precipitated by COVID, and that the Fed is not faced with the challenges of setting\nmonetary policy under such conditions. But if we again face those challenges, we now\nhave the additional insight that only experience can bring. I hope that this latest\nexperience will help us approach the future with a more complete understanding of the\npolicy choices and tradeoffs.",

Waller\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nC. Peter McColough Series on International Economics\nCouncil on Foreign Relations\nNew York, New York\nJanuary 20, 2023\n\nThank you, Ben, and thank you to the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) for\ninviting me to be part of this discussion. It has been close to a year since the Federal\nOpen Market Committee (FOMC) began tightening monetary policy. We began raising\ninterest rates in March 2022 and shrinking our securities holdings in June in order to\nbring inflation down to our 2 percent target.1 Today I thought I would spend a few\nminutes taking stock of the year behind us and talking about what’s next.\nA year ago, inflation was elevated and rapidly accelerating, and the Fed moved to\nquickly and dramatically tighten monetary policy. At the end of December, the federal\nfunds rate target was set in a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, the highest in 15 years.\nEconomic activity, meanwhile, has been holding up well. After shrinking slightly in the\nfirst half of 2022, real gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 3.2 percent in the\nthird quarter, and monthly data suggest it grew around 2 percent in the fourth quarter. I\nexpect such slowing to continue in this quarter, which is both expected and desirable in\nour ongoing fight to lower inflation.\nThe FOMC’s goal in raising interest rates is to dampen demand and economic\nactivity to support further reductions in inflation. And there is ample evidence that this is\nexactly what is going on in the business sector. On the manufacturing side, industrial\nproduction declined for the second month in December. And the Institute for Supply\nManagement’s (ISM) forward-looking indicators of orders and customers’ inventory\nsuggested that further weakening is in train. Meanwhile, the ISM survey for\nnonmanufacturing businesses, which had reported expansion since April of last year,\n1 The FOMC communicated its intentions for some time before March, and this guidance effectively began\nmonetary policy tightening before raising rates and beginning the tapering of asset purchases that month.\nThe views expressed here are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of my colleagues on the FOMC.\n\n-2 -\nindicated a slight contraction in December. This slowdown in services activity was\nwidespread, affecting 11 of 17 sectors in the survey, with significant slowdowns in\nconstruction and real estate, two industries heavily affected by higher interest rates. This\nslowing in business activity is consistent with the FOMC’s goal of damping demand and\nreducing production so that it is in better alignment with the productive capacity of the\neconomy. The goal is not, I would emphasize, to halt economic activity, and so we will\nbe watching these sectors closely to see how this moderation continues.\nGrowth in consumer spending has also begun to slow. While that growth was\nsurprisingly strong through most of the second half of 2022, nominal personal\nconsumption expenditures growth slowed to 0.1 percent in November, and retail sales fell\n1 percent. We don’t have spending data on goods and services for December, but retail\nsales fell another 1.1 percent. While the latest readings of consumer sentiment from the\nUniversity of Michigan moved up some from historic lows, I continue to expect that last\nyear’s decline in real incomes, along with higher borrowing costs, will moderate\nconsumer spending this year and help return inflation more promptly to the FOMC’s 2\npercent target. Job one is maintaining the progress we are making in lowering inflation,\nand moderation in consumer spending will support that progress.\nThe slowing in output growth has occurred alongside the continuing strength of\nthe labor market. Total nonfarm employment grew 223,000 in December, close to the\naverage of 237,000 a month for the fourth quarter. That is down quite a bit from the\nmonthly increase of 539,000 in the first quarter of 2022 but still a solid growth rate, far\nabove the number of new jobs needed to keep pace with population growth. Employment\n\n- 3 -\ngrew robustly in the leisure and health-care sectors, where labor shortages are reportedly\nsevere.\nWhile the labor market is strong, it is also tight. The unemployment rate was 3.5\npercent in December, matching the low reached before the pandemic, and the lowest in\n53 years. But there are signs that demand for labor is moderating. Job openings reported\nin the November Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey and job postings from\nDecember’s Indeed data are down from their recent peaks. Temporary-help employment,\nwhich has sometimes been a leading indicator for overall employment, has declined in\nrecent months, but that decrease may be due at least in part to employers opting to hire\nfull-time workers in place of temps to help keep jobs filled.\nA robust labor market, despite modest economic growth, is a plus for workers and\nallows the Fed to focus on lowering inflation. It shows that jobs and income can hold up\nto the effects of higher interest rates, helping the FOMC continue its efforts to lower\ninflation to our 2 percent goal by further tightening monetary policy.\nA potential downside of a tight labor market is if labor costs, which heavily\ninfluence inflation, grow so fast that they slow progress toward the FOMC’s 2 percent\nobjective. Wages and other measures of compensation accelerated as inflation surged in\nthe second half of 2021 and wage growth remained high in 2022. But as overall inflation\nhas begun to moderate in recent months, so have some measures of growth in wages and\nother compensation. For example, the 12-month increase in average hourly earnings hit a\nrecent peak of 5.6 percent in March (which is when the Fed began raising interest rates)\nand has been falling gradually and fairly steadily since then, reaching an annual rate of\n4.6 percent in December. The 3-month annualized change in average hourly earnings—\n\n- 4 -\n4.1 percent in December—is running below the 12-month rate and is thus a signal of\nongoing moderation. These are encouraging signs, but we need to see continued\nimprovement across various measures of labor costs, because additional moderation is\nneeded to bring inflation down to our 2 percent goal and because a significant escalation\nin wage growth could drive up longer-range inflation expectations. Those longer-range\nexpectations have been fairly stable through this period of very high inflation, and we\nwant it to stay that way because escalating expectations could drive inflation higher.\nLet me turn now to the outlook for inflation. Last week’s report on the Consumer\nPrice Index (CPI) showed that inflation continued to moderate in December, which was\nvery welcome news. First, I am going to spell out why this was such good news, and\nthen I am going to turn around and explain why I am still cautious about the inflation\noutlook and supportive of continued monetary policy tightening.\nOverall headline inflation fell a tenth of a percent month over month in\nDecember, the first monthly drop since May 2020. The 12-month change in inflation\npeaked at 9 percent in June, and has fallen every month since, to 6.5 percent in\nDecember.\nA big factor in the monthly decline in headline inflation in December was a\nsignificant drop in energy prices, which more than offset an increase in food prices. The\nFOMC targets headline inflation because food and energy are considerable expenses for\nmost people, but they are more volatile than other components of the index, and by\nfactoring them out, “core” inflation can provide a picture of where inflation is headed.\nHere also, we are seeing some progress. Yearly core inflation was down in December to\n5.7 percent, from 6 percent in November and a peak of 6.6 percent in September. Over\n\n- 5 -\nthe past three months, core CPI inflation has run at an annualized rate of 3.1 percent, a\nnoticeable drop from earlier in 2022.\nAnother encouraging sign is that higher inflation was less concentrated—the share\nof categories of different goods and services with inflation over 3 percent has declined in\nthe past several months, from almost three fourths in early 2022 to less than one half in\nDecember. That’s good news because it indicates that broader inflationary pressure\nacross the economy is easing.\nNow, here’s why I am cautious about these latest results and why I am not ready\nyet to substantially alter my outlook for inflation. Month-over-month core CPI inflation\nactually ticked up in December from November and is pretty much where it was in\nOctober and where it was in March when we began raising interest rates. Although\ninflation measured over 12 months has been falling, December’s reading is still close to\nwhere it was a year ago. Core inflation was 6 percent year over year (YOY) in January\n2022 and was 5.7 percent YOY last month. Thus, it basically moved sideways all year.\nSo, while it is possible to take a month or three months of data and paint a rosy picture, I\ncaution against doing so. The shorter the trend, the larger the grain of salt when\nswallowing a story about the future. Back in 2021, we saw three consecutive months of\nrelatively low readings of core inflation before it jumped back up. We do not want to be\nhead-faked. I will be looking for the recent improvement in headline and core inflation to\ncontinue.\nWages, as I indicated earlier, are another stream of data that I will be watching for\nevidence of continued progress to help ease overall inflation. Though recent hourly\nearnings data are a positive development, I need to see more evidence of wage\n\n- 6 -\nmoderation to sustainable levels. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s Wage Growth\nTracker has been running higher lately and has moderated less. The employment cost\nindex for December won’t be out until the end of this month. Over time, we need to see\nwages grow more in line with productivity growth plus 2 percentage points, consistent\nwith the FOMC’s inflation target.\nThose are reasons that I am cautious about the recent good news, but it is good\nnews. We have made progress. Six months ago, when inflation was escalating and\neconomic output had flattened, I argued that a soft landing was still possible—that it was\nquite plausible to make progress on inflation without seriously damaging the labor\nmarket. So far, we have managed to do so, and I remain optimistic that this progress can\ncontinue.\nI believe that monetary policy should continue to tighten, but using a comparison\nI employed in a speech a couple months ago, the view from the cockpit is very different\nat 30,000 feet than it is close to the ground. When the FOMC began raising the federal\nfunds rate last spring from near zero, it made sense to move quickly. But after front-\nloading monetary policy tightening, with many unprecedented 75 basis point hikes in the\nfederal funds rate target, by early December I believed the policy stance was slightly\nrestrictive, and I supported a decision by the Committee to hike by a still considerable 50\nbasis points.2 To return to the airplane image, after climbing steeply and using monetary\npolicy to significantly raise interest rates throughout the economy, it was apparent to me\nthat it was time to slow, but not halt, the rate of ascent.\n2 Each 75 basis point hike was the largest rate single increase since the FOMC began announcing its rate\ndecisions in 1994. The Committee raised rates at individual meetings by larger amounts in the early 1980s,\nwhen it raised the federal funds rate to near 20 percent.\n\n- 7 -\nAnd in keeping with this logic and based on the data in hand at this moment, there\nappears to be little turbulence ahead, so I currently favor a 25-basis point increase at the\nFOMC’s next meeting at the end of this month. Beyond that, we still have a considerable\nway to go toward our 2 percent inflation goal, and I expect to support continued\ntightening of monetary policy.\nI think that is probably enough from me, so that there will be more time for you to\nask questions. Thank you again to the CFR for the opportunity to be here today.",

Waller\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nEconomics of Payments XII Conference\nWashington D.C.\nOctober 26, 2023\n\nIt is a pleasure to welcome you all to this annual conference hosted by the Board\nfor the first time in more than a decade. The payments system is changing, and the\nagenda for the next two days indicates that this year’s conference will tackle a number of\ntopics that are central to this evolution.\nThe Fed plays multiple important roles in the payments system. We provide key\nservices directly to a broad set of commercial banks, credit unions, and to the U.S.\nTreasury. We maintain accounts for these entities, transfer funds electronically, collect\nchecks, and distribute currency. We also supervise certain financial market\ninfrastructure. Through these functions, we help to ensure that the U.S. payments system\nmeets the needs of consumers and businesses.\nFrom its founding, the Federal Reserve played a central role in the payments\nsystem. Market disruptions that contributed to financial panics in the late 19th and early\n20th centuries were an important impetus for the establishment and design of the Federal\nReserve. During the Panic of 1907, some banks refused to clear checks from other banks,\ncreating a crisis in depositor confidence and leading to bank failures. Paul Warburg, an\ninfluential figure in banking at the time, argued that the central bank should have a duty\nto “establish and maintain a perfect system of credit, enabling the general banks to\ntransform cash credits into actual cash with such absolute ease and certainty that the use\nof cash credit, instead of actual cash, will not cease, no matter what may happen.”1\nIn 1913, Congress did just that by creating the Federal Reserve and assigning it\nthe authority to establish a nationwide check-clearing system. Shortly thereafter, the Fed\nestablished a wire transfer service known as Fedwire, and later built on that with the\n1 Paul M. Warburg,. “A United Reserve Bank of the United States,” Proceedings of the Academy of\nPolitical Science in the City of New York vol. 1, no. 2 (January 1911): 302-342.\n\n- 2 -\nautomated clearinghouse (ACH) service in the 1970s. With the launch of FedNow this\npast summer, we now have an instant payments service. Our job in providing these\nservices and carrying out our responsibilities is to make sure the payments system\nfunctions efficiently and resiliently, promoting the kind of confidence that Warburg\nunderstood was vital.\nIt is great to see that those of you participating in this conference are taking on the\nkey issues of the day and pushing out the frontier of knowledge with your research. Just\nyesterday, we had a Board meeting to carry out our statutory responsibilities with respect\nto setting the debit interchange fee cap. And, of course, we have an interest in the\ndevelopments around other topics on your agenda, such as stablecoins and crypto. But\nwith just a couple minutes left before the formal proceedings start, I want to draw a\nconnection between two topics on your agenda and two questions that I have.\nFirst, how quickly will consumers and businesses demand instant payments? As I\nmentioned, we recently launched FedNow, our newest payments service. In some ways,\nwhat FedNow is doing is not new because it simply executes the operations that happen\nbetween when a bank sends an authorized consumer transaction and when that\ntransaction is cleared and settled on the other end. Some of those things happen now\nwith ACH, but with ACH it takes longer. FedNow speeds that process up from, often, a\ncouple days to a couple seconds from initiation to final receipt by consumers and\nbusinesses. The launch of FedNow was just one of many steps toward a system where\nsubstantially all payments are settled instantly. Banks also have a role in moving us\ncloser to that reality. They will have to adapt their systems to be able to connect to\n\n- 3 -\nFedNow, and how soon they do that will depend in part on how much their customers\ndemand instant payments.\nMoving on to my second question, I see that you have a session on central bank\ndigital currency. About two years ago I posed the question: What is the fundamental\nmarket failure a central bank digital currency will solve? 2 I have yet to hear a\nconvincing answer. As I mentioned earlier, the Fed’s job is to make sure the payments\nsystem functions efficiently. For over 100 years that has meant that the commercial\nbanks and credit unions engage directly with the consumers, while we sit in the back and\nmake sure things clear and settle efficiently. What then are the reasons that support why\nwe should change our role to sitting out front and engaging directly with the consumers?\nI haven’t heard a good answer to that, but I am happy to see that it is a topic being\ndiscussed in your conference.\nWith that, I’ll step away so that we can get on with the main event. Thank you all\nfor being here today, and I hope you have a great and thought-provoking conference.\n2 Christopher J.

    "text": "For release on delivery\n1:15 a.m. EDT (10:45 a.m. local time)\nAugust 28, 2024\nInterlinking Fast Payment Systems\nRemarks by\nChristopher J. Waller\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nGlobal Fintech Fest\nMumbai, India\nAugust 28, 2024\n\nThank you to the conference organizers for the opportunity to speak this year at\nthe Global Fintech Fest—a place where there is so much payments innovation.1 The\ntechnology-driven payments revolution in India has been enabled by a public-private\npartnership to build the “technology stack” of digital platforms that has broadened\nfinancial inclusion and done so at low costs.2 Building on the foundation established by\nthe public sector, innovators in the private sector seized the opportunity to enhance\npayments through the introduction of new capabilities that alleviate frictions while\nremaining within regulatory guardrails. In today’s remarks, I am going to touch on how\ninterplay between the public and private sectors may be the key to advancing cross-\nborder payments.\nNow that fast payment systems have been established around much of the globe—\nin over 70 countries and climbing—attention is turning to how these newer systems could\npotentially enhance global payments. Specifically, interlinking fast payment systems has\nbeen identified as a possible means to deliver enhanced cross-border payments for\nconsumers and businesses. Interlinking arrangements would allow banks in different\ncountries who are users of domestic fast payment systems to send payments to each other\nthrough technical connections between their respective domestic systems. As you all\nknow, interlinking is one of the areas outlined in the G20 roadmap for further exploration\nas part of a holistic effort to enhance cross-border payments. The overarching G20 goal\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board.\n2 The technology stack is a unified set of digital platforms that includes digital identity, payment rails, and\ndata sharing policy. See Derryl D’Silva, Zuzana Filková, Frank Packer, and Siddharth Tiwari, “The design\nof digital financial infrastructure: lessons from India,” BIS Papers No 106 (Basel: Bank for International\nSettlements, December 2019), https://www.bis.org/publ/bppdf/bispap106.pdf.\n\n- 2 -\nis to mitigate challenges with cross-border payments in a coordinated way at a global\nlevel, with input from key stakeholders including the private sector.\nThe G20 roadmap addresses a new topic that payments industry stakeholders have\nbeen circling around for years—more cost-effective and timely cross-border payments for\nconsumers and businesses. This policy goal has been advanced by the Federal Reserve\nover time in various payment system improvement initiatives, dating back to the late\n1990s when the Federal Reserve began adapting the automated clearinghouse (ACH)\nservice to support international payments, and more recently in 2015 when we\ncollaborated with industry to improve the payment system.3 Today’s consumers and\nbusinesses can generally send a payment anywhere in the world, but they all seem to\nwant faster and cheaper global payments, just like we always want faster flights and\ncheaper airfares. However, I am not entirely convinced that interlinking arrangements\nwill necessarily deliver on those goals. Let me explain with some context.\nFaster and cheaper cross-border payments\nNot all frictions that slow payments down are bad. Certain frictions are\npurposely built into the global payment system for compliance and risk-management\nreasons. Slowing down the speed at which payments are cleared and settled helps banks\nprevent money laundering and counter the financing of terrorism, detect fraud, and\nrecover fraudulent or misdirected cross-border payments. Granted, the practice today of\nsending payments through an often complex chain of correspondent banks contributes to\n3 See “Strategies for Improving the U.S. Payment System,” Federal Reserve System, last modified\nJanuary 26, 2015, https://fedpaymentsimprovement.org/wp-content/uploads/strategies-improving-us-\npayment-system.pdf and “Strategies for Improving the U.S. Payment System: Federal Reserve Next Steps\nin the Payments Improvement Journey,” Federal Reserve System, last modified September 6, 2017,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/other20170906a1.pdf.\n\n- 3 -\nslower payments that could benefit from efficiency enhancements. However, there is no\nsilver bullet that increases speed and efficiency without tradeoffs. Unless new solutions\nare found, interlinking fast payment systems might increase the risk-management burden\nfor banks that participate in them. That is, legal, compliance, and operational\nconsiderations are critical to the discussion of the promise and challenges of interlinking.\nGovernance, oversight, and settlement arrangements also need to be thought through,\nalong with considerations for data privacy.\nIn addition, can we assume that all parties to a cross-border transaction want\nfaster payments? The fundamental friction in any transaction is that the seller of an\nobject—a can of soup, an hour of labor, or a good manufactured for export—wants to\nreceive their money as fast as possible. However, the buyer of the object, or the buyer’s\nintermediary, typically has an incentive to wait as long as they can to pay for something\nthey have purchased. Under this logic, senders need to be properly incentivized to speed\nup cross-border payments. The one exception may be person-to-person remittances,\nwhere workers from other countries want to send money home, and recipients want\naccess, as fast as possible. But remittances are only a small percentage of the value of\ncross-border payments, so we’d need to weigh the benefits against the costs of a potential\npublic-sector intervention to shift incentives. So, I am still left with the larger question of\nwhether we should be incentivizing faster cross-border payments.\nSuppose we do want to incentivize senders by lowering costs of faster\npayments—whose responsibility is it to do that? Should it be left to private-sector\ncompetition to drive down costs as is typically the case with other products? Or is there\nsomething unique about payments that requires central banks or payment system\n\n- 4 -\noperators to step in to interlink their networks with the goal of bringing costs down? We\nhave already seen examples of the private sector leveraging technology to innovate in the\nmarket for cross-border instant payments, both at the wholesale and retail level. For\nexample, we have seen a real-time payment system built for wholesale clients that allows\nclearing and settlement between global clients in seconds, with necessary compliance\nperformed upfront in less than 24 hours. Another example is the SWIFT Global\nPayments Innovation, which offers improved speed and transparency for the business\ncustomers of participating banks, and, by their account, has been adopted by 150 banks\nglobally. In mentioning these examples, I am not intending to endorse certain private-\nsector services. Rather, these newer services are illustrative of how market forces and\ncompetition can meet consumer and business demands for more efficient cross-border\npayments.\nIn the United States we have experience with offering low-cost international ACH\npayments. We provided direct ACH linkages from the United States to Europe and\nCanada, but after more than 20 years, the banks were not using it, and we stopped the\nservice. It is possible that a fast payment interlinking arrangement adopted by Federal\nReserve would be more effective for our bank customers than the former ACH service,\nbut we would proceed cautiously to carefully consider the costs and benefits. Economic\nviability needs to be a cornerstone for any action we may take. We need to ask ourselves\nwhether banks would find a central bank interlinking service more effective than their\nexisting arrangements for cross-border payments, and if they would actually use it.\n\n- 5 -\nPractical aspects of interlinking fast payment systems\nWe know from basic economic theory that payment systems are similar to other\nnetworks in that greater participation is necessary for the network to grow and increase\nvalue to its users. This is true on a global scale, too, which in practical terms means that\nvaluable global interlinked networks would have to be founded on underlying domestic\nnetworks with a breadth of senders and receivers. Domestic networks need to be\ndeveloped first. If this condition is not in place, interlinked networks could end up being\na road to nowhere.\nBuilding out domestic networks has been done in different ways. In some\ncountries the central bank has authority to mandate participation, notably in Brazil with\nthe successful Pix system. In other countries, notably India, united efforts by the\ngovernment, central bank, and private sector established the digital public infrastructure\nthat enabled broad adoption.\nIn the United States, it’s a different story, and the payments landscape is unique.\nWith over 9,000 depository institutions and different authorities than other countries, the\nFederal Reserve determined that it needed to build a fast payment system accessible to all\ndepository institutions to achieve our policy goals. At the time of our decision, there was\nonly one private-sector instant payment system in the market, built by the largest banks.\nBased on our experience, we did not believe that this system would ultimately reach all\ndepository institutions, nor would other private-sector systems emerge to compete with it\nand extend the scope of that service. Yet we knew from industry engagement that\nsmaller banks across the country wanted a broadly accessible fast payment system, so we\n\n- 6 -\nstepped in to address the clear coordination problem. This action is very much consistent\nwith the Federal Reserve’s role in the U.S. payment system historically.\nWe have seen widespread adoption of the FedNow Service in just a little over a\nyear since implementation, with close to 1,000 depository institutions on the network\nincluding many of the largest banks that will drive origination volume. Yet we are still at\nthe beginning of a multiyear journey of establishing a ubiquitous network covering the\nmajority of institutions in our country. Variation around the world in domestic fast\npayment network adoption means that the value of globally interlinked systems is not yet\nclear.\nFrom a technical perspective, the promise of interlinking, which is essentially\ninteroperability between or among domestic fast payment systems, is that fast payment\nnetworks can just “connect”’ with each other and move payments globally. It sounds\nsimple. In practice, however, achieving interoperability is not simple. Technology is\nprobably the easiest part. The legal, compliance, settlement, and governance challenges I\nmentioned earlier are more substantial. In addition, even when technological connections\nare in place, payments may not actually be instant as they traverse across systems\nbecause of domestic variations in ISO 20022 implementation, which is the global\nstandard used by most fast payment systems. To send an ISO message seamlessly from\none country to another across a technical link, operators need to coordinate and align on\ncommon practices.\nWe should consider that new multilateral arrangements for interlinking could\npotentially address some of the challenges that I have outlined. Today, certain countries\nhave established bilateral links between domestic fast payment systems primarily to\n\n- 7 -\nsupport remittance payments. These arrangements demonstrate that linkages are\ntechnically possible and that legal and compliance issues can be addressed. Yet each link\nis unique and requires resource-intensive negotiation and alignment between parties.\nEstablishing bilateral links across the globe simply will not scale. We know this to be\ntrue from our own bilateral ACH linkages, where each arrangement required bespoke\nagreements with correspondent banks and service providers. Multilateral arrangements\nmight bring some efficiencies, yet they are no small undertaking.\nConclusion\nTo sum up, overall, I do see the value of a coordination role for the public sector\nto improve cross-border payments, an effort in which the Federal Reserve has been and\nwill continue to be heavily engaged. We will continue our engagement with international\nfora to improve the speed and efficiency of cross-border payments and to investigate the\nissues critical to interlinking payment systems. Our chief focus in the near-to mid-term,\nhowever, is continuing to build the FedNow network domestically and increasing\nparticipation in the service. We are also improving existing cross-border rails by\nconsidering expanded operating hours on our large-value, real-time gross settlement\nsystem, the Fedwire Funds Service, and by adopting ISO 20022, a globally accepted\nmessaging standard. Looking out over the longer term, we will continue to conduct\nresearch and experimentation on emerging technologies to better understand the role\nthese innovations could play in the payments landscape of the future. I expect the\ntechnical capabilities, legal infrastructure, and use cases for faster cross-border payments\nwill evolve, and I look forward to following the private-sector innovation that will\nemerge from stakeholders represented at this event.",

Waller\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nEconomic Club of Miami\nMiami, Florida\nAugust 28, 2025\n\nThank you, Jon, and thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today.1\nSince I last spoke on the economy and monetary policy on July 17, economic data\nhave reinforced my view of the outlook and my judgment that the time has come to ease\nmonetary policy and move it to a more neutral stance.2\nIn July, I argued that, looking through tariff effects, with underlying inflation near\ntarget and the upside risks to inflation limited, the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC) should not wait until the labor market deteriorates before we cut the policy rate.\nBased on all the data in hand, I believe this argument is even stronger today, and that the\ndownside risks to the labor market have increased.\nIn July, I warned that job creation was weaker than it seemed in the payroll\nnumbers and that data due in early September would indicate that payroll growth will be\nsignificantly lowered when annual revisions are made next spring. But even before then,\njob creation came in soft in the employment report for July, and May and June were\nrevised down sharply, for a three-month average pace for total nonfarm payroll growth of\nonly 35,000. After accounting for these revisions and what we will learn in a couple of\nweeks, the data are likely to indicate that employment actually shrank over those three\nmonths. I will have more to say about labor market data revisions and how they should\nbe treated in evaluating the monthly jobs report, one of the most valuable tools we have\nfor judging economic conditions.\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 See Christopher J. Waller (2025), “The Case for Cutting Now,” speech delivered at the Money\nMarketeers of New York University, New York, July 17,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250717a.htm.\n\n- 2 -\nI favored reducing the federal funds rate by 25 basis points at the FOMC’s July\nmeeting, and subsequent data on the labor market and inflation indicate this was the right\ncall. That also seems to be the message from financial markets, which now expect a 25-\nbasis-point cut at the FOMC’s September meeting and put significant odds on an\nadditional one or two cuts at the final two meetings of 2025. As I will discuss, factoring\nout estimates of the temporary effects of import tariffs, underlying inflation remains close\nto 2 percent. I believe the data on economic activity, the labor market, and inflation\nsupport moving policy toward a neutral setting. Based on the median of FOMC\nparticipants’ estimates of the longer-run value of the federal funds rate, neutral is 125 to\n150 basis points lower than the current setting. While I believe we should have cut in\nJuly, I am still hopeful that easing monetary policy at our next meeting can keep the labor\nmarket from deteriorating while returning inflation to the FOMC’s goal of 2 percent. So,\nlet’s get on with it.\nEconomic activity has slowed significantly in 2025 from 2024. Growth for the\nfirst half of the year was 1.4 percent. Looking ahead, the limited evidence we have is\nconsistent with continued sluggish growth. We don’t have much data for the second half,\nbut smoothing through the monthly volatility, retail sales for July suggest that consumers\nare continuing to spend, albeit at a slower pace than last year. Meanwhile, manufacturing\noutput in the report on industrial production was flat in July, and according to purchasing\nmanagers, new orders for manufacturing are consistent with a modest decline in the next\nfew months. For the large majority of businesses outside of manufacturing, new orders\nare consistent with roughly flat production in the coming months.\n\n- 3 -\nMany forecasters have said they expect household and business spending and\ninvestment decisions will be weighed down by tariffs—those enacted, and the uncertainty\nabout tariff levels in the future. Tariffs affect the costs and profits of businesses and, to\nthe degree that they raise prices, also affect the real disposable income of consumers.\nSome businesses will be directly affected by tariffs, but many more will be affected by\nhow tariffs crimp household spending. Tariff effects on households and businesses also\nwill weigh on employment. All of this is consistent with what my business contacts are\ntelling me, which is that they are postponing investment and hiring because of the\nuncertainty about how tariffs will affect their input costs and demand for their products.\nThat said, I’m starting to hear some rumblings that businesses cannot sit on the sidelines\nforever. So we could see, at least, investment projects that were postponed begin to pick\nup, which would be positive for the economy. But how employment decisions evolve is\nmore up in the air. I will be monitoring these business decisions because they are key to\nhow activity will unfold in the second half of the year.\nReturning to the labor market, risks are continuing to build. In my July 17\nspeech, I said that private-sector job creation was nearing stall speed, and the data\nreceived since then have put an exclamation point on this statement. I always say that\none month is not a trend, but now we have three months of weak job-creation data from\nthe Current Employment Statistics. After revisions included in the July report, private-\nsector job creation averaged 52,000 in May, June, and July, about half the rate in the first\nquarter of 2025. The headline numbers, including public-sector workers, are, as I noted\nearlier, even worse, but I tend to focus on the private sector as a better indication of the\nunderlying momentum in the labor market.\n\n- 4 -\nThat’s the picture after the unusually large revisions to May and June payrolls and\nthe soft reading for July that was included in the latest jobs report. In addition to those\nrevisions, on September 9 we will get a preliminary estimate of what to expect in the\nannual “benchmark” revisions to 2025 early next year. I estimate that monthly job\ncreation will be reduced by an average of about 60,000 a month.3 That would mean that\nprivate-sector employment actually shrank, on average, in the past three months and that\njob creation earlier in the year was weaker than currently reported.4\nI have heard the argument that declining labor supply due to lower immigration\nmeans that low jobs numbers aren’t as bad as they look and that the “breakeven” number\nfor keeping the unemployment rate steady is declining. To those people, I would say:\nYes, these estimates have been falling, but I haven’t heard anyone say the breakeven\nlevel is negative. Supply-side changes can’t account for the ugly jobs numbers of the\npast three months.\nOther data support the idea that labor demand may be on the edge of a sharp\ndecline. For example, wage growth for people switching to new jobs is lower than for\npeople staying in the same job, the opposite of what we see in a strong labor market. A\nfew years ago, the rate of people quitting their jobs surged, and job switchers were\ngetting substantially larger raises than those staying in their jobs. Today the quits rate is\n3 My estimate of the anticipated revision is based on the difference between the currently published level of\npayroll employment and the count of employment from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages\n(QCEW), which is used to benchmark the payroll employment figures. The QCEW data, which are\ncurrently available through 2024:Q4, suggest that the monthly change in payroll employment has been\noverstated by roughly 60,000 per month since March 2024.\n4 I also look at timely data that Federal Reserve staff maintains in collaboration with the employment\nservices firm ADP to construct a measure of weekly payroll employment, which covers about 20 percent of\nthe nation’s private workforce. This measure is comparable to the one ADP publishes. The current May–\nJuly contour for the staff measure of ADP-based private employment is broadly consistent with that of the\nCurrent Employment Statistics numbers. And in the weeks after the July jobs report’s reference period,\npreliminary estimates from ADP show continued deterioration.\n\n- 5 -\nback down to its mid-2010s level, and these individuals must be switching jobs for\nreasons other than gains in compensation.\nAnother sign of a weakening in the labor market is that the unemployment rates\nfor some cyclically sensitive groups of workers, such as teenagers, are up sharply this\nyear, to levels, again, similar to those in the softer job market of the mid-2010s.\nSupplementing this hard evidence of falling labor demand is the consistent story from my\nbusiness contacts that they are not hiring. The mix of reasons is not only uncertainty over\ntariff policy and slowing demand for their goods and services, but also, increasingly,\nuncertainty over how to use artificial intelligence, which is especially freezing hiring for\nsome entry-level jobs.5\nThis softening in labor demand is occurring at the same time, as I noted earlier,\nthat there is a decline in labor supply. I often hear the argument that the unemployment\nrate is the key labor market indicator because it reflects what is happening in both\ndemand and supply. And given that the current unemployment rate is 4.2 percent, close\nto most estimates of maximum employment and barely changed over the last year, this\nsuggests that the labor market is solid. While I would normally agree with this statement,\nI do not think it is accurate now. I believe that any decline in labor supply is only\nmasking weakening demand in the labor market. Whether or not supply is down,\nweakening demand is not good, and it is specifically what monetary policy is intended to\naddress.\n5 If artificial intelligence (AI) is affecting employment decisions, an important question for policymakers is\nwhether such effects are temporary or permanent. Like many other innovations, AI will most likely shift\ndisplaced workers into new roles.\n\n- 6 -\nBefore I move on from the labor market, let me address a question of some public\ndebate recently, which is the quality of the payroll data. As should be obvious from these\nremarks and others I have delivered, I consider the monthly jobs report, including its\nestimate of payroll employment, an absolutely indispensable tool in evaluating the\neconomy and setting monetary policy, and that view is close to unanimous among\neconomic forecasters and policymakers. Considering how important this data is in\ngetting an accurate and reliable read on the state of the labor market, it is entirely\nappropriate to examine the quality of the jobs numbers and the process by which they are\ncollected. There is always room for improvement in data collection and analysis. In fact,\nthe Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and other agencies that collect economic data have\nbenefited from expert committees of outside advisers who have provided advice on ways\nto improve data quality.\nThere has been substantial commentary since the last jobs report regarding the\ndeclining response rate of establishments and individuals in the employment survey and\nthe outsized revisions of the data. This commentary has raised questions about the\nquality of the employment survey data. So I want to address this issue and clarify some\nfacts about the survey response and the revisions. When the BLS sends out the\nestablishment survey for a given month, it gives firms three months to return the\nsurvey—they can return it in the first month, the second month, or the third month. Some\nfirms do not respond at all. Firms that submit their responses in the first month are the\nbasis for the initial, or preliminary, payroll estimate. Those firms that respond in the\nsecond month get added to the first-month responders to get an updated number, which\nyields the first revision that is published a month later. Then the firms that respond in the\n\n- 7 -\nfinal month provide the BLS with the final numbers for the original month. This is the\nsecond revision and is the official payroll estimate for that month.\nA decade ago, the response rate for the first month was 75 percent, meaning three-\nfourths of the firms surveyed responded immediately. But the initial response rate has\nfallen to 60 percent recently. Does that imply that the overall response rate for the entire\nthree-month period has fallen? No, response rates by the final estimate have not fallen—\nabout 95 percent of firms responded a decade ago, and that is how many are responding\nnow. What has happened is that U.S. firms are slower in returning the survey. Ten years\nago, if the survey had been sent to 100 firms, 75 would respond in the first month, and 20\nfirms would respond in the next two months. But now only 60 firms respond in the first\nmonth, and 35 firms respond in the second and third months. But in both cases, 95 out of\n100 firms surveyed responded.6\nWhat are the implications of this delayed response pattern? First, if more data\ncome in later in the survey period, then the initial estimate is less likely to accurately\nrepresent the final estimate, which means you are more likely to get significant revisions\nin the second and third months. The revisions do not mean the quality of the data has\ndeclined; it simply reflects the fact that more data is coming in late in the survey period.\nA second point is that revisions have been, on average, negative for the past\ncouple of years, and while the recent revisions were large, revisions have not been getting\nbigger, on average, based on an analysis recently issued by economists at J.P. Morgan.7\n6 The initiation rate has fallen significantly since the onset of the pandemic. This is an area where\nadditional resources dedicated to recruiting participants could improve data collection.\n7 See J.P. Morgan (2025), “US Focus: Jobs Revisions,” webpage, August 15,\nhttps://markets.jpmorgan.com/research/email/scx/1h6t2ulk/GPS-5056358-0/dcb73cdb-097b-4cdc-807f-\nbccb79320a11.\n\n- 8 -\nThey did find that large revisions are often associated with major turning points in the\nlabor market. One possibility is that the recent large revisions in the payroll data for May\nand June indicate the labor market is at an inflection point and may worsen in coming\nmonths.\nOverall, the delay in responses does mean that we can expect initial reports to be\nnoisier and more prone to revision. One month of data has never constituted a trend, but\nit is going to be especially important to take near-month payroll data with a grain of salt\nand form a picture of the labor market based on several months of results and a range of\nother labor market indicators. I hope my analysis of the labor market shows you that I do\nexactly that.\nLet me now turn to the outlook for inflation. Earlier this month, we received\nconsumer and producer price information for July that allows for an estimate of inflation\nbased on personal consumption expenditures (PCE), the FOMC’s preferred measure.\nBased on those reports, PCE inflation increased 2.6 percent over the 12 months ended in\nJuly, and PCE inflation excluding volatile food and energy prices increased 2.9 percent.\nWe will get the official data tomorrow.\nInflation has increased since the first quarter, but these numbers include the\neffects of import tariff increases, which, with inflation expectations anchored, I continue\nto expect will only temporarily raise inflation. Federal Reserve staff has extracted the\ntariff effects of inflation, and their latest estimates imply that without these effects,\nunderlying inflation continues to run close to the FOMC’s 2 percent target.8\n8 For a detailed discussion of the methodology to detect tariff effects on inflation, see Robbie Minton and\nMariano Somale (2025), “Detecting Tariff Effects on Consumer Prices in Real Time,” FEDS Notes\n(Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, May 9),\n\n- 9 -\nThere is still considerable uncertainty about how much more, and how quickly,\ntariffs will pass through to consumer prices. I have seen estimates that vary widely in the\nshare of tariffs borne by exporters, importers, and consumers, and that tells me that one\nmust be careful not to presume that some will bear a lot more than others. I continue to\nassume that the three groups affected by tariffs will share the costs roughly equally—one-\nthird, one-third, and one-third. Most forecasts are for 12-month inflation to continue to\nslowly increase for a couple more months, with monthly tariff effects dissipating by early\n2026.\nI believe that monetary policy should look through the tariff effects on inflation.\nWith underlying inflation close to 2 percent, market-based measures of longer-term\ninflation expectations firmly anchored, and the chances of an undesirable weakening in\nthe labor market increased, proper risk management means the FOMC should be cutting\nthe policy rate now. I felt this way in July, and all the evidence since then has led me to\nfeel more strongly about it today. Based on what I know today, I would support a 25\nbasis point cut at the Committee’s meeting on September 16 and 17. While there are\nsigns of a weakening labor market, I worry that conditions could deteriorate further and\nquite rapidly, and I think it is important that the FOMC not wait until such a deterioration\nis under way and risk falling behind the curve in setting appropriate monetary policy.\nMy eagerness to move now is supported by my view that monetary policy is\nmoderately restrictive. In June, the median of FOMC participants estimated that the\nlonger-run value of the federal funds rate, akin to what it would be now without\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/detecting-tariff-effects-on-consumer-prices-in-\nreal-time-20250509.html\n\n- 10 -\nrestricting or stimulating the economy, is 3 percent. With the target for the federal funds\nrate in a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, that means we are 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 percentage\npoints above neutral.\nWhile I judge that the FOMC should have begun this process in July, based on the\ndata in hand, I don’t believe that a cut of larger than 25 basis points is needed in\nSeptember. That view, of course, could change if the employment report for August, due\nout a week from tomorrow, points to a substantially weakening economy and inflation\nremains well contained.\nI think there is a growing consensus that monetary policy needs to be more\naccommodative, and even some recognition that it would have been wise to begin this\nprocess in July. I don’t believe that policy has fallen substantially behind the curve, but\none way to signal that I don’t intend to allow that happen is to talk about where we go\nafter September. Like other participants, I will be updating my economic projections just\nbefore the next FOMC meeting, including my assessment of the appropriate level of the\nfederal funds rate at the end of this year and next. The totality of the data and the outlook\nwill determine how quickly I believe we need to move policy to a neutral setting, but as I\nstand here today, I anticipate additional cuts over the next three to six months, and the\npace of rate cuts will be driven by the incoming data.i\ni On August 29, on page 2, a correction was made to the growth rate for real gross domestic product in the\nfirst half of 2025.

    "text": "For release on delivery\n8.45 a.m. EDT (7:45 a.m. CDT)\nApril 14, 2023\nFinancial Stabilization and Macroeconomic Stabilization:\nTwo Tools for Two Problems\nRemarks by\nChristopher J. Waller\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nGraybar National Training Conference\nSan Antonio, Texas\nApril 14, 2023\n\nThank you, Kathy, it’s a pleasure to be with you today. I am going to focus my\nremarks on the economic outlook, including how the recent turmoil in banking has\naffected that outlook.1 Relative to the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC)\neconomic objectives, data for the first quarter indicate that economic output and\nemployment are continuing to grow at a solid pace while inflation remains much too\nhigh. The FOMC raised its target range for the federal funds rate to 4¾ to 5 percent at its\nMarch meeting, and our statement noted that recent banking developments are likely to\nresult in tighter credit conditions and to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation.\nWe didn’t know then, and still don’t know, the extent of these possible effects. So,\nperhaps even more closely than usual, I will be watching the data to evaluate the\nappropriate path of monetary policy.\nThe sudden failure of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank, which\ncontributed to stresses felt by other mid-size banks, was a classic bank run, in which the\nrapid withdrawal of funds by depositors created severe liquidity problems. SVB was a\nspecialty bank serving the tech sector. Unlike other banks, where a substantial share of\ndeposits is insured and verifiably safe, more than 90 percent of SVB’s deposits were\nabove the $250,000-per-account limit for deposit insurance. Additionally, those deposits\nwere largely from many of the same types of businesses, resulting in additional risk.\nChair Powell has directed Vice Chair for Supervision Barr to report by May 1 on SVB’s\nfailure, including the Federal Reserve’s supervision and regulation of the bank. Based on\nwhat is already in the public record, SVB seems to have done a terrible job managing its\nrisks.\n1 The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nA bank run that undermines confidence in other banks is the most fundamental\nrisk to the financial system, and the Fed, serving as the lender of last resort, was created\nin part to prevent such a development. The job of the lender of last resort is to provide\nsufficient funds to the banking system so that depositors can be confident they will be\nable to withdraw their funds on demand. If depositors are confident that they will be able\nto withdraw their funds, then a bank run will stop or never start in the first place. Last\nmonth, that confidence was fractured when the failures of SVB and Signature Bank\nraised the possibility that uninsured depositors could take significant losses. As fear of\ntaking those losses spread to uninsured depositors at healthy institutions, it became\nimperative for the Federal Reserve, along with other regulators, to act.\nThe Fed’s long-time liquidity tool is the discount window, by which banks can\npost collateral, priced at market value, and obtain loans for up to 90 days. On March 12,\nthe Fed created an additional lending tool, with the approval of the Secretary of the\nTreasury, called the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP), which accepts U.S.\ngovernment securities collateral at par value with no haircuts for loans with maturities up\nto a year. To date, both tools are working well at providing needed liquidity to help\nbanks deal with deposit outflows. In addition, the Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation, and the Treasury Department announced the use of the systemic risk\nexception with respect to both SVB and Signature Bank to fully protect all depositors. I\nvoted for these actions, not because SVB and Signature are systemically important on\ntheir own, but to stem the emerging crisis of confidence which could have led to\nadditional bank runs with significant adverse effects on financial markets and the broader\neconomy.\n\n- 3 -\nThe BTFP and discount window appear to have been successful in providing\nstability to the banking system. In the past few weeks, we have seen deposit flows\nstabilize across banks and, as a result, the combined usage of the discount window and\nthe new program has moderated. Both tools remain ready and able to provide liquidity,\nenabling banks to support households and businesses.\nThis success allowed us to focus on our macroeconomic objectives of price\nstability and maximum employment when setting the policy rate at our March FOMC\nmeeting. Against this backdrop, the FOMC raised the policy rate 25 basis points without\ncausing significant stress to the financial system. To date, that decision has been\nvalidated.\nThat said, it is unclear to what extent the stress in the banking system will weigh\non economic activity. If banks feel they need to adjust their business models or are\nuncertain about the stability of their deposit base or the momentum of the economy, they\nmay tighten credit conditions and curtail lending. Tighter financial conditions or other\nlending conditions would likely cause households to reduce spending and businesses to\npull back on investment and hiring, all of which will help move supply and demand back\ninto better balance and help bring inflation down toward our 2 percent target.\nIt is important to note that there were indications of tightening credit conditions\nthis year before the problems emerged in the banking system. In the Board’s January\nsenior loan officer opinion survey, bank officials reported higher interest rates for loans\nand tighter lending standards, relative to the end of last year.2 These loan officers also\nsaid they expected to continue tightening lending standards over the course of 2023.\n2 One can find the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices at the following link.\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/data/sloos.htm\n\n- 4 -\nThey cited an expected deterioration in collateral value, a reduction in risk tolerance, and\na deterioration in the credit quality of bank portfolios, which mirror the factors that\ncontributed to the recent turmoil in banking. The failure of SVB and Signature Bank and\nrelated developments might have solidified and pulled forward factors that were already\nworking to tighten lending conditions, or it may be that credit conditions will now be\neven tighter than they were on track to be.\nI say this because, all else equal, a significant tightening of credit conditions could\nobviate the need for some additional monetary policy tightening, but making such a\njudgement is difficult, especially in real time.3\nRegarding the economic outlook, the data in hand for the first quarter of 2023\ncontinue to surprise me, with stronger growth and job creation than I expected late last\nyear. The FOMC has significantly raised the target range for the federal funds rate to\ndampen aggregate demand, but U.S. consumers and businesses are showing remarkable\nresilience. The Atlanta Fed’s gross domestic product (GDP) growth tracker, which\nreflects the most up-to-date data, estimates that gross domestic product grew by 2.2\npercent in the first quarter, in line with many private sector estimates and higher than\nmost estimates of potential growth provided by FOMC participants. This growth would\nmean that, so far, tighter monetary policy and credit conditions are not doing much to\nrestrain aggregate demand.\nSome data for March point to moderation in economic activity. The Institute for\nSupply Management’s (ISM) survey of purchasing managers indicated that\n3 For a given level of tightening in various financial market data, estimates of the equivalence in tightening\nof the policy rate vary widely, and, as the shift in financial conditions since early March showed, financial\nconditions themselves are a moving target.\n\n- 5 -\nmanufacturing contracted in March, and the ISM’s survey related to non-manufacturing\nindicated that activity outside the manufacturing sector decelerated in March to a modest\npace. Just a few minutes ago data on retail sales for March was released, which will give\nus some idea of how consumer demand is holding up. For this and other sectors of the\neconomy, I believe that demand will moderate because of higher interest rates.\nThe solid performance of the economy through the first quarter in part reflects the\ntight labor market. The jobs report for March showed, once again, that we have a strong\nlabor market, with 236,000 jobs created and the unemployment rate falling to 3.5 percent.\nWhile still showing strong signs of growth, job creation did cool a bit from the hot\nreadings we got in January and February. And we did get some encouraging news that\nthe labor market is rebalancing. First, the labor participation rate increased for the fourth\nmonth in a row, so labor supply is slowly increasing. Second, the report on February job\nopenings showed that job vacancies fell 632,000 to 9.9 million and the vacancy rate\ndeclined to 6 percent. Job vacancies have fallen 14 percent since the peak in March\n2022. The job openings data along with the jobs report show that labor demand has been\nfalling, which is more evident in declining vacancies than in rising layoffs. So as the\nlabor market continues to rebalance this should help bring inflation down by reducing\nwage pressures.\nNow, let’s talk about what these developments mean for inflation. Inflation\nmoderated in the second half of 2022, but that progress more or less stalled toward the\nend of the year, and inflation remains far above the FOMC’s target of 2 percent. On\nApril 12, we got consumer price index (CPI) inflation data for March, and it was another\nmonth of mixed news. Overall CPI inflation rose very little with only a 0.05 percent\n\n- 6 -\nincrease from the previous month, due to sharp declines in food and energy prices, with\nthe year over year increase falling to 5 percent. Core inflation, which strips out food and\nenergy prices, is a good guide to future inflation, and that measure came in at around 0.4\npercent in March, which translates to an annual rate of 4.6 percent if it were to persist. It\nwas the fourth month in a row with core inflation at 0.4 percent or higher. Since\nDecember of 2021, core inflation has basically moved sideways with no apparent\ndownward movement. So, despite some encouraging news on a slowing in housing costs,\ncore inflation does not show much improvement and remains far above our 2 percent\ninflation target.\nWhether you measure inflation using the CPI or the Fed’s preferred measure of\npersonal consumption expenditures, it is still much too high and so my job is not done. I\ninterpret these data as indicating that we haven’t made much progress on our inflation\ngoal, which leaves me at about the same place on the economic outlook that I was at the\nlast FOMC meeting, and on the same path for monetary policy. Because financial\nconditions have not significantly tightened, the labor market continues to be strong and\nquite tight, and inflation is far above target, so monetary policy needs to be tightened\nfurther. How much further will depend on incoming data on inflation, the real economy,\nand the extent of tightening credit conditions.\nAnother implication from my outlook and the slow progress lately is that, as of\nnow, monetary policy will need to remain tight for a substantial period of time, and\nlonger than markets anticipate. But there are still more than two weeks until the next\nFOMC meeting, and I stand ready to adjust my stance based on what we learn about the\neconomy, including about lending conditions. Other data such as those on the housing\n\n- 7 -\nsector, personal income, and surveys that provide managers’ views of economic\nconditions in April will come in over the next few weeks. I would welcome signs of\nmoderating demand, but until they appear and I see inflation moving meaningfully and\npersistently down toward our 2 percent target, I believe there is still work to do.\nThank you, Kathy, and I’m happy to take a few questions.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n1:00 p.m. EDT (noon local time)\nApril 14, 2025\nA Tale of Two Outlooks\nRemarks by\nChristopher J. Waller\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nCertified Financial Analysts Society of St. Louis\nSt. Louis, Missouri\nApril 14, 2025\n\nThank you, Jack and thank you to the CFA of St. Louis for the opportunity to\nspeak to you today. It’s a pleasure to be back home here in the city where I worked for\nnearly 12 years before becoming a Governor at the Federal Reserve Board.\nI am here to discuss my favorite topic, which is the outlook for the U.S. economy\nand the implications for monetary policy.1 I speak publicly on the outlook every few\nweeks or so, and usually the most exciting thing to happen in between these appearances\nis a monthly data release from the Bureau of Labor Statistics or the Commerce\nDepartment.\nThis time, of course, is different. The tariff increases announced April 2 were\ndramatically larger than I anticipated, adding on to other tariffs announced in March,\nalong with retaliatory actions from some countries. Combining all of these actions to\ndate, it is clear that tariffs this large and broadly applied could significantly affect the\neconomy and the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) pursuit of our economic\nobjectives. Given that there is still so much uncertainty about how trade policy will play\nout and how businesses and households will respond, I have struggled, like many others I\nhave talked with, to fit these varying possibilities into a single coherent view of the\noutlook.\nIt is an understatement to say that financial markets did not respond well to the\nApril 2 tariff announcement. Then last Wednesday, a substantial proportion of the\nnewest tariffs were suspended for 90 days pending negotiations to lower them, reportedly\nin exchange for lower barriers to U.S. exporters. This left in place a 10 percent tariff on\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nall imports, the pre-existing tariffs on some products and countries, and a sharp increase\nin import and export tariffs on China trade. More sector-specific tariffs are promised, and\nmuch uncertainty remains about whether tariff negotiations will lead to deals or whether\nthe April 2 tariffs will be implemented in 90 days.\nUncertainty about trade or fiscal policy decisions is precisely why you won’t hear\nme talking about such actions very often. It is why I avoided speaking in detail about\nproposed tariffs earlier this year. I do not judge such policy actions. But I must base my\npolicy decisions on the actions taken. Tariffs are the elephant in the room, so let’s talk\nabout them.\nAs I said a moment ago, I struggled after April 2 to come up with a single\ncoherent view of how the tariff increases would affect my outlook and views on monetary\npolicy. That difficulty did not end after the 90-day tariff suspensions announced on April\n9, which, if anything, may have widened the range of possible outcomes and effects and\nmade the timing even less certain. Friday’s exemptions for some tariffs on some\nelectronics imports from China only complicated the picture. Considering all this\nuncertainty, it is impossible to forecast how the economy will evolve very far into the\nfuture. In such circumstances, I tend to think in terms of scenarios and managing the\nassociated risks. So, for the balance of my remarks, I will try to lay out some possible\ntariff scenarios and how they will affect my thinking about the appropriate path for\nmonetary policy in the coming months.\nBut before I get to this exercise, it is essential to understand how the economy\nwas faring leading up to this big change in trade policy. As I will detail, in my view, the\neconomy was on a fairly solid footing in the first quarter of 2025. While the evidence\n\n- 3 -\nsuggests real gross domestic product (GDP) growth slowed from a 2.4 percent annual\npace in the fourth quarter, I believe the economy did grow modestly in the first quarter\nand that growth would have been stronger except for some special factors that are\nunlikely to continue.\nA variety of “soft” data—reports from business contacts and a range of consumer\nand business surveys—hinted at a substantial slowdown. The “hard” data, which\nincludes actual measurement and estimates of aggregate economic conditions, have\ntended to show that the economy grew modestly. While monthly readings through\nFebruary show consumer spending slowed from the fourth quarter, that may have\nreflected unusual seasonal factors that weighed on spending in the first two months of\nthis year, including harsh winter weather. We will get March retail sales later this week,\nand that should provide some helpful evidence of the pace of consumer spending.\nAnother factor counted against measured GDP growth in the first quarter was a surge in\nimports, likely an anticipatory effect caused by the prospect of the new tariffs, which\nprobably won’t continue. In the labor market, employment grew 228,000 in March,\nexceeding expectations, and job openings through February indicated that the labor\nmarket remained roughly in balance. In light of the continuing strength of the labor\nmarket and factors that probably temporarily lowered GDP growth, I think the U.S.\neconomy was in good shape in the first quarter.\nInflation has had a bumpy path down toward our 2 percent goal, and progress\nseemed to stall last year. But after some high inflation readings in January and February,\nwe got some encouraging news last Thursday on consumer price index (CPI) inflation.\nHeadline CPI prices fell 0.1 percent in March, bringing the 12-month measure of CPI\n\n- 4 -\ninflation down to 2.4 percent. A drop in energy prices—which has continued so far this\nmonth—was a big reason for the step-down. Core CPI inflation, which excludes volatile\nenergy and food prices and is a good guide to future inflation, rose just a tenth of a\npercent last month, which brought the 12-month change down to 2.8 percent, its lowest\n12-month reading since March 2021.\nWhen CPI data is supplemented with the producer price data that we received last\nweek, we estimate that the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), the\nFOMC’s preferred inflation gauge, was roughly unchanged in March bringing the 12-\nmonth change to 2.3 percent. Core PCE prices are estimated to have risen less than 0.1\npercent for the month, leaving core PCE inflation at 2.7 percent over the previous 12\nmonths. Both measures of total and core PCE inflation were above the FOMC’s 2\npercent goal.\nLooking across the first-quarter data, I see the economy growing modestly with a\nlabor market that was still solid and inflation that was still too high but was making slow\nprogress toward our goal of 2 percent.\nLet me now return to tariffs and my scenarios. To level set the discussion of\ntariffs, as of December 2024, the effective average trade-weighted tariff for all imports\ninto the United States was under 3 percent. Earlier this year, targeted tariffs brought the\naverage to 10 percent. The April 2 tariffs would have pushed that to 25 percent or more.\nEven with the pause on implementing those tariffs, retaining the new 10 percent tariff on\nmost imports and a tariff on Chinese imports of well over 100 percent, estimates are that\nthe average effective tariff today is still around 25 percent. This estimate is rough, and\nwe have seen that policy can change quickly, but the point is that even after the 90-day\n\n- 5 -\npause, the current tariff rate is a sharp increase to a level that the United States has not\nexperienced for at least a century.\nThe primary challenge in analyzing the economic effects of the tariff increases is\nthe considerable uncertainty that remains about their size and permanence. So I have\ndecided to focus on two scenarios for tariff policy when thinking about the economic\nresponse. One possibility is that they will remain very high and be long-lasting, near the\ncurrent average of 25 percent or more, as part of a committed effort by the\nAdministration to engineer a fundamental shift in the U.S. economy toward producing\nmore goods domestically and reducing trade deficits. The second scenario is that the\nsuspensions are the beginning of a concerted effort to negotiate reductions in foreign\nbarriers faced by U.S. exporters that will result in the removal of most of the announced\nimport tariffs, which would reduce the average tariff rate to around 10 percent. This\nlatter scenario had been my base case up until March 1. While there is a range of\npossibilities that could combine these objectives for tariff policy, these two approaches\nwould yield significantly different outcomes for the economy and monetary policy, so I\nwould like to discuss them today as two separate scenarios.\nIn doing so, I am not here to judge the objectives for the tariff increases. I am a\ncentral banker, and, as I said earlier, that means I take fiscal and other policy decisions\nmade by others as a given when setting monetary policy.\nBefore I summarize my two scenarios, let me emphasize that neither of them are\nforecasts and that I am employing scenarios as a way to frame my thinking about\nmanaging the risks of decision making when the outlook is as uncertain as it is. The\n“large tariff” scenario assumes that average tariffs around 25 percent will remain in place\n\n- 6 -\nfor some time. Let’s assume they remain at that level until at least the end of 2027,\nwhich is the horizon for economic projections made by FOMC participants. In my view,\nkeeping the large tariffs in place this long would be necessary if the primary goal is\nremaking the U.S. economy, which is now mostly services, into one that produces a\nlarger share of the goods it consumes. Such a shift, if it is possible, would be a dramatic\nchange for the United States and would surely take longer than three years.\nIn the second scenario, it is assumed that the primary goal would be to use the\ntariffs as leverage to negotiate reductions in trade barriers faced by U.S. exporters. In this\ncase, while I would expect that the announced minimum 10 percent tariff on all goods\nfrom all countries would remain in place, I would also expect that substantially all other\ntariffs would be eliminated over time. I will call this the “smaller tariff” scenario.\nLet me begin with the large tariff scenario and the implications for inflation. As I\nhave noted in past speeches, the textbook view of tariffs is that they are a one-time\nincrease in prices and would not be expected to be a persistent source of inflationary\npressure.2 While the tariffs after April 9 were very large, I still believe they would have\nonly a temporary effect on inflation.\nPrivate sector forecasts expect tariff increases of this magnitude to increase\ninflation by 1-1/2 to 2 percentage points over the next year or so, which I think is a\nreasonable estimate. If underlying core PCE inflation were to continue at its estimated\n12-month pace of 2.7 percent in March, that would mean inflation could reach a peak\nclose to 5 percent on an annualized basis in coming months if businesses quickly and\n2 See Christopher J. Waller (2025), “Disinflation Progress Uneven but Still on Track Rate Cuts on Track as\nWell,” speech delivered at the University of New South Wales Macroeconomic Workshop, Sydney, New\nSouth Wales, Australia, February 17,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250217a.htm.\n\n- 7 -\ncompletely passed through the cost of the tariff. Even if the tariffs were only partially\npassed on to consumers, inflation could move up to around 4 percent. These outcomes\nwould obviously be a reversal of the progress we have made on bringing inflation down\nover the past few years.\nIt will be important to watch inflation expectations and make sure they remain\nanchored during this process. Surveys of consumers have shown big increases in\ninflation expectations for this year. However, I tend to discount survey-based measures\nof inflation and prefer those based on the spread between nominal and inflation-indexed\nsecurities, since investors have more skin in the game than survey respondents. These\nmarket-based measures have not increased significantly, which implies market\nparticipants view tariffs as a one-time change to the price level. So I don’t think\nexpectations have become unanchored.\nThere are other factors that may limit the increase in inflation. I continue to\nbelieve that monetary policy is meaningfully restricting economic activity and hope that\nunderlying inflation may moderate over the course of the year, separate from the tariff\neffects. Also, competitive forces, including the desire to hold on to customers, may\ninduce businesses to pass along only a fraction of higher costs from tariffs. Finally, if the\neconomy slows substantially, then weaker demand will put downward pressure on\ninflation after tariffs take effect.\nIn terms of output growth, with large tariff increases, I would expect the U.S.\neconomy to slow significantly later this year and this slower pace to continue into next\nyear. Higher prices from tariffs would reduce spending, and uncertainty about the pace\nof spending would deter business investment. I have heard this repeatedly from business\n\n- 8 -\ncontacts around the country—tariff uncertainty is freezing capital spending. Productivity\ngrowth, an important source of GDP increases in recent years, would slow as investment\nis allocated according to trade policy and not towards its most productive and profitable\nuses. A fall in productivity would likely lower estimates of the neutral policy rate,\nmaking the current policy rate more restrictive than it is currently. Any trade retaliation\nfrom U.S. trading partners would reduce U.S. exports, which would be a drag on growth.\nThere is a long list of factors that can lower growth in this scenario.\nAlong with slower economic growth would come higher unemployment. With\nlarge tariffs remaining in place, I expect the unemployment rate, which was 4.2 percent in\nMarch, would rise by several tenths of a percentage point this year and approach 5\npercent next year. Even as the economy has moderated over the past year, the\nunemployment rate has stayed remarkably stable and close to estimates of its long-term\nrate—in other words, close to the FOMC’s goal. But a verifiable fact about the\nunemployment rate, based on history, is that when it starts to rise, as I expect it would\nunder this scenario, it often rises significantly.\nIn summary, under the large tariff scenario, economic growth is likely to slow to a\ncrawl and significantly raise the unemployment rate. I do expect inflation to rise\nsignificantly, but if inflation expectations remain well anchored, I also expect inflation to\nreturn to a more moderate level in 2026. Inflation could rise starting in a few months and\nthen move back down toward our target possibly as early as by the end of this year.\nYes, I am saying that I expect that elevated inflation would be temporary, and\n“temporary” is another word for “transitory.” Despite the fact that the last surge of\ninflation beginning in 2021 lasted longer than I and other policymakers initially expected,\n\n- 9 -\nmy best judgment is that higher inflation from tariffs will be temporary. If this inflation\nis temporary, I can look through it and determine policy based on the underlying trend. I\ncan hear the howls already that this must be a mistake given what happened in 2021 and\n2022. But just because it didn’t work out once does not mean you should never think that\nway again. Let me use a football analogy to characterize my thoughts. You are the\nPhiladelphia Eagles and it is fourth down and a few inches from the goal line. You call\nfor the Tush Push but fail to convert by running the ball. Since it didn’t work out the way\nyou expected, does that mean that you shouldn’t call for the Tush Push the next time you\nface a similar situation? I don’t think so. With the history of 2021 and 2022 still in my\nmind, I believe my analysis of the effect of tariffs is the right call, and I am going to stick\nwith my best judgment.\nWhile I expect the inflationary effects of higher tariffs to be temporary, their\neffects on output and employment could be longer-lasting and an important factor in\ndetermining the appropriate stance of monetary policy. If the slowdown is significant\nand even threatens a recession, then I would expect to favor cutting the FOMC’s policy\nrate sooner, and to a greater extent than I had previously thought. In my February\nspeech, I referred to this as the world of “bad news” rate cuts. With a rapidly slowing\neconomy, even if inflation is running well above 2 percent, I expect the risk of recession\nwould outweigh the risk of escalating inflation, especially if the effects of tariffs in\nraising inflation are expected to be short lived.3\n3 Recent research from the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis shows that this action is the optimal\nmonetary policy response in a standard macroeconomic model. See Javier Bianchi and Louphou Coulibaly\n“The Optimal Monetary Policy Response to Tariffs” Working Paper 810, Federal Reserve Bank of\nMinneapolis, March 7, 2025. The Optimal Monetary Policy Response to Tariffs | Federal Reserve Bank of\nMinneapolis\n\n- 10 -\nLet me now turn to the second scenario, in which tariffs are lower. In this case, I\nwould expect the 10 percent across-the-board tariff to be the baseline for the average\ntrade weighted tariff. Under this scenario the effect on inflation would be significantly\nsmaller than if larger tariffs remained. Here, the peak effect on inflation could be around\n3 percent on an annualized basis Since it may take some time for tariff-related price\n.\nincreases to work their way through production chains, the peak may be lower but still\ndissipate slowly. As trade negotiations proceed, I would expect that expectations of\nfuture inflation would remain anchored and short-term measures could even fall over\ntime, helping keep overall inflation in check.\nAt the same time, the fact that there is still an increase in tariffs means the smaller\ntariff scenario would surely have a negative effect on output and employment growth, but\nsmaller than the larger tariff scenario. The new tariffs are hitting an economy in good\nstanding, which leaves me encouraged that households and businesses would continue to\nspend and hire during trade negotiations that lead to substantially reduced import tariffs\nand possibly remove barriers to U.S. exporters over time.\nAs a result of these limited effects on inflation and economic activity from\nsteadily diminishing tariffs, I would support a limited monetary policy response.\nAnchored or even lower inflation expectations as the economy slows, combined with the\nview that smaller tariff effects are temporary, gives the FOMC room to adjust policy as\nprogress on the underlying trend in inflation is revealed in price data. With the threat of a\nsharp slowdown or recession diminished, pressure to reduce rates based on falling\ndemand would diminish also. That is, the policy response in this scenario could allow for\nmore patience. The preemptive policy cuts we did last fall can allow us some time to\n\n- 11 -\nwait and see if the hard data catch up to the soft data or vice versa and how much of the\ntariff will be passed through to the consumer. In such a scenario, the outlook for\nmonetary policy might not look much different than it did before March 1. With a fairly\nsmall tariff effect on inflation, I would expect inflation to continue on its path down\ntowards our 2 percent target. In this case, “good news” rate cuts are very much on the\ntable in the latter half of this year.\nLet me conclude with two essential points. The first is that the new tariff policy is\none of the biggest shocks to affect the U.S. economy in many decades. The second is that\nthe future of that policy, as well as its possible effects, is still highly uncertain. This\nmakes the outlook also highly uncertain and demands that policymakers remain flexible\nin considering the wide range of outcomes. In the end, the United States is a dynamic,\nresilient capitalist system that responds well to shocks and always has. I suspect that will\ncontinue to be the case now.\n.",

Waller\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nPeterson Institute for International Economics\nWashington, D.C.\n(via webcast)\nMarch 29, 2021\n\nBy way of introduction, I spent the first part of my career as an economics\nprofessor and researcher. One of my main fields of inquiry was monetary policy theory.\nI have long been a strong believer in the virtues of central bank independence, and today\nI will devote my remarks to that topic.1\nAs a result of the COVID-19 crisis, tremendous monetary and fiscal measures\nhave been taken to provide economic relief to American households and businesses. The\nFederal Reserve took a host of actions, including lowering its policy rate to zero and\npurchasing securities to support market functioning and provide monetary\naccommodation.2 The Congress enacted several packages that funded the health\nresponse to the pandemic, expanded unemployment insurance, and provided economic\nassistance payments to households and businesses.3\nThe virus also created uncertainty and turbulence in financial markets, which led\nthe Federal Reserve to establish emergency lending programs to serve as lending\nbackstops and support the flow of credit to households, businesses, nonprofits, and state\nand local governments.4 Establishing these programs under section 13(3) of the Federal\n1 I am grateful to Jane Ihrig for assistance in preparing these remarks.

My goal today is to definitively put that narrative to rest. It is simply\nwrong. Monetary policy has not and will not be conducted for these purposes.\nMy colleagues and I will continue to act solely to fulfill our congressionally\nmandated goals of maximum employment and price stability. The Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC) determines the appropriate monetary policy actions solely to move\n5 See Congressional Budget Office (2020), The Effects of Pandemic-Related Legislation on Output\n(Washington: CBO, September), available at https://www.cbo.gov/publication/56537; Congressional\nBudget Office (2021), “Summary Estimate for Divisions M through FF, H.R. 133, Consolidated\nAppropriations Act, 2021, Public Law 116-260, Enacted on December 27, 2020,” January 14,\nhttps://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2021-01/PL_116-260_Summary.pdf; and Congressional Budget Office\n(2021), “Estimated Budgetary Effects of H.R. 1319, American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, As passed by the\nSenate on March 6, 2021,” summary tables, March 10, https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2021-\n03/Estimated_Budgetary_Effects_of_HR_1319_as_passed_0.pdf.\n6 See Congressional Budget Office (2021), The Budget and Economic Outlook: 2021 to 2031\n(Washington: CBO, February), available at https://www.cbo.gov/publication/56970; and Congressional\nBudget Office (2015), An Update to the Budget and Economic Outlook: 2015 to 2025 (Washington: CBO,\nAugust), p. 71, https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/114th-congress-2015-2016/reports/50724-Update-\nOneColumn_0.pdf.\n\n- 3 -\nthe economy towards those goals. Deficit financing and debt servicing issues play no\nrole in our policy decisions and never will. Chair Powell made this same point in his\nrecent comments to the Economic Club of New York.7 My objective today is to\nreinforce that message.\nThis does not mean, however, that the Treasury and Federal Reserve should never\nwork together. My comments today will focus on the issue of cooperation—on when and\nhow much is beneficial and on the potential costs that should not be overlooked.\nLet me point out that there are two fronts for interaction between the Treasury and\nthe Federal Reserve. The first is what I will call “back office” operations. By this term, I\nmean the range of fiscal agency services that the Federal Reserve provides to the\nTreasury by statute.8 For example, the Federal Reserve maintains the Treasury’s\noperating account, accepting deposits, paying checks, and making electronic payments on\nbehalf of the Treasury. It provides securities services on behalf of the Treasury,\nsupporting the auction, issuance, and redemption of marketable Treasury securities. It\nalso provides application development and infrastructure support services, assisting in the\nTreasury’s efforts to improve government cash- and debt-management processes. Since\nthe Federal Reserve is the fiscal agent for the Treasury—and to play that role efficiently\nand at low cost—the Federal Reserve and the Treasury must always work closely\ntogether on operations issues.\n7 See Jerome H. Powell (2021), “Getting Back to a Strong Labor Market,” speech delivered at the\nEconomic Club of New York (via webcast), February 10,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210210a.htm.\n8 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2018), “Fiscal Agency Services,” webpage,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/fisagy_about.htm.\n\n- 4 -\nThe second form of interaction involves the Treasury and the Federal Reserve\nworking together on certain macroeconomic policy issues. I will discuss two areas where\ndiffering degrees of interaction could occur, emergency lending facilities and economic\nstabilization, and one area where that interaction should not, and does not, occur—debt\nfinancing.\nFirst, let me talk about emergency lending facilities authorized by section 13(3) of\nthe Federal Reserve Act.9 During a financial crisis or extreme market malfunctioning,\ncooperation between the fiscal and monetary authorities is imperative. An important role\nof a central bank is to step in and provide liquidity to ensure market functioning during\nthose “unusual and exigent circumstances.”10 And under those circumstances, since the\npassage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the\nSecretary of the Treasury is required to approve any new programs under the Federal\nReserve’s emergency lending authority.\nAs I mentioned, the Federal Reserve and the Treasury undertook this kind of\ncoordinated response a year ago, as uncertainty about the economic effect of the virus\ncaused markets to begin seizing up. Many section 13(3) facilities were established to\nsupport the flow of credit to households, businesses, and state and local governments.\nAll of these emergency programs required the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury,\nand many of them were supported by the Treasury’s financial backing, using funds\nspecifically appropriated by the Congress for these facilities in the Coronavirus Aid,\nRelief, and Economic Security Act.\n9 See 12 U.S.C. § 343(3).\n10 See section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. § 343(3)), available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/section13.htm (quoted text in paragraph (3)(A)).\n\n- 5 -\nAt times like these, cooperation between the fiscal and monetary authorities\nstrengthens financial stability. A financial crisis is not a time for uncooperative behavior\nfrom either side. However, with regard to the second area, economic stabilization, it is\nimperative that the central bank remain independent from the fiscal authority. There are\nsizable costs if cooperation turns into fiscal control.\nTo understand this point, consider a situation where the economy is hit with a\nnegative shock that depresses aggregate demand. The Macro 101 textbook policy\nresponse we teach students is for the monetary and fiscal authorities to enact stimulative\npolicies to increase aggregate demand. This effort involves fiscal actions, such as\nincreasing spending and cutting taxes, which increase the deficit. The finance ministry’s\njob is to finance the deficit that results from these fiscal policy actions. Greater\nborrowing by the finance ministry to finance these policies will tend to put upward\npressure on interest rates, which crowds out private sector spending. In this textbook\nexample, the monetary authority should respond to this upward pressure on interest rates\nby adopting a more accommodative policy stance to bring rates back down.\nFrom an institutional design viewpoint, what would be the appropriate\narrangement to ensure this type of policy response? One obvious solution would be to\ngive the finance ministry control of monetary policy to ensure a coordinated policy\nresponse. This logic suggests central bank independence is an impediment to optimal\nstabilization policy.\nSo why have an independent central bank? Why create an impediment to socially\nbeneficial cooperation?\n\n- 6 -\nIn the situation where monetary policy is under control of the Treasury, and thus\nthe executive branch in the United States, political motivations may influence decisions.\nTo return to my stabilization example, as the economy recovers, with all of the monetary\nand fiscal stimulus in place, this stimulus may lead to undesirable inflation pressures.\nThe standard monetary policy response is to evaluate the current employment and\ninflation situations and raise interest rates when deemed appropriate. However, if\nmonetary policy is under the control of the Treasury, then to further juice the economy\nfor short-term political gains, this action could be delayed past the date the central bank\nwould want to raise rates. Consequently, the argument goes that a hot economy may\ncause substantial inflation pressures that are hard to rein in politically, and which\nultimately harm Americans in the longer run. This view is backed up by the political\neconomy literature, which argues that having monetary policy under the control of\npolitical authorities may lead to excessive inflation and economic volatility that is not\nsocially optimal.11 Put another way, it can lead to an unstable economy, on which\nhouseholds and businesses cannot rely.\nSubsequent academic research, including mine, focuses on ways in which the\ncentral bank could be designed to prevent this undesired outcome from happening.12 One\nof those ways is delegating decisionmaking to a policy committee that is insulated from\nshort-term political pressures. Institutional details that enhance insulation include giving\n11See Finn E. Kydland and Edward C. Prescott (1977), “Rules Rather Than Discretion: The Inconsistency\nof Optimal Plans,” Journal of Political Economy, vol. 85 (June), pp. 473–91; Robert J. Barro and David B.\nGordon (1983), “A Positive Theory of Monetary Policy in a Natural Rate Model,” Journal of Political\nEconomy, vol. 91 (August), pp. 589–610; and Alberto Alesina (1987), “Macroeconomic Policy in a Two-\nParty System as a Repeated Game,” Quarterly Journal of Economics, vol. 102 (August), pp. 651–78.\n12 See Kenneth Rogoff (1985), “The Optimal Degree of Commitment to an Intermediate Monetary Target,”\nQuarterly Journal of Economics, vol. 100 (November), pp. 1169–89; and Christopher J. Waller (1989),\n“Monetary Policy Games and Central Bank Politics,” Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, vol. 21\n(November), pp. 422–31.\n\n- 7 -\ncentral bankers long terms and prohibiting removal from office for political reasons. This\nliterature provides the theoretical foundations for central bank independence and the\nimportance of central bank credibility.\nA look across countries is instructive. Operational independence with clearly\nspecified goals for monetary policy has become the norm for central banks in advanced\neconomies, reflecting the consensus that has emerged over the past 30 years concerning\nthe benefits of central bank independence.\nThe Congress was fully aware of the potential misuse of monetary policy for\npolitical reasons, and it purposefully created the Federal Reserve as an independent\ncentral bank. The design features of the Federal Reserve minimize political influence\nover monetary policy while still maintaining accountability to the Congress and to the\nelectorate for its policy actions.13\nEventually, in 1977, the Congress mandated that the Federal Reserve conduct\nmonetary policy to effectively promote the goals of maximum employment and price\nstability. By having monetary policy overseen by independent officials, the incentive to\nmisuse stabilization policy for partisan purposes is reduced. Monetary policymakers can\nfocus on what is best for the economy over the long run.14\n13 An example of a design feature of the Federal Reserve that balances accountability with independence to\nconduct monetary policy is the provision in the Federal Reserve Act that requires “open market” purchases\nand sales of Treasury securities (12 U.S.C. § 355). The requirement for purchases and sales to be in the\nopen market makes the Federal Reserve accountable for paying a market price, and, by preventing the\nFederal Reserve from purchasing directly from the Treasury, it supports the independence of the Federal\nReserve in the implementation of monetary policy. For a discussion of various tensions between allowing\nthe Federal Reserve to be independent to conduct policy and also being accountable to the electorate, see\nChristopher J. Waller (2009), “Why the Fed Is a Well-Designed Central Bank,” in Federal Reserve Bank of\nSaint Louis, Annual Report, 2009 (St. Louis: FRBSL), https://www.stlouisfed.org/annual-\nreport/2009/why-the-fed-is-a-well-designed-central-bank.\n14 See Michele Fratianni, Jurgen von Hagen, and Christopher Waller (1997), “Central Banking as a Political\nPrincipal-Agent Problem,” Economic Inquiry, vol. 35 (April), pp. 378–93.\n\n- 8 -\nFinally, we come to the third area of potential interaction between the central\nbank and the Treasury: debt financing. When governments run up large debts, the\ninterest cost to servicing this debt will be substantial. Money earmarked to make interest\npayments could be used for other purposes if interest rates were lower. Thus, the fiscal\nauthority has a strong incentive to keep interest rates low.\nThe United States faced this situation during World War II.15 Marriner Eccles,\nwho chaired the Federal Reserve at the time, favored financing the war by coupling tax\nincreases with wage and price controls. But, ultimately, he and his colleagues on the\nFOMC concluded that winning the war was the most important goal, and that providing\nthe government with cheap financing was the most effective way for the Federal Reserve\nto support that goal. So the U.S. government ran up a substantial amount of debt to fund\nthe war effort in a low interest rate environment, allowing the Treasury to have low debt\nservicing costs. This approach freed up resources for the war effort and was the right\ncourse of action during a crisis as extreme as a major world war.\nAfter the war was over and victory was achieved, the Treasury still had a large\nstock of debt to manage and still had control over interest rates. The postwar boom in\nconsumption, along with excessively low interest rates, led to a burst of inflation.\nWithout control over interest rates, the Federal Reserve could not enact the appropriate\ninterest rate policies to rein in inflation. As a result, prices increased 41.8 percent from\nJanuary 1946 to March 1951, or an average of 6.3 percent year over year.16 This trend,\n15 This history is recounted in Jessie Romero (2013), “Treasury-Fed Accord: March 1951,” Federal\nReserve History, November 22, https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/treasury-fed-accord.\n16 See Bureau of Labor Statistics (2021), “Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers: All Items in\nU.S. City Average [CPIAUCNS],” retrieved from FRED, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, March 11,\nhttps://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPIAUCNS.\n\n- 9 -\nand efforts by then-Chair Thomas McCabe and then-Board member Eccles, ultimately\nled to the Treasury-Fed Accord of 1951, which restored interest rate policy to the Federal\nReserve. The purpose of the accord was to ensure that interest rate policy would be\nimplemented to ensure the proper functioning of the economy, not to make debt financing\ncheap for the U.S. government.\nThe upshot of these examples is that cooperation between the Federal Reserve and\nthe Treasury is important to address macroeconomic policy issues. But research shows\nthat, to avoid distortions in using monetary policy for deficit financing, it is important to\nhave an independent central bank with a clear and credible inflation target, which the\nFederal Reserve does.17 Central bank independence is critical for maintaining that target\nand keeping inflation expectations in line with that target.\nMy message today is that the Federal Reserve and the Treasury should work\ntogether at key times and along certain dimensions. Back-office operations are done\nefficiently and effectively in this manner. And in times of crisis, coordination allows\npolicies to be implemented quickly and forcefully to set the stage for a strong path of\nrecovery. But for this arrangement to work, the political independence of the Federal\nReserve is essential—it is the best way for the Federal Reserve to meet its congressional\nmandate and allow policymakers to meet the longer-term needs of the American people.\nThe Treasury and the Federal Reserve both recognize this necessity and have issued joint\nstatements to this effect in the past.18\n17 See, for example, Fernando M. Martin (2015), “Debt, Inflation and Central Bank Independence,”\nEuropean Economic Review, vol. 79 (October), pp. 129–50.\n18 For example, see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and Department of the Treasury\n(2009), “The Role of the Federal Reserve in Preserving Financial and Monetary Stability: Joint Statement\nby the Department of the Treasury and the Federal Reserve,” joint press release, March 23,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20090323b.htm\n\n- 10 -\nWith this independence, of course, the FOMC is committed to being accountable\nand transparent about our actions to both the Congress and the public—and the Federal\nReserve strives to continually improve its transparency. In 2020, for example, the FOMC\nreleased a new Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.19 This\nnew framework explains how we interpret the mandate that the Congress has given us\nand describes the broad framework that we believe will best promote our maximum-\nemployment and price-stability goals.\nGoing forward, the monetary policy choices of the FOMC will continue to be\nguided solely by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices.\nThese congressionally mandated goals always drive our decisions; partisan policy\npreferences or the debt-financing needs of the Treasury will play no role in that decision.\nCooperation in times of crisis, like during the initial phases of the COVID crisis,\nwas crucial for staving off an economic disaster, putting us on the road to recovery, and\nhelping avoid long-run scarring and was the appropriate way to serve the Fed’s dual\nmandate. But the independence of the Federal Reserve is in the nation’s best interest and\nshould be valued and protected by all.\n19 The new statement—released on August 27, 2020, and reaffirmed in January 2021—is available on the\nBoard’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review-of-monetary-policy-strategy-\ntools-and-communications-statement-on-longer-run-goals-monetary-policy-strategy.htm.",

Waller\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe Brookings Institution\nWashington, D.C.\nJanuary 16, 2024\n\nThank you, David Wessel, and thank you to Brookings for the opportunity to\nspeak to you today.\nIn the second half of 2023, I gave a series of speeches about the apparent conflict\nbetween the strength of economic activity in the third quarter and continued progress\ntoward the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) 2 percent inflation goal.1 I said\nthen that “something’s got to give”—either activity needs to moderate, or progress on\nlowering inflation is going to stop. By late November, the latest economic data left me\nencouraged that there were signs of moderating economic activity in the fourth quarter,\nbut inflation was still too high.\nAs of today, the data has come in even better. Real gross domestic product\n(GDP) is expected to have grown between 1 and 2 percent in the fourth quarter,\nunemployment is still below 4 percent, and core personal consumption expenditure (PCE)\ninflation has been running close to 2 percent for the last 6 months. For a\nmacroeconomist, this is almost as good as it gets.\nBut will it last? Time will tell whether inflation can be sustained on its recent\npath and allow us to conclude that we have achieved the FOMC’s price-stability goal.\nTime will tell if this can happen while the labor market still performs above expectations.\nThe data we have received the last few months is allowing the Committee to consider\ncutting the policy rate in 2024. However, concerns about the sustainability of these data\ntrends requires changes in the path of policy to be carefully calibrated and not rushed. In\n1 See Christopher J. Waller (2023), \"Something's Got to Give,\" speech delivered at the Distinguished\nSpeaker Seminar, European Economics and Financial Center, London, October 18, and “Something\nAppears to Be Giving,” speech delivered at the American Enterprise Institute, Washington, D.C.,\nNovember 28. The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the\nFederal Open Market Committee.\n\nthe end, I am feeling more confident that the economy can continue along its current\ntrajectory.\nLet me start with the data on economic activity that has brought me to this view,\nand then I’ll talk about the labor market, financial conditions, and inflation. I’ll conclude\nwith what I think the implications are from all that for monetary policy.\nFirst, economic activity has moderated. After averaging an annualized 3 percent\nover the first three quarters of 2023, and 5 percent in the third quarter, growth in real\nGDP appears to have slowed appreciably in the fourth quarter. The average of private-\nsector forecasts summarized by the Blue Chip survey estimates that real GDP grew 1.5\npercent in the final three months of 2023. The Atlanta Fed’s GDP Now model, based on\ndata in hand, currently stands at 2.2 percent. An important part of that moderation comes\nfrom business investment and government spending, both of which showed rapid growth\nearlier in 2023 that didn’t appear sustainable. Consumer spending also accounted for\nmuch of the surprising strength in GDP growth earlier in the year, but here the slowdown\nso far appears more tentative. Factors such as high interest rates, a depletion of excess\nsavings, and a pickup in credit card usage all portend slower growth ahead, but it is\nunclear how much of that slowing has already occurred. Since consumer spending\naccounts for more than two-thirds of GDP, this component of demand is obviously\ncritical for the outlook. We’ll find out more about consumer spending tomorrow from\nthe report on December’s retail sales.\nTurning to the labor market, over the course of 2023, there have been increases in\nlabor supply amid slowing demand for labor, and I expect this to continue to bring the\nlabor market into better balance. Some have seen the latest jobs report as in conflict with\n\nthis story, so let me explain why I don’t see it that way. The short version is that I see the\nsurprises in the December jobs report as largely noise against a trend of ongoing\nmoderation that supports progress toward 2 percent inflation.\nThe unemployment rate in December held steady at 3.7 percent while employers\nadded 216,000 jobs, which was more than expected and an increase from the 173,000\ncreated in November and 105,000 in October. While that looks like a modest\nacceleration in job creation, I remind myself that revisions to monthly payrolls have been\ndownward for most of 2023—from the first to the third estimate employment gains were\nrevised down in 9 of 10 job reports. Given this recent history of revisions, there is a good\nchance December will be revised down. Furthermore, with growth expectations\nmoderating over coming quarters, employment gains are likely to slow. We can see that\nthis is already happening if we look at progress over the previous quarters. Average\nmonthly payroll gains over the fourth quarter were 165,000, a step down from the\n221,000 average in the third quarter and 257,000 in the first half of 2023. This data\nshows an improving balance between labor supply and demand.\nLikewise, an uptick in wage growth last month should be viewed over a longer\ntime horizon. Average hourly earnings rose 0.4 percent in December, as they did in\nNovember, and the 3- and 12-month increases ticked up. But over the course of the\nfourth quarter, wages rose less than they did in the third quarter, and over the past several\nquarters I see a moderation in wage increases across various measures of labor\ncompensation that I expect will be consistent with ongoing progress toward 2 percent\ninflation. And, though there was a drop in labor force participation in December, the\n\nfourth-quarter average is higher than it was in 2022. These are all signs that the labor\nmarket continues to come into better balance.\nMeanwhile, data on job openings indicates ongoing moderation in labor demand.\nJob openings played a prominent role in my thinking over the last two years about how\nrestrictive monetary policy aimed at bringing down inflation will impact labor demand\nand unemployment. One can think of total labor demand as being the sum of the number\nof workers employed and the number of workers that firms want to hire. The latter is\nbest measured by posted job vacancies. If labor demand declines, the question is: Will\nemployment bear the brunt of the reduction in demand or will vacancies absorb the\nimpact? Traditional Phillips curve analysis assumes that employment would bear the\nbrunt and as a result, unemployment would rise significantly from a tightening of\nmonetary policy. History has shown that this is not an unreasonable assumption,\nparticularly when the job vacancy rate is below 4.5 percent.\nBut in the spring of 2022, the vacancy rate peaked around 7.5 percent with nearly\n12 million job vacancies, and there were still about 6 million unemployed workers. It\njust seemed counterintuitive to me that with that many job openings and so few people\nlooking for work that the first thing a firm would do when labor demand softened would\nbe to lay off workers. My economic instinct was that this time things would be different\nand that vacancies would absorb the decline in labor demand, while employment and\nunemployment changed relatively little.\nBut instinct isn’t enough sometimes. One needs an economic model to verify\nyour instinct and good data analysis is needed to quantify the theoretical impact. This is\n\nwhat I provided in a speech I gave in May 2022, with the help of Andrew Figura.2 In that\nspeech we described a textbook labor search model to derive a Beveridge curve, which is\na theoretical relationship between job vacancies and the unemployment rate.3 To\nquantify the effects of restrictive monetary policy on unemployment, we used standard\nempirical methods to calibrate the theoretical model. We showed that if restrictive\nmonetary policy could lower the vacancy rate from 7.5 percent to 4.5 percent via a\nsignificant decline in job vacancies, there would be a relatively small increase in the\nunemployment rate—from 3.7 percent to 4.2 percent. Based on this analysis, we argued\nthat, as long as the involuntary job-separation rate did not rise, restrictive monetary\npolicy would allow the FOMC to bring inflation down without a significant increase in\nthe unemployment rate. This seemed like a very plausible assumption given the\nincredibly high vacancy rate and dearth of workers looking for jobs. Our predictions\ncontradicted standard Phillips curve analysis and historical precedent, but we were in\nunprecedented times in 2022.\nIt has been nearly two years since I gave that speech. How has our prediction\nfaired? Data received since then have supported our argument. Since March 2022, the\nFOMC raised the policy rate over 500 basis points and core PCE inflation has fallen\nsubstantially, especially when measured over the past six months. During this dramatic\ntightening of policy, the job vacancy rate fell from around 7.5 percent to 5.3 percent,\nwhich brought the ratio of job vacancies to the number of unemployed people to a touch\n2 See Christopher J. Waller (2022), “Responding to High Inflation, with Some Thoughts on a Soft\nLanding,” speech delivered at the Institute for Monetary and Financial Stability (IMFS) Distinguished\nLecture, Goethe University Frankfurt, Germany, May 30.\n3 See Figura and Waller (2022). \"What does the Beveridge curve tell us about the likelihood of a soft\nlanding?,\" FEDS Notes. Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, July 29, 2022,\nhttps://doi.org/10.17016/2380-7172.3190.\n\nbelow 1.4—down from the peak of 2 and not far from the pre-pandemic level of 1.2. The\ninvoluntary job-separation rate has remained essentially unchanged at 1 percent since\nApril 2022. Meanwhile the unemployment rate, while bouncing around a bit, is the same\nas it was in March 2022, 3.7 percent, which is lower than we predicted.\nNow, we argued that this couldn’t go on forever. We showed in our research that\nif the vacancy rate continued to fall below 4.5 percent there would be a significant\nincrease in the unemployment rate. So, from now on, the setting of policy needs to\nproceed with more caution to avoid over-tightening. But to me, this episode shows that\ngood theory combined with good data analysis can lead to good policy outcomes, even if\nthe predictions challenge conventional wisdom.\nMoving on from the labor market, another important factor affecting economic\nactivity and progress toward the FOMC’s economic objectives is financial conditions,\nand I wanted to give my view of where they stand. There has been a lot of focus on\ntightening financial conditions in the fall and then easing of conditions more recently.\nMy view continues to be that, on net, financial conditions remain restrictive and continue\nto have the desired effect of being a drag on economic activity to put downward pressure\non inflation.\nRecall that the 10-year Treasury yield peaked in mid-October around 5 percent at\nthe time of the jump up in measured economic activity in the third quarter and shortly\nafter a strong jobs report for September. At that point, FOMC participants still expected\nanother rate hike in 2023. But then the data started cooling off, the FOMC’s December\nSummary of Economic Projections indicated no more hikes, and the 10-year Treasury\nyield fell to around 4 percent, which is roughly where it was just after the FOMC’s last\n\nrate hike in July. Remember that in July the widespread view was that financial\nconditions were pretty tight. I consider this to still be true today, and that judgment is\nsupported by current readings of financial conditions indexes, which capture a broader set\nof financial variables.4\nSo let’s talk about what the data on economic activity, the labor market and\nfinancial conditions mean for progress toward 2 percent inflation. The backdrop is that\nwe made a lot of progress on inflation in 2023. The 12-month percent change in total\nPCE inflation, the FOMC’s preferred measure for our target, fell from 5.3 percent in\nJanuary to 2.6 percent in November, the latest month of data. Factoring out volatile\nenergy and food prices, core inflation is a better guide to where inflation is going, and\ncore PCE inflation fell from 5 percent in January to 3.2 percent in November. With\ninflation declining over the course of the year, I like to look at 3- and 6-month measures\nto have a better understanding of the current level of inflation. As I noted earlier, the 6-\nmonth change in core inflation has been hovering close to a 2 percent annual rate, as has\nthe 3-month measure.\nData on inflation for December was released last week for the consumer price\nindex (CPI) and producer price index. CPI inflation for both total and core rose 0.3\npercent for the month. Producer price index (PPI) inflation numbers reported a continued\ndecline in those prices. Some of the PPI data feed into December PCE inflation, and\nprivate sector forecasts suggest that the monthly core PCE reading will be 0.2 percent. If\n4 For example, the movement of Goldman Sachs’ Financial Conditions Index looks a lot like that of the 10-\nyear Treasury yield and is close to its levels in July. The Federal Reserve’s Financial Conditions Impulse\non Growth index also shows a downward movement from its peak earlier in 2023, and its level continues to\nsuggest that conditions are a headwind to economic activity.\n\nthose forecasts hold true, then core PCE inflation in December will remain close to 2\npercent, when measured on a 3-month or 6-month basis.\nPCE inflation of 2 percent is our goal, but that goal cannot be achieved for just a\nmoment in time. It must be sustained at a level of 2 percent. As I said earlier, based on\neconomic activity and the cooling of the labor market, I am becoming more confident\nthat we are within striking distance of achieving a sustainable level of 2 percent PCE\ninflation. I think we are close, but I will need more information in the coming months\nconfirming or (conceivably) challenging the notion that inflation is moving down\nsustainably toward our inflation goal.\nThis brings me to the implications for monetary policy. The progress I have\nnoted on inflation, combined with the data in hand on economic and financial conditions\nand my outlook has made me more confident than I have been since 2021 that inflation is\non a path to 2 percent. While the emphasis of policy since that time has been on pushing\ndown inflation, given the strength of the current labor market the FOMC’s focus now is\nlikely to be more balanced: keeping inflation on a 2 percent path while also keeping\nemployment near its maximum level. Today, I view the risks to our employment and\ninflation mandates as being more closely balanced. I will be watching for sustained\nprogress on inflation and modest cooling in the labor market that does not harm the\neconomy.\nI believe policy is set properly. It is restrictive and should continue to put\ndownward pressure on demand to allow us to continue to see moderate inflation readings.\nSo, as I said, I believe we are on the right track to achieve 2 percent inflation.\n\nAs long as inflation doesn’t rebound and stay elevated, I believe the FOMC will\nbe able to lower the target range for the federal funds rate this year. This view is\nconsistent with the FOMC’s economic projections in December, in which the median\nprojection was three 25-basis-point cuts in 2024. Clearly, the timing of cuts and the\nactual number of cuts in 2024 will depend on the incoming data. Risks that would delay\nor dampen my expectation for cuts this year are that economic activity that seems to have\nmoderated in the fourth quarter of 2023 does not play out; that the balance of supply and\ndemand in the labor market, which improved over 2023, stops improving or reverses; and\nthat the gains on moderating inflation evaporate.\nOne piece of data I will be watching closely is the scheduled revisions to CPI\ninflation due next month. Recall that a year ago, when it looked like inflation was\ncoming down quickly, the annual update to the seasonal factors erased those gains. In\nmid-February, we will get the January CPI report and revisions for 2023, potentially\nchanging the picture on inflation. My hope is that the revisions confirm the progress we\nhave seen, but good policy is based on data and not hope.\nWhen the time is right to begin lowering rates, I believe it can and should be\nlowered methodically and carefully. In many previous cycles, which began after shocks\nto the economy either threatened or caused a recession, the FOMC cut rates reactively\nand did so quickly and often by large amounts. This cycle, however, with economic\nactivity and labor markets in good shape and inflation coming down gradually to 2\npercent, I see no reason to move as quickly or cut as rapidly as in the past. The healthy\nstate of the economy provides the flexibility to lower the (nominal) policy rate to keep\n\nthe real policy rate at an appropriate level of tightness. But I will end by repeating that\nthe timing and number of rate cuts will be driven by the incoming data.\nThank you.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n12:10 p.m. EDT (6:10 p.m. local time)\nOctober 18, 2024\nCentralized and Decentralized Finance: Substitutes or Complements?\nRemarks by\nChristopher J. Waller\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe Vienna Macroeconomics Workshop\nInstitute of Advanced Studies\nVienna, Austria\nOctober 18, 2024\n\nThank you for inviting me to speak today.1 I have participated in this conference\nfor nearly 20 years and have often presented my research on monetary theory, banking,\nand payments. So, I believe this is the right audience to speak to regarding the role of\ncentralized finance and the emergence of decentralized finance, or defi for short. Over\nthe past few years, there has been a lot of attention and work on defi, which will be a\nmajor focus of my remarks. Many argue that defi will replace traditional centralized\nfinance while others argue that it merely extends traditional finance methods and trading\nactivities onto new platforms. It is in this sense that I want to address the question of\nwhether centralized finance and defi are substitutes or complements to each other.\nAdvances associated with defi have the potential to profoundly affect financial\nmarket trading. While I believe these advances could lead to efficiency gains, I recognize\nthe significant value that has been delivered for centuries by financial intermediaries and\nthrough centralized financial markets. Before I share my views on the promise of these\nnew technologies, let me tell you where I’m coming from on these issues.\nI am an economist, and so my first inclination is to think about the underlying\neconomics driving an issue. But to understand the value proposition of defi, it is useful to\nfirst recall why centralized financial market trading arose in the first place. Centralized\nfinance clearly provides benefits to people, but obviously also comes with some costs. I\nam going to take a few minutes to discuss those benefits and costs before turning to the\nquestion at hand.\n1 I would like to dedicate these remarks to an old friend and longtime participant of this conference, Paul\nKlein, who passed away unexpectedly two months ago. The views expressed here are my own and are not\nnecessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nLet’s start with the economics of trading. Most financial trades are “pairwise” in\nthat the seller of an object needs to find a buyer of that exact object. The problem is that\nit is often complicated, costly, and time-consuming to search for a buyer. This gives rise\nto the need for someone to step in and help buyers and sellers match in a faster and less\ncostly manner. In short, there is a profit opportunity for someone to intermediate the\ntrade.\nAnother name for intermediaries is middlemen. Why would we pay a\nmiddleman? In their paper from nearly 40 years ago, Ariel Rubenstein and Asher\nWolinsky described it eloquently: “What makes the middlemen’s activity possible is the\ntime-consuming nature of the trade, which enables middlemen to extract surplus in return\nfor shortening the time period that sellers and buyers have to wait for a transaction.”2\nLet me contextualize the value of middlemen with an example I used for years\nwhen teaching money and banking. Suppose you had some extra income from saving\nand wanted to lend it out to earn interest. How would you do that? First, you would have\nto advertise that you had funds to lend. Then, you would have to wait for the right person\nwho needed that exact amount of funds, which could be a long time. Once you met the\nright person, you would have to negotiate when repayment would occur. Next, you\nwould need to know a lot of information about the person receiving your funds and the\nlikelihood you would get repaid. This is needed to assess the risk of the transaction and\nthe compensation you would need to give up your funds. You would also need a lot of\nlegal advice to draw up a contract and stipulate how the contract would be enforced under\n2 See Ariel Rubinstein and Asher Wolinsky, “Middlemen,” The Quarterly Journal of Economics 102\n(August 1987): 581–93, https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/102/3/581/1887969.\n\n- 3 -\na range of conditions. Finally, since you are the sole source of funding, you will bear the\nentire cost of a default. It should be clear that this would be a daunting exercise for most\npeople and explains why they would turn to a middleman who specializes in this type of\nactivity to do all this on their behalf.\nIt is for these reasons that banks arose as early as in ancient Mesopotamia to carry\nout some of these functions.3 Similar issues arise when it comes to other ways of\ntransferring resources from one person to another, as occurs from non-bank debt, equities\nand insurance contracts. Many point to trades of shares in the Dutch East India Trading\nCompany in Amsterdam in the 1660s as the origins of the first modern stock exchange.\nLloyds of London was founded as a means of pooling funds to share risk and return in the\nshipping industry, thus becoming the first insurance firm. The fact that similar\narrangements still exist centuries later is a testament to the value of intermediation and\ncentralized financial trading.\nHowever, these arrangements are not without drawbacks. An obvious drawback\nof intermediation from the perspective of those wishing to trade is that those middlemen\nmust get paid. That is, there are transaction costs. Another drawback of intermediation is\nthat you typically must turn over control of your assets, such as savings or stocks, to the\nintermediary for them to be traded. This creates a classic “principal-agent” problem\nwhereby incentives between the principal—you—and the agent—the intermediary—may\nnot be aligned. That can raise concerns about custody arrangements and recourse to\n3\nSee Benjamin Bromberg, “The origin of banking: religious finance in Babylonia,” The Journal of\nEconomic History 2 (May 1942): 77–88, https://cooperative-individualism.org/bromberg-benjamin_the-\norigin-of-banking-1942-may.pdf.\n\n- 4 -\nregain control of one’s assets. Intermediation also requires recordkeeping arrangements\nthat customers can trust accurately reflect their true holdings. In other words, centralized\nfinance requires a substantial amount of trust. With all that in mind, let me turn to how\nand why technological innovations have given rise to defi.\nIn a capitalist system, the existence of profits provides incentives for others to\nenter the market, offer a better product, and compete away any excess profits. This can\nbe done by the creation of new financial firms that can provide the same or better service\nat a lower cost. Often that occurs through innovations and exploiting new technologies.\nThink about how the invention of the telegraph and the telephone revolutionized trading.\nMore recently, the advent of the internet further advanced the ease and speed of financial\ntrading. These are examples of how financial trading has evolved over time. And the\nnext wave of innovations in financial market trading could be driven by technological\nadvances that alleviate some potential drawbacks of the centralized approach.\nOften broad technological advances emanate from narrower efforts to design\nproducts or processes that solve specific problems. For example, one technology used to\nsupport portable home appliances like vacuum cleaners was originally developed to\nsupport the space program.4 Similarly, the development of crypto-assets led to the\ndevelopment of technologies that are fueling possibilities in defi.\nWe don’t have enough time for me to cover the full history of crypto-assets, but I\nwill focus on several key elements that have affected the evolution toward defi. An early\ncrypto-asset—Bitcoin—was developed to function in a world in which trust among\n4 See National Aeronautics and Space Administration, “Spinoff from a Moon Tool,” January 1, 1981,\nhttps://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20030005114/downloads/20030005114.pdf.\n\n- 5 -\nindividuals did not exist. Rather than relying on intermediaries which require trust,\nBitcoin relied on technology to facilitate trade. Bitcoin was also designed for privacy.\nNo one would know who was buying or selling Bitcoin. This was achieved through\ncryptographic technology and private keys. In addition, it allowed individuals to\nmaintain control of their crypto-assets throughout the entire trading process. That is, they\nno longer had to delegate control to others. Finally, all records were kept on a form of\ndistributed ledger called a blockchain, which has design features that promote\ntransparency and are censorship-proof. No individual or government could destroy the\nrecords of trades or take ownership of the objects traded.\nWith that history in mind and before we delve into the question of whether defi\nand centralized finance are substitutes or complements, I think it is useful to carefully\ndefine some terms. This will make sure we’re all talking about the same things. As I\ndescribed in a speech last year, I think of the crypto ecosystem as consisting of three\nparts:\n• a crypto-asset, which generally refers to any digital object traded using\ncryptographic techniques;\n• technology that directly facilitates trading crypto-assets; this includes smart\ncontracts and tokenization;5 and\n5\nSee Christopher J. Waller, “Thoughts on the Crypto Ecosystem” (speech at Global Interdependence\nCenter Conference: Digital Money, Decentralized Finance, and the Puzzle of Crypto, La Jolla, CA,\nFebruary 10, 2023), https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20230210a.htm.\n\n- 6 -\n• a database management protocol used to record trades and ownership of assets,\ncommonly referred to as the blockchain, which includes both permissioned and\npermissionless distributed ledger technologies.\nIt is easy to see how the emergence of these technologies could lead one to think\nof defi as a substitute for centralized finance. For example, the technologies are allowing\nfor individuals to trade assets without giving up control of those assets to an\nintermediary—a critical distinction with centralized finance.\nHowever, there are other uses emerging from these technologies that look more\nlike complements to centralized finance. For example, distributed ledger technology, or\nDLT, may be an efficient and faster way to do recordkeeping in a 24/7 trading world.\nWe already see several financial institutions experimenting with DLT for traditional repo\ntrading that occurs 24/7. But before these ledgers can be used to facilitate transactions in\ntraditional assets—like debt, equity, and real estate—these assets must be tokenized.\nUndertaking the process to tokenize assets and use distributed ledgers like blockchain can\nspeed up transfers of assets and take advantage of another innovation: smart contracts.\nRather than relying on each party to separately carry out the transaction, smart\ncontracts can effectively combine multiple legs of a transaction into a single unified act\nexecuted by a smart contract. This can provide value as it can mitigate risks associated\nwith settlement and counterparty risks by ensuring the buyer will not pay if the seller\ndoes not deliver. While these efforts are still in early stages, the functionality could\nexpand to a broad set of financial activities. The bottom line is that things like DLT,\ntokenization, and smart contracts are just technologies for trading that can be used in defi\n\n- 7 -\nor also to improve efficiency in centralized finance. That is why I see them as\ncomplements.\nStablecoins are another important innovation in defi. Stablecoins were created in\nthe crypto universe in hopes of providing a “safe” asset with a stable value for trading.\nNearly all stablecoins are pegged to the U.S. dollar one-for-one. They provide an\nopportunity for buyers and sellers to transact in a decentralized fashion with the\nstablecoin used as the settlement instrument. Because they are effectively digital\ncurrency, stablecoins can reduce the need for payment intermediaries and thereby reduce\ncosts of payments globally. But their safety is not assured. History is replete with cases\nin which synthetic dollars became subject to runs. Stablecoins thus face all of the same\nissues any substitute for genuine U.S. dollars faces. If appropriate guardrails can be\nerected to minimize run risk and mitigate other risks, such as their potential use in illicit\nfinance, then stablecoins may have benefits in payments and by serving as a safe asset on\na variety of new trading platforms.\nThese technologies will almost certainly lead to efficiency gains over time, but as\nthey develop, we should think carefully about their role in the broader financial\nlandscape.\nIs it really possible to completely decentralize finance using these technologies?\nThe answer is obviously “no.” Intermediation is still valuable for the average person, and\nwe see this by the existence of trading exchanges in the crypto world. All these platforms\ninvolve giving custody of one’s crypto-assets to an intermediary, who conducts trades on\nbehalf of the client. This reintroduces the need for trust in these platforms just as trust is\nneeded in modern banking systems.\n\n- 8 -\nReturning to the technologies behind defi, one must ask whether there are unique\nrisks associated with the use of these technologies. If so, what is the nature of these\nrisks? Are they contained to just those people directly engaging with the technologies, or\ncould there be broader spillovers to society? For example, can these technologies\nincrease the risk of inadvertently providing funds to bad actors? In centralized finance\nthere are regulations that require banks to know who their clients are. Are similar rules\nand regulations needed around some of these new technologies? When it comes to our\nfinancial plumbing, which affects every person or business in one way or another, I think\na balanced view of expeditious disruption and long-term sustainability is merited.\nSo where does that leave us? Ultimately, I believe that advances in technology\nhave the potential to drive efficiency gains in finance, just as technological innovation\nhas done for centuries. While there are certain services emerging through defi that\ncannot be provided by centralized finance, the technological innovations stemming from\ndefi are largely complementary to centralized finance. They have the potential to\nimprove centralized finance, thereby increasing the significant value that financial\nintermediaries and centralized financial markets deliver. I look forward to seeing the\ncontinued evolution of financial technology and the benefits that evolution will bring to\nthe households and businesses served by the financial system.",

Waller\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\nDallas, Texas\nJuly 10, 2025\n\nThank you, Lorie. Let me start by expressing my deepest condolences to the\nfamilies and loved ones of those harmed by the flooding in the Hill Country. I cannot\nimagine the pain and anguish they are feeling. My prayers go out to all those affected.\nTurning to my remarks for today, thank you also for the opportunity to speak to\nyou about the Fed’s balance sheet, one of the more complex, and, I believe,\nmisunderstood aspects of the Federal Reserve’s role as a central bank.1 To level set the\nconversation, let me start with some simple facts. In August of 2007 our balance sheet\nwas around $870 billion, equal to approximately 6 percent of nominal gross domestic\nproduct (GDP). Today it is around $6.7 trillion, with a t, which is about 22 percent of\nGDP. This is down significantly from its maximum size of nearly $9 trillion in early\n2022 but still quite large. Since nominal GDP has essentially doubled since 2007, if our\nbalance sheet had grown at the same rate, it would be around $1.7 trillion today—not\n$6.7 trillion.\nAn obvious question is why our balance sheet is so much larger than economic\ngrowth would have predicted. As an aside, let me point out that there is no consensus\namong economists about how large a central bank balance sheet should be, but it is\nlogical to ask: if monetary policy worked when the balance sheet was 6 percent of GDP,\nwhy is it, and perhaps needs to be, proportionally so much larger now?\nA major reason is that the Federal Reserve embarked on two major balance sheet\npolicy initiatives over the past twenty years to respond to urgent problems in the\neconomy. First, we engaged in quantitative easing, or QE, to provide support to the\neconomy after the advent of the Global Financial Crisis and then again with the COVID-\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of\nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\n19 pandemic. Second, we consciously changed our implementation framework for\nproviding liquidity to the banking system by moving from a scarce-reserves system to an\nample-reserves system. This change was necessary because there were shortcomings\nwith the scarce-reserves approach—short-term rates were harder to control and required\ndaily interventions in the markets by the Fed, and these problems were made worse when\nrates were at or near zero. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) explicitly\nstated its commitment to ample reserves in 2019, when we were gradually shrinking our\nbalance sheet, concluding that this approach would be used over the longer-run, and it\nsoon proved very useful when the pandemic again brought rates to zero.2\nAlthough these are two fundamentally different reasons for changing the size of\nour balance sheet, we did them more or less at the same time. This has caused confusion,\nwith some people thinking that the Fed is choosing to keep the balance sheet larger than it\nneeds to be. This confusion is amplified by the fact that there are external forces that\nhave boosted the size of our balance sheet that are not under the control of the Federal\nReserve. My goal today in this speech is to disentangle each of these forces and try to\ndemystify the role of our balance sheet in conducting monetary policy. I also want to\nclarify issues that are currently being discussed in the public domain. I agree that the\nbalance sheet needs to shrink but, as I will show, not by as much as some believe it\nshould. I will also explain why the composition of the balance sheet matters as much as\nits size and how changes are needed there as well.\n2 In January 2019 the FOMC released the\nStatement Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation and Balance Sheet Normalization, which is\navailable on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20190130c.htm\n\n- 3 -\nI know from teaching this topic over the years to my undergraduate students that\nunless you are an accountant or a banker, you would probably rather go to the dentist\nthan listen to a speech about the Fed’s balance sheet. I hope to explain it clearly enough\nthat you can leave here and engage in the public debate with a better understanding of the\nissues. To do so, the approach I want to take is the following. Suppose the Fed had\nnever used quantitative easing and simply decided to move to an ample-reserves system\nfrom a scarce-reserves system. How would the liability and asset sides of our balance\nsheet change in response to this one policy decision? After addressing this question, I\nwill then discuss how QE affects our balance sheet and also some difficult tradeoffs that\narise when engaging in QE.\nThe Big Three Liabilities\nFor any balance sheet, we start with the asset and liability entries. Assets are\nthings that are owned, and liabilities are things that are owed to others at a given point in\ntime. I will start by listing the big three liabilities on the Fed’s balance sheet and the\ncharacteristics of those liabilities. There are other types of liabilities (and capital) that\nmust be accounted for, but they are too small to matter for the policy matters I want to\ndiscuss, so I will ignore them. After discussing these “big three” liabilities, we can\nconsider what assets should be held to match those liabilities.\nThe first big liability of the Federal Reserve is currency outstanding. The Fed\nsupplies U.S. dollars elastically to the public, based on demand, distributing dollars\nthrough banks.3 That demand, which is not controlled by the Fed, is basically determined\n3 The Federal Reserve supplies currency on demand to ensure that commercial bank money trades one for\none with currency. This creates certainty that a customer’s demand to transform one unit of commercial\nbank money into a unit of currency will be met.\n\n- 4 -\nby how fast the economy—and thus the need for cash—is growing. At the end of 2024,\nthe amount of dollars in circulation was $2.3 trillion. That is up considerably from\naround $800 billion in 2007 after which the overall balance sheet began growing sharply.\nEven in terms of GDP, currency has increased, from 5.5 percent of GDP in 2007 to\nalmost 8 percent today. So, an important point that many do not realize is that the Fed’s\nbalance sheet has expanded, especially in nominal terms, from increased demand for U.S.\ncurrency.4\nWhat are the characteristics of currency as a liability? First, it is non-interest\nbearing. Second, it never “matures” as other debt obligations do. Let’s just say that\ncurrency is different from other liabilities—it pays no interest, and you never get back\nyour initial payment for acquiring it. If you come to the Fed and ask us to redeem a\ndollar bill, we will simply give you another dollar bill.\nThe second big liability is the Treasury General Account, or TGA. The Federal\nReserve is the fiscal agent of the U.S. Treasury, which means that we are the bank for the\nU.S. government and the TGA is the Treasury’s checking account. What are the\ncharacteristics of the TGA? First, it is a short-term liability that moves up and down as\ncash flows in and out of the account as the Treasury receives tax and other payments and\npays its bills. Second, we do not pay interest to the Treasury on its account balances.\nFinally, given the asynchronous timing of payments and receipts, the TGA can vary\nsignificantly, especially when the debt ceiling is binding. During 2024, it generally\n4 Judson (2024) estimates that a significant share of demand for U.S. currency comes from abroad,\nespecially in the $100 denomination; see Ruth Judson (2024), “Demand for U.S Banknotes at Home and\nAbroad: A Post-Covid Update,” International Finance Discussion Papers 1387 (Washington: Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System, March), https://doi.org/10.17016/IFDP.2024.1387.\n\n- 5 -\nfluctuated between about $650 billion and $950 billion, briefly peaking at around $960\nbillion during the April tax season. Due to this year’s debt ceiling constraint, the TGA\nfell from its 2024 average of $780 billion to about $325 billion recently, and with the\ndebt ceiling just increased, there will be a quick rebuild in the coming weeks. So, it is not\nunusual for the TGA to fluctuate by several hundred billion dollars. This situation is very\ndifferent than the one in 2007 when the TGA was deliberately held steady at $5 billion\neach day. This change reflects both how much federal spending has grown in that time\nand also a shift in accounting in 2015 to holding an estimated week’s worth of federal\npayments in the TGA—a decision made by the Treasury to better manage its cash flow.\nAn important point that applies to both currency and the TGA is that the Federal\nReserve does not have control over the size of these liabilities and hasn’t been\nresponsible for their sharp increases. Together, they represent about $3 trillion of our\n$6.7 trillion balance sheet, or roughly 10 percent of nominal gross domestic product. So,\nthe size of the Fed’s balance sheet, which is now about 22 percent of nominal GDP, is\nnearly half accounted for by these two liabilities that are not under the Fed’s control.\nThose who argue that the Fed could go back to 2007, when its total balance sheet was 6\npercent of GDP, fail to recognize that these two factors make it impossible.\nThe third big liability on the Fed’s balance sheet is reserves, which are the funds\nthat depository institutions hold in accounts at the Fed. In effect, these are the checking\naccount balances of the banking system that are held at the Federal Reserve. What is the\ncharacteristic of reserves held by banks? First, much like the TGA, they are short term in\nnature and very liquid—in effect like digital cash. They are the safest and most liquid\nasset in the financial system and used to conduct payments between banks. The reserve\n\n- 6 -\nbalances that an individual bank holds can increase or decrease, depending on the flow of\npayments between banks. Much like the TGA, an individual bank’s reserve holdings can\nbe volatile. But these payments do not change the total amount of reserves in the banking\nsystem—they simply transfer them from one bank to another. So, while reserve balances\nof individual banks can move around, total reserves are more stable, and the total amount\nof reserves in the system is directly controlled by the Federal Reserve. Second, in\nOctober 2008, Congress authorized the Federal Reserve to pay interest on these\nliabilities. Besides ending the implicit tax on banks for holding reserves, it was a step\naimed at helping the Fed conduct monetary policy effectively, which it does, but it is\nsometimes inaccurately criticized as a giveaway to banks. I will address this point a little\nlater. But I mention it here because the amount of reserves in the system affects the total\npayment flow the Fed must make to banks at the current interest rate on reserves.\nAssets Backing These Liabilities\nBy the definition of a balance sheet, these liabilities must be matched by assets\nheld by the Federal Reserve. Let’s consider matching assets to our currency liability. As\nI said earlier, currency pays no interest and never matures. So, we can hold assets of any\nmaturity length to offset our liability for currency. Since currency pays no interest, any\ninterest earned off these assets is pure profit. Given that longer-maturity assets generally\npay higher interest rates and are less volatile, it seems reasonable to hold longer maturity\nassets against our currency liability.\nNow consider the TGA liability. We also pay no interest on the TGA. But, unlike\ncurrency, a problem with the TGA is that it can vary substantially, which makes total\nreserves in the system more volatile. This link to reserves is because when tax payments\n\n- 7 -\nare made to the Treasury, we debit the payer’s bank reserves and credit the Treasury’s\nTGA account. When the Treasury makes a payment, we debit the TGA and credit the\nrecipient bank’s reserve account. Thus, volatile movements in the TGA affect the Fed’s\nreserve management policy. There are two ways to deal with this situation: hold a buffer\nof reserves to ensure movements in the TGA do not affect market liquidity or hold short-\nmaturity assets that we can expand or contract to sterilize movements in the TGA such\nthat total reserves in the banking system are unchanged.5 The first strategy suggests the\nbuffer stock of assets could take the form of somewhat longer maturity, while the second\nstrategy could require holding short-term assets that can easily be bought and sold with\nlittle interest rate risk.\nThat brings us to reserves. As I mentioned, reserves are a short-maturity liability\nwhich pay interest, which suggests that the Fed should consider holding short maturity\nassets against this liability. Treasury bills and short-maturity Treasury notes are the safest\nand most liquid assets, so it would make sense to hold them against reserves. If the\ninterest rate earned on our short maturity Treasury assets is very close to the interest we\npay on reserves, then our interest earnings from the Treasury are simply passed through\nto the banks. In this sense, our balance sheet is just another way to transfer interest\npayments on Treasury securities from the Treasury to the banks.6\nBecause of the minimal spread between these two short-term interest rates, banks\nare largely indifferent to either holding reserves or the short-term Treasury securities we\n5 For a discussion of the short-maturity assets approach, please see Annette Vissing-Jorgenson\n(forthcoming), “Fluctuations in the Treasury General Account and the Fed’s Balance Sheet,” FEDS Notes\n(Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System).\n6 For accounting purposes, our net interest income on these assets backing reserve balances would be near\nzero.\n\n- 8 -\nhold—both are highly liquid and pay roughly the same rate of return. But layer on top of\nthis the fact that reserves are a bit more liquid than Treasury securities because banks\ndon’t have to buy or sell the Treasury securities to get reserves, and banks are willing to\nhold a lot of reserves. Since the Fed supplies these reserves, one might ask what it costs\ntaxpayers to supply a large amount of reserves. From the Treasury’s point of view, its\ninterest expense is the same regardless of who holds the short-term Treasury securities.\nSo, the Fed can provide all the liquidity that banks need at zero marginal cost, which\nmakes me wonder why some want to make reserves scarce. I often use the following\nanalogy to drive this point home: If governments could provide clean, safe drinking water\nfor citizens at zero cost, why would they make it scarce?\nNow, one could ask why pay interest on reserves at all? Why not keep the interest\nincome generated on the assets we hold to back reserves and remit it back to the\nTreasury? This seems like a no brainer! But there are a few reasons that interest on\nreserves makes sense, including the following.\nFirst, paying interest on reserves that is commensurate to the rate paid on short-\nterm Treasury securities makes reserves attractive to banks, and holding reserves\nimproves the functioning of the financial system by giving banks more liquidity and\ngreater scope to settle payments in an orderly way. In contrast, if reserves bear no\ninterest, then commercial banks will have strong incentives to avoid holding a lot of\nreserves, and instead hold short-term, interest-bearing assets like Treasury bills. If banks\nmanaged their liquidity only by buying and selling Treasury securities, several banks\nselling Treasury securities at the same time could flood the market and put undesirable\nupward pressure on interest rates across the economy. An ample-reserves regime where\n\n- 9 -\nwe pay interest on reserves ensures that there are enough reserves in the banking system\nto avoid this kind of sell off in Treasury securities, helping to stabilize the financial\nsystem without any harm to banks or their customers.\nThe second part of the case for interest on reserves is that it isn’t costing taxpayers\nany money. As I noted earlier, whether the Fed or banks hold the Treasury securities, the\nTreasury is paying interest on its debt. And, if the Fed is holding the Treasury securities,\nthen the interest payment from the Treasury to the Fed on the Treasury bills is matched\nwith an interest payment from the Fed to banks on their reserves. So, paying interest on\nreserves is not creating any additional expense to the Treasury.\nBut what is the appropriate level of ample reserves the Fed is trying to get to?\nThere is no clear answer to this question and that is what we are trying to discern. We\nwant to provide the amount of liquidity necessary, but we don’t want to provide excessive\nliquidity that banks do not want or need.\nOne reason for increased demand for reserves is that since the Global Financial\nCrisis changes in banking regulations led to a large shift in demand for high-quality\nliquid assets. For example, bank liquidity regulations, such as the liquidity coverage\nratio, encouraged banks to hold high quality liquid assets. As these regulations came into\nplay, banks’ demand for high-quality liquid assets, including reserves, increased\ntremendously relative to 2007.\nI think of ample reserves as the threshold below which banks would need to\nscramble to find safe, liquid funding, something that would drive up the federal funds rate\nand money market interest rates across the economy. We have some experience with\ntesting the level of ample reserves during an episode of stress in the financial system that\n\n- 10 -\noccurred in 2019. At the start of that year, reserves stood at about 8 percent of nominal\nGDP, and we were continuing to reduce our balance sheet with no apparent stress among\nbanks or otherwise in the financial system. In September 2019, reserves fell below 7\npercent of nominal GDP, and stresses appeared in the financial system, requiring the Fed\nto step in and take action to add reserves. So, I start from the view that problems\nemerged when reserves fell below 8 percent of GDP. One might argue that banks are\nnow larger relative to GDP, so they may desire a bit more reserves. Furthermore, there is\nalso a genuine concern that it is not only the total amount of reserves that matters but also\nthe distribution of reserves across the banking system. So, I would add a buffer to the 8\npercent of GDP that I cited earlier and assume 9 percent is the threshold below which\nreserves would not be ample. That would mean, as of today, that $2.7 trillion of reserves\nis roughly ample—it could be more or less in practice, but let me use it as a benchmark.\nSo, putting the pieces of this hypothetical minimum balance sheet together, we\nhave an estimated $2.7 trillion in reserve balances, $2.3 trillion in currency, and an\naverage of $780 billion in TGA liabilities. This combined means the Fed should be\noperating with a balance sheet that is roughly $5.8 trillion dollars or 19 percent of GDP.\nClose to half of this proportional increase from 2007, as I noted, comes from currency\nand TGA growth outside the Fed's control, and the rest from a transition to an ample\nreserves regime that has been a necessary, efficient and more effective way of managing\nmonetary policy.\nIn summary, if we had simply adopted an ample reserves system and backed these\nliabilities as I suggested without engaging in quantitative easing, there are three key\ntakeaways: (1) we would be earning a net profit off of the assets backing currency and the\n\n- 11 -\nTGA, (2) the assets backing ample reserves would simply be a way to transfer interest\npayments to the banks, and (3) we would hold short to medium term assets that could be\nbought or sold to neutralize large movements in the TGA to keep total reserves stable.\nWith this balance sheet, the Federal Reserve would never run losses, the banks would\nhave ample liquidity for market functioning, and the Fed would not face serious interest\nrate risk on its asset holdings.\nToday’s Balance Sheet and Where We Are Heading\nAt this point there are going to be people somewhere shaking their fists and\nyelling that what I have said is simply false because the Federal Reserve is currently\nlosing money on its balance sheet. Our interest expense on reserves is now exceeding our\ninterest income on our asset holdings. This is all true. But this outcome is because of\nengaging in QE for many years since 2007, not because we are running an ample reserves\nsystem. Remember, what I have described so far is what an optimally designed balance\nsheet would look like if we had never engaged in QE and simply moved to an ample-\nreserves system.\nLet me now do the following. Assume we have a balance sheet that corresponds\nto an ample-reserves system, but now the Fed engages in QE as a means of conducting\nmonetary policy to support the economy.\nThe Federal Reserve engaged in QE programs when the policy rate was driven\ndown to zero because of severe shocks to the economy after the Global Financial Crisis\nand then because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Once the policy rate is at zero, the Federal\nReserve is constrained in its ability to use its traditional tools to provide further support\nfor the economy. The idea of QE is to buy longer-duration securities as opposed to short-\n\n- 12 -\nduration assets. By increasing the demand for long-dated securities, the Fed drives up the\nprice and drives down the yield on those securities. By lowering longer-term yields the\nFed is able to loosen financing conditions to stimulate aggregate demand. The Fed\ntypically buys longer-dated Treasury securities during QE, but it also bought agency\nmortgage-backed securities that have the implicit backing of the U.S. Treasury and are\nissued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two government-sponsored enterprises.\nQE affects our balance sheet in material ways that differ from what happens if one\nis simply constructing the balance sheet to support ample reserves, currency, and the\nTGA. First, it increases the duration of our balance sheet beyond what we would hold\njust for currency. Longer-duration assets are more prone to interest rate risk, and the\nlower the interest rates on those assets, the lower interest income the Fed will receive far\ninto the future. If interest rates rise suddenly or over time as the economy recovers, those\nassets lose value (in substantial amounts), which lowers the unrealized value of our\nportfolio. Second, we use short-term reserves to buy the longer duration assets which\nleads to a maturity mismatch between our assets and our liabilities. So, the additional\nreserves that are injected from QE may not be costless when short-term rates rise, as they\ndid in 2022, meaning that interest paid on those additional reserves will exceed what is\nearned on the long-term assets that were purchased with them.\nThis effect highlights the fact that engaging in QE involves a tradeoff for the\nFederal Reserve—trying to support the economy in serious economic downturns at the\nzero lower bound while creating a maturity mismatch between our assets and liabilities\nthat brings interest rate risk onto our balance sheet. This tradeoff does not happen if we\nsimply structure our balance sheet to support an ample-reserves system. The decision to\n\n- 13 -\nengage in QE requires the Federal Reserve to weigh the benefits and costs from this\naction. Those benefits and costs are often difficult to quantify at the time QE is\nundertaken. It is only with hindsight that we can fully assess them, which is one of the\nchallenges of making policy in real time.\nWhere do we stand today? The Federal Reserve is operating with an abundant, or\nmore than ample, level of reserves, and our securities holdings are tilted toward longer-\ndated maturities. We are shrinking the balance sheet to get back to a size consistent with\nan ample reserves system. As of last month, banks had nearly $3.4 trillion of reserves\nwith the Fed, accounting for about 11 percent of nominal GDP.7 Given my rough\nestimate of the level of reserves needed to be ample, I believe we can likely continue to\nlet a share of maturing and prepaying securities roll off our balance sheet for some time,\nreducing reserve balances. Of course, we will continue to carefully monitor financial\nmarkets as we go.\nFor me, the bigger problem with our balance sheet is that the maturity structure of\nour assets to support an ample-reserves system is not well matched. We have far too\nmany long-term assets on our balance sheet relative to my arguments for how to structure\nthe balance sheet. I argued that long-term assets should only be held against currency\nliabilities, which are $2.3 trillion. But we hold about $2.3 trillion in agency mortgage-\nbacked securities alone! So the duration of our asset portfolio is far too long for the\nliabilities we need to hold for an ample-reserves system.\nIf the Fed moved forward with a maturity-matching strategy as I suggest, it would\nhold about half of its Treasury securities in shorter-dated bills. There have been some\n7 As I noted, there will be a replenishing of the TGA in coming weeks. This action will reduce reserves\ncommensurately.\n\n- 14 -\nadvocates who support moving toward the Federal Reserve having a Treasury securities\nportfolio whose composition mimics the breakdown, or “universe,” of total Treasury\nsecurities outstanding. This would mean having about 20 percent of our current balance\nsheet in bills. The argument for this maturity structure is that with this approach, the\nFed’s holdings would not be putting pressure on any one segment of the yield curve.\nThis is a valid argument, but it would put more duration on our balance sheet and expose\nthe Fed to potential income losses, as we have witnessed the past few years. Maybe that\nis a tradeoff we should make to avoid distorting our demand for Treasury securities\nrelative to the market’s demand. In the end, I support continuing the conversation about\nwhat the ultimate composition should be. My objective today was to try to clarify what\nan ample-reserves balance sheet should look like as a starting point for this conversation.\nIn the years ahead, moving our portfolio toward shorter-duration securities will be\na slow process unless we were to take the dramatic step of selling existing securities to\nreplace them with Treasury bills. When reserves hit their desired ample level and we\nneed to increase securities holdings in line with growth in autonomous factors, like\ncurrency and the TGA, we can actively accumulate bills, if we do not take other actions\nsooner.\nI hope that taking a deep dive into a few line items on the Fed’s balance sheet has\nhelped to see some issues that lie ahead. Though the FOMC has not finalized its desired\nefficient and effective size and composition of the balance sheet, it seems apparent that\ntoday’s portfolio should be adjusted. And there are obvious steps to take. We are\nreducing the size of the balance sheet slowly and need to consider shifting it toward more\n\n- 15 -\nbills. As we do so, we should do it gradually and predictably, so the markets and public\nare fully aware of our actions.i\ni On July 10, 2025, a typo was corrected in this sentence to change \"reserves\" to \"Treasury securities\":\n\"And, if the Fed is holding the Treasury securities, then the interest payment from the Treasury to the Fed\non the Treasury bills is matched with an interest payment from the Fed to banks on their reserves.\"",

Waller\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Assessing the Effectiveness of Monetary Policy during and after the COVID-19 Pandemic”\n2025 IJCB Research Conference, hosted by\nthe Czech National Bank and the International Journal of Central Banking\nPrague, Czech Republic\nJune 23, 2025\n\nThank you, Aleš, and thank you to the Czech National Bank (CNB) for hosting\nthis year’s conference. The CNB also supported this conference in 2017. It is wonderful\nto have such a great relationship between the International Journal of Central Banking\n(IJCB) and one of our sponsoring institutions.\nI would like to take a few minutes as the outgoing managing editor of the IJCB to\nemphasize the importance of this journal and the research it supports.1 Central banks\nplay an important role promoting the growth and effective functioning of their\neconomies, and many of the decisions they make are influenced by careful and cutting-\nedge research. In fact, I recently gave a speech that discussed the importance of\neconomic research in monetary policy decisions.2 The IJCB, through this conference and\nits volumes, provides an outlet to share and disseminate research that adds to public\nknowledge and understanding and informs the operational and policy decisions of central\nbankers.\nThe value of central bank–focused research has long been known. In the summer\nof 2004, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the European Central Bank, and\nthe Group of Ten central banks agreed to support the development of the IJCB to focus\non the theory and practice of central banking. The journal has attracted distinguished\nmanaging editors, including my colleagues from the Federal Reserve; my immediate\npredecessor, Luc Laeven, from the European Central Bank; and the current managing\neditor, Antoine Martin, from the Swiss National Bank, who, unfortunately, could not be\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 See Christopher J. Waller (2025), “The Role of Economic Research in Central Banking,” speech delivered\nat the award ceremony for the winners of the Bank Al-Maghrib Prize for Economic and Financial Research,\nBank of Al-Maghrib, Rabat, Morocco, May 14,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250514a.htm.\n\n- 2 -\nhere today. We have the strong support now of nearly 55 sponsoring institutions,\nincluding the Czech National Bank and also the host of last year’s conference, the Central\nBank of Italy. Among the ways that central banks serve the public interest is as an\nongoing source of economic research, and the strong commitment to the IJCB here in\nPrague and other capitals advances our collective interest in strong economies and\nfinancial stability.\nTurning to this year’s conference, we chose the theme based on events that have\nbeen very much on the minds of central bankers: “Assessing the Effectiveness of\nMonetary Policy during and after the COVID-19 Pandemic.” The past several years have\nseen significant monetary policy actions across the globe in response to COVID‐19–\ninduced recessions, inflation higher than in several decades, unprecedented supply chain\ndisruptions, and, in some countries, very tight labor markets. Early on, policymakers’\nresponses appeared quite in sync, but with differing speeds of recovery and varying\nchallenges faced by different types of economies, that changed over time. Additionally,\ngeopolitical tensions and energy price shocks have introduced new complexities. So we\nthought this conference could be a good place to come together and hear about the\nlessons we have learned from these common and different experiences.\nToday and tomorrow we will be discussing the yield curve, policy rules, and\nmonetary policy transmission. We also will look into banking issues such as loan\nissuance and financial stability. And we are lucky to have the Fed’s Vice Chair for\nSupervision Miki Bowman here to give a keynote speech. As we go through these\nsessions, I hope we will all ask ourselves how this work can help policymakers do their\n\n- 3 -\njobs better. Through our conversation, I would ask you to share knowledge about each of\nthese topics as they are pertinent around the world.\nBut before we get to those presentations, and what I hope will be vigorous\ndiscussion, let me recognize several people who made this event possible. Here at the\nCNB, Simona Malovaná and Martin Hodula helped organize this conference. Year\nround, the IJCB co-editors devote many hours of their time to review papers to keep the\njournal at its high-quality and high-impact status. These individuals are Ana Babus,\nDiana Bonfim, Huberto Ennis, Carlos Garriga (who is here with us today), Refet\nGürkaynak, Òscar Jordà, Robin Lumsdaine, Fernanda Nechio, Steven Ongena, and\nEnrico Sete. Finally, for the past three years, the day-to-day smooth running of the\njournal couldn’t have been accomplished without the editorial team at the BIS and the\nBoard of Governors. A special thank you goes to my team: Kommaly Dias, Jane Ihrig,\nand Elie Singer, who worked to oversee the process.\nAnd with that, I will step away from the microphone and put the spotlight where it\nshould be, on the scholars presenting their work today. Thank you, and I believe Martin\nhas a few words to get us started.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n6:30 p.m. EDT\nJuly 17, 2025\nThe Case for Cutting Now\nRemarks by\nChristopher J. Waller\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nMoney Marketeers of New York University\nNew York, New York\nJuly 17, 2025\n\nThank you, John, and thank you for the invitation to speak to you today.\nMy purpose this evening is to explain why I believe that the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC) should reduce our policy rate by 25 basis points at our next\nmeeting.1 I used to tell my junior research colleagues that presentations are not murder\nmysteries—just tell the audience up front “who did it” by telling them the main point. So\nlet me follow my own advice and state up front the reasons I believe we should cut the\npolicy rate at our meeting in two weeks.\nFirst, tariffs are one-off increases in the price level and do not cause inflation\nbeyond a temporary surge. Standard central banking practice is to “look through” such\nprice-level effects as long as inflation expectations are anchored, which they are.\nSecond, a host of data argues that monetary policy should be close to neutral, not\nrestrictive. Real gross domestic product (GDP) growth was likely around 1 percent in the\nfirst half of this year and is expected to remain soft for the rest of 2025, much lower than\nthe median of FOMC participants’ estimates of longer-run GDP growth. Meanwhile, the\nunemployment rate is 4.1 percent, near the Committee’s longer-run estimate, and\nheadline inflation is close to our target at just slightly above 2 percent if we put aside\ntariff effects that I believe will be temporary. Taken together, the data imply the policy\nrate should be around neutral, which the median of FOMC participants estimates is\n3 percent, and not where we are—1.25 to 1.50 percentage points above 3 percent.\nMy final reason to favor a cut now is that while the labor market looks fine on the\nsurface, once we account for expected data revisions, private-sector payroll growth is\nnear stall speed, and other data suggest that the downside risks to the labor market have\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nincreased. With inflation near target and the upside risks to inflation limited, we should\nnot wait until the labor market deteriorates before we cut the policy rate.\nLet me explain my reasoning by starting with my view of economic activity.\nGiven the ups and downs of monthly indicators of GDP this year, we can best get a view\nof the performance of the economy by combining the first- and second-quarter numbers.\nWith the data in hand, estimates suggest that real GDP increased at an annual rate of\nabout 1 percent in the first half of this year, compared with 2.8 percent in the second half\nof 2024. That comparison is important not only for the extent of the slowdown, which is\nconsiderable, but also because it is well below most estimates of the potential growth rate\nof the economy. Based on forward-looking indicators, I don’t expect a rebound in the\nsecond half—in fact, most forecasts suggest that real GDP growth will remain around\n1 percent at an annual rate. While the recent tax bill has a significant number of elements\nthat will spur economic growth in the future, not much of those effects will show up\nthis year.\nThe slowdown in GDP is evident in consumer spending, which constitutes about\ntwo-thirds of economic activity. After hovering near 3 percent last year, real personal\nconsumption expenditures (PCE) growth is estimated to have stepped down to 1 percent\nin the first half of this year. This morning the Commerce Department announced June\nretail sales. The data are consistent with this forecast, as the increase is on the heels of a\ncouple of soft monthly readings. As we move forward this year, consumer spending is\nexpected to continue to grow at a similar pace, tempered by the expected slowing in\ngrowth of real disposable income because of the temporary effects of tariff increases. I\n\n- 3 -\nwill say more about tariffs when I discuss inflation, but in assessing the near-term\nmomentum of the economy, tariffs could well be a factor.\nTurning to the “soft” data, this picture of declining momentum is consistent with\nwhat I am hearing from my business contacts and other sources. The Fed’s July 16th\nBeige Book reported mixed evidence on economic activity across Federal Reserve\nDistricts, with 5 reporting slight or modest gains and the remaining 7 having flat or\ndeclining activity.2 This mixed news is also found in surveys of purchasing managers\nwhere there is a continuing contraction in manufacturing and a slight expansion in\nnonmanufacturing activity. Given that firms outside manufacturing represent the large\nmajority of businesses, this implies a modest expansion in activity.\nNow let’s talk about the labor market. The headline numbers from the June jobs\nreport looked reassuring—the unemployment rate stands at 4.1 percent, within the range\nit has been for the past year, and payroll gains were reported as 147,000, essentially the\nsame as in May. But looking a little deeper, I see reasons to be concerned. Half of the\npayroll gain came from state and local government, a sector of employment that is\nnotoriously difficult to seasonally adjust this time of year. In contrast, private payroll\nemployment grew just 74,000, a much smaller gain than in the previous two months, and\nthat is consistent with other surveys you might have read about that found a drop in\nprivate-sector employment.3 I focus on private-sector employment not only because it is\nthe lion’s share of employment, but also because it is a better guide to the cyclical\nmovement in employment than counting public and private sector together. As I used to\n2 The Fed’s Beige Books are available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/publications/beige-book-default.htm.\n3 The employment services firm ADP reported that private sector employment declined by 33,000 in June.\n\n- 4 -\ntell my students, the Federal Reserve’s job should be to maximize private-sector\nemployment, not government employment.\nAnd there is another reason to cite the slowdown in private-sector hiring. A\npattern in data revisions in recent years tells us that the private payroll data are being\noverestimated and will be revised down significantly when the benchmark revision\noccurs in early 2026. Accounting for the anticipated revision to the level of employment\nin March 2025 and extrapolating forward, private-sector employment gains last month\nwere much closer to zero.4 This is why I say private-sector payroll gains are near stall\nspeed and flashing red.\nThis is only one month of data, I realize, and one possible factor in the slowdown\nin private-sector hiring could be a deceleration in net immigration this year, although it\nwill take time to get a clear picture of how immigration is affecting employment. But\nother data support the idea of a slowdown in hiring. There are widespread media reports\nof the difficulty new college graduates are encountering in finding jobs, and, in fact, the\nunemployment rate for new grads is at a 10-year high, far above the level before the\npandemic.5\nLooking across the soft and hard data, I get a picture of a labor market on the\nedge. The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey reports continued low rates of firing\nbut also low rates of hiring. I suspect this is a hangover of a labor market that was very\n4 My estimate of the anticipated revision is based on the difference between the currently published level of\npayroll employment and the count of employment from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages\n(QCEW), which is used to benchmark the payroll employment figures. The QCEW data, which are\ncurrently available through 2024:Q4, suggest that the monthly change in payroll employment has been\noverstated by roughly 60,000 per month since March 2024.\n5 See Federal Reserve Bank of New York (2025), “The Labor Market for Recent College Graduates,”\nwebpage, https://nyfed.org/collegelabor. Through March, college-educated workers aged 22 to 27 had an\nunemployment rate of 5.8 percent, up steadily since mid-2022 and far above the 3.6 percent rate in\nJanuary 2020.\n\n- 5 -\ntight after the pandemic, leaving employers resistant to let go of qualified workers for\nfear of renewed labor shortages. That said, purchasing managers report caution and even\nsome pauses on hiring. The June 4th Beige Book reported declining labor demand in\nevery single Federal Reserve District, and the July 16th Beige Book emphasized that labor\ndemand continued to be less than labor supply in many industries. With hiring already\nlow, at a certain point, declining demand would overcome any instinct to hold on to\nworkers, and if that attitude does shift, it implies that a larger and more sudden reduction\nin payrolls and an increase in the unemployment rate are a risk.\nTo sum up here, I see the hard and soft data on economic activity and the labor\nmarket as consistent: The economy is still growing, but its momentum has slowed\nsignificantly, and the risks to the FOMC’s employment mandate have increased.\nLet’s turn to the inflation data. In the past two days, we received June consumer\nand producer price data that give us a good idea of the inflation rate based on PCE, the\nFOMC’s benchmark for monetary policy. After several months of readings that moved\nthe 12-month inflation rate closer to the FOMC’s target, the consumer price index and the\nproducer price index suggest that total PCE inflation moved up to around 2.5 percent in\nJune, and core inflation likewise rose to roughly 2.7 percent. I believe these data reflect\nsome modest effect from tariff increases, which began in February, and I believe there are\nfurther tariff-induced increases to inflation to come later this year, with the asterisk that\nthere remains a lot of uncertainty about how trade agreements or escalations in trade\nconflicts may affect that outcome.\nTo understand how tariffs are affecting prices, I have been following not only the\nBureau of Labor Statistics monthly data, but also studies of high frequency price data.\n\n- 6 -\nFor example, some researchers this year are tracking the short-run price impact of tariffs\non goods prices in real time by examining product-level price data from online stores of\nlarge U.S. retailers.6 Using data through mid-July, they find that, on net, imported goods\nprices have increased modestly while domestic goods prices are little changed. Looking\nacross country of origin, Chinese goods imports have seen the most persistent and steady\nprice increases. That said, to date, the data point to very small goods price increases\nrelative to the size of the tariff rates.\nThis finding is consistent with my view that a large share of tariff increases won’t\nbe passed through to consumers. My presumption has been that consumers will have to\npay about one-third of the price increases from higher tariffs, with the remainder split\nbetween foreign suppliers and U.S. importers. So if there is a permanent increase to\nimport tariffs of about 10 percent, I expect this will raise PCE inflation three-tenths of 1\npercent this year, and that this increase would fade over the next year or so.7\nI can think of a couple of other reasons that may limit the impact on consumers.\nThe first is that the slowing down of the rollout of many tariffs, with multiple\npostponements for continuing negotiations, may be giving U.S. importers time to\nsubstitute finished or intermediate goods to domestic suppliers or foreign sources subject\nto lower tariffs. A second reason is that, faced with the slowing economy that I have\ndescribed and the likelihood that tariffs will be weighing on consumer spending, foreign\n6 For a discussion of the methodology by Cavallo, Llamas, and Vazquez, see Alberto Cavallo, Paola\nLlamas, and Franco Vazquez (2025), “Tracking the Short-Run Price Impact of U.S. Tariffs,” working paper\n(Cambridge, Mass.: HBS Pricing Lab, July),\nhttps://www.pricinglab.org/files/TrackingTariffs_Cavallo_Llamas_Vazquez.pdf. And updates of the price\ndata can be found on the HBS Pricing Lab website at https://www.pricinglab.org/tariff-tracker.\n7 For a full rationale of this estimate, see Christopher J. Waller (2025), “The Effects of Tariffs on the Three\nI’s: Inflation, Inflation Persistence, and Inflation Expectations,” speech delivered at “Structural Shifts and\nMonetary Policy,” 2025 Bank of Korea International Conference, Bank of Korea, Seoul, South Korea,\nJune 1, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250601a.htm.\n\n- 7 -\nproducers and importers may be finding ways to hold the line on prices to maintain their\npresence on store shelves and hold on to customers. In fact, slowing demand increases\ncompetition for all firms, and consumers may benefit. Finally, despite all of the\ndiscussion of supply chain disruptions, tariff effects on supply chains are completely\ndifferent than what happened during the pandemic. In the pandemic, supply chains were\nactually broken: Many workers were not working, factories were idle, and waves of\nCOVID were hitting at asynchronous times across the globe. In contrast, in the case of\nthe higher tariffs, we know exactly where things are being produced, and nothing is\nbroken—firms are simply arguing about prices and who will eat the tariffs. Once that\ngets resolved, goods will flow naturally across the globe but potentially using different\nroutes.\nIt is possible, of course, that tariffs may have a larger effect on inflation than I\nexpect, but that won’t affect my view of the implications for monetary policy. As I have\nsaid many times, tariff increases are a one-time boost to prices that do not sustainably\nincrease inflation. In the absence of an unanchoring of inflation expectations and an\nacceleration of wage growth, which we have not seen, tariffs won’t and can’t\npermanently increase the inflation rate. What does this mean for monetary policy?\nResearch shows that central bankers should—and, in fact, do—look through price-level\nshocks to avoid needlessly tightening policy in times like these and damaging the\neconomy.8\n8 Edward Nelson documents central banks’ views of various price shocks. As long as inflation expectations\nare anchored, both nominal wage growth and inflation in the post-shock period should be able to continue\nat pre-shock rates, as neither has been upset by a rise in inflation expectations, and output and employment\ncan also grow along paths that are undisturbed by the shock. See Edward Nelson (2025), “A Look Back at\n‘Look Through,’ ” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2025-037 (Washington: Board of Governors\nof the Federal Reserve System, May), https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/a-look-back-at-look-\nthrough.htm.\n\n- 8 -\nThe key question for monetary policy right now is what we can discern about the\nunderlying rate of inflation—that is, the rate excluding tariffs—based on the\nfundamentals of the economy. Federal Reserve Board staff has done work to try to\nestimate tariff effects on PCE prices.9 Using that methodology, if I subtract estimated\ntariff effects from the reported inflation data, I find the inflation numbers for the past few\nmonths would have been quite close to our 2 percent goal. You’re not going to hear\n“mission accomplished” from me, but what this tells me is that underlying inflation has\nbeen lower than what is reported and close to our objective.\nBesides tariffs, I don’t expect an undesirable, sustained increase in inflation from\nother forces. Among the reasons for this are that the rate of growth in labor\ncompensation is down considerably in the past year or two, and, with the softening labor\nmarket, I do not expect workers will be able to get large wage increases going forward.\nCombining this with solid rates of productivity growth implies inflation should continue\naround 2 percent.\nTwo more points support my inflation outlook, and I will only summarize them\nhere since I discussed them at length in my June outlook speech.10 The first addresses\nthe question of whether I could be making the same kind of mistake my FOMC\ncolleagues and I made in 2021 and 2022 in expecting inflation increases to be only\ntransitory when they turned out to be persistent. But unlike then, there is no pandemic\ndisrupting labor, goods, and services supply around the world, and economic growth is\n9 For a detailed discussion of the methodology to detect tariff effects on inflation, see Robbie Minton and\nMariano Somale (2025), “Detecting Tariff Effects on Consumer Prices in Real Time,” FEDS Notes\n(Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, May 9),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/detecting-tariff-effects-on-consumer-prices-in-\nreal-time-20250509.html.\n10 See Waller, “The Effects of Tariffs on the Three I’s,” in note 7.\n\n- 9 -\nnow slow and slowing, rather than expanding rapidly. These differences bring me to the\nsecond point, which is that unlike in 2021 and 2022, when expectations of future inflation\nrose, today the measures of expectations I watch remain firmly anchored.11\nTo sum up, tariffs have boosted, and will continue to boost, inflation a bit above\nthe FOMC’s 2 percent objective this year, but policy should look through tariff effects\nand focus on underlying inflation, which seems to be close to the FOMC’s 2 percent goal,\nand I do not see any concern for forces driving it persistently higher.\nAs I hope will be evident by now, the evidence of a slowing economy, and all the\nfactors I have cited weighing on economic activity, mean that the risks to the FOMC’s\nemployment mandate are greater, and sufficient to warrant an adjustment in the stance of\nmonetary policy. Based on June’s Summary of Economic Projections, the current target\nrange for the federal funds rate of 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent is 125 to 150 basis points above\nthe participants’ median estimates of the longer-run federal funds rate of 3 percent.\nWhile I sometimes hear the view that policy is only modestly restrictive, this is not my\ndefinition of “modestly.”\nIn fact, the distance that must be traveled to reach a neutral policy setting weighs\nheavily on my judgment that the time has come to resume moving in that direction. In\nJune, a majority of FOMC participants believed it would be appropriate to reduce our\npolicy rate at least two times in 2025, and there are four meetings left. I also believe—\nand I hope the case I have made is convincing—that the risks to the economy are\nweighted toward cutting sooner rather than later. If the slowing of economic and\nemployment growth were to accelerate and warrant moving toward a more neutral setting\n11 I consider survey-based measures of inflation expectations unreliable, and the market-based measures\nthat I watch have remained firmly anchored.\n\n- 10 -\nmore quickly, then waiting until September or even later in the year would risk us falling\nbehind the curve of appropriate policy. However, if we cut our target range in July and\nsubsequent employment and inflation data point toward fewer cuts, we would have the\noption of holding policy steady for one or more meetings.\nFor this reason, I believe it makes sense to cut the FOMC’s policy rate by 25 basis\npoints two weeks from now. And looking to later this year, if, as I expect, underlying\ninflation remains in check—with headline inflation data reporting modest, temporary\nincreases from tariffs that are not unanchoring inflation expectations—and the economy\ncontinues to grow slowly, I would support further 25 basis point cuts to move monetary\npolicy toward neutral.",

Waller\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n2024 International Journal of Central Banking Conference\nRome, Italy\nJune 24, 2024\n\nThank you, Stefano, and thank you to the Central Bank of Italy (CBI) for hosting\nthis year's conference.\nWhen it is in the news, central banking often looks like the work of individual\npolicymakers handing down their decisions. In fact, it is a team effort of many people\nworking together, and that is also the case for editing the International Journal of Central\nBanking (IJCB) and planning this conference. I have a long list of people to thank who\ndid the lion's share of that work during the year that I have served as managing editor.\nBut for those who may not know it, let me first review the history of the journal and then\ndiscuss what this conference will address.\nIn the summer of 2004, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the\nEuropean Central Bank, and the Group of Ten central banks agreed to support the\ndevelopment of a new publication focused on the theory and practice of central banking.\nWe didn’t launch this journal because there was a shortage of research on central banking\nor of journals eager to publish it. Far from it. Central bankers themselves continue to\npublish peer-reviewed research in leading journals, not to mention many working papers\npublished by central banks and other outlets. This work was prevalent, but there was a\nsense that there lacked a place for scholarly research that focused exclusively on central\nbanking and could serve as a forum for the community of central bankers around the\nworld. The creation of the International Journal of Central Banking filled this deficit.\nThe primary objectives of the IJCB are to widely disseminate the best policy-\nrelevant and applied research on central banking and to promote communication among\nresearchers inside and outside central banks. We do this with publication of the journal,\nwhich will now be coming out six times a year, and with the added attention of this\n\n- 2 -\nconference, which presents research on timely policy topics. The journal has attracted\ndistinguished managing editors, including my colleagues from the Federal Reserve and\nmy immediate predecessor, Luc Laeven from the European Central Bank. We have the\nstrong support now of nearly 55 sponsoring institutions, including the Central Bank of\nItaly and also the host of last year’s conference, the Central Bank of Ireland.\nIn 2023, we chose the theme for this year’s conference based on events very much\non the minds of central bankers: “The Transmission of Monetary Policy in the Post-\nPandemic World.” Many things changed both during COVID and after. First, there was\nan unprecedented fiscal and monetary policy response to the pandemic. Second,\nstructural changes have occurred, including supply chain issues and shifts in the\norganization of work. Finally, economies have been grappling with elevated inflation.\nThis economic environment has raised several policy questions that the papers presented\nhere attempt to answer. These are questions that policymakers, including those here\ntoday, must grapple with, even when the answers are far from apparent. Academic\nresearch provides insights into these questions and possible answers, ways to analyze the\ndata, and the foundations for testing theories with economic models.\nThe papers presented here today and tomorrow are ideal examples of the kind of\nwork that can help policymakers do their jobs better, and can facilitate the sharing of\nknowledge around the world. We have sessions on how firms’ balance sheets,\nhouseholds’ savings and borrowing decisions, as well as supply chains, influence\nmonetary policy transmission. We also will look into financial market impacts and labor\nmarket considerations of the current policy environment.\n\n- 3 -\nBefore we get to those presentations, and what I hope will be vigorous\ndiscussions, let me recognize several people who made this event possible. Here at the\nCBI, Stefano and Enrico Sette helped organize this conference. Enrico is a co-editor of\nthe IJCB. Let me mention the other co-editors: Ana Babus, Diana Bonfim, Huberto\nEnnis, Carlos Garriga, Refet Gürkaynak, Òscar Jordà, Robin Lumsdaine, Fernanda\nNechio, and Steven Ongena. This conference and the day-to-day smooth running of the\njournal couldn't be accomplished without the editorial team at the BIS and the Board of\nGovernors. A special thank you goes to Kommaly Dias and Jessica Flagg from my staff.\nAnd, finally, a big thank you to my adviser Jane Ihrig, who does so much for me and who\nworked to oversee the process at the IJCB this past year.\nAnd with that, I will step away from the microphone and put the spotlight where it\nshould be, on the scholars presenting their work today. Thank you.",

Waller\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Structural Shifts and Monetary Policy”\n2025 Bank of Korea International Conference\nBank of Korea\nSeoul, South Korea\nJune 1, 2025\n\nThank you to the conference organizers for inviting me to speak today. I have\nattended this conference several times and I’m honored to be on the program this year.\nToday, I will speak on the U.S. economic outlook and the implications for monetary\npolicy.1 I will focus my comments on two issues: first, the effects of tariffs on inflation\npersistence, and second, the divergence of household inflation expectations and financial\nmarket measures of inflation expectations.\nThe theme of this conference is structural shifts and monetary policy. The key\nstructural shift that is affecting the economies of both the United States and South Korea\nis the recent change in U.S. trade policy, and a substantial share of my remarks will\naddress how this shift is affecting the U.S. outlook.\nThe variability in tariff announcements this year, including the whipsawing of\ncourt rulings and doubling of metal tariffs last week, has created considerable uncertainty\nabout where trade policy will settle. In mid-April, based on how things looked at the\ntime, I proposed two scenarios to consider in framing an outlook and a preferred stance of\nmonetary policy: a large tariff scenario and a smaller tariff scenario.2 In both cases, I\nassumed that the tariff increases would lead to a one-time boost to prices that would\ntemporarily raise inflation, after which inflation would return to its underlying rate. This\ntemporary increase could play out with a prompt rise in inflation that could recede\nquickly, or it could occur more gradually with a more modest increase that would recede\nmore slowly. As I will explain, crucial to this judgment is my assumption that longer-\nterm inflation expectations remain anchored.\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 See Waller (2025) A Tale of Two Outlooks:\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250414a.htm\n\n- 2 -\nThe large-tariff scenario I described assumed an average, trade-weighted tariff for\ngoods imports of 25 percent, which is close to where things stood after the 90-day tariff\nsuspensions announced April 9, and my scenario assumed that this would remain in place\nfor some time. In that case, I argued that inflation based on the personal consumption\nexpenditures (PCE) price index could reach a peak of 5 percent on an annualized basis\nthis year if businesses passed through all of the tariff costs to consumers. If firms\nabsorbed some of the tariff increase, then inflation might peak around 4 percent. I also\nargued that an economic slowdown from these higher costs could push the\nunemployment rate up from 4.2 percent to 5 percent next year.\nThe smaller-tariff scenario assumed a 10 percent average tariff on goods imports\nwould remain in place but that higher country and sector specific tariffs would be\nnegotiated down over time. In this case, inflation may rise to 3 percent on an annualized\nbasis and then dissipate. Growth in output and employment would slow, with the\nunemployment rate rising but probably not as high as 5 percent.\nReported progress on trade negotiations since that speech leaves my base case\nsomewhere in between these two scenarios. The temporary reduction in China tariffs has\nsignificantly decreased the trade-weighted average tariff, since China supplied about 13\npercent of U.S. goods imports in 2024. But that reduction is only temporary and is due to\nincrease if a trade agreement is not reached by August 12. Meanwhile, tariffs on other\ncountries were temporarily lowered to 10 percent, but it is unclear where they will end\nup. Furthermore, the Administration continues to say that it plans additional tariffs on\nspecific industries and sectors of the economy. Last week’s court decisions declaring a\nlarge share of tariffs illegal introduce additional uncertainty, but there seem to be multiple\n\n- 3 -\noptions for maintaining tariffs, so I will stick with an estimated trade weighted tariff right\nnow of 15 percent on U.S. goods imports, which falls in between my large- and smaller-\ntariff scenarios. I see the risks of my large tariff scenario having gone down, but there is\nstill considerable uncertainty about the ultimate levels, and thus about the impact on the\neconomic outlook.\nThe context for this uncertainty about tariffs is that hard data on the fundamentals\nof the economy lately has been mostly positive and supportive of the Federal Open\nMarket Committee’s (FOMC) economic objectives. There is very little evidence of the\neffect of trade policy in this data on inflation or economic activity through April, but that\nmay change in the coming weeks. In comparison, there is evidence of tariff effects in the\n“soft data” based on surveys of consumers, businesses, and investors—indications of an\nexpected slowdown in economic activity and an increase in prices. As of today, I see\ndownside risks to economic activity and employment and upside risks to inflation in the\nsecond half of 2025, but how these risks evolve is strongly tied to how trade policy\nevolves.\nA careful examination of the hard data on overall economic activity through April\nshows it has been, on balance, positive. I say this because, while real gross domestic\nproduct contracted slightly in the first quarter, private domestic final demand, a measure\nof spending by consumers and businesses, grew at a healthy annual rate of 2.5 percent in\nthe quarter. Of course, economic policy uncertainty among businesses is very elevated,\nand this has affected measures of sentiment and confidence for consumers and\nbusinesses, which fell to historically low levels in April. One index of this policy\nuncertainty compiled from newspaper stories, government reports, and the dispersion of\n\n- 4 -\nthe forecasts of private-sector economists rose in April to nearly twice the level seen\nduring the pandemic and the Global Financial Crisis.3 However, consumer sentiment\nrebounded with the announcement that the China tariffs had been lowered temporarily.\nAnd households’ spending should continue to be supported by income from the resilient\nlabor market. In addition, my business contacts have told me that, because of tariff\nuncertainty, their investment plans are currently on hold but are not canceled. So we may\nsee a slowdown in investment in the near term but a jump back up later this year.\nWherever things end up on a continuum between my “large” and “smaller”\nscenarios, I do expect tariffs will result in an increase in the unemployment rate that will,\nall else equal, probably linger. Higher tariffs will reduce spending, and businesses will\nrespond, in part, by reducing production and payrolls.\nWe won’t get the jobs report for May until this Friday, but the consensus\nexpectation is that employers added 130,000 jobs and that the unemployment rate\nremained steady at 4.2 percent. We have seen a reduction in wage pressures over recent\nmonths, and the ratio of job vacancies to the number of unemployed people has\nmoderated from as high as 2 a couple of years ago to close to 1 today, which was about\nwhere it was before the pandemic. With a balanced labor market, if aggregate demand\nslows noticeably, businesses will likely look to cut workers. But I believe job cuts would\nbe modest if the smaller-tariff scenario is realized. Most chief executives I have spoken\nto say that they can maintain their current operations with an effective tariff of 10\n3 See Scott R. Baker, Nick Bloom, and Steven J. Davis (2025), “Economic Policy Uncertainty,” webpage,\nhttps://www.policyuncertainty.com/us_monthly.html.\n\n- 5 -\npercent, looking for efficiencies here and there, and won’t have to significantly reduce\ntheir workforces.\nInflation\nNow let me turn to the outlook for inflation. Before the recent shift in U.S. trade\npolicy, inflation had been making consistent, but uneven, progress over the past two years\ntoward our 2 percent goal. While that progress seemed to stall at the beginning of 2025,\nit has resumed the past two months. The same pattern of higher readings at the start of\nthe year, followed by lower readings the next couple of months, also occurred in 2024\nand I expect that research will eventually reveal some residual seasonal effect or other\nfactor that has affected at least some prices early in the year.\nTotal PCE inflation for April rose 0.1 percent, and core PCE inflation without\nenergy and food prices increased by the same amount. It was the second monthly reading\nat 0.1 percent or less, and it means that headline PCE inflation was up 2.1 percent over\nthe 12 months through April and that core was up 2.5 percent. In the absence of the tariff\nincreases, I was expecting inflation would continue to be coming down nicely to our 2\npercent goal. But now I expect that the effect of higher tariffs will raise inflation in the\ncoming months. The surge in imports to build up inventories ahead of the April 2\nannouncement makes the timing of price increases somewhat uncertain.\nThinking about the rest of 2025 and 2026, I expect the largest factor driving\ninflation will be tariffs. As I said earlier, whatever the size of the tariffs, I expect the\neffects on inflation to be temporary, and most apparent in the second half of 2025. This\nwill be determined not only by the ultimate size of the increase, but also by how\nexporters and importers respond, something that is highly uncertain. Will foreign\n\n- 6 -\nexporters discount prices to try and preserve market share? Will domestic importers\nabsorb some of the tariff increases to shore up demand and sales volumes? Will firms\nsimply pass the entire tariff along to consumers? Since about 10 percent of personal\nspending goes to imported goods, if the ultimate tariff levels are closer to my 10 percent\nsmaller-tariff scenario and if that is fully passed through to consumers, then the tariff\nwould push up prices 1 percent. But based on my conversations with business leaders, I\nsuspect the tariff cost will not be fully passed through and, instead, the burden will be\ndistributed something like 1/3, 1/3, and 1/3 among consumers, importers and exporters.\nIn this case, it would raise inflation three tenths of 1 percent for a short period. However,\nif the tariffs are higher than 10 percent, more of the increase is likely to be passed on to\nconsumers, as businesses face limits in how much they can absorb and still find a way to\nremain profitable.\nI have also heard from business contacts that firms may choose to spread the tariff\nacross non-imported goods. This would increase many goods prices a little instead of\nboosting import prices by a larger amount. But this approach would not affect the total\nimpact of tariffs on the overall price level. Let me illustrate why using an example.\nImagine a firm selling 10 goods with equal sales revenue so that all have an equal\nweight of 1/10 when aggregating the firm’s average price. Now assume one of the goods\nis imported. A 10 percent tariff on the imported good that is fully passed through raises\nthe price of the imported good by 10 percent, while the prices of the other nine goods\nremain unchanged. This pricing strategy raises the average price of all goods by 1\npercent. Now, instead, suppose the firm chooses a different strategy and decides to\nspread the tariff cost across all goods by raising all 10 goods prices by 1 percent. As a\n\n- 7 -\nresult, the price of the imported good increases much less, but the prices of the other nine\ngoods now increase a bit even though they are not subject to tariffs. Under this strategy,\nthe average price of the firm’s goods still goes up 1 percent, and the tariff is fully passed\nthrough. So both pricing strategies have the same total effect on the aggregate price level\nacross the firm and, if repeated, across the economy. The same logic applies to passing\nalong the tariff via a sequence of smaller price increases instead of at a single point in\ntime—in the end, the aggregate price level goes up by the same amount regardless of\nwhether it is gradual or immediate.\nI have heard the concern that some firms may raise prices opportunistically while\nblaming the tariff increase. There is always a risk that firms blame some purported cost\nspike for a price increase, but it doesn’t happen often because of the risk of losing market\nshare to competitors or squandering the allegiance of loyal customers. So while this may\nhappen in isolated instances, I do not believe it will be a significant source of additional\ninflation above and beyond the tariff-induced increase.\nInflation Persistence\nLet me now turn to the first of two issues about inflation that I want to cover in\nmore detail. This is inflation persistence. The economics behind a tariff increase implies\nit should have a transitory effect on prices—tariffs raise prices once, but those prices\ndon’t keep going up. I know that hearing “transitory” will certainly remind many people\nof the consensus on the FOMC in 2021 that the pandemic increases to inflation would be\ntransitory. Inflation turned out to be much more persistent than we thought it would be.\nAm I playing with fire by taking this position again? It sure looks like it. So why do I\nbelieve a tariff-induced inflation spike will not be persistent this time?\n\n- 8 -\nLooking back to how inflation played out in 2021 and 2022, I believe there were\nthree key factors that increased the persistence of the initial burst of inflation in 2021.\nFirst, there was a negative labor supply shock that was more persistent than expected. I\nbelieved that once the economy reopened, all of this labor would return. However, many\nworkers left the labor market because of illness, or to care for children and family\nmembers, or took early retirement. They never returned. And with every wave of\nCOVID-19, the United States experienced additional waves of early retirements that\ninhibited the labor supply from returning to its pre-pandemic level. Also, with the service\nsector shut down, demand surged for goods as spending on travel and other services\nhalted and the negative labor supply shock led to a shortage of workers in goods\nproduction, delivery, and sales. Goods industries raised wages to attract workers and\nthen once the economy began to reopen, service-sector firms had to pay higher wages to\nget workers back. This persistent shortage of labor from these several pandemic-related\neffects continued through 2021 and 2022 as job vacancies skyrocketed and firms had no\nchoice but to pass along escalating wage increases in the form of higher prices.\nThe second factor driving inflation after the pandemic was that the supply chain\ndisruptions that many expected to be temporary turned out to be more persistent. There\nwere multiple waves of COVID affecting different regions of the world at different times,\nso that resolving production and transportation problems was constantly disrupted by the\nebbing and flowing of the disease. One notable detail is that China’s lockdowns lasted\nmuch longer than expected and played an important role in global supply disruptions.\nThe last factor was the quite stimulative fiscal response in the United States.\nThere were hundreds of billions of dollars in grants to businesses to pay idled workers\n\n- 9 -\nand large transfer payments to households. Furthermore, additional fiscal spending bills\nin 2021 and 2022 further stimulated aggregate demand. I am willing to admit that, at the\ntime, I underappreciated how the large and sustained fiscal response would combine with\nhighly accommodative monetary policy to overstimulate aggregate demand in an\neconomy that quickly recovered from the early effects of the pandemic.\nToday I don’t see factors like the three I have described here reinforcing the\ninflationary effects of higher tariffs. There is no longer a shortage of labor and, at least\nso far, no indication that tariffs are causing big disruptions in supply chains, as the recent\nsurge in imports that I mentioned should attest. While Congress is putting together a tax\nbill, as it stands now, a large share of that legislation extends tax cuts that have been on\nthe books for eight years and thus would not be stimulative. Finally, monetary policy is\nin a very different position—we have shrunk our balance sheet by over $2 trillion and our\npolicy rate is north of 4 percent instead of being at the effective lower bound. So I do not\nbelieve one can use 2021 and 2022 as a basis for predicting what will happen to the\npersistence of inflation arising from tariffs.\nInflation Expectations\nNow let’s discuss the second issue of diverging inflation expectations. I have\nargued that I believe the tariff-induced inflation will be transitory and we should look\nthrough it when setting policy as long as longer-term inflation expectations are\nanchored.4 However, right now, we are seeing a dramatic disparity between household\nmeasures of inflation expectations and market-based measures, as well as the inflation\n4 For an interesting history of monetary policymakers “looking through” inflation increases, see Nelson,\nEdward (2025). “A Look Back at “Look Through”,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2025-037.\nWashington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, https://doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2025.037.\n\n- 10 -\nexpectations of professional forecasters. The University of Michigan’s Surveys of\nConsumers show that both near- and longer-term inflation expectations have increased\nstrikingly, on net, in the past few months and currently stand at 6.6 percent and 4.2\npercent respectively. Meanwhile, inflation expectation measures based on prices of\nnominal versus inflation-adjusted securities have not increased very much, with 2-year\nTreasury Inflation-Protected Securities inflation compensation around 2.7 percent and 5-\nyear and 10-year around 2.4 percent. Also, the median from the Survey of Professional\nForecasters for consumer price inflation 6 to 10 years ahead is at 2.2 percent.\nThis highly unusual discrepancy between inflation expectation measures creates\nproblems for policymakers. Whose expectations should we be paying attention to? I\nprefer to look at market-based measures of inflation compensation and professional\nforecasters’ expectations because they have money on the line. Those buying inflation\nprotected-securities lose money if they are wrong. Professional forecasters have clients\nand firms making financial decisions based on those forecasts and will lose customers if\ntheir predictions are wrong. As I used to teach my students, in a capitalist system,\ncompetition will drive firms out of business if they make bad decisions. Forecasting\nmistakes can be costly for consumers, but households aren’t competing with each other\nand won’t be driven out of business if they make bad decisions.\nBut, for the sake of argument, let’s assume that the household measures of high\ninflation expectations are correct and financial market participants’ expectations are too\nlow. What are the implications of this mismatch?5 If households actually believe\n5 In what follows, I am focusing solely on the higher level of inflation expectations and not the higher level\nof inflation uncertainty. The level of inflation and uncertainty about inflation are highly correlated, so it is\ndifficult to disentangle the effects separately. To see how these two effects can alter household behavior,\nsee Dimitris Georgarakos, Yuriy Gorodnichenko, Olivier Coibion, and Geoff Kenny (2024), “The Causal\n\n- 11 -\ninflation will be 7 percent for several years, workers would be expected to demand at\nleast a 7 percent raise to keep their real wages from falling.6 If firms grant those wage\ndemands, then inflation would rise by roughly 7 percent as the wage increases are passed\nthrough. Also, job search and the quits rate should increase as workers look for higher-\npaying jobs.\nIs this happening? Although that was the story a few years ago in a tight labor\nmarket, I am not now hearing about such an upturn in wage demands from my business\ncontacts, and I don’t see it in wage and compensation data. After several years of\noutsized pay increases and in a labor market that has loosened significantly from a year\nor two ago, I think workers don’t have much leverage to ask for raises and are probably\nmore worried about keeping their jobs right now. Furthermore, instead of increasing, the\nquits rate is below its pre-pandemic level. Given labor market conditions, it seems hard\nto believe that the high inflation expectations we are seeing in consumer surveys will lead\nto large nominal wage increases and a second-round burst of inflation.\nA second point here is that if consumers believed we were about to face high\ninflation, they would be front-loading purchases, much as importers seem to be front-\nloading their inventories. But, on the contrary, with the exception of motor vehicles, we\nhaven’t seen a broad surge in the consumer spending, which overall is growing more\nslowly than it did in the second half of 2024.\nEffects of Inflation Uncertainty on Households’ Beliefs and Actions,” NBER Working Paper Series 33014\n(Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic Research, October),\nhttps://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w33014/w33014.pdf.\n6 As documented in Nelson (2025), second round wage effects were a general concern of policymakers in\nthe 1970s and 1990s when discussing oil price shocks or how to respond to changes in value-added taxes\nand exchange rate shocks.\n\n- 12 -\nFor financial businesses, they set interest rates of their loans and financial\nproducts based on expected inflation. Their views should be embedded in market-based\ninflation expectations and those of professional forecasters. If they got the forecast\nwrong and the nominal interest rates on their loans were too low, then their real returns\nwould be dramatically reduced and their profit margins squeezed. I have a hard time\nbelieving interest rates are mis-priced so badly. If they were, then households would\nthink the real interest rate on loans is greatly suppressed. Consequently, loan demand for\ninterest-sensitive products like houses, cars, and durable goods should surge. While loan\ndemand appears to be healthy, there are no reports from banks or other financial firms\nthat loan demand is surging.\nSo, based on wage demands, spending patterns, and loan demand, I see no\nevidence of economic activity that conforms to the inflation views reflected in the\nUniversity of Michigan household measures, which, like other polling about the economy\nin recent years, may reflect attitudes about other factors.7\nIn conclusion, given my belief that any tariff-induced inflation will not be\npersistent and that inflation expectations are anchored, I support looking through any\ntariff effects on near term-inflation when setting the policy rate. Fortunately, the strong\nlabor market and progress on inflation through April gives me additional time to see how\ntrade negotiations play out and the economy evolves. Assuming that the effective tariff\nrate settles close to my lower tariff scenario, that underlying inflation continues to make\n7 For a discussion of factors that were affecting inflation perceptions during the COVID pandemic, see\nDavid Lebow and Ekaterina Peneva (2024), “Inflation Perceptions during the Covid Pandemic and\nRecovery,” FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, January 19),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/inflation-perceptions-during-the-covid-pandemic-\nand-recovery-20240119.html.\n\n- 13 -\nprogress to our 2 percent goal, and that the labor market remains solid, I would be\nsupporting “good news” rate cuts later this year.",

Waller\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nWyoming Blockchain Symposium 2025\nTeton Village, Wyoming\nAugust 20, 2025\n\n- 2 -\nThank you for inviting me to speak today on payments innovation.1 It is an exciting time\nto work in payments. While I have always been interested in the topic, I would have never\nimagined decades ago that payments would generate this amount of enthusiasm, where now\nsome of the coolest jobs in tech are working in this area.\nThe payment system is experiencing what I have called a “technology-driven revolution,”\nwhere the latest advances in computing power, data processing, and distributed networks have\nfueled growth in innovative new payment services.2 This includes 24/7 instant payments, user-\nfriendly digital wallets and mobile payment apps, and stablecoins and other digital assets.\nAlongside these new services sits enabling technology, such as artificial intelligence (AI), that\nhas the potential to improve the precision and efficiency of the underlying payment products\neven further.\nWhile there has been a lot of excitement, and admittedly sometimes hype, around the\npossibilities of these new technologies, there have also been some who have been fearful or\nskeptical of innovation in this space. But we only have to look to history to see that the\nevolution of the payment system has long been a story of technological advancement.\nIn any payment transaction, three things happen. First, an object is bought and paid for\nwith another object. Second, there is a technology for conducting this transaction. Finally, there\nis a technology for recording the history of the transaction and ownership of the objects. For\n1 Thank you to Alex Sproveri and Kirstin Wells of the Federal Reserve Board for their assistance in preparing this\ntext. The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve\nBoard.\n2 See Christopher J. Waller, “Reflections on Stablecoins and Payments Innovations,” speech delivered via webcast at\nthe 2021 Financial Stability Conference, cohosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and the Office of\nFinancial Research, Cleveland, OH, November 17, 2021,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20211117a.htm.\n\n- 3 -\nexample, I can go to the grocery store and buy an apple and use a digital dollar in my checking\naccount to pay for it. I tap my debit card on a card reader to conduct the transaction. Finally, the\nmachine prints out a receipt, which is the record of the transaction. The same process applies to\nthe crypto world. I buy a meme coin and use a stablecoin as the means of payment. The\ntransaction takes place using a smart contract. Finally, the transaction is recorded on a\ndistributed ledger.3 There is nothing scary about this just because it occurs in the decentralized\nfinance or defi world—this is simply new technology to transfer objects and record transactions.\nThere is nothing to be afraid of when thinking about using smart contracts, tokenization, or\ndistributed ledgers in everyday transactions.\nThe technologies available today might be new, but leveraging innovative technology to\nbuild new payment services is not a new story. What I’d like to emphasize today is that the\nprivate and public sectors can both embrace innovation within their respective roles.\nFirst, I will recap how I generally approach these issues. I am a strong believer in the\nbenefits of the free market. I hold the view that it is generally the private sector that can most\nreliably and efficiently allocate resources and take risks to explore the value of new technologies.\nI also see firsthand the important role the Federal Reserve plays in fostering a payment and\nsettlement system that is both safe and efficient. Such a system promotes a vibrant economy,\nsince it allows for participation from a broad range of individuals and businesses without\nrequiring them to invest heavily in bilateral arrangements.4\n3 See Christopher J Waller, “Centralized and Decentralized Finance: Substitutes or Complements?” speech delivered\nat the Vienna Macroeconomics Workshop, Institute of Advanced Studies, Vienna, Austria, October 18, 2024,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20241018a.htm.\nCrypto-asset generally refers to any digital object traded using cryptographic techniques.\n4 See Christopher J. Waller, “What Roles Should the Private Sector and the Federal Reserve Play in Payments?”\nspeech delivered at The Clearing House Annual Conference 2024, New York, NY, November 12, 2024,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20241112a.htm.\n\n- 4 -\nI would argue that broadly, there have been two models of payments innovation, which\ncan be useful in characterizing the longer-term arc of payments evolution, as well as some recent\ndevelopments. The first is private sector-driven innovation. As I have noted, this should be the\ndefault model. The second approach is where public sector entities like the Fed build platforms\nthat enable the private sector to offer services to their customers. This should be done only\nrarely, and in instances where there is a specific market need. Both models are important in the\npayments ecosystem, and I’ll walk through some historical and recent examples.\nLet’s take the first model of private sector-led innovation and use payment cards as an\nexample. Early cards were metal plates or cardboard, then they incorporated magnetic strips,\nthen chips, and now I tap my phone to pay. In the early days of consumer credit used for\ntransactional purposes, privately operated card companies seized on the availability of new\ntechnology to support automated card authorizations and processing, continually upgrading over\ntime, to build what are now global networks of interconnected banks that support the preferred\npayment method for consumers and many small businesses in the United States. 5 Here, the\nprivate sector demonstrated its ability to effectively build a payment service that met the needs of\nconsumers, all based on proprietary technology. Even still, card networks interact with the\nbroader payments, clearing, and settlement ecosystem, benefitting from Fed-operated payment\ninfrastructures for settlement of interbank obligations.6\n5 Data from the 2024 Diary of Consumer Payment Choice survey show that more than three-quarters of U.S.\nconsumers prefer credit or debit cards for in-person payments. See Berhan Bayeh, Isaiah Nardone, Shaun O’Brien,\nand Hailey Phelps, 2025 Findings from the Diary of Consumer Payment Choice (Federal Reserve Financial\nServices, 2025), https://www.frbservices.org/binaries/content/assets/crsocms/news/research/2025-diary-of-\nconsumer-payment-choice.pdf.\n6 See Susan Herbst-Murphy, “Clearing and Settlement of Interbank Card Transactions,” Payment Cards Center\nDiscussion Paper (Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, October 2013), https://www.philadelphiafed.org/-\n/media/frbp/assets/consumer-finance/discussion-papers/d-2013-october-clearing-\nsettlement.pdf?la=en&hash=CB5785393686C300C316A43A2620E904.\n\n- 5 -\nStablecoins are the latest example of private sector-led innovation in payments.7 The\noriginal use of stablecoins was to facilitate crypto trading. Crypto-asset prices can be volatile\nand as with any financial market, there is a need for traders to move out of relatively risky\npositions into safer ones with a stable asset price. As the stablecoin market matured, firms found\nthat the properties of stablecoins using distributed ledger technology— including 24/7\navailability, fast transferability, and their freely circulating nature —could be attractive for other\nuse cases as well. That includes providing a means to access and hold U.S. dollars, particularly\nin countries with high inflation or without easy or affordable access to dollar cash or banking\nservices. In fact, I believe that stablecoins have the potential to maintain and extend the role of\nthe dollar internationally. Stablecoins also have the potential to improve retail and cross-border\npayments.\nI spoke about the maturing stablecoin market in February of this year, and, at the time, I\nnoted the need for a regulatory regime for stablecoins in the U.S to provide regulatory clarity and\nreduce regulatory fragmentation for market participants.8 Last month, the GENIUS Act became\nthe first major crypto-asset legislation to become law. This was an important step for the\npayment stablecoin market and could help stablecoins reach their full potential. Stablecoins, like\ncard payments, are a private sector-driven innovation. And, like card payments, we see\nconnections to the traditional payments, clearing, and settlement ecosystem. For example, many\nstablecoin arrangements use legacy payment services to fund and redeem stablecoin balances.\n7 See Christopher J. Waller, “Reflections on a Maturing Stablecoin Market,” speech delivered at A Very Stable\nConference, San Francisco, CA, February 12, 2025,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250212a.htm. For the purposes of this speech, I will\ndefine stablecoins as a type of digital asset designed to maintain a stable value relative to a sovereign currency and\nbacked at least one-to-one with safe and liquid assets.\n8 See Christopher J. Waller, “Reflections on a Maturing.”\n\n- 6 -\nIn addition to stablecoins, the use of AI in payments is an area where we are seeing\nsignificant private sector-led innovation. Here, AI is not serving as payments infrastructure but\nas an enabling technology that could bring considerable benefits to both private and public\nsector-operated payment services.\nIt may surprise some to learn that, within the financial sector, the payments industry has\nlong been at the forefront of AI adoption. This is true for several major waves of AI technology.\nSince the early 1990s, payment firms have used machine learning for things like detecting fraud\nand money laundering, or predicting payment flows and trends.9\nMore recently, as large language models and generative AI have matured, payments\ninnovators have used the technology to further enhance fraud detection and compliance systems\nand to make the cumbersome process of reconciling payments files more accurate and efficient.\nAgentic AI systems, which operate autonomously by planning and executing multistep\nprocesses, appear to be the next wave of AI advancement. While agentic AI is still in its early\ndays, payments innovators in the private sector are once again channeling the promise of this\ntechnology and rapidly building out various use cases.\nNow, let’s touch briefly on the second model of public sector innovation of payments\ninfrastructures to support the private sector. Almost since its founding, the Federal Reserve has\nprovided core clearing and settlement infrastructure to maintain the safety and efficiency of the\npayment system. The Fed has consistently upgraded the infrastructure over time using the latest\navailable technology. For example, in the early 20th century, interbank transfers were effected\n9 For example, Visa began using neural networks for fraud detection as early as 1993. See Rajat Taneja, “30 years of\nAI and counting,” Visa Perspectives, September 14, 2023, https://corporate.visa.com/en/sites/visa-\nperspectives/innovation/thirty-years-of-ai-and-counting.html.\n\n- 7 -\nthrough telegraph wires—an early version of Fedwire—then through emerging forms of\nelectronic payment messages. Now fast-forward to this century where we have interbank\npayment systems that process transactions in real time.10 Banks, payment services providers,\nand even fintechs have used the infrastructure provided by the Fed to build payment services that\ntheir customers demand.\nAll of this is to demonstrate that the evolution of the payment system has long been a\nstory of technological advancement. Much of this evolution has been led by private sector\ninnovators. Key components have been supported by the Federal Reserve, either providing core\ninfrastructure as a payment system operator or in convening the industry around specific\nsolutions like payment standards.11 These complementary roles have led to a U.S. payment\nsystem that operates safely and efficiently and serves as a backbone for commerce in the U.S.\nand globally. That is why it is important for the Federal Reserve to continue to embrace\ntechnological advancements to modernize its services and continue to support private sector\ninnovation.\nThe Fed is also conducting technical research on the latest wave of innovations, including\ntokenization, smart contracts, and AI in payments. As a payment system operator, it is important\nto understand trends in payments technology so that we can continue to support private sector\nfirms that leverage our infrastructures, as well as understand whether emerging technologies\ncould provide opportunities to improve our existing platforms and services. Finally, we engage\nwith innovators like you to better understand new technologies and their potential to improve\n10 See Christopher J. Waller, “What Roles Should the Private.”\n11 See Christopher J. Waller, “Payments Innovation, Technical Standards, and the Federal Reserve's Roles” speech\ndelivered at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, Minneapolis, MN, May 17, 2024,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240517a.htm.\n\n- 8 -\npayments. In fact, it is my belief that the Federal Reserve could benefit from further engagement\nwith innovators in industry, particularly as there is increased convergence between the traditional\nfinancial sector and the digital asset ecosystem. We are working on ways to further that\nengagement, so stay tuned.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n10:05 a.m. EST\nNovember 28, 2023\nSomething Appears to Be Giving\nRemarks by\nChristopher J. Waller\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nAmerican Enterprise Institute\nWashington, D.C.\nNovember 28, 2023\n\nLast month, I gave a speech entitled “Something’s Got to Give.”1 That message\nwas prompted by the fact that we were observing strong economic growth and\nemployment data in the third quarter, while simultaneously seeing a clear moderation in\ncore personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation. While this was good news for\nemployment growth, the pace of real economic activity seemed inconsistent with\ncontinued progress toward the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) goal of 2\npercent inflation. It seemed clear to me then that something had to give— for inflation to\ncontinue falling to our 2 percent target, the economy needed to slow from its torrid third-\nquarter pace. If it did not cool off, then it was likely that progress on inflation would stop\nor even reverse. So, what remained to be seen was whether the economy would cool or\ninflation would heat up.\nI am encouraged by what we have learned in the past few weeks—something\nappears to be giving, and it’s the pace of the economy. Data for October indicated an\neasing in economic activity, and forecasts for the fourth quarter show the kind of\nmoderation that is more in keeping with progress on lowering inflation. In addition, after\nwatching core PCE inflation increase in September from its summer lows, the latest data\nshowed inflation moving in the right direction in October, albeit gradually.\nWhile I am encouraged by the early signs of moderating economic activity in the\nfourth quarter based on the data in hand, inflation is still too high, and it is too early to\nsay whether the slowing we are seeing will be sustained. But I am increasingly confident\n1 See Christopher J. Waller (2023), “Something’s Got to Give,” speech delivered at the Distinguished\nSpeaker Seminar, European Economics and Financial Center, London, October 18,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20231018a.htm.\nThe views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nthat policy is currently well positioned to slow the economy and get inflation back to 2\npercent. That said, there is still significant uncertainty about the pace of future activity,\nand so I cannot say for sure whether the FOMC has done enough to achieve price\nstability. Hopefully, the data we receive over the next couple of months will help answer\nthat question.\nLet’s start by updating the picture on economic activity. The initial estimate was\nthat real gross domestic product (GDP) grew at a vigorous 4.9 percent pace in the third\nquarter. We’ll find out tomorrow if that estimate holds up, but growth in the quarter\nclearly picked up from the first half of 2023, when real GDP grew at a little more than a 2\npercent pace. Growth in consumer spending, which accounts for most of GDP, was\nstrong in the third quarter.\nData on economic activity in October indicate that consumer spending is cooling\nfrom its pace in the third quarter. Retail sales fell 0.1 percent, the first drop since March.\nSpending was down on motor vehicles, an interest-sensitive sector, which may be\nevidence that that the FOMC’s tightening of monetary policy is having some effect.\nSpending was also down at gasoline stations, mostly because of a sizable decline in gas\nprices, often a larger factor for this segment of retail than shifts in demand. But even\nwithout motor vehicles and sales at gas stations, retail sales barely increased in October,\nwhich may reflect a broad-based moderation in demand.\nBeyond consumer spending, there are indications that manufacturing and non-\nmanufacturing activity by businesses slowed in October. If we factor out a big drop in\nmotor vehicle and parts production due to the United Auto Workers strike which ended\n\n- 3 -\nOctober 30, manufacturing output edged up only 0.1 percent last month.2 Surveys of\npurchasing managers by the Institute for Supply Management indicated that both\nmanufacturing and non-manufacturing activity slowed in October.\nNowcasting models that forecast GDP based on available data are predicting a\nsignificant moderation in economic activity in the fourth quarter. After the retail sales\nreport for October, the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow model is forecasting a 2.1 percent pace of\nincrease for these three months, nearly identical with the actual growth rate for the first\nhalf of the year. Something that significantly boosted GDP in the third quarter was a\nbuildup in inventories, which are quite volatile from quarter to quarter. This volatility\nreflects how businesses manage their inventories by building them up and drawing them\ndown at other times to manage cash flow and anticipate swings in demand. Private\ninventory investment contributed 1.3 percentage points to GDP in the third quarter and\nthat likely won’t be sustained. Inventory swings could even subtract from GDP in future\nquarters.\nOne thing to bear in mind is that the GDPNow estimate does not include the\neffects of the auto workers strike. A range of estimates suggest the strike will cut roughly\nhalf of a percentage point off the GDP growth rate in the fourth quarter and then boost\nGDP in the next quarter around the same amount, so I will tend to look through the strike\nimpact in considering the strength of economic activity. All in all, it seems like output\ngrowth is moderating as I had hoped it would, supporting continued progress on inflation.\n2 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2023), Statistical Release G.17, “Industrial\nProduction and Capacity Utilization” (November 16).\n\n- 4 -\nThe labor market is also cooling off. Job creation is down this year from the high\nrates of 2022, and the unemployment rate has risen from a more than 50-year low of 3.4\npercent in April to 3.9 percent in October. The ratio of job vacancies to people seeking\nwork has fallen, and so has the rate of people voluntarily quitting their jobs. Average\nhourly earnings, which grew at an annual rate of more than 5 percent last year, have\ndecelerated more or less steadily in 2023 to 4.1 percent in October.\nThese are all signs of a loosening labor market. But for all of the measures I have\nmentioned, they are still at levels that, historically, would be associated with a fairly tight\nlabor market. We have 10 months of data on job creation in 2023, and for the 5 months\nthrough May, the monthly average was 287,000. Even with the strong month in\nSeptember, the average for the past five months has been 190,000, which is close to the\n10-year average from 2010 through 2019.3 That’s a significant slowing, but job creation\nis still happening at a rate that is higher than what would be required to absorb new\nentrants to the labor force, factoring out changes in labor force participation. And while\n3.9 percent unemployment is higher than the April low, it is still basically as low as\nunemployment got during the booming job market of the late 1990s. Members of the\nNational Federation of Independent Businesses (NFIB) report job vacancies are down\nsignificantly from 2022, but still at a level that is higher than the late 1990s or any time in\nthe 36 years of the NFIB survey.4 The bottom line here is that the labor market is still\nfairly tight and I will be watching closely to see whether it continues to moderate in ways\nthat keeps inflation moving toward 2 percent.\n3 After job creation in September was initially reported as 336,000, it was later revised down to 297,000.\n4 The survey is available on the NFIB’s website at https://www.nfib.com/surveys/small-business-economic-\ntrends/\n\n- 5 -\nSo, let’s talk about that progress on inflation. Consumer price index (CPI)\ninflation for October was what I want to see. For the month, there was no inflation,\nprices were virtually flat, and unlike earlier moments where improvements were\nconcentrated in some goods and services, the moderation in inflation was broadly\ndistributed. Over the previous 12 months, CPI inflation was 3.2 percent, a dramatic\nimprovement from 2022, when CPI inflation was above 8 percent for most of the year.\nFor October alone, a drop in energy prices offset increases in other categories, but the\nincrease that month in core inflation excluding food and energy was still a modest 0.2\npercent. Core CPI inflation was 4 percent over the past 12 months, but a better sense of\nthe recent trend comes from the annualized rate of 3-month inflation, which for core was\n3.4 percent in October.\nAs you may know, the FOMC uses another measure of inflation for its 2 percent\ntarget, based on personal consumption expenditures, and this consistently runs a bit\nbelow CPI inflation. We’ll get October PCE inflation on November 30, but a rough\nestimate based on differences with CPI and the producer price index indicates that\nheadline PCE inflation was 3 percent over three months and 2.5 percent over six months.\nThe question is whether inflation can continue to make progress toward 2 percent.\nThere are some factors favoring this outcome, so let me walk through them.\nFirst, housing services inflation, based heavily on rents, has slowed from its peak\nlast year, and the lagged effect of moderation in rental prices in the past year should keep\nthis sizable component of inflation at a moderate level.5 Goods prices have contributed a\n5 The pace of increase in asking rents and rents on new lease contracts—which do reflect contemporaneous\nrental market conditions—slowed since early 2022. This moderation has put downward pressure on shelter\ninflation this year, which should continue going forward.\n\n- 6 -\nlot to the decline in inflation recently and have moderated so much that they probably\nwon’t be contributing much more. But services excluding housing, which accounts for\nabout half of PCE inflation, has not moderated as much as other categories, and there will\nhave to be some improvement there for overall inflation to reach 2 percent.\nLabor costs are a significant share of these service price increases, and the moderation in\nwage growth I mentioned earlier should help lower this segment of inflation. The\nincrease in average hourly earnings has slowed to an annualized rate of 3.2 percent over\nthe past three months, below the 4.1 percent 12- month rate, a sign of continuing\nimprovement. That is also the indication from the Atlanta Fed’s Wage Growth Tracker,\nwhich uses household survey data to estimate annual wage increases. It was as high as\n6.4 percent in March and was down to 5.2 percent in October. A broader measure of\ncompensation, the quarterly employment cost index, has improved less dramatically this\nyear. A services-oriented measure of wage increases constructed by the St. Louis Fed\nalso showed slowing. This research, based on data from the payroll company Homebase,\nshows wage pressure continuing to moderate in a way that is similar to broader measures\nof wage growth.6\nThis is encouraging, but it is not enough evidence to be sure it will continue. Just\na couple of months ago, inflation and economic activity bounced back up, and the future\nwas looking less certain. And while it is encouraging to see inflation by the FOMC’s\npreferred measure dipping below a 3 percent rate over the last three or six months, our\ntarget is 2 percent, and policy needs to be set a level that moves inflation to 2 percent in\n6 See Maximiliano A. Dvorkin and Maggie Isaacson (2022), “Recent Trends in Individual Wage Growth,”\nOn the Economy Blog, December 22, https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2022/dec/recent-trends-\nindividual-wage-growth\n\n- 7 -\nthe medium term. I will be closely monitoring the pressure on various categories of\ngoods and services prices in the coming weeks to help me decide if inflation is continuing\non its downward path.\nLet me turn now to the implications of all this for monetary policy. I would start\nwith the point I made at the outset—monetary policy is restrictive, and it is clearly\ncontributing to the rapid improvement in inflation in the last year. The FOMC raised the\nfederal funds rate from near zero to more than 5 percent, the sharpest increase in more\nthan 40 years, and, as some people have noted, we have seen the most rapid decline in\ninflation on record. Elevated inflation was partly the result of supply-side problems\nrelated to the pandemic, and some of the improvement in inflation that we have seen has\nbeen due to the easing of those problems. But most data indicators and anecdotal\nevidence suggests that supply side problems are largely behind us so they will provide\nlittle support in the future in returning inflation to our 2 percent goal. Monetary policy\nwill have to do the work from here on out to get inflation back down to 2 percent.\nThere has been chatter that robust economic growth and falling inflation may be\nthe result of higher labor productivity growth. In fact, productivity growth over the last\ntwo quarters has averaged over 4 percent, more than double the long-term rate. However,\nmeasures of labor productivity are very noisy, and for the 15 quarters since the advent of\nthe pandemic, productivity has increased at an annual rate of 1.4 percent, close to the 1.5\naverage over the past 15 years. So, relying on the productivity growth story to guide the\ncurrent stance of monetary policy appears to be premature.\nThere has also been a lot of discussion about the overall easing of financial\nconditions this month, as reflected in market interest rates and the prices of other assets.\n\n- 8 -\nTo put this easing into perspective, from July to the end of October, the yield on the ten-\nyear Treasury increased about 1 percentage point. Since the FOMC’s last meeting, which\nended November 1, the ten-year rate has fallen six tenths of a percentage point. Long-\nterm interest rates are still higher than they were before the middle of the year, and\noverall financial conditions are tighter, which should be putting downward pressure on\nhousehold and business spending. But the recent loosening of financial conditions is a\nreminder that many factors can affect these conditions and that policymakers must be\ncareful about relying on such tightening to do our job.\nThe October data I have cited on economic activity and inflation are consistent\nwith the kind of moderating demand and easing price pressure that will help move\ninflation back to 2 percent, and I will be looking to see that confirmed in upcoming data\nreleases. Before the next FOMC meeting we will get data on PCE inflation and job\nopenings, and a job report and supply manager’s survey for November. CPI inflation will\ncome out on December 12, the first day of the FOMC meeting. All of that data will tell\nus whether inflation and aggregate demand are continuing to move in the right direction\nand inflation is on a path to our 2 percent goal.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n1:00 p.m. EST\nDecember 17, 2021\nA Hopeless and Imperative Endeavor:\nLessons from the Pandemic for Economic Forecasters\nRemarks by\nChristopher J. Waller\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nForecasters Club of New York\nNew York, New York\nDecember 17, 2021\n\nThank you, Mike, for the introduction. It is a privilege for me to address fellow\nmacroeconomic forecasters, and I thought an appropriate subject would be the challenge\nof forecasting during the pandemic.1 First, a few remarks about my outlook. Then I will\ndiscuss some lessons learned from the pandemic—lessons about the economy’s response\nto this unprecedented event relative to what forecasters, including myself, first thought.\nIn light of November’s job report, I believe the economy is closing in on\nmaximum employment. Though job creation was lower than expected last month, the\nnumber indicated another solid increase in jobs. Accounting for retirees leaving the\nworkforce, I estimate that employment is only about 1-1/2 million jobs below its\nFebruary 2020 level, when monetary policy was less accommodative and unemployment\nwas at a 50-year low and below Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants’\nestimates of the longer-run unemployment rate. The unemployment rate dropped to 4.2\npercent in November, just a touch above the median of FOMC participants’ longer-run\nlevel of 4 percent. The economy seems to be on track to grow at an annual rate of 6 to 7\npercent this quarter and by nearly that much in the first quarter of 2022.\nTurning to inflation, it is alarmingly high, persistent, and has broadened to affect\nmore categories of goods and services, compared with earlier this year. Wages are rising,\nand business contacts are reporting in the Fed’s Beige Book that they are comfortable\npassing on increases in input costs to their customers. I have argued for some time that\nthere are upside risks to inflation, and with inflation exceeding the FOMC’s 2 percent\ntarget for some time now, I strongly supported the Committee’s decision this week to\n1 These views are my own and do not represent any position of the Board of Governors or other Federal\nReserve policymakers.\n\n- 2 -\nspeed up the pace of the tapering of asset purchases. This action gives us increased\nflexibility to adjust monetary policy as needed in 2022.\nAssuming this new pace of reductions in our monthly asset purchases continues,\nthe FOMC will end purchases in March. The appropriate timing for the first increase in\nthe policy rate, of course, will depend on the evolution of economic activity, something\nthat I will be closely monitoring. But given my expectations for inflation and labor\nmarket conditions, I believe an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate will\nbe warranted shortly after our asset purchases end.\nOne big uncertainty about this outlook, of course, is the Omicron variant. We still\ndon’t know how serious a public health threat it will be, so we don’t know if it will slow\nthe U.S. economy, as the Delta variant briefly did, or even possibly slow progress toward\nmaximum employment. Cutting the other way, we also do not know if Omicron will\nexacerbate labor and goods supply shortages and add inflation pressure, derailing the\nmoderation of inflation next year that is my baseline. Over the past couple of years,\nforecasters have gotten pretty used to sudden changes in the outlook, and my colleagues\nand I on the FOMC will adjust as needed.\nThe Perils of Forecasting\nAs I am speaking to the Forecasters Club of New York, I thought I would\npontificate a bit on the nature of the forecasting business. Forecasting typically involves\nanswering the following question: Given the data we see today, what will be the value of\nsome variable, such as gross domestic product (GDP), some period into the future? If the\nonly metric of success is the accuracy of the forecast, then one should use a purely\n\n- 3 -\nstatistical model that looks for the variables that have the best predictive power. In this\nworld, no one asks why those variables have predictive power—they just do.\nBut that is not the only thing that a forecaster’s clients want—they also want an\nexplanation for why you are making this forecast. Using a recent example, in May 2021\ninflation readings were over 4 percent. If your statistical model predicted that inflation\nwould fall to 2 percent by the end of 2021, you would be asked why you are making that\nprediction. To answer this question, you need an economic model. But by resorting to\nan economic model, which is an abstract representation of the true economy, you are\npotentially making a tradeoff between the statistical accuracy of the forecast and the logic\nof an abstract economic model to explain that forecast.\nOn top of that, you must resort to a stochastic economic model, where future\nstates of the world occur with probabilities of less than one. So not only do you need to\nspecify future states of the world from an economic model, you also need to specify the\nprobability for each possible state of the world. Unfortunately, God does not hand us the\nprobability distribution for future states of the world, so we must come up with that on\nour own. We do that by looking at history and trying to tease out empirical estimates of\nthose probabilities, hoping that history is a good guide to what will happen in the future.\nBut one thing that history makes clear is that past behavior is not always a good predictor\nof future behavior. Thus, to forecast well, one needs a good economic model, knowledge\nabout future states of the world, and an accurate probability distribution over those future\nconditions. Even if we believe we have all of these elements in our forecasting toolbox,\nwe still face the daunting task of forecasting turning points and judging the effect of\nunusual shocks.\n\n- 4 -\nAs a result, economic forecasting is a pretty hopeless endeavor. So why do we do\nit? Because of how much is riding on the outcome. All economic activity—every one of\nthe billions of economic decisions that will be made today, and every day—is guided by a\nview of the future. It is based on assumptions about economic conditions down the line.\nIf the view is that conditions will be prosperous, consumers will be more likely to buy\nthat new, bigger TV, and business owners will be more likely to expand and hire. But if\ntheir views are that conditions will get worse, they will be more likely to save than spend.\nWithout a set of beliefs about the future, no one would be able to decide to spend or\ninvest. The cumulative effect of all those decisions determines whether the economy\ngrows or contracts, whether a business thrives or fails, and whether families can pay their\nbills.\nSo, fully aware of the dismal prospects of getting a forecast right, we soldier on,\nin pursuit of the scintilla of understanding it may provide about a future that everyone is\ninterested in. It is often said that, based on our performance, economic forecasters need\nto approach this work with humility, but I think it is exactly the opposite. It takes\nbravado and some chutzpah to stand up and express confidence in an economic forecast\nthat will almost certainly be wrong. But we do it and take the hits when we are wrong,\nbecause so much depends on that view of where the economy is headed. Now, let us\nlook at the forecasting community’s performance over the past couple of years.\nTwo Years of COVID-19\nIt has been almost exactly two years since reports began to circulate of a novel\nvirus in Wuhan, China. In March 2020, health experts in the United States and elsewhere\nwere recommending social distancing, avoiding crowded public places, and maintaining\n\n- 5 -\nat least six feet of distance from other people. At that time, many economies, and\neventually much of the United States, instituted lockdowns that kept school kids and\nnonessential employees at home. The effect was a sudden and severe drop in economic\nactivity and significant stress in the financial system, including a significant disruption in\nTreasury markets.\nUnlike other severe economic shocks in the past century, such as the Global\nFinancial Crisis (GFC), the COVID crisis was a health emergency. The response was a\nplanned shutdown of key sectors of the U.S. economy—something that had never been\ndone before. Obviously, the pandemic has been a great hardship for many people, and it\nwas very challenging for anyone trying to forecast the effect of the virus on the economy.\nWhile we all knew that a recession was in the cards, forecasters lacked the historical\nanalog to give us an idea of the severity of the recession. To say there was massive\nuncertainty in predicting the effect of the virus is an understatement.\nWhile shutdowns and lockdowns were more severe in March and April 2020 in\nsome parts of the country than in others, most of the country was affected, and the drop in\nemployment and spending was larger and faster than the United States had ever\nexperienced. Twenty-two million jobs were lost in March and April. The unemployment\nrate more than quadrupled from a 50-year low of 3.5 percent in February to 14.8 percent\nin April. Real GDP fell at an annualized rate of 31 percent in the second quarter of 2020,\nwhich was three times faster than ever recorded.2\n2 The data here are from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, national income and product accounts. Since\n1947, when quarterly measurement began, the previous record was an annualized drop of 10 percent in the\nfirst quarter of 1958.\n\n- 6 -\nBefore the start of the pandemic, the top and bottom 10 respondents of the Blue\nChip survey (meaning those with the highest and lowest forecasts) had an average\nforecast for 2020 GDP growth of 1.5 percent and 2.2 percent, respectively, which is a\nvery tight range. Once the pandemic started, this range exploded, with GDP growth\nforecasts ranging from negative 1.1 to negative 7.4 percent. Pre-pandemic forecasts for\nthe 2020:Q4 unemployment rate ranged from 3.2 to 4 percent. In April 2020, the forecast\nfor the Q4 unemployment rate ranged from 5.4 to 13.7 percent. It is clear from these\ndisparate forecasts that there was tremendous uncertainty regarding the future states of\nthe world and the probabilities associated with those states of the world occurring, which\nimpaired the effort to model that future.\nJust as we lacked the background and experience to forecast the negative effects\nof the pandemic, we also lacked the experience to understand the extraordinary rebound\nthat followed. GDP grew at a 33 percent annualized rate in the third quarteri. Half of the\njobs lost were regained in four months, and in seven months the unemployment rate had\nfallen to 6.7 percent. By comparison, after the GFC, it took more than two years to\nregain half of the jobs lost and more than four years to return unemployment to 6.7\npercent.\nSo, given this unprecedented shock and the response of the economy to that\nshock, what are some lessons I learned from the pandemic for understanding the behavior\nof an economy, and how do those lessons affect my forecasts going forward?\nLesson 1: When the Shock Is Unique, Adapt Fast\nI think a principal lesson from this experience is that forecasters have to consider\nthe nature and the novelty of an economic shock and quickly adapt our models to new\n\n- 7 -\nsituations. Some adaptations will work well and others will not, but you must adapt and,\nthrough trial and error, sort out how to modify one’s model to account for novel shocks.\nAt the onset of the pandemic, there was a lot of learning about the nature of the\nshock and how to adapt economic models. Economists had to quickly incorporate\nepidemiology models of disease transmission into their economic models to try to\nunderstand how the spread of the virus would affect the overall economy.3 As a simple\nexample, how should we capture the economic effects of social distancing in models in\nwhich the concept of distance doesn’t exist?\nI cannot say how much forecasters relied upon their existing models or historical\ndata to adjust their outlooks as 2020 progressed, but it was not enough to avoid large and\npersistent forecasting errors. For example, figure 1 shows the evolution of the Blue Chip\nsummation of private forecasters’ outlook for the average level of the unemployment rate\nin the fourth quarter of 2020. In March, like everyone else, these forecasters had no\nsense of what was coming; the consensus was for an unemployment rate of 3.7 percent\nnear the end of the year. By April, there was a clear sense that the shock was bad.\nForecasters adjusted their expectation for the unemployment rate to average near 9\npercent in the fourth quarter of 2020. In May, with numbers in hand showing\nunemployment averaging around 14 percent for March and April, the consensus Blue\n3 For example, see Guillaume Vandenbroucke (2020), “The Mechanics of Individually- and Socially-\nOptimal Decisions during an Epidemic,” Working Paper Series 2020-013B (St. Louis: Federal Reserve\nBank of St. Louis, September), https://doi.org/10.20955/wp.2020.013; Andrew Glover, Jonathan\nHeathcote, Dirk Krueger, and Jose-Victor Ríos-Rull (2020), “Health versus Wealth: On the Distributional\nEffects of Controlling a Pandemic,” NBER Working Paper Series 27046 (Cambridge, Mass.: National\nBureau of Economic Research, September), https://www.nber.org/papers/w27046; Martin Bodenstein,\nGiancarlo Corsetti, and Luca Guerrieri (2020), “Social Distancing and Supply Disruptions in a Pandemic,”\nFinance and Economics Discussion Series 2020-031 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System, April), https://doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2020.031; and Antoine Lepetit and Cristina\nFuentes-Albero (2020), “The Limited Power of Monetary Policy in a Pandemic,” working paper\n(September; revised November 2021), https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3699708.\n\n- 8 -\nChip forecast then suggested a slowly declining unemployment rate that would average a\nbit over 10 percent in Q4. A slow decline in unemployment is what we experienced after\nthe GFC, so it made sense to project a similar slow decline after the virus hit. But this\ntime really was different.\nIn fact, the unemployment rate dropped to 6.7 percent in November, and that is\nwhere it ended the year. Even after the dramatic economic rebound in May and June, the\nchange in the consensus view for the unemployment rate later that year was extremely\ngradual. Something seemed to prevent forecasters—me included—from seeing the rapid\nimprovement that was happening before our eyes.\nSame thing for the inflation forecast this year. As figure 2 shows, in January and\nFebruary, the Blue Chip consensus was for consumer price inflation for Q4 to average\nabout 2 percent. This forecast slowly ticked up to 2.4 percent through September. It was\nonly in November that the consensus forecast moved above 4 percent and then jumped to\n6.8 percent in the December survey. Just last Friday, November CPI inflation was\nreported at 6.8 percent for the 12 months ending November, the largest 12-month\nincrease since mid-1982.\nI don’t mean to single out private forecasters; my colleagues and I on the FOMC\ndid no better forecasting during the pandemic. In June 2020, when the rebound in\nactivity was under way, our median projection was for a drop in GDP that was more than\ntwice as large as it turned out to be. Instead of an unemployment rate of 6.7 percent at\nyear-end 2020, we predicted 9.3 percent. And even at the end of last year, nearly a year\ninto the pandemic shock, we continued to have large forecast errors. We predicted that\ninflation based on personal consumption expenditures would be 1.8 percent this year,\n\n- 9 -\ninstead of the 5 percent it hit in October. Data suggest it will remain elevated through\nyear-end.\nToday at the Federal Reserve, we have learned from the COVID experience, and\nover the past two years we have improved our models and data collections in many ways.\nOne enhancement has been to supplement our models with additional high-\nfrequency and microdata, such as data on school closures, airline passenger traffic, and\nmass transit ridership, to help us understand movements in various aspects of the\neconomy. We gave more weight to weekly data on credit card purchases to supplement\nmonthly retail sales reports. Both weekly paid employment and active employment from\nADP have provided insight into the labor market ahead of when monthly employment\nnumbers are released. We have also dug into very disaggregated data on prices to see\nwhere the upward and downward pressures are concentrated to help guide our thinking of\nhow each of the sectors might adjust in the future. Another improvement in our approach\nto modelling is to incorporate epidemiological models to assist in thinking about the\ntransmission of COVID over time and how vaccines have helped slow that spread and\nstabilize the economy.\nThe lesson from this experience is that economists need to continually adapt their\nmodels to the economic situation they are faced with, and when they are faced with a\nsevere shock, they should ask themselves if they need to adapt their standard models and\nfind other methods for forecasting the economy.\nLesson 2: Novel Shocks Can Produce Financial Stress in Unexpected Areas\nAnother lesson we learned was that unprecedented shocks, such as a pandemic,\ncan generate unexpected and unfamiliar stress in the financial system. When the\n\n- 10 -\nlockdowns and business closures started, it was reasonable to wonder whether banks\nwould come under pressure, as they did during the Global Financial Crisis. As it turned\nout, banks were in pretty good shape and weathered the spring of 2020 pretty well, after a\ndecade of effort by them and by government to strengthen regulation and supervision.4\nOn the other hand, probably the last thing that we expected to see was severe stress in the\nTreasury market, the most liquid and stable financial market in the world. But as it\nbecame clear that earnings and all sorts of payments could be disrupted to households,\nbusinesses, and state and local governments, there was a huge dash for cash and other\nliquid assets.5 Instead of flocking to Treasuries, people were trying to sell them into a\nrapidly deteriorating market. So we learned that even a Treasury security can become\nilliquid for certain types of shocks.\nLesson 3: The Fed Has Powerful Tools, Even When the Shock Is Unprecedented\nWe also learned that the Fed has potent tools to deal with even such an unfamiliar\ncrisis. The Fed stepped in, lowered rates for discount window lending, revived lending\nfacilities from the financial crisis, and created numerous new facilities to lend or support\nlending to households, small and large businesses, and state and local governments. In\nall, the Fed created 13 different lending facilities. In most cases, merely announcing\nthese backstops succeeded in stabilizing markets, and, in fact, several facilities\nexperienced very few requests for loans, which I consider a success.\n4 See Randal K. Quarles (2020), “What Happened? What Have We Learned From It? Lessons from\nCOVID-19 Stress on the Financial System,” speech delivered at the Institute of International Finance,\nWashington, October 15, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/quarles20201015a.htm.\n5 In U.S. Treasury securities markets, for example, the difference between the prices offered to sell and buy\nsome securities widened considerably, making it difficult for trades to occur.\n\n- 11 -\nSo we learned that when the Fed acts quickly and decisively, our tools can\nquickly restore confidence, even when that loss of confidence is felt as widely as it was in\nthe spring of last year. In addition, when the Fed makes it clear that it is prepared to act\nwithout hesitation as a backstop, that fact alone can be sufficient to stem a crisis.\nLesson 4: Globalization Is Fragile, and Inflation Ain’t Dead\nAfter two years of surprises, persistently elevated inflation is the biggest surprise\nfor me, and I am carefully watching how this plays out in the next few months. High\ninflation is a heavy burden for households that have no choice about paying higher prices\nfor groceries and other necessities. It hurts small business owners who have a harder\ntime balancing their costs and the prices they charge for goods and services. One of the\nFederal Reserve’s most important responsibilities is keeping prices stable and inflation\nunder control.\nLike most economists, after the performance of inflation over the past decade, it\nwould have been hard for me to believe that it could run as high and as long as it has. I\ndidn’t expect it in 2020 as the pandemic took hold, and I was still in some doubt early\nthis year. Likewise, I have been surprised at the persistence of the bottlenecks and other\nsupply disruptions that have been a prominent source of elevated inflation. Like others, I\nexpected that markets would adjust quickly and that these problems would be fixed, but\nthat clearly isn’t happening, and at this point, with COVID continuing to crimp supply, I\ndon’t know when it will. We are learning that the long and complex supply chains that\nhave facilitated trade and driven down production costs in recent years are quite fragile\nand are taking longer to repair than I would have expected.\n\n- 12 -\nSimilarly, I would have expected that labor supply shortages would have eased as\nthe vaccine became widely available, unemployment benefits faded, and wages improved\nat the fastest rate in decades. Labor force participation increased last month, but I would\nhave expected that more people would have joined the workforce after businesses and\nschools reopened. COVID has changed a lot of things, and we need to consider if it has\npersistently changed a significant number of people’s desire to go back in the labor force.\nThis brings me back to my outlook for the economy in 2022, and the implications\nfor monetary policy. The economy is set to continue growing very strongly through at\nleast the first half of next year, and I expect employment to keep growing. With the\nunemployment rate at 4.2 percent in November, I believe we are very close to meeting\nthe FOMC’s maximum-employment goal. For inflation, as I said earlier, the next few\nmonths will be crucial in determining whether price increases will begin to moderate, as I\nstill expect in my baseline outlook. However, I will be closely watching indicators of\ninflation expectations for signs that consumers and investors have come to expect high\ninflation well into the future, a development that could signal that the moderation in\ninflation I expect will not be coming soon. So, by choosing to speed up our reductions in\nasset purchases, the FOMC is providing flexibility for other adjustments to monetary\npolicy, if needed, as early as spring to accommodate changes in the economic outlook.\nOmicron, as I said earlier, could slow the recovery or exacerbate inflation pressures, so\nwe will have to be ready in the coming weeks to adjust as needed.\n\n- 13 -\n12.0\n10.0\n8.0\n6.0\n4.0\n2.0\n0.0\nSource: Haver Analytics, Blue Chip Economic Indicators.\nSource: Haver Analytics, Blue Chip Economic Indicators.\ni Note: This speech was updated on January 5, 2022.

    "text": "May 13, 2021\n\nGovernor Christopher J. Waller\n\nAt The Global Interdependence Center's 39th Annual Monetary and Trade Conference, The LeBow College of Business, Drexel University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (via webcast)\n\nThank you, Kathleen, and thank you, George and the Global Interdependence Center, for the invitation to speak to you this afternoon. I am with you to talk about my outlook for the U.S. economy and the implications for monetary policy. 1 In the last week we have received employment and inflation reports that have garnered a lot of attention. Incorporating this information into my outlook, I have two messages today. The first is that, despite an unexpectedly weak jobs report, the U.S. economy is hitting the gas and continuing to make a very strong recovery from the severe COVID-19 recession. Let's remember, and this applies to latest inflation data too, that a month does not make a trendâthe trend for the economy is excellent. My second message is that, despite the unexpectedly high CPI inflation report yesterday, the factors putting upward pressure on inflation are temporary, and an accommodative monetary policy continues to have an important role to play in supporting the recovery.\n\nThe pandemic and resulting public health response led to the sharpest drop in employment and output the United States has likely ever experiencedâ22 million jobs lost in eight weeks and an annualized decline of 30 percent in real gross domestic output for the second quarter of 2020. These numbers are simply staggering, and they left us in a deep, deep hole. Not so long ago, it seemed like the economic damage from COVID-19 might be with us for a long time, and that a full recovery could take many years. But thanks to the rapid development of vaccines and aggressive fiscal and monetary policy, the economy is recovering much faster than anyone expected six months ago.\n\nI said a few weeks ago that the economy was ready to rip, and in many respects, that is exactly what it is doing. The initial estimate of first quarter real gross domestic product (GDP) growth came in at a 6.4 percent annual rate, surpassing the level of output in the first quarter of 2020, before the full force of COVID-19 hit the economy. Second-quarter growth is likely to be as much as 8 percent, and the prospects are good that GDP will be close to trend output by the end of 2021. New home sales continue to be strong. We are seeing robust household spending on durable goods despite supply bottlenecks that I will discuss in a moment. Surveys of purchasing managers point to continued solid growth in both manufacturing and business services.\n\nSo, what about that jobs report? That thud you heard last Friday was the jaw of every forecaster hitting the floor. It was a big surprise for me and most people, but it probably should not have been, because it fits with what we have been hearing from businesses about labor supply shortages. GDP is back to its pre-pandemic level, but we have recovered only 14 million of the 22 million jobs lost last spring.\n\nTo fully understand how the labor market is performing, I like to refer to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's labor market distribution spider chart. 2 The chart plots data for 15 different labor market indicators in an easy-to-read manner. Using this chart, you can compare all these indicators for February 2020, April 2020, and March 2021. Looking at these months allows one to compare the very healthy labor market of February 2020 with the depths of the pandemic decline in April 2020 and see both how well we have rebounded since then and how much farther we still have to go.\n\nThe takeaway from that chart is that the labor market has recovered on many dimensions, such as hiring plans, job openings, quits rates, and firms unable to fill job openings. But on other dimensions, the labor market is far from recovering to its pre-pandemic level. Employment, as I said, is still below where it was in February 2020, by 8 million jobs. The unemployment rate is still 2.5 percentage points higher than it was in February 2020, and we know that it is even worse for some groupsânearly 10 percent for Black workers and nearly 8 percent for Hispanics. The employment-to-population ratio continues to be depressed from February 2020. The upshot is that several measures of labor market conditions have fully recovered, but other measures indicate that the overall labor market has a long way to go to get back to full strength. In short, some of the labor market's cylinders are firing away, and some are still sputtering, so monetary accommodation continues to be warranted.\n\nThis chart, like the disappointing jobs report for April, shines a light on a current puzzle characterizing the U.S. labor marketâa lot of job openings, but high unemployment rates and a low labor force participation rate. We hear repeatedly from our business contacts about firms boosting wages yet still being unable to attract workers. 3 While clearly this is a real problem for some firms at the moment, I believe this mismatch is temporary.\n\nI think of the current problem as follows. When the pandemic hit, both labor demand and labor supply fell dramatically. The combination of widespread vaccines and fiscal and monetary stimulus caused consumer demand to recover sharply. This situation, in turn, caused labor demand to rebound quickly, particularly in goods-producing industries. However, due to factors like continued fears of the virus, the enhanced unemployment insurance, child-care issues, and early retirements, labor supply has not rebounded in the same fashion, which led to a situation with excess demand for labor and upward pressure on wages. 4 And that is exactly what we saw in the April jobs report. Average hourly earnings rose 20 cents in April for private-sector nonsupervisory workers, to $25.45.\n\nBut it is likely the labor supply shortage will be temporary. As vaccinations continue to climb, fears of reentering the labor force should decline. By September, most schools and daycare facilities are expected to fully reopen, resolving recent child-care issues for many families. Finally, the enhanced unemployment benefits passed in response to the pandemic expire in September, and research has shown repeatedly that the job-finding rate spikes as unemployment benefits run out. 5 Thus, while labor demand is currently outrunning labor supply, supply should catch up soon.\n\nNow let me turn to the other leg of the Fed's dual mandate, price stability. That second thud you heard yesterday was forecasters' bodies following their jaws to the floor after the CPI report was released. It was a surprise, but a look at its causes doesn't alter my fundamental outlook, which is that the main pressures on inflation are temporary.\n\nFirst, let me address concerns that strong growth threatens to unleash an undesired escalation in inflation. In August 2020, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) adopted a new policy framework that includes flexible average inflation targeting and a policy stance based on economic outcomes as opposed to economic forecasts .\n\nFlexible average inflation targeting means we aim to have inflation overshoot our 2 percent longer-run goal if inflation had been running persistently below target. Given that we missed our inflation target on the low side consistently for the past eight years or so, the FOMC has said that it will aim to moderately overshoot its inflation target for some period but then have it return to target. Our willingness to aim for above-target inflation also means we will not overreact to temporary overshoots of inflationâwe need to see inflation overshoot our target for some time before we will react.\n\nAn outcomes-based policy stance means that we must see inflation before we adjust policyâwe will not adjust based on forecasts of unacceptably high inflation as we did in the past. Call this the \"Doubting Thomas\" approach to monetary policyâwe will believe it when we see it.\n\nWe asked to see it, and lo and behold, we are now starting to see inflation exceeding our inflation target. But the critical question is: for how long? Although inflation is starting to exceed our 2 percent target, in my view, this development is largely due to a set of transitory factors that are occurring all at once. I can think of at least six.\n\nFirst, there is what we economists call \"base effects,\" which is the simple arithmetic of what happens when the very low inflation readings of the first half of 2020 fall out of our 12-month measure of inflation. That adjustment will be over in a few months. A second temporary factor is higher energy prices, which have rebounded this year as the economy strengthens but are expected to level off later this year. Retail gasoline prices have jumped in some areas due to the disruption of the Colonial Pipeline, but the effect on inflation should be temporary also.\n\nA third factor is the significant fiscal stimulus to date. Stimulus checks put money in people's pockets, and when they spend it, there will be upward pressure on prices. But when the checks are gone, the upward pressure on prices will ease.\n\nA fourth factor is a reversal of the very high savings that households have built up over the past year. As households draw down these savings, demand for goods and services will increase, which again will put upward pressure on prices. But, just like stimulus checks, once the excess savings is gone, it is gone, and any price pressures from this factor will ease.\n\nA fifth factor is supply bottlenecks that manufacturers and importers are currently experiencing; supply chain constraints are boosting prices, particularly for goodsâless so for services. One strength of a capitalist system is that markets adjust. If demand and prices rise for a product, supply will follow, and bottlenecks will dissipate. So once again, price pressures induced by bottlenecks should reverse as supply chains catch up and orders get filled.\n\nFinally, the excess demand for labor I described earlier is likely to continue to push wages up in the next couple of months. How much of this increase gets passed through to prices is unknown, but some of it will. However, as I argued earlier, once labor supply catches up, this wage pressure should ease.\n\nI expect that all of these factors will cause inflation to overshoot our 2 percent longer-run goal in 2021. But they will not lead to sustained, high rates of inflation. Financial markets seem to think the sameâ5-year breakeven inflation expectations are around 2.5 percent, and 5-year, 5-year-forward measures are around 2 percent, when adjusted for the difference between CPI (consumer price index) and PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation rates. 6 Hence, markets do not believe the current factors pushing up inflation will last for long.\n\nWhile I fully expect the price pressure associated with these factors to ease and for some of the large increases in prices to reverse, it may take a while to do so. Shortages give producers pricing power that they will be reluctant to let go of right away. Wage increases for new workers may cause firms to raise wages for existing workers in order to keep them. Consequently, there may be knock-on effects from the current wage increases. The pandemic has also caused firms to restructure their supply chains, and, as a result, bottlenecks may last longer than currently anticipated as these supply chains are rebuilt. There are also asymmetric price effects from cost shocksâprices go up very quickly but often tend to come down more slowly, as consumers slowly learn that the bottlenecks have gone away.\n\nFor these reasons, I expect that inflation will exceed 2 percent this year and next year. After that, it should return to target. And in my view, this fluctuation is okayâour new framework is designed to tolerate a moderate overshoot of inflation for some time as long as longer-term inflation expectations remain well-anchored at 2 percent.\n\nBefore I turn to the implications of all this for monetary policy, a word about the housing market. As I said earlier, housing is a bright spot in the economy that is encouraging investment and lifting household wealth, which is all good, but with memories of recent history in mind, the fast growth in housing prices in most areas of the United States does bear close watching. Housing is becoming less affordable, and that price increase has the biggest effect on low-income individuals and families who have struggled the most since last spring and who are always the most vulnerable to rising rents and home prices. Prices for lumber and other inputs for housing are skyrocketing, and while that occurrence is not having a significant effect on inflation, it is limiting the supply of new homes and helping feed the house price boom. Fortunately, the banking system is strong and resilientâgoing through multiple Fed stress tests and a tough, real-life stress test this past year. Nevertheless, I am watching this sector closely for signs of stress and will continue to do so.\n\nSo, in summary, the economy is ripping, it is going gangbustersâpick your favorite metaphor. But we need to remember that it is coming out of a deep hole, and we are just getting back to where we were pre-pandemic. Labor market indicators are more mixed with 8 million workers still without jobs. But many of the problems holding back labor supply will dissipate over time, and we should return to the robust labor market we had in February 2020. Inflation is currently being driven above our 2 percent inflation target but is expected to return to target in subsequent years as transitory inflation shocks fade.\n\nHighly accommodative monetary policy, in conjunction with unprecedented fiscal support, has supported a rapid recovery from a uniquely sharp, pandemic-caused recession. The improving economy is helping repair the significant economic damage suffered by individuals, families, and businesses, but there is still a way to go before we fully recover.\n\nIn light of that fact, I expect the FOMC to maintain an accommodative policy for some time. We have said our policy actions are outcome based, which means we need to see more data confirming the economy has made substantial further progress before we adjust our policy stance, because sometimes the data does not conform to expectations, as we saw last Friday. The May and June jobs report may reveal that April was an outlier, but we need to see that first before we start thinking about adjusting our policy stance. We also need to see if the unusually high price pressures we saw in the April CPI report will persist in the months ahead. The takeaway is that we need to see several more months of data before we get a clear picture of whether we have made substantial progress towards our dual mandate goals. Now is the time we need to be patient, steely-eyed central bankers, and not be head-faked by temporary data surprises.\n\nThank you for the opportunity to speak to you, and I would be happy to respond to your questions.\n\n1.

Breakeven inflation expectations are derived from Treasury constant-maturity securities and comparable Treasury inflation-indexed constant-maturity securities, otherwise known as TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities). The latest values imply what market participants expect inflation to be over the stated period on average. They are based on CPI inflation, whereas the preferred inflation measure for the FOMC is PCE inflation, which tends to run 0.3 percentage point below CPI on average. Return to text",
