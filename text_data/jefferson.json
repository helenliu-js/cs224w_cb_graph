    "text": "For release on delivery\n9:05 a.m. EDT\nMay 18, 2023\nThe U.S. Economic Outlook and Considerations for Monetary Policy\nRemarks by\nPhillip N. Jefferson\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\n2023 International Insurance Forum\nNational Association of Insurance Commissioners\nWashington, D.C.\nMay 18, 2023\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thank you for inviting me to speak. It is a pleasure to\nbe here. I would like to use this opportunity to share with you my outlook on the U.S.\neconomy, credit conditions, and monetary policy.\nBefore I start, let me remind you that the views I will express today are my own\nand are not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\nAggregate Economic Activity\nDespite heightened uncertainty, due to banking-sector stress, geopolitical\ninstability, and the aftermath of the pandemic, I expect the economy to grow in the\nsecond quarter. The pace of growth, however, will be slower than what we observed in\nthe first quarter, when real GDP increased at an annual rate of 1.1 percent. My\nexpectation is based mainly on data that showed weakening spending in recent months,\nand other data that imply moderating spending, including a sizable decline in April in\nconsumer sentiment, as measured by the initial estimate of the University of Michigan\nSurveys of Consumers. While my base case forecast for the U.S. economy is not a\nrecession, I expect spending and GDP growth to remain quite slow over the rest of 2023,\ndue to continued tight financial conditions, low consumer sentiment, and a decline in\nhousehold savings that had built up after the onset of the pandemic. Furthermore, I\nacknowledge that there are downside risks, among them the possibility that the degree of\nbank lending restraint and uncertainty could weigh on economic activity more than I\nexpect.\nThe Labor Market\nEven as GDP growth has slowed, employment has continued to increase, and the\ncurrent labor market is one of the strongest that U.S. workers have experienced in\n\n- 2 -\ndecades. The economy created 253,000 jobs in April and the unemployment rate was\n3.4 percent, the lowest since 1969. Job creation has been remarkably resilient to tighter\nfinancial conditions. Employers have added an average of 280,000 jobs a month this\nyear. That’s down from the 350,000 a month created in the second half of 2022 but still\nrobust. The tight labor market has boosted wages and other compensation for workers.\nWage growth has continued to run ahead of the pace consistent with 2 percent inflation\nand current trends in productivity growth. Wage gains are welcome as long as they are\nconsistent with price stability. Over the 12 months ended in March 2023, the\nemployment cost index (ECI) for total hourly compensation for private-sector workers\nrose 4.8 percent, down only a little from its peak of 5.5 percent last June.\nMy expectation is that the slowing economy will soon begin to reduce job growth,\nwith labor supply and labor demand coming into better balance. The unemployment rate\nmay rise gradually to levels still consistent with a growing economy. Data on job\nopenings and voluntary quits by workers indicate that labor demand has eased somewhat,\nand this is reflected also in a modest decline in the growth of average hourly earnings,\nfrom a 12-month rate of 5 percent in November to 4.4 percent in April.\nInflation\nNow let me turn to the outlook for inflation. While inflation has come down\nsubstantially since last summer, it is still too high, and by some measures progress has\nbeen slowing. After peaking at a 12-month rate of 7 percent last June, personal\nconsumption expenditures (PCE) inflation fell to 4.2 percent in March, which is also\ndown from 5.1 percent in February. That reflects substantial decreases in energy prices\nand a big slowdown in food inflation. Cheaper energy and a slowdown in food price\n\n- 3 -\nincreases are good news for lower- and middle-income households that spend a larger\nshare of their income for these items.\nBut outside of energy and food, the progress on inflation remains a challenge.\nExcluding these prices, which tend to be more volatile than prices of other goods and\nservices, leaves what we call “core” inflation, and this measure is a useful guide to\ndiscern longer-lasting movements in inflation. Core PCE inflation was 4.6 percent in\nMarch, down from a peak of 5.4 percent in February 2022. While we do not have a\nreport on PCE inflation for April yet, another inflation measure, the core component of\nthe consumer price index (CPI), showed little further improvement in April. Looking\nmore closely at core inflation, I like to divide it into three parts—core goods inflation;\nhousing, which is classified as a service; and nonhousing services. Core goods inflation\nfell sharply over the second half of 2022 as supply-chain bottlenecks eased, but more\nrecently it has stabilized at around 2.6 percent. Housing services inflation, which\nincludes rent and the equivalent for owner-occupied homes, is 8.2 percent on a 12-month\nbasis. Housing is a big part of inflation, and while rent increases on new leases have\ncome down considerably over the past year, it will take some time for this softening in\nrents to show through to the 12-month changes. And, finally, inflation in nonhousing\nservices, the largest component of services, has been stubbornly high at around\n4.5 percent and shows no signs of significant decline yet.\nRecent Stress in the Banking Sector\nOverall, the U.S. banking system is sound and resilient, and I am confident it will\nbe able to continue to play its important role providing credit to households and\nbusinesses. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to expect that recent stress events will lead\n\n- 4 -\nsome banks to tighten credit standards further. The evidence is that so far there has been\nonly a modest incremental tightening of lending conditions, which had already tightened\nconsiderably over the past year since the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates. In\na survey conducted by the Federal Reserve in April, loan officers reported that 46 percent\nof banks had tightened credit terms in the previous three months for commercial and\nindustrial lending to larger firms, versus 44.8 percent that had tightened in the January\nsurvey. The April survey’s increase in the share of banks reporting tightening was\nsimilar, though a bit larger, for commercial and industrial lending to smaller firms. At\nthis point, it is hard to tell how much of this tightening was in train already, after\ncontinued increases in interest rates, and it is likewise difficult to say how much the stress\nin midsized banks will ultimately curtail credit in the coming year. Furthermore, there is\nconsiderable uncertainty about the magnitude of the impact on household spending and\nbusiness investment, and this uncertainty complicates economic outlook forecasts.\nThe Insurance Industry Resiliency\nGiven your gathering here today, I would be remiss if I did not say a word or two\nabout the insurance industry before closing. The insurance industry has performed well\nthrough recent stresses. Although the profitability of property and casualty insurance\ncompanies in 2022 was reduced by natural catastrophes and inflation, the industry’s\ncapital appears strong when considering a range of plausible stress events. For life\ninsurers, the recent increase in interest rates has been a mostly welcome development that\nhas supported higher investment returns but also poses risks, such as early withdrawals\nby some policyholders. While the life insurance industry’s capitalization remains strong,\n\n- 5 -\nthe use of reinsurance merits continued monitoring. With that said, let me turn to\nmonetary policy.\nConsiderations for Monetary Policy\nSo what factors will I consider in the coming weeks as I contemplate the\nappropriate stance of monetary policy going forward? Over the next few weeks, we will\nreceive a considerable amount of data on economic activity for April and May, including\nthe employment report for May and a report on May CPI inflation. Monetary policy\nshould be forward-looking. It should be conducted so that longer-term inflation\nexpectations are well anchored around our inflation target of 2 percent. Monetary policy\nshould also be data dependent to allow for continuous learning about the underlying\nstructure of the economy as new data arrive. These principles of monetary policymaking\nare always valuable, especially so when the level of uncertainty is high, as it is now.\nI am guided by the dual mandate assigned to the Federal Reserve by the U.S.\nCongress: price stability and maximum employment. On the one hand, inflation is too\nhigh, and we have not yet made sufficient progress on reducing it. On the other hand,\nGDP has slowed considerably this year, and even though the effect has been muted in the\nlabor market so far, demand clearly has begun to feel the effects of interest rates that are\n5 percentage points higher than they were a little over a year ago. History shows that\nmonetary policy works with long and variable lags, and that a year is not a long enough\nperiod for demand to feel the full effect of higher interest rates. Another factor weighing\non my thinking is the uncertainty about tighter lending standards that I mentioned earlier.\nI intend to consider all these factors in the coming weeks as I contemplate the appropriate\nstance of monetary policy going forward.\n\n- 6 -\nThank you.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n8:45 a.m. EDT\nMay 19, 2025\nLiquidity Facilities: Purposes and Functions\nRemarks by\nPhilip N. Jefferson\nVice Chair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Financial Intermediation in Transition: How Will Policy Adapt?”\n2025 Financial Markets Conference, sponsored by\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nFernandina Beach, Florida\nMay 19, 2025\n\nThank you, President Bostic, for that kind introduction and for the opportunity to\ntalk to this group today.1 I am delighted to be here, and I look forward to discussions at\nthis important conference.\nThe theme of today’s conference is developments in financial intermediation and\npotential implications for monetary policy. As this conference embarks on a larger\ndiscussion of the role of banks and nonbanks in various market segments—including\ncredit markets, Treasury and money markets, and payments—I believe it is worth taking\na step back to explore an important background factor, which is how and why central\nbanks provide liquidity.\nThe provision of liquidity by central banks is a foundational element of financial\nintermediation. Central banks should be able to provide liquidity effectively for the\nfinancial system to function smoothly. Today, I will take this opportunity to discuss\nsome aspects of liquidity provision by the central banks. Of course, the main forms of\nliquidity provided by central banks—namely, currency and bank reserves—are the\nfoundation of safe liquidity in the economy. It is vital for a central bank to make clear\nthat it stands ready to provide liquidity should stress emerge. But a central bank must\nalso take steps to minimize moral hazard. “Moral hazard” in this context refers to the\nconcern that publicly provided liquidity might encourage private financial institutions to\ntake on excessive risk.\nWhat I would like to focus on in this speech are two types of liquidity provision\nthat aim to reduce the frictions associated with the basic operations of banks. The first\ntype of liquidity is intraday credit, which is key in handling payment system frictions\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nduring the day, and the second one is overnight credit, which deals with a range of\nfrictions.2 I will also highlight some design features of broadly similar liquidity facilities\nin three other advanced economies: the U.K., Japan, and the euro area. I believe it is\nvaluable to look at other central banks’ experiences with liquidity provision, which\nentails recognizing the important differences that exist across jurisdictions and mandates\nand considering what lessons can be learned.\nAt their core, liquidity facilities support the smooth operation and stability of the\nbanking system, the effective implementation of monetary policy, and the furtherance of\na safe and efficient payment system. This activity in turn supports the flow of credit to\nbusinesses and households. Last year, the Federal Reserve Board issued a public request\nfor information (RFI) seeking to identify operational frictions in these facilities, and those\ncomments are under review. I hope that today’s discussion about how facilities operate\nin the U.S. and around the globe can further that dialogue among participants at this\nconference.\nHow It Works in the U.S.\nLet me start by discussing how liquidity provisions work in the U.S., as\nsummarized in slide 3. Banks maintain deposit accounts at the Federal Reserve (Fed).\nThe balances in these accounts, known as reserves, are the most liquid assets that banks\nhave and are used to meet payment flows as households and business customers of banks\ncarry out their regular business. Banks often experience mismatches in the timing of\npayment inflows and outflows, which could occasionally cause the balance in a bank’s\n2 I refer to primary credit lending as overnight lending for simplicity even though banks are able to borrow\nfor maturities of up to three months. The vast majority of primary credit lending is overnight. See\nJefferson (2024a) and (2024b) for a summary of the evolution of the discount window.\n\n- 3 -\naccount at the Fed to become negative. To help institutions manage this mismatch and\npromote the smooth functioning of the payment system, the Fed extends intraday credit,\nalso known as daylight overdrafts.\nIntraday credit facilities provide temporary credit to depository institutions such\nas commercial banks and credit unions to foster the smooth functioning of the payment\nsystem. If a bank temporarily lacks the funds to process payments, it can use intraday\ncredit to avoid delaying payments until it has sufficient liquidity. The Fed provides\nintraday credit on both a collateralized and an uncollateralized basis. Collateralized\nintraday credit is provided free of charge, whereas uncollateralized credit incurs a fee.\nSince this type of credit is provided on an intraday basis, the Fed expects banks to have\npositive balances in their accounts by the end of the operational day. If a bank has a\nnegative balance at the end of day, it incurs an overnight overdraft and pays a penalty.\nThe Fed also provides overnight credit through the discount window to approved\ncounterparties against a broad range of collateral. This type of liquidity provision is\ndesigned to mitigate short-term misallocations of liquidity. For example, a bank may\nneed to settle a large payment at the end of the day, but it may temporarily have\ninsufficient funds in its account to do so. To meet the payment obligation, the bank could\nborrow in private interbank markets—in which financial institutions lend funds to each\nother on a short-term basis—or from the central bank. The rate on overnight credit also\nhelps central banks with monetary policy implementation. In addition, overnight\nliquidity facilities often serve as a first line of defense against stresses, and they stand\nready to provide liquidity when institutions face outflows.\n\n- 4 -\nAll discount window loans are collateralized, and a wide range of bank assets,\nincluding a variety of loans and securities, are eligible to serve as collateral.3 The Fed\noperates three separate facilities under the discount window: primary credit, secondary\ncredit, and seasonal credit.\nThe first one, primary credit, is available to generally sound banks at a rate that is\ncurrently set at the top of the target range for the federal funds rate. Providing liquidity at\nthis rate supports the implementation of monetary policy because institutions can turn to\nthe Fed if conditions tighten in money markets that might otherwise push overnight\nmoney market rates above levels that would be consistent with the Fed’s target range. As\nI noted earlier, primary credit also helps deal with idiosyncratic funding challenges that\nbanks might be experiencing. Most of the funding provided is on an overnight basis;\nhowever, funding is available for up to 90 days.\nThe next one, secondary credit, is available to banks that are not sufficiently\nhealthy to have access to primary credit. It is available at a higher rate, features higher\nhaircuts on collateral, and is limited to overnight credit.4\n3 Examples of assets that may serve as collateral include, but are not limited to, U.S. Treasury securities,\ninvestment-grade corporate bonds, U.S. government agency-backed mortgage securities, commercial and\nindustrial loans, commercial real estate loans, agricultural loans secured by farmland, one- to four-family\nmortgage loans, and auto loans. For more detail on assets that may serve as collateral, please see Federal\nReserve Banks (n.d.), “Collateral Eligibility – Securities and Loans,” Discount Window Direct,\nhttps://www.frbdiscountwindow.org/pages/collateral/collateral_eligibility.\n4 The Fed lends less than the fair market value of the collateral provided to manage the credit risk\nassociated with its lending operations. For example, if a bank needs a loan of $100, a portfolio of securities\nvalued at $200 may be required to be posted if the discount or haircut associated with that portfolio is\n50 percent. The difference between the amount that the Fed will lend on a particular asset and the fair\nmarket value of that asset reflects the haircut, or margin. These haircuts differ, for instance, with the\nhistorical price volatility and credit risk associated with the asset. Information on the haircuts for different\nassets may be found at Federal Reserve Banks (n.d.), “Collateral Valuation,” Discount Window Direct,\nhttps://www.frbdiscountwindow.org/pages/collateral/collateral_valuation.\n\n- 5 -\nThe third facility, seasonal credit, provides short-term liquidity to smaller\ninstitutions that experience sizable seasonal fluctuations in their balance sheets.\nTypically, these are banks located in agricultural or tourist areas.\nShort-Term Credit Provision across Jurisdictions\nLooking at central banks’ experiences across jurisdictions provides useful insights\nabout different approaches to providing liquidity.5 Central banks choose a combination\nof interest rates, collateral requirements, collateral valuation practices, and other design\nfeatures to encourage usage of facilities while minimizing undesired consequences—in\nparticular, moral hazard. For example, a central bank facility that provides liquidity at an\nattractive interest rate could be very effective in ensuring that shocks to the financial\nsystem do not disrupt the flow of credit but may potentially increase moral hazard. If that\nfacility only accepted a narrow set of high-quality collateral, however, then the moral\nhazard associated with it could be reduced. Alternatively, the usage of a facility that\ncharges an interest rate above the market rate (a so-called penalty rate) is likely limited,\nbut if the facility accepted a broad range of collateral, usage can be encouraged.6 In these\ntwo examples, the counterbalancing choices are with respect to the interest rate charged\nand the eligible collateral. Different central banks might prefer one approach over the\nother depending on specific aspects of their frameworks and banking systems.\nOf course, there are challenges in comparing liquidity facilities across\njurisdictions given important differences with respect to central banks’ legal authorities,\n5 See Arseneau and others (2025).\n6 A penalty rate in the Board’s emergency lending regulation is defined as a rate that is higher than the\nmarket rate in normal circumstances, affords liquidity in unusual and exigent circumstances, and\nencourages repayment of the credit and discourages use of the program or facility as the unusual and\nexigent circumstances that motivated the program or facility recede and economic conditions normalize.\nSee Regulation A—Extensions of Credit by Federal Reserve Banks, 12 CFR pt. 201.4(d)(7) (2024).\n\n- 6 -\nmonetary policy frameworks, the size of the economy and financial sector, and\ninstitutional structures. This divergence is also true across the four advanced economies\nthat I will consider today: the U.S., the U.K., Japan, and the euro area. There can be\nlarge differences in each jurisdiction’s banking sector and central bank balance sheets\nrelative to the size of their economies, highlighting the need to use caution when\ncomparing aspects of their liquidity provision.\nWith that caveat in mind, let’s look at the design features of some foreign central\nbank liquidity facilities that are fairly similar to the Fed’s discount window. As shown in\nfigure 1, the Bank of England (BOE) operates two such short-term facilities: an\noperational standing facility and a discount window. The operational standing facility\nfeatures lower rates but restricts acceptable collateral to high-quality, highly liquid\nsovereign debt. The discount window facility accepts a broader range of collateral but\ncharges a higher rate.\nWhich facility an eligible borrower turns to in the U.K. depends on the sorts of\ncollateral that are being pledged. In the U.S., whether an institution has access to primary\nor secondary credit depends on the condition of the borrower. The BOE monitors\nborrower conditions, and the Fed also sets haircuts on collateral based on asset riskiness.\nThe differences in design considerations could influence how eligible borrowers integrate\nthese facilities into their regular liquidity management practices.\nThe Bank of Japan (BOJ) has two facilities: one that provides overnight loans\nand another that provides somewhat longer-term funding up to three months. Because\nthe BOJ has been operating a system with a very large supply of reserves for some time,\nits lending facilities tend not to be used extensively, other than in stress periods.\n\n- 7 -\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) operates a marginal lending facility quite\nsimilar to the Fed’s discount window. It can meet the idiosyncratic funding needs of\nindividual banks and serves as a ceiling on interbank rates and thus helps the ECB\nimplement monetary policy. This facility is an important element of the ECB framework\neven though the ECB’s approach to monetary policy implementation involves providing\nthe banking system with a sizable amount of reserves through weekly (repo) lending\noperations.7\nThe international differences show that central banks can accomplish their\nobjectives using facilities with quite different designs. As I noted earlier, one of the vital\npurposes of a short-term liquidity facility is to be able to provide support to the banking\nsystems during stress. The Fed, the BOE, the BOJ, and the ECB have been able to do so.\nFigure 2 shows short-term credit provision over time for the four central banks: the BOJ,\nthe green line; the Fed, the black line; the ECB, the blue line; and the BOE, the red line.8\nEach line is the monthly short-term credit outstanding as a share of central bank assets in\n2019. This figure illustrates a few important points.\nFirst, at most times, use of the short-term central bank liquidity facilities is\nmodest. Second, central bank provision of short-term liquidity can increase very rapidly\nduring times of stress.9 For example, the Fed and the ECB provided substantial short-\nterm liquidity during the 2007–09 financial crisis. Third, the figure also illustrates that\nstress is not always global in nature and peak usage does not necessarily coincide. For\n7 See Isabel Schnabel (2024), “The Eurosystem’s Operational Framework,” speech delivered at the Money\nMarket Contact Group meeting, Frankfurt, Germany, March 14,\nhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2024/html/ecb.sp240314~8b609de772.en.html.\n8 Values in figure 2 represent the marginal lending facility for the euro area, the complementary lending\nfacility for Japan, the operational standing lending facility for the U.K., and primary credit for the U.S.\n9 See Jefferson (2024a) for a longer historical perspective on the Fed’s liquidity provision over time.\n\n- 8 -\ninstance, short-term liquidity provision rose in the euro area during the European\nsovereign debt crisis that began in late 2009 and peaked in 2012, but it did not increase\nmuch in the U.S. Similarly, short-term liquidity provision increased in the U.S. during\nthe March 2023 banking stress episode, but it did not increase in the euro area. I also\nwant to highlight that during stress events, central banks complement their regular short-\nterm standing liquidity facilities with other facilities. Therefore, stress events may not\nnecessarily result in an increase in liquidity provision through a short-term standing\nfacility.\nNow let’s turn to more recent developments. Over the past few years, as central\nbanks have shrunk their balance sheets, liquidity has been gradually reduced, which has\nmade the existing liquidity provision tools more relevant. The BOE and the ECB have\nindicated that they are moving toward operating frameworks in which short-term\nliquidity providing repo operations will play a key role.10\nThe Fed has stated that it will continue to operate in an ample-reserves regime. In\nthis regime, the primary credit rate is positioned to be slightly above the rate expected to\nprevail in interbank markets so use of the discount window should typically remain\nmodest. Still, the facility remains available to be used. Figure 3 shows the discount\nwindow credit as a share of Fed assets over the past decade. As you can see from this\nfigure, over the past few years, the discount window has been used more than was the\ncase before the pandemic. Increased usage may be due to the discount rate being set\n10 See, for example, B (2024), “Transitioning to a Repo-Led Operating Framework,” discussion paper\n(London: BOE, December 9), https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/paper/2024/dp/transitioning-to-a-repo-\nled-operating-framework.\nSee, for example, Schnabel, “The Eurosystem’s Operational Framework,” The Eurosystem’s operational\nframework.\n\n- 9 -\ncloser to private market rates than was the case before the pandemic, the availability of\nlonger maturity loans, and shifts in communication.\nIntraday Credit Provision across Jurisdictions\nJust as there are differences with respect to the provision of overnight liquidity\nacross central banks, there are also differences in the provision of intraday credit. One\ndifference is with respect to unresolved intraday overdrafts. As I noted earlier, it is\npossible for banks to incur overnight overdrafts if they fail to take such action as\nrequesting an overnight loan, although overnight overdrafts are not considered business\nas usual and carry a penalty rate in the U.S., currently set at the primary credit rate plus\n400 basis points.11 The BOJ does something quite similar. By charging a high penalty\non overnight overdrafts, both the Fed and the BOJ discourage overdrafts.\nIn contrast to the Fed and the BOJ, the ECB and the BOE can automatically\nconvert most of the intraday overdrafts into an overnight loan from the business-as-usual\nfacility seamlessly, without action on the part of the bank, against the same collateral at\nthe end of the day.12 That feature creates a greater similarity between intraday credit and\novernight credit in those jurisdictions. The relationship between intraday credit and\novernight credit is going to be an important one for central banks amid developments in\npayment systems, including advances in technology and the expansion of payment\nsystem operating hours.\n11 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2023), Federal Reserve Policy on Payment\nSystem Risk, (Washington: Board of Governors), p. 33,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/files/psr_policy.pdf.\n12 The BOE is a special case because, for most institutions, intraday overdrafts are seamlessly converted\ninto an overnight loan if the institution signed up to use the operational standing facility in advance.\nInstitutions that have not signed up in advance and end the day with an overdrawn reserve account face an\noverdraft charge of 2 percent plus the Bank Rate or another rate set at discretion.\n\n- 10 -\nConclusion\nToday, I provided an overview of the Fed’s provision of liquidity through the\ndiscount window and intraday credit and highlighted some similarities and differences\nacross jurisdictions. In summary, the Fed’s discount window and intraday credit facilities\nhave many features that are similar to those found in other central bank facilities. While\ndifferences in institutional, legal, and financial system structures across jurisdictions\nmake central bank short-term lending context specific, looking at the experiences of\ncentral banks across other jurisdictions is informative, as central banks share similar\ngoals and face similar challenges when it comes to liquidity provision.\nThe Fed is continually assessing and striving to improve the operational aspects of\ndiscount window and intraday credit. The Federal Reserve System has made several\nimportant advancements to ensure that liquidity provision meets the needs of the\n21st century economy. For example, Reserve Banks have worked to streamline the use\nof electronic files when establishing access to the discount window and made\ntechnological advancements in the process for requesting a discount window loan. The\nFederal Reserve System launched a convenient online portal called “Discount Window\nDirect” for requesting and prepaying discount window loans that is generally accessible\nto banks 24–7. To improve familiarity with the discount window, Reserve Banks have\nconducted outreach to banks and made efforts to guide them in using the program.\nTo complement these efforts, the Board issued an RFI last September seeking\ninput on the operations of the discount window and intraday credit. Any issues identified\nin the responses to the RFI can help the Fed understand further improvements that may\npromote efficiency and reduce the burden on banks.\n\n- 11 -\nI look forward to hearing insights you may have into central banks’ liquidity\nfacilities and how these issues intersect with the topics that will be discussed at this\nconference.

    "text": "For release on delivery\n12:30 p.m. EDT\nApril 3, 2025\nU.S. Economic Outlook and Central Bank Communications\nRemarks by\nPhilip N. Jefferson\nVice Chair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Financial Intermediaries, Markets, and Monetary Policy,”\na conference sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and the\nUniversity of Virginia Darden School of Business\nAtlanta, Georgia\nApril 3, 2025\n\nThank you, Dr. Tkac, for your kind words and for the opportunity to talk to this\ngroup.1 It is always wonderful to be back in Georgia and here at the Federal Reserve\nBank of Atlanta. And it is an honor to speak at a conference co-organized by the\nUniversity of Virginia, where I received my Ph.D.\nYou have heard already today about financial markets and the banking system.\nTo add to that picture, I would like to share with you my outlook for the U.S. economy\nand my views of appropriate monetary policy. But before that, I want to touch on the\nimportance of central bank communications, and particularly the evolution of Fed\ncommunications.\nThe Value of Communications\nOne of the reasons I so appreciate the opportunity to speak at events like this is\nbecause speeches are an important part of how the Federal Reserve delivers on its\nmission to the American people. Like my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC), I enjoy engaging regularly with people from around the country to\nhear about on-the-ground economic conditions and to learn specifics about industries and\ncommunities. Such engagement is also a pathway to delivering better policy. It is\nimportant that households, businesses, and financial markets understand policymakers’\nviews and assessments of economic conditions.\nMonetary policy is transmitted to the rest of the economy through financial\nmarket prices, such as long-term interest rates, which in turn affect the decisions of\nhouseholds and businesses. Changes in the target range for the federal funds rate are\ntransmitted to short-term interest rates through arbitrage relationships. Short-term\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\ninterest rates and central bank communication, in turn, affect long-term interest rates\nthrough investors’ expectations. According to the expectations theory of the term\nstructure of interest rates, intermediate- and long-term interest rates are the weighted\naverage of expected future short-term interest rates. In addition, monetary policy affects\nrisk premiums. Tighter monetary policy tends to reduce the willingness of investors to\nbear risk, making them less willing to invest in long-term assets, which means that their\nreturn should be higher for investors to buy these assets.\nFormer Fed Chair Ben Bernanke nicely summarized how important central bank\ncommunication is for the transmission of monetary policy by saying that “monetary\npolicy is 98 percent talk and only two percent action.”2 While obviously hyperbole, the\npoint is meaningful. Clear communication is an important part of a Fed policymaker’s\njob.\nToday the Fed communicates in a variety of ways, including policymaker\nspeeches, Chair Powell’s press conferences, and even through the Fed’s social media\nchannels. Clear and ample communication, however, has not always been the hallmark\nof the Fed. In the 1990s, cable news outlets would attempt to spot former Fed Chair Alan\nGreenspan walking into the building on the day of FOMC meetings. Commentators\nwould pay careful attention to the size of his briefcase.3 The thought was that if the Chair\nwas advocating a rate change, the briefcase would be bulging with documents to\nconvince fellow policymakers. A light bag, on the contrary, would have signaled that a\n2 See Ben S. Bernanke (2015), “Inaugurating a New Blog,” Ben Bernanke’s Blog, March 30, paragraph 1,\nhttps://www.brookings.edu/articles/inaugurating-a-new-blog.\n3 See William T., Gavin and Rachel J. Mandal (2000), “Inside the Briefcase: The Art of Predicting the\nFederal Reserve,” Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, Regional Economist, July 1,\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/regional-economist/july-2000/inside-the-briefcase-the-art-of-\npredicting-the-federal-reserve.\n\n- 3 -\nstatus quo policy decision was likely. Former Chair Greenspan seemed to value the\nelement of surprise. In 1987, he famously quipped, “If I seem unduly clear to you, you\nmust have misunderstood what I said.”4 That said, during his tenure in later years, he\ninitiated substantial changes in how Fed policymakers communicate with the public.\nFigure 1 shows a timeline of the steps taken toward increasing transparency at the\nFed since the 1990s. Beginning in 1993, the Fed started to publish FOMC meeting\nminutes in their current form at the next meeting. Soon after that, the Committee began\nreleasing full transcripts of what was said at the meetings with a five-year lag. The next\nyear, the FOMC started to issue statements following meetings at which there was a\nchange in the policy stance. Before such public statements, Fed watchers would need to\nobserve movements in markets to determine if a policy change was being implemented.\nIn subsequent years, the target federal funds rate was incorporated into these statements,\nand then, in 1999, the FOMC started to publish statements after every meeting, regardless\nof whether there was a policy change. In 2004, the FOMC accelerated the release of the\nminutes to three weeks after the meeting. The Fed’s transparency increased further under\nformer Chair Bernanke. In November 2007, the FOMC began releasing the Summary of\nEconomic Projections, commonly known as the SEP, which, as you may know, is a\ncompilation of individual policymakers’ forecasts for output, unemployment, and\ninflation. Since 2012, the SEP has also included information about policymakers’\nprojections of appropriate monetary policy, known as the dot plot. Former Chair\nBernanke started holding press conferences after every other FOMC meeting in 2011. In\n2012, the FOMC published the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy\n4 See Binyamin Appelbaum (2012), “A Fed Focused on the Value of Clarity,” New York Times,\nDecember 13.\n\n- 4 -\nStrategy, which is known as the consensus statement. That statement articulates the\nFOMC’s framework for the conduct of monetary policy in pursuit of the dual-mandate\ngoals assigned by Congress: maximum employment and price stability. And since then,\nthe FOMC has undertaken periodic public reviews of that statement. Under Chair\nPowell’s tenure, starting in 2019, the Chair’s press conferences have been held after\nevery FOMC meeting.\nOf course, the Chair and other policymakers also regularly testify before\nCongress, as required by law. And the Fed releases many reports and data, including the\nMonetary Policy Report, the Financial Stability Report, and the Supervision and\nRegulation Report. Policymakers’ public appearances also help inform the public about\nthe Fed’s goals and its strategies to achieve those goals.\nCommunication is not just about talking; it is also about listening. Policymakers\nlisten to the steady beat of economic data, and the Board and the Reserve Banks conduct\nnumerous surveys of financial market participants, businesses, and families. Some of\nwhat we hear is summarized in the Beige Book, published eight times per year. I also\nlisten to experts and the public at events like this and Fed Listens events, several of which\nare planned for later this year.\nToday, it is widely accepted that clear communication contributes greatly to\neffective transmission of monetary policy, especially because clear communication can\naffect the expected path of interest rates and financial conditions more generally. Former\nCleveland Fed President Loretta Mester studied this issue closely and discussed that\nwhen policymakers are clear about their policy goals, aspects of the economy that can\nand cannot be influenced by monetary policy, and the economic information that\n\n- 5 -\ninfluences their forecasts and policy decisions, the public will have a better understanding\nof monetary policy.5 The public can then incorporate that information into their saving,\nborrowing, employment, and investment decisions.\nEconomic Outlook\nSo, in that spirit of making sure the public is well informed, I will now share with\nyou my outlook for the U.S. economy. Over the past two years, significant progress has\nbeen made toward the Fed’s dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable\nprices. Labor market conditions are solid, and inflation has come down, though it\nremains somewhat elevated relative to our 2 percent goal. While the economy is in a\nsolid position, surveys of consumers and businesses show heightened uncertainty about\nthe economic outlook. It remains to be seen what these surveys imply about future\nspending and investment and the direction of the economy more broadly.\nEconomic Activity\nThe economy expanded at a solid pace at the end of last year with gross domestic\nproduct (GDP) rising at a 2.4 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, extending a period\nof steady growth, as you can see in figure 2. While Fed policymakers and many private-\nsector forecasters expect growth to continue, they broadly anticipate a slower pace of\nexpansion this year. In the SEP released after the March FOMC meeting, the median\nparticipant projected GDP to rise 1.7 percent this year and to move up a bit below\n2 percent over the next two years.\n5 See Loretta J. Mester (2018), “The Federal Reserve and Monetary Policy Communications,” speech\ndelivered at the Tangri Lecture at Rutgers University, New Brunswick, New Jersey, January 17,\nhttps://www.clevelandfed.org/collections/speeches/2018/sp-20180117-federal-reserve-monetary-policy-\ncommunications.\n\n- 6 -\nResilient consumer spending has been the driving force of the current economic\nexpansion. More recently, a few signs have emerged that suggest that some of the factors\nsupporting last year’s strong spending growth may be weakening. As you can see in\nfigure 3, retail and food service sales rose 0.2 percent in February after falling a sharp\n1.2 percent in January. That slower pace of spending could reflect seasonality, poor\nweather, and expected cooling after the strong spending at the end of last year.\nNonetheless, the readings at the start of this year suggest less support for growth from\nhousehold spending in the first quarter. The most recent Beige Book stated that contacts\nreported consumer spending was lower, on balance, with still solid demand for essential\ngoods but increased price sensitivity for discretionary items, particularly among lower-\nincome shoppers.6\nIndustrial production has increased for three straight months, including a\n0.7 percent advance in February, which was led by a rise in manufacturing output,\nparticularly motor vehicles. Like consumer sentiment, however, readings on business\nsentiment have also slipped. The Beige Book reported some increases in manufacturing\nactivity, though it noted concerns raised by firms, including chemical products and office\nequipment makers, about the potential effect of changes to trade policy. Some\nmanufacturing contacts in this region, the Sixth District, said that they expected demand\nto improve over the next 12 months but also noted risks around policy changes and global\nuncertainty.\n6 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2025), The Beige Book: Summary of\nCommentary on Current Economic Conditions by Federal Reserve District, February,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/BeigeBook_20250305.pdf.\n\n- 7 -\nIf uncertainty persists or worsens, economic activity may be constrained. An\nimportant lesson learned in recent years, however, is that American consumers have been\nresilient, and negative sentiment reported in surveys often does not translate into a\nslowdown in actual activity.\nLabor Market\nWith respect to the labor market, conditions remain solid. The unemployment\nrate has remained low and was 4.1 percent in February. As you can see in figure 4, it has\nremained in a narrow range for the past year, consistent with broader evidence that labor\nmarket conditions have stabilized. That said, I anticipate that there could be some modest\nsoftening in the labor market this year. In the SEP projections, the median FOMC\nparticipant expected the unemployment rate to be 4.4 percent at the end of this year and\n4.3 percent over the next two years.\nPayroll job gains have averaged nearly 200,000 per month over the past six\nmonths, through February. We will, of course, get additional data tomorrow with the\nMarch jobs report. The pace of job gains has cooled from its post-pandemic peak, but\nlayoffs remain low. Figure 5 shows that new applications for unemployment benefits are\nlargely holding steady this year and running at rates consistent with pre-pandemic levels.\nLow layoffs are a reason why the unemployment rate has been steady even as hiring has\nmoderated. Recently, there has been an increase in former federal government\nemployees seeking unemployment benefits and some uptick in claims filings in certain\nregions affected by those layoffs. I will be monitoring incoming data closely and remain\nvigilant about potential spillover effects in sectors such as education, health care, and\nstate governments.\n\n- 8 -\nLooking at figure 6, you see that the gap between job openings and unemployed\npeople seeking work has held steady for several months. That is another sign that the\nlabor market is well-balanced. The gap has significantly narrowed from a peak in 2022,\nwhen the labor market was overheated. It is now consistent with 2019 readings, when the\nlabor market was also solid and inflation low. Wages are growing faster than inflation\nand at a more sustainable pace than earlier in the pandemic recovery. The labor market is\nnot a source of significant inflationary pressures.\nInflation\nInflation has come down a great deal over the past two and a half years but\nremains somewhat elevated relative to our 2 percent objective. Looking at inflation\nshown in figure 7, you see that the 12-month change in the personal consumption\nexpenditures (PCE) price index peaked at 7.2 percent in June 2022. Since then, it has\ncome down on an uneven path. In February, overall inflation was 2.5 percent on a 12-\nmonth basis. Core PCE inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, shown\nby the dashed red line, peaked at 5.6 percent in 2022. In February, it was 2.8 percent.\nWhile inflation is well down from its recent peak, the latest data have largely\nshown it moving sideways. The median FOMC participant forecasts overall PCE\ninflation at 2.7 percent this year and 2.2 percent next year. In 2027, the median\nprojection is at our 2 percent objective. The prospect of tariffs has consumers and\nbusinesses reporting that they expect higher inflation in the near term. Beyond the next\nyear or so, however, most measures of longer-term inflation expectations remain\nconsistent with our 2 percent inflation goal.\n\n- 9 -\nTo better understand what is driving inflation, I think it can be helpful to look at\nsome major components of changes in prices, as you can see in figure 8. Outside of food\nand energy, goods inflation was negative last year, helping to support overall disinflation.\nIn more recent months, goods inflation has turned positive. That may in part reflect trade\npolicy or the anticipation of changes to trade policy, but capturing the exact cause is\ndifficult. Services inflation excluding housing, the dashed red line, has moderated from\nits peak but remains elevated. Housing services inflation, the dotted purple line,\ncontinues to move lower. If that trend continues, it could counter somewhat stronger\ninflation in other categories.\nMonetary Policy\nIn the current environment, I attach a higher degree of uncertainty to my\nprojections than usual. The most recent SEP indicated that other FOMC participants also\nwere quite uncertain about the outlook: A greater number of participants indicated that\nuncertainty around their projections of GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and\ninflation was higher than average over the past 20 years compared with responses from\nthe previous SEP round in December 2024. As I mentioned, consumer and business\nsurveys show that much of the economic uncertainty they report is tied to recent\ndevelopments in trade policy. Significant changes in trade, immigration, fiscal, and\nregulatory policies currently are in process. It will be crucial to evaluate the cumulative\neffect of these policy changes as we assess the economy and consider the path of\nmonetary policy. Of course, at the Fed, we look at the whole of the economy and many\nfactors that shape it.\n\n- 10 -\nI supported the FOMC’s decision to hold rates steady at our last policy meeting in\nMarch. Growth has remained solid so far but has started to show some signs of slowing.\nLabor market conditions have remained stable through February, and progress on\ninflation has eased, but the outlook is uncertain. These conditions led me to favor\nholding the policy rate constant at what I view as a moderately restrictive level.\nThe longer-term perspective provided by figure 9 shows that the FOMC\nresponded to elevated inflation in the post-pandemic period by raising the policy rate\n5¼ percentage points over about 15 months, starting in March 2022. After the\nCommittee held the rate at that restrictive level for more than a year, progress on inflation\nallowed it to lower its policy rate by 1 full percentage point last year to its current level.\nThe outcome of inflation moderating toward the 2 percent target without a large increase\nin unemployment was historically unusual but greatly welcomed.\nThinking about the future path of policy, I will continue to assess incoming data,\nthe evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. As we emphasize, monetary policy is not\non a preset course. If the economy remains strong and inflation does not continue to\nmove sustainably toward 2 percent, the current policy restraint could be retained for\nlonger. If the labor market were to weaken unexpectedly or inflation were to fall more\nquickly than anticipated, policy could be eased accordingly. In my view, there is no need\nto be in a hurry to make further policy rate adjustments. The current policy stance is well\npositioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of\nour dual mandate.\nHaving provided you with my current economic outlook, I would like to conclude\nby circling back to where I started, with the value of central bank communication. The\n\n- 11 -\nremainder of today’s conference will touch on FOMC communications and monetary\ntransmission, among other topics. In that sense, the remarks that I’ve just given may\nbecome tomorrow’s data point! I appreciate the pursuit of research like that presented\ntoday, which helps us gain further insight into a wide range of topics relevant to monetary\npolicymaking.\nThank you for your time today.

    "text": "For release on delivery\n10:30 a.m. EST\nFebruary 27, 2023\nRecent Inflation and the Dual Mandate\nRemarks by\nPhilip N. Jefferson\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nEc10, Principles of Economics, Lecture\nFaculty of Arts and Sciences, Harvard University\nCambridge, Massachusetts\nFebruary 27, 2023\n\nThank you, Jason, for inviting me to join your economics class and for your kind\nintroduction. It is a pleasure to be here. I miss teaching economics classes.\nBefore I continue, I would like to note, as I always do, that the views I will express today\nare my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues at the Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\nWhat I like about economics is that it deals with real-world issues, and many times we\nexperience firsthand a topic discussed in textbooks. Take the recent inflation, for example. This\nmay be your first experience with high inflation. I am sure you noticed prices going up at\nrestaurants, supermarkets, and the gas pump without having to read about it in the newspaper. I,\nfor one, can confirm that the inflationary pressure in the rental housing market in the\nWashington, D.C., area is real. While we have all experienced prices going up, it’s challenging\nto measure inflation itself and its consequences.\nToday, I want to do the following: discuss with you different ways to measure inflation,\ncharacterize our recent inflation, and contextualize the battle against inflation in terms of the\nFed’s dual-mandate goals of price stability and maximum employment. Then, I will offer some\nconcluding remarks.\nDifferent Ways to Measure Inflation\nThe two primary measures of the price level in the United States are the consumer price\nindex, commonly referred to as the CPI, and the personal consumption expenditures price index,\ncommonly referred to as the PCE price index. Positive changes in these indexes are recorded as\ninflation. Each inflation measure has both total (or headline) and core subindexes, which I will\ntalk about later. The CPI and PCE price indexes are constructed in broadly similar ways, but\n\nthere are important differences between them.1 Both indexes measure inflation using a specific\nbasket of goods and services consumed by households. These baskets are similar but not\nidentical across the two measures. Both measures also weight each item in their basket roughly\nin accordance with its expenditure share. That is, the more households spend on an item, like\nrent, the higher the weight it receives in the overall index. The weights are broadly similar\nacross the two indexes, but, again, there are some important differences.\nNow, let’s talk in more detail about the differences between the CPI and the PCE price\nindexes. First, the PCE price index has a broader scope than the CPI. The CPI is limited to\nexpenditures that households pay out of pocket, while the PCE price index covers a broader set\nof goods and services as it seeks to cover prices for all consumer expenditures in the national\nincome and product accounts (NIPA). For example, the PCE price index includes prices of the\nhealth services provided to households through Medicaid, while the CPI excludes these items.\nSecond, the PCE price index and the CPI use different weighting systems. The PCE price\nindex, which is more comprehensive than the CPI, estimates expenditure shares using the\nnational income and product accounts, while the CPI measures expenditure shares using a\nseparate survey of households, the Consumer Expenditure Survey. This leads to some\ndifferences in expenditure weights that can at times be important. For example, the share of\nmedical services is notably higher in the PCE price index (partly because the PCE price index\nincludes more kinds of medical expenditures), and the share of housing services is noticeably\nsmaller (because overall expenditures are larger in the PCE price index). As a result, when\n1 See, for example, Johnson (2017), who explains methodological similarities and differences between PCE price\nindex and CPI.\n\nhealth-care services or housing services inflation behave differently than other prices, this can\nlead to differences in PCE versus CPI inflation.\nAnother difference in the weights is that the PCE price index uses time-varying weights,\nwhile the official CPI keeps weights fixed for a year. The PCE price index weights change to\nreflect changes in the goods consumers buy. For instance, at the start of the pandemic, the CPI\nwas still giving the same weights to cruise ship and airline fares, even though no one was\ntraveling. The time-varying weights in PCE also account for substitution behavior. Suppose the\nprice of apples goes up and the price of oranges stays the same. Consumers are then likely to\nsubstitute apples with oranges. In contrast, the CPI does not capture substitution behavior\nbecause the basket of goods consumers purchase is updated only once a year (instead of every\nmonth) and reflects expenditure patterns prevailing two years ago. The substitution effects\ncaptured by the PCE price index is one reason why PCE inflation (black line) is, almost always,\nlower than CPI inflation (red line), as you can see in figure 1.\nAs I mentioned earlier, there are both total and core PCE price and CPI indexes. The\ncore subindex is the total index excluding food and energy prices.2 Food and energy prices are\nmore volatile than other prices, which makes total inflation more volatile.\nThis volatility is evident in figure 2. You can see the black line (total PCE price index)\nexhibiting more drastic ups and downs than core PCE price index, the red line in the graph, and\nmany of the sharp movements are short lived. In other words, the volatility in the total PCE\nprice index makes it harder to discern trends (longer-lasting movements) from transitory\nmovements. In addition, food and energy prices often depend on factors that are beyond the\n2 Note that the core indexes are defined somewhat differently. Both core indexes exclude all energy prices. But\nwhile the CPI excludes all food prices, the core PCE price index excludes food bought for consumption at home\n(that is, food purchased at grocery stores) but includes food purchased at restaurants.\n\ninfluence of monetary policy, such as geopolitical developments (for example, those associated\nwith fluctuations in energy prices) or weather or disease or war (for example, in the case of food\nprices).\nIn summary, the differences between CPI and PCE price indexes are important. The\nFOMC has chosen to target the PCE price index because it is broader and it captures more\naccurately what households are actually consuming.3 In addition, food and energy account for a\nsignificant portion of household budgets, so the Federal Reserve’s inflation objective is defined\nin terms of the total PCE price index, but the Fed monitors the core PCE price index, as well as\nother inflation indicators, in order to identify evolving inflation trends.4\nSelect Components of Core PCE Inflation\nNow, I would like to dig a bit deeper into recent inflation trends. To do so, I find it\nuseful to look at three large categories that together make up the core PCE price index: goods\nexcluding food and energy, housing services, and services excluding housing and energy. Slide\n7 provides some examples of what is in each subcomponent.\nFigure 3 shows recent inflation rates for each component: goods excluding food and\nenergy (black line), housing services (blue line), and services excluding housing and energy (red\nline). I look at these three categories separately because what has been causing inflation in each\nof these sectors is somewhat different. Understanding the different causes and how they affect\nthe different components could help the FOMC predict the future course of inflation. Since\n3 The Fed’s Monetary Policy Report explains why the Fed chooses the PCE price index to the CPI (see Board of\nGovernors, 2000, footnote 1). Notwithstanding this preference, the FOMC relies on a variety of aggregate price\nmeasures, as well as other information on prices and costs, in assessing the path of inflation.\n4 For an explanation of how the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System evaluates changes in inflation,\nsee Board of Governors (2016).\n\nmonetary policy affects the economy (and inflation) with a lag, the Committee is always forward\nlooking.\nFocusing on the price of core goods, the black line in figure 3, you can see how goods\nprices rose sharply in the second half of 2020 due to both a rapid shift in demand toward goods\nand unprecedented disruptions to global supply chains. As so many were isolating themselves—\nespecially those of us lucky enough to have jobs that let us work remotely—there was a sharp\nshift in demand from services (eating out and traveling) to durable goods (like stationary\nbicycles) to make our stay-at-home experience more pleasant. The pandemic also severely\ndisrupted the global production and distribution of goods, leading to large backlogs at ports and\nwidespread shortages of materials, most notably semiconductors. The imbalance between supply\nand demand for goods resulted in a sharp increase of prices. At the end of 2021, once vaccines\nwere developed and deployed and people slowly emerged from isolation, there was a partial shift\nin demand back to services, and supply chain bottlenecks started to ease. Thus, inflation in this\ncategory started to come down and has come down substantially.\nIn contrast to core goods, housing services inflation, the blue dashed line in figure 3, has\nnot started to come down yet. Housing services prices are estimated using information on rents\nand measure the price that renters pay, and homeowners would pay, to live in their homes. Like\ncore goods, demand in the housing sector underwent a major shift during the pandemic.\nThe surge in work from home shown in figure 4 led to an increase in the demand for\nbigger homes located in smaller metro areas or further from city centers. These shifts in demand\nhappened much more rapidly than the response in housing supply. As a result, rents increased\nquite significantly.\n\nWe have not seen a decline in housing services inflation, but there are indications that we\nsoon will. To see this, consider figure 5. Because rental agreements tend to be renewed\ninfrequently (often only once a year), average rents (the black line), which is what the PCE price\nindex measures, tend to lag market rents (the green, blue, and red lines), the rent I would pay if I\nwere to sign a new lease as a new tenant. For this reason, market rents are a leading indicator of\nhow overall rents and housing services prices are likely to change over the next 6 to 12 months.\nMarket rents are now increasing much more slowly than over 2021 and much of 2022,\nsuggesting that housing services inflation will eventually slow.\nLastly, inflation in other core services, the red line back in figure 3, is a large category\nthat covers activities as varied as travel and recreation, and medical and legal services. Inflation\nfor these services has remained stubbornly high. As other Governors and I have noted in the\npast, an important source of inflation pressures in this category has likely been the shortage of\nworkers, which has pushed up labor costs at rates above those consistent with 2 percent inflation.\nThe inflation outlook for this nonhousing category of core services partly depends on whether\ngrowth in nominal labor costs comes back down, and recent data suggest that labor\ncompensation has indeed started to decelerate somewhat over the past year.\nAlthough I have focused on core inflation because it is more useful for assessing trends in\ninflation, we also closely follow food and energy prices given that our target is for total inflation\nand that food and energy prices are very important for many households. Both food and energy\ninflation rose sharply following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. But more recently, food\ninflation has slowed somewhat, as global food prices have retraced some of their earlier\nincreases, while energy prices have fallen noticeably. Because energy prices are shaped\n\nprimarily by global developments and not by U.S. monetary policy, there is a lot of uncertainty\nabout the future course of energy inflation.\nIn summary, core goods inflation has started to come down. Several indicators suggest\nthat housing services inflation is likely to come down in the coming months. There is more\nuncertainty surrounding inflation in core services excluding housing. Over time, we’ll learn\nmore about inflation dynamics in this sector.\nBenefits of Price Stability and a Target of 2 Percent\nSo far, I’ve talked about how to measure inflation, about different subcomponents, and\nabout drivers of inflation. I will now discuss the benefits of price stability and a longer-run 2\npercent inflation rate target.\nPrice stability is one of two goals assigned to the Federal Reserve by law, but there is also\na broad consensus among economic researchers and policymakers that price stability is a\ndesirable objective. Deviations from price stability in the form of persistently elevated inflation\nrates are costly for the economy for several reasons, some of which I’ll review now.5\nFundamentally, a low and stable inflation rate is beneficial for the decisionmaking\nprocesses of households and firms. Choices regarding work, savings, and the expansion of\nbusiness enterprises are likely to be harder when there is uncertainty about the likely future\ncourse of prices. Retirement planning by households and investment decisions by firms are,\nconsequently, put on a sounder footing if there is confidence about the future value of the\ncurrency. The avoidance of this uncertainty is also likely to be beneficial for national economic\nperformance. If the prospect of high inflation or uncertainty about future inflation factors\n5 For examples of research on the costs of inflation, see Fischer and Modigliani (1978), Fischer (1981), McCallum\n(1990), Shiller (1997), and Feldstein (1999). See also the implications for monetary policy drawn by Bernanke and\nothers (1999). Diercks (2019) provides a detailed analysis of work that has appeared on the issue since the mid-\n1990s.\n\nheavily into firms’ and households’ calculations, it is less likely that resources will be allocated\nto activities that raise the productive potential of the economy, rather than into areas that are only\nmade attractive by the presence of high and variable inflation.6\nThere are other economic costs of high inflation. In the labor market, as nominal wages\nare often set in advance, bouts of unanticipated inflation typically lead to a drop in workers’ real\nwages in the short run, and this is a burden on households in meeting their expenses.7\nMore generally, even anticipated rates of inflation can produce redistributions of income.\nSuch redistributions are also likely to be adverse for members of society who do not have ready\naccess to the kinds of financial instruments that would best protect them against high inflation.\nThe likelihood of wide-ranging distortions due to inflation is enhanced by the fact that the\nU.S. tax code does not fully take inflation into account. Consequently, as stressed in\nfundamental work by the late Martin Feldstein of Harvard University, high inflation can distort\nsaving and investment decisions, including through the treatment of after-tax capital gains.8\nAnother reason why deviations from price stability distort decisions and redistribute\nincome lies in the fact that much of our financial system, including many arrangements\npertaining to retirement plans, is structured in terms of streams of nominal payments.9 Absent a\nbackground of a steady and predictable inflation rate, the purchasing power of retirement income\nstreams and other payments may turn out to be very different from what was envisioned when\nthey were originally arranged.\n6 One long-standing effect of inflation is that it creates incentives that would not otherwise be present to economize\non low-interest-bearing money balances. More broadly, an inflationary environment may distort portfolio decisions.\n7 Ultimately, nominal wage contracts will adjust to reflect a higher longer-run inflation rate. In the short run,\nhowever, it has been a long-standing feature of the U.S. economy that nominal wages tend to lag developments in\nprices; see, for example, Mitchell (1913) and Barattieri, Basu, and Gottschalk (2014). Consequently, inflation tends\nto drain worker purchasing power in the short run.\n8 See, for example, Feldstein (1982).\n9 Owing to contractual and other institutional arrangements, it may be difficult to adjust these streams of payments\npromptly once it emerges that the inflation rate is higher or lower than expected.\n\nThe fact that much of the financial system is based on nominal payments also makes it\nclear that unexpectedly or unduly low inflation rates have important economic costs, too,\nincluding by saddling borrowers (debtors) with very high repayment burdens in real terms.\nConsider homeowners who take out a conventional fixed-rate mortgage, with the expectation\ntheir nominal incomes will rise about 2 percent per year. If the economy were instead to\nexperience deflation accompanied by flat or declining wages, then after a few years the\nhomeowners might find it considerably more difficult to cover their monthly fixed mortgage\npayments than they had originally anticipated. This increase in the real value of debts due to\nvery low inflation or, worse, outright deflation would also be a burden on all households that\nhave outstanding fixed nominal student loans, auto loans, or credit card debt, as well as\nbusinesses that had taken out bank loans or issued bonds.\nIn 2012, the FOMC set a formal inflation target to help households and businesses\nunderstand our goal and help keep inflation expectations anchored over time. The FOMC’s\nchoice of a 2 percent inflation rate, instead of zero, reflected the judgment that reasonable price\nstability was desirable while also recognizing the reality that very low inflation can also be\neconomically costly.10 In addition, a zero percent goal would make the longer-run nominal\ninterest rate 2 percentage points lower than would be the case under a 2 percent inflation goal. A\nzero-inflation environment would consequently restrict the FOMC’s scope to lower nominal\ninterest rates when this was necessary for stabilization purposes. In contrast, a 2 percent\ninflation rate is still low enough to be consistent with price stability but gives the FOMC greater\n10 The Federal Reserve has had price stability as a formal part of its mandate since 1977. In 2012, the 2 percent\ninflation objective was seen as formalizing judgments that the Committee had already made over the previous years\nabout the appropriate inflation rate. For analyses of how the Federal Reserve has interpreted its price-stability\nmandate over time, see the transcript of the FOMC’s January 24–25, 2012, meeting, which is available on the\nBoard’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC20120125meeting.pdf; see also\nOrphanides (2006) and Nelson (2021).\n\nscope to stimulate the economy in times when it judges that achievement of maximum\nemployment requires that the Committee provide policy accommodation.\nFrom these considerations flows the conclusion that a 2 percent inflation rate is the price-\nstability objective most consistent with the FOMC’s dual mandate. The 2 percent longer-run\ninflation goal has been maintained since 2012.\nPolicy Risks and the Benefits of Credibility\nOften, the FOMC must balance competing risks given its dual mandate of promoting\nmaximum employment and stable prices. In the current context, there is, on the one hand, the\nrisk that monetary policy will not be sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation back to 2 percent\nover time, and on the other hand there is a risk of policy being too restrictive and unnecessarily\nincreasing the likelihood of recession. In the face of this latter risk, some economists argue that\na higher inflation target is better than the Fed’s current 2 percent target rate.11 Changing the\nFOMC’s longer-run inflation objective, however, would introduce an additional risk by calling\ninto question the FOMC’s commitment to stabilizing inflation at any level because it might lead\npeople to suspect that the target could be changed opportunistically in the future. If so, then\nthese reputational costs will undermine the key benefits of well-anchored longer-run inflation\nexpectations discussed above: an increased ability of monetary policy to fight economic\ndownturns without sacrificing price stability. Moreover, if the purpose of a higher inflation\n11 See, for example, Summers (1991) and Reifschneider and Williams (2000). Blanchard, Dell’Ariccia, and Mauro\n(2010), among others, have suggested that central banks should consider raising their target inflation rate, on the\ngrounds that conditions since the financial crisis have demonstrated that monetary policy is more constrained by the\neffective lower bound (ELB) on nominal interest rates than was originally estimated. Ball (2013), for example, has\nproposed 4 percent as a more appropriate target for the FOMC. While it is certainly likely that earlier analyses of\nthe implications of the ELB significantly underestimated the likelihood of severe recessions and slow recoveries of\nthe sort recently experienced in the United States and elsewhere (see Chung and others, 2012), it is also the case that\nthese analyses did not consider central banks’ ability to use large-scale asset purchases and other unconventional\ntools as a means of providing economic stabilization in the presence of the ELB constraint.\n\ntarget is to increase the ability of the central bank to deal with the severe recessions that follow\nfinancial crises, then a better strategic approach might be to rely on more vigorous supervisory\nand macroprudential policies that could help reduce the likelihood of such events. Further,\nseeking an inflation rate in the vicinity of 4 percent or higher would certainly stretch the meaning\nof “stable prices” in the Federal Reserve Act.12\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, today, I have discussed with you how persistently high inflation hurts\neveryone and how the Fed must jointly achieve price stability and maximum employment to\nfulfill its dual mandate over time. I also discussed how persistently low inflation is costly, and\nhow changing the 2 percent inflation target would damage the central bank’s credibility. For\nthese reasons, I am committed to lowering inflation to our 2 percent target.\nThis is a very exciting time to study economics. I hope that the ways of thinking you are\ndeveloping in this class will help you better understand economic phenomena that you observe\nand the challenges that policymakers face.\nThank you.\n12 In rejecting a 4 percent inflation target, Bernanke (2010a) suggests that “inflation would be higher and probably\nmore volatile under such a policy” and “inflation expectations would also likely become significantly less stable.”\nAccording to Bernanke (2010b), “The Federal Reserve over a long period of time has established a great deal of\ncredibility in terms of keeping inflation low, around 2 percent . . . If we were to go to 4 percent, and say we’re going\nto 4 percent, we would risk I think losing a lot of that hard-won credibility because folks would say, well, if we go to\n4, why not go to 6 . . . It would be very difficult to tie down credible expectations at 4.”\n\nReferences\nBall, Laurence (2013). “The Case for Four Percent Inflation,” Central Bank of the Republic of\nTurkey, Central Bank Review, vol. 13 (May), pp. 17–31.\nBarattieri, Alessandro, Susanto Basu, and Peter Gottschalk (2014). “Some Evidence on the\nImportance of Sticky Wages,” American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics, vol. 6\n(January), pp. 70–101.\nBernanke, Ben (2010a). “The Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy,” speech delivered at the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Economic Symposium, Jackson Hole, Wyoming,\nAugust 27, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20100827a.htm.\n——— (2010b). “Statement of the Honorable Ben Bernanke, Chairman, Board of Governors of\nthe Federal Reserve System,” in The Economic Outlook, hearing before the Joint\nEconomic Committee, U.S. Congress, April 14, Senate Hearing 111-583, 111 Cong.\nWashington: Government Printing Office.\nBernanke, Ben S., Thomas Laubach, Frederic S.

    "text": "For release on delivery\n7:30 p.m. EST\nFebruary 4, 2025\nU.S. Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy\nRemarks by\nPhilip N. Jefferson\nVice Chair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nEconomics Department Special Lecture, Lafayette College\nEaston, Pennsylvania\nFebruary 4, 2025\n\nThank you, Professor Smith. It is an honor to be speaking to you today here at\nLafayette College.1 I am glad to have the opportunity to return to such a historically\nimportant place as Easton, Pennsylvania, and the Lehigh Valley. This area was part of\nthis country’s colonial beginnings, it was instrumental in the rising of the industrial age,\nand, as the home to Crayola, it very literally played a role in coloring how we see the\nworld. Today, this region is leading the way forward with its many outstanding\ninstitutions of higher education, very prominently including, of course, Lafayette College.\nToday, I would like to take this opportunity to share with you my outlook for the\nU.S. economy and my views of appropriate monetary policy. This is a useful time to do\nthat, as my colleagues and I on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the\nFederal Reserve’s primary monetary policymaking body, held our first meeting of 2025\njust last week.\nOverall, the U.S. economy is starting the year in a good position. I expect\ninflation’s slow descent to continue, and I anticipate that economic growth and labor\nmarket conditions will remain solid. I have learned, however, that it is wise to be humble\nabout my projections. There is always a great deal of uncertainty around any economic\nforecast, and currently we face additional uncertainties about the exact shape of\ngovernment policies, as well as their economic implications.\nLast week, my FOMC colleagues and I discussed the latest economic\ndevelopments and reviewed data that arrived since our previous policy meeting in\nDecember. At the conclusion of that meeting, I voted in support of the Committee’s\ndecision to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent.\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nThis decision was made in support of our goals to achieve maximum employment and\ninflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. I remain focused on setting policy to\nachieve the dual-mandate goals given to us by Congress: maximum employment and\nstable prices. Sound monetary policy and positive supply-side developments have\ncontributed to the achievement of sustained economic growth in recent years, the return\nof low unemployment, and inflation moving sustainably toward our 2 percent objective.\nI remain committed to returning inflation to our target while sustaining the solid labor\nmarket. Now is an appropriate time to assess the path forward for the economy. I am\nhappy to be here today to share my views with you.\nEconomic Activity\nThe U.S. economy appears to be maintaining its momentum after growing at a\nsolid pace last year. Last year’s growth was notable because many private forecasters in\n2023 projected a significant downturn sometime in 2024.2 However, data over the past\nyear painted a very different picture. GDP grew 2.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2024,\naccording to last week’s data release.3 As you can see in figure 1, that extends a stretch\nof solid quarterly growth over the past couple of years. Shortly, when I discuss the labor\nmarket, I will say more related to the large swing in GDP growth in 2020 that stands out\nin this chart. For all of 2024, the economy grew 2.5 percent, which is a modest slowing\nfrom the 3.2 percent growth in 2023. The economy has been benefiting from positive\n2 See Harriet Torry and Anthony DeBarros (2023), “A Recession Is No Longer the Consensus,” Wall Street\nJournal, October 15.\n3 See Bureau of Economic Analysis (2025), “Gross Domestic Product, 4th Quarter and Year 2024\n(Advance Estimate),” news release, January 30, https://www.bea.gov/sites/default/files/2025-01/gdp4q24-\nadv.pdf.\n\n- 3 -\nsupply developments, including more workers joining the labor force and higher labor\nproductivity.\nThe resilience of American consumers is the driving force behind the solid\neconomic growth seen in recent quarters. Household spending, adjusted for inflation,\ngrew 3.2 percent in 2024, slightly stronger than in 2023. The consumer spending data we\nhave received recently have surprised me to the upside. As you can see in figure 2,\npersonal consumption increased at a faster pace each quarter last year. Nominal retail\nsales rose briskly in the second half of last year. Private-sector data are consistent with\nGDP figures. According to private surveys of businesses, activity in the services sector,\nwhich accounts for about two-thirds of all consumer spending, has been on a general\nupward trajectory since mid-2020.4\nElsewhere in the economy, growth has been less robust. Residential investment\nhas been fairly flat over the past three quarters, and growth of business fixed investment\ncooled last year from its strong 2023 pace. Much of the equipment investment that did\ntake place came from imports. Indeed, domestic manufacturing industrial production was\nflat last year. Overall, I see the economy as continuing to grow at a healthy pace this\nyear, though I anticipate growth to be slightly lower than what we observed in 2024.\nHouseholds and firms face an uncertain environment, and that tends to lower consumer\nspending and business investment. If consumer spending continues to grow at the same\npace as it has in the past two years, however, that could cause me to revise up my outlook\nfor overall economic growth.\n4 See the December 2024 Services ISM Report on Business, which is available on the Institute for Supply\nManagement’s website at https://www.ismworld.org/supply-management-news-and-reports/reports/ism-\nreport-on-business/services/december.\n\n- 4 -\nLabor Market\nTurning to employment, I see the labor market as being in a solid position, with\nconditions broadly returning to balance after a period of being overheated. It’s helpful to\nstep back and look at the labor market’s path over the past five years. Looking at figure\n3, you can see that the unemployment rate surged in early 2020, peaking at 14.8 percent\nin April 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic first took hold and a wide swath of the\nglobal economy was shutdown. The unemployment rate subsequently fell swiftly as the\neconomy recovered. By April 2023, it touched 3.4 percent, a half-century low. At that\npoint, many employers reported that they were struggling to fill openings. Then, over the\nlatter part of 2023 and early 2024, the unemployment rate rose nearly a percentage point,\nan unusual pattern outside of a recession. As a policymaker, I took note of this rise when\nconsidering our dual-mandate objectives. Now, I have also taken note that the\nunemployment rate has effectively held steady since the middle of last year. I view that\nas a sign that downside risks in the labor market have abated.\nThe latest jobs report showed that the unemployment rate was 4.1 percent in\nDecember, the same reading as in June 2024.5 That is low by historical standards and\nclose to estimates of the longer-run rate that is consistent with our employment mandate.\nIn the three months ending in December, payrolls rose by an average of 170,000 jobs a\nmonth. While employment growth has eased somewhat from the early part of last year,\nthe steady unemployment rate suggests that payroll gains have been sufficient to absorb\nnew entrants to the labor market. The general moderation in hiring is consistent with\n5 See Bureau of Labor Statistics (2025), “The Employment Situation—December 2024,” news release,\nJanuary 10, bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf.\n\n- 5 -\nother measures showing that the demand for labor has come into better balance with the\nsupply of workers.\nLooking at figure 4, you can see that as of November, there were 1.2 job openings\nfor every unemployed person seeking work. That ratio is down from 2.0 in 2022, when\nthe labor market was overheated. Also notice that the current vacancy-to-unemployment\nratio is just a little below its value before the pandemic took hold. And while hiring has\neased from the pace in 2023, layoffs have not increased. As you can see in figure 5, the\nnumber of Americans seeking first-time unemployment benefits has trended at\nhistorically low levels for the past three years. Consistent with a moderation in hiring\nand a steady unemployment rate, workers’ wage gains have slowed from when the labor\nmarket was overheated. Still, the pace of increase in average hourly earnings has been\nhealthy, increasing 3.9 percent during the 12 months ending in December, and shows\nthat, on average, worker pay has grown at a faster rate than the rate of inflation.\nLooking broadly across the past several months, I see a labor market that is in\nsolid condition and not a source of significant inflationary pressure. While the downside\nrisks of a rapidly weakening labor market appear to have lessened, I expect some further\nsoftening that could cause the unemployment rate to edge just slightly higher this year but\nstay in a range consistent with recent readings.\nInflation\nThinking about the other component of our dual mandate, inflation has come\ndown a great deal over the past two and a half years but remains somewhat elevated\nrelative to our 2 percent objective. Inflation, as measured by the 12-month change in the\npersonal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, peaked at 7.2 percent in June\n\n- 6 -\n2022. Looking at the blue line in figure 6, you can see that it has since come down to 2.6\npercent as of this past December. Economists also pay close attention to core inflation,\nwhich excludes often volatile food and energy costs. That core PCE inflation figure,\nshown by the red dashed line, peaked at 5.6 percent in 2022. By December 2024, it had\neased to 2.8 percent. Annualized inflation over the past three months has been closer to\nour 2 percent objective. As you can see, the path of disinflation has been bumpy. I\nexpect that to continue to be the case.\nI find it helpful to look at the components of inflation to better understand\nunderlying trends. Looking at figure 7, core goods inflation, the blue line, is running\nclose to pre-pandemic levels, reflecting a better alignment between supply and demand\nafter pandemic-related distortions. Nonhousing services inflation, the red dashed line,\nhas cooled largely in line with slower wage growth. Housing services inflation, the\npurple dotted line, remains somewhat elevated, but I expect more progress in that\ncategory as the earlier slowing in growth of rents for new tenants feeds through into\ngrowth of average rents.6\nWith supply and demand conditions having moved into better balance, wage\ngrowth slowing to a more sustainable pace, and longer-term inflation expectations\nremaining well anchored, I see a path for inflation to continue its progress toward our\nlonger-run goal. While the easing of overall inflation in recent years has been\nencouraging, the fact is that it remains above our 2 percent objective. Monthly inflation\nreadings tend to be volatile, consistent with the bumpy path I described, but the 12-month\n6 See Philip N. Jefferson (2024), “U.S. Economic Outlook and Housing Price Dynamics,” speech delivered\nat the Mortgage Bankers Association’s Secondary and Capital Markets Conference and Expo 2024, New\nYork, May 20, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20240520a.htm.\n\n- 7 -\nreadings have held in a fairly consistent range somewhat above our target over the second\nhalf of last year.\nMonetary Policy\nIn the current environment, I attach a high degree of uncertainty to my\nprojections. As I have already mentioned, there have been notable recent instances where\nforecasters have been surprised. That said, I see the risks to achieving our employment\nand inflation goals as being roughly in balance, and I am attentive to the risks to both\nsides of our mandate. That better balanced position is partly a result of the monetary\npolicy actions over the past few years, which I will review briefly.\nAs you can see in figure 8, the FOMC responded to elevated inflation by raising\nthe policy rate 5-1/4 percentage points over about 15 months, starting in March 2022, and\nthen holding the rate at that restrictive level for more than a year. This contributed to\ninflation easing from a 40-year high to near current levels while maintaining a solid labor\nmarket. That outcome was historically unusual but greatly welcomed. By September of\nlast year, I had growing confidence that with an appropriate recalibration of our policy\nstance, strength in the labor market could be maintained in a context of moderate\neconomic growth and inflation moving sustainably down to 2 percent. The FOMC\nreduced the federal funds rate by a full percentage point over the course of our final three\nmeetings last year. As a result of those actions, our policy stance is now significantly less\nrestrictive than it was when we began lowering the federal funds rate. Given current\neconomic conditions—specifically, inflation that remains modestly above our target and\na labor market that is solid—and my projections of future economic conditions, I voted\nlast week to maintain our current policy stance. As long as the economy and labor\n\n- 8 -\nmarket remain strong, I see it as appropriate for the Committee to be cautious in making\nfurther adjustments.\nOver the medium term, I continue to see a gradual reduction in the level of\nmonetary policy restraint placed on the economy as we move toward a more neutral\nstance as the most likely outcome. That said, I do not think we need to be in a hurry to\nchange our stance. In considering additional adjustments to the federal funds rate, I will\ncarefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. As is\nalways the case, monetary policy is not on a preset course. To that end, I could envision\na range of scenarios for future policy. For example, if the economy remains strong and\ninflation does not continue to move sustainably toward 2 percent, we can maintain policy\nrestraint for longer.\nAlternatively, if the labor market were to weaken unexpectedly or inflation were\nto fall more quickly than anticipated, it may be appropriate to reduce the policy rate more\nquickly. Our current stance of policy is well positioned to deal with the risks and\nuncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate.\nAs I conclude, I want to assure you that I am mindful that monetary policy\ndecisions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. I highly value\nopportunities to visit places like Lafayette College and Easton to share my views, hear\nfrom you, and see how the economy is experienced firsthand in your community. I\nremain fully committed to supporting maximum employment and bringing inflation\nsustainably to our 2 percent goal. Our success in delivering on these goals matters to all\nAmericans.\nThank you.\n\nU.S. Economic Outlook and\nMonetary Policy\nPhilip N.

    "text": "For release on delivery\n7:30 p.m. EST\nFebruary 5, 2025\nDo Non-inflationary Economic Expansions Promote Shared Prosperity?\nEvidence from the U.S. Labor Market\nRemarks by\nPhilip N. Jefferson\nVice Chair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nSwarthmore College\nSwarthmore, Pennsylvania\nFebruary 5, 2025\n\nThank you, Professor O’Connell, for that kind introduction and for the\nopportunity to talk to this group.1 I am delighted to be back at Swarthmore College.\nThis special community brings back fond memories of fantastic students, great\ncolleagues, and pedagogical excellence.\nYesterday, I discussed my outlook for the current U.S. economy. I highlighted\nhow the economy is growing and appears to be roughly in balance, with low\nunemployment and declining inflation. Today, I will review some of the historical\nevidence pertaining to periods when the Federal Reserve has achieved both components\nof its dual mandate, maximum employment and stable prices, on a sustained basis—that\nis, periods of long non-inflationary economic expansions. My title question is whether\neconomic evidence indicates that such expansions also result in greater shared prosperity.\nMy focus will be on the labor market. A reason for this focus is that for many\nindividuals, their employment attachment is a key determinant of their household’s\noverall well-being. My approach will be to compare the current labor market with the\nlabor market at the end of 2019—that is, at the end of the most recent long, non-\ninflationary expansion. Such a comparison provides a lens through which to view the\nprospects for broadly shared prosperity fostered by the current U.S. labor market.\nThe remainder of my talk is organized as follows. First, I describe the labor\nmarket at the end of 2019. After that, I discuss the state of the labor market in the\nimmediate aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. Then, I describe the current labor\nmarket situation. Next, I discuss possible reasons why strong labor markets facilitate\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nbroad-based prosperity. Before concluding, I consider whether the benefits of long\nexpansions are persistent.\nThe Labor Market on the Eve of the COVID-19 Pandemic\nLet’s begin the exploration of my title question with a careful look at the situation\nduring the historically strong labor market on the eve of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nFollowing the 2007-09 Global Financial Crisis, the U.S. economy expanded for\n128 consecutive months, making it the longest economic expansion in U.S. history.\nDuring this period, as shown in figure 1, the aggregate unemployment rate fell steadily\nfrom a peak of 10 percent in October 2009 to 3.5 percent in September 2019, the lowest\nrecorded in nearly 50 years. Job opportunities were plentiful in this strong labor market,\nwith the ratio of vacancies to job seekers hovering around 1.2 throughout 2019, implying\nthat businesses were seeking to fill more open positions than there were workers actively\nsearching for employment. Moreover, while some long economic expansions have led to\nan unwelcome rise in prices, inflation remained low and stable. Indeed, the Federal\nReserve was grappling with inflation somewhat below, rather than above, its longer-run\n2 percent target.\nIn addition, and perhaps related to the length of the expansion, the pre-pandemic\nlabor market was remarkable in terms of the broad-based gains seen across demographic\ngroups, which contributed to a historic narrowing of employment disparities. For\ninstance, as shown in figure 2, the unemployment rate among African Americans, the\nsolid red line, has usually been about twice as high as that for white individuals, the solid\nblue line, and is more sensitive to the state of the business cycle. The unemployment rate\namong Hispanics, the dotted green line, falls between these two groups. In late 2019,\n\n- 3 -\nhowever, both African American and Hispanic unemployment rates had fallen to the\nlowest levels on record up to that point, significantly narrowing the persistent\nunemployment gaps between these groups. Before this, the greatest improvement in the\nunemployment rate among African Americans was at the end of the 1991–2001 economic\nexpansion, which itself was the second longest expansion in U.S. history. But in 2019,\nthe unemployment rate for African Americans was about 2 percentage points lower than\nit was in early 2001.\nThe influence of the long expansion on employment gaps also was evident for\nother groups of workers. Like minorities, individuals with less education, and especially\nthose who have not completed high school, also experience higher cyclical volatility in\ntheir employment.2 In 2019, as shown in figure 3, the unemployment rate gaps between\nworkers with less than a high school education, the solid red line, and those who have\nattained at least a bachelor’s degree, the solid purple line, also were near multidecade\nlows. Further, the strong labor market created new opportunities for teens and younger\nworkers, groups whose employment prospects, and even long-term career trajectories, are\nespecially sensitive to the cyclical state of the economy.3\nBeyond narrowing gaps between workers actively searching for a job, the strong\npre-pandemic labor market also helped draw many new participants into the labor force.\nAmong prime-age workers, those aged 25 to 54, the labor force participation rate began\nrising again around 2015, as shown in figure 4, reversing a declining trend. This was true\namong both men, the solid black line, whose participation had been steadily declining\nsince the 1950s, and women, the dashed red line, whose participation had previously\n2 See Jefferson (2005, 2008).\n3 See Oreopoulos, Von Wachter, and Heisz (2012).\n\n- 4 -\npeaked in early 2000. Labor force participation among women was rising especially\nbriskly in the months just before the pandemic, essentially reversing its entire decline\nover the previous 20 years. While this partially reflects broader demographic trends such\nas increasing educational attainment, participation was rising for both women with and\nwithout a college degree after 2015, suggesting that the strong labor market played a part\nin this reversal.\nTurning now from employment and participation to earnings, nominal wages\nwere growing solidly before the pandemic. As with gains in employment, the strong\nlabor market was especially beneficial for some groups. Most noticeably, as shown in\nfigure 5, wage growth for the bottom quartile of earners, the solid red line, started to pick\nup about five years into the expansion, in late 2014, and by 2019 was significantly\nstronger than for workers in higher earnings quartiles, the solid purple line.4 These\ndifferences in wage growth are important, as they imply convergence in levels and,\ntherefore, declining wage inequality as the bottom of the distribution catches up to higher\nearners. Similarly, wages were growing faster for non-white workers relative to white\nworkers in 2019, though differences by educational attainment were less pronounced at\nthe time.\nLooking back now, the U.S. economy in 2019 was in a good place. The labor\nmarket was tight but not overheating, bringing widespread gains to workers. Further, had\nit not been for the sudden and dramatic interruption of the COVID-19 pandemic, this\n4 Nominal wages in the figure are measured by the Atlanta Fed’s Wage Growth Tracker. Series show 12-\nmonth moving averages of the median percent change in the nominal hourly wage of individuals observed\n12 months apart. Workers are assigned to wage quartiles based on the average of their wage reports in both\nthe Current Population Survey and outgoing rotation group interviews; workers in the lowest 25 percent of\nthe average wage distribution are assigned to the 1st quartile, and those in the top 25 percent are assigned to\nthe 4th quartile.\n\n- 5 -\nstrong labor market was expected to persist. In December 2019, the median Federal\nOpen Market Committee (FOMC) participant expected the aggregate unemployment rate\nto remain below 4 percent through the end of 2022 while inflation was expected to move\nback up to the Committee’s 2 percent objective.5 Had this long, non-inflationary\nexpansion continued as the Committee forecast, gaps in employment and earnings across\ngroups may have continued to narrow as well.\nThe Labor Market Following the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe expansion, however, was cut short by the COVID-19 pandemic. In April\n2020, the unemployment rate, as shown in figure 6, briefly surged to 14.8 percent, its\nhighest rate since the Great Depression while the share of Americans seeking jobs (not\nshown) plummeted. Moreover, those same groups that had benefited from the strong pre-\npandemic labor market—African American and Hispanic workers, women, and\nindividuals without a college degree—generally fared worse at the onset of the pandemic.\nAlthough some of these groups typically experience greater losses in economic\ndownturns, factors unique to the pandemic, including greater exposure to the industries\nmost affected by lockdowns, also contributed to disparities in job losses. For instance,\nunlike a typical recession, the pandemic disproportionately affected service industries,\nwhich employ a larger share of women than industries like construction and\nmanufacturing, which are generally more cyclically sensitive.\n5 The December 2019 median forecast of FOMC participants is taken from the Summary of Economic\nProjections (SEP), which is available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm. FOMC participants submit\nprojections of future economic activity and their individual views of the appropriate path of monetary\npolicy conditional thereupon four times a year. These projections are published as the SEP. The SEP is\nneither a consensus forecast nor is it a commitment to a policy path. Rather, it shows the median, central\ntendency, and range of the participants’ projections estimated using the 19 individual projections.\n\n- 6 -\nJust as the pandemic itself led to unprecedented losses in the labor market, the\nsubsequent recovery was unprecedented in many ways. As the health risk abated and the\neconomy reopened, labor demand surged as businesses attempted to re-hire workers, but\nmany workers remained on the sidelines. By late 2021, the labor force participation rate\nwas still well below its pre-pandemic level. Vacancies rose to record levels, while, at the\nsame time, quits, as shown in figure 7, surged as workers sought out new job\nopportunities, leading some to refer to the post-pandemic recovery as the “Great\nResignation.” Consequently, as shown in figure 8, the gap between available jobs, the\nsolid black line, and available workers, the dashed red line, which had been just over 1\nmillion positions in late 2019, widened to over 6 million, the equivalent of two job\nopenings for every unemployed worker. This was an exceptionally tight labor market, far\nexceeding any in recent history, including the labor market before the pandemic.\nThe strong post-pandemic aggregate economy reversed the disparities between\ngroups that initially widened in 2020. The aggregate unemployment rate fell to\n3.4 percent in April 2023, its lowest since 1969. That same month, the unemployment\nrate for African Americans fell to 4.8 percent, the lowest level on record and\n1/2 percentage point below the previous record set in 2019, as shown in figure 9 by the\nred solid line, which is the difference between the unemployment rate for African\nAmericans and its own average in the year 2019.\nAlthough labor force participation was initially slower to recover, the labor force\nparticipation rate among prime-age women climbed to its highest level ever in 2023, well\nabove even pre-pandemic levels, as shown in figure 10 by the red dashed line, which is\n\n- 7 -\nthe difference between the labor force participation rate for women and its own average\nin the year 2019.\nThe tight labor market also led to a surge in nominal wage growth, especially for\nworkers lower in the earnings distribution. In fact, as shown in figure 11, wage growth\nfor low-wage workers, the solid red line, was strong enough, with a peak wage growth\nclose to 7.5 percent in 2022, to drive a meaningful compression in the aggregate wage\ndistribution (not shown). Economic research suggests that the pandemic recovery\nreversed around one-third of the increase in the aggregate ratio of the 90th percentile to\nthe 10th percentile wage inequality since the 1980s.6 These gains at the bottom of the\nincome distribution also were reflected in the experience of different demographic\ngroups, as shown in figure 12, with stronger wage growth for nonwhite workers, the\ndashed red line, relative to white workers, the solid black line, and, unlike even the pre-\npandemic expansion, for workers with a high school education or less relative to those\nwith a bachelor’s degree or more.\nUnlike the noninflationary pre-pandemic expansion, however, these nominal\nwage gains coincided with rising prices, reducing many workers’ actual purchasing\npower. Real wage growth deflated by the personal consumption expenditures price\nindex, which adjusts for the effect of inflation on workers’ purchasing power, was\nnegative for many workers in 2022, despite strong aggregate employment growth.\nFurther, the costs of inflation also vary across groups, and there is evidence that rising\nprices may hurt lower-income populations more.7 This underscores the connection\nbetween the two components of the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate to promote both\n6 See Autor, Dube, and McGrew et al. (2023).\n7 See Orchard (2022).\n\n- 8 -\nmaximum employment and stable prices, since the benefits of strong labor markets are\neroded when accompanied by an unwelcome rise in inflation.\nThe Current Labor Market Situation\nLet me turn now to the labor market situation more recently. As the economy has\nrecovered from the pandemic, the labor market has come into better balance. By mid-\n2024, the gap between available jobs and available workers—I’ll show that figure again\nhere—had essentially returned to where it was in 2019, reflecting both a decline in\nvacancies and improvements in labor supply. Various indicators pointed to a labor\nmarket that was still tight, but no longer overheating.\nCurrently, the labor market remains solid, on balance, and inflation continues a\nbumpy descent toward the FOMC’s 2 percent objective. Layoff activity and initial\nclaims for unemployment insurance, shown in figure 13, remain low by historical\nstandards even as job openings have moved down to more normal levels. The\nunemployment rate appears to have leveled off close to what the median FOMC\nparticipant currently sees as its long-run sustainable level of 4.2 percent.8 While\nemployment gaps between certain demographic groups have widened a touch since 2022,\nthey remain historically narrow. Further, a welcome development as inflation has\nmoderated is that real wage growth has picked up even as nominal wage growth has\nslowed. Though wages are now growing similarly across demographic groups, the\nnarrowing of the wage gap across demographic groups realized in 2021 and 2022\npersists.\n8 See the December 2024 median forecast of FOMC participants in the SEP, which is available on the\nBoard’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.\n\n- 9 -\nHow Do Strong Labor Markets Facilitate Broad-Based Prosperity?\nLooking back at long, noninflationary episodes like the pre-pandemic expansion\nraises the question of why strong labor markets have been especially beneficial for\ncertain demographic groups. Although the literature has not reached a definite\nconclusion to this question, researchers have pointed to several economic mechanisms\nthat may help explain these patterns.\nIn 1973, the economist Arthur Okun argued that “high-pressure” labor markets—\nsuch as those in 2019 and during the pandemic recovery—allowed workers to move up\nthe job ladder, creating new opportunities for individuals on the margins of the labor\nmarket.9,10 Further, he argued that when job openings are difficult to fill, employers relax\nhiring standards, creating new opportunities for individuals who otherwise might struggle\nto find employment. Consistent with this argument, economic research shows that as the\nlabor market strengthened from 2010 to 2014, employers reduced education and\nexperience requirements in online job postings.11 Economic research also highlights the\nrole of more productive job-worker matches as tight labor markets facilitate a re-\nallocation of labor to better and more productive jobs.12 On the participation side, the\nlabor force participation rate tends to respond to business cycles with a significantly\nlonger lag than the unemployment rate, for instance, due to the stickiness of decisions\nrelated to caregiving or educational responsibilities. This suggests that long expansions\nare especially important for drawing non-participants back into the labor market.13\n9 See Okun (1973).\n10 While there is no official definition of a “high-pressure” labor market, the term usually refers to a period\nwhen the unemployment rate is below its natural rate—that is, below its long-run sustainable level.\n11 See Modestino and others (2016).\n12 See Akerlof, Rose, and Yellen (1988).\n13 See Cajner, Coglianese, and Montes (2021).\n\n- 10 -\nOf course, each business cycle is different, making it difficult to draw general\nconclusions from past episodes. The pandemic recovery, for example, led to a rise in\nretirements, far more than what would have been expected given population aging.14 On\nthe downside, this contributed to the significant shortage of workers as the economy was\nreopening. On the upside, it may have created more opportunities for younger workers to\nmove up the job ladder than is typical during a normal expansion, making Okun’s\nargument especially relevant. The COVID-19 pandemic also was a remarkable\nreallocation shock, and elevated quits and job switching may have improved the quality\nof matches between businesses and workers more than usual, potentially contributing to\nstrong productivity growth and wage gains.\nPerhaps paradoxically, excessively tight labor markets may not be beneficial to\nlower-wage workers in the long run. Some economists argue that hiring difficulties may\nlead firms to adopt technologies that substitute, rather than complement, workers,\nultimately reducing labor demand.15 Similarly, an overheating labor market may lead\nsome workers to prioritize short-term gains over longer-term career stability. Empirical\nevidence, for example, suggests that during economic expansions some young people\nchoose to take an unstable job that is likely to disappear in the next recession, rather than\ninvest in training opportunities.16\n14 See Montes, Smith, and Dajon (2022).\n15 See Krueger (2002).\n16 Specifically, empirical evidence indicates that educational enrollment rates go down during expansions.\nFor four-year college enrollment rates, see Dellas and Sakellaris (2003); for community college enrollment\nrates, see Betts and McFarland (1995); for high school enrollment rates, see Dellas and Koubi (2003).\n\n- 11 -\nAre the Benefits of Long Expansions Lasting?\nAnother key question for policymakers is whether the benefits of long expansions\ncan be sustained, given that the same groups who benefit disproportionately from strong\nlabor markets also fare worse in recessions. Again, the literature, while not conclusive,\noffers some reasons for cautious optimism. There is some empirical evidence that\nsuggests that the benefits of tight labor markets are somewhat persistent, at least for\nAfrican Americans and women.17 The fact that labor market disparities that worsened\nduring the pandemic returned to their pre-pandemic levels so quickly following the\npandemic may be another reason to be hopeful.\nConclusion\nLet me conclude by offering an answer to my title question. The weight of the\nhistorical evidence I discussed today suggests that broadly shared economic prosperity is\nmore likely when the economy grows over time with low unemployment and stable\nprices. While the early part of the current expansion was inflationary, the intent of\nmonetary policy actions over the past few years has been to return us to a prolonged\nperiod where prices are stable and the labor market remains solid. The historical\nexperience of the U.S. labor market suggests that long, noninflationary expansions are\nassociated with narrower gaps in employment and earnings, with minority groups and\nless-educated workers benefiting disproportionately from sustained periods of strong\neconomic growth. Such benefits can help make up for the disproportionate losses\nexperienced by the same groups during economic downturns and, in some cases, may\neven lead to lasting gains.\n17 See Aaronson and others (2019).\n\n- 12 -\nFinally, let me return to where I started, the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate:\nmaximum employment and stable prices. The historical evidence that I have reviewed\ntonight suggests that shared prosperity is a byproduct of sustained accomplishment of our\nmission.\nThank you.\n\n- 13 -\nReferences\nAaronson, Stephanie R., Mary C.

I would like to thank the Atlanta, Dallas, and Richmond Feds for\ninviting me today and for bringing together this collection of expertise and research.\nToday I would like to continue the discussion you have been having about tech-\nenabled responses to the pandemic. Then I would like to delve a bit further into what\nthose pandemic-related disruptions have meant for economic activity at the microlevel\nand how the changes of the past few years affect how I view the outlook for the\nmacroeconomy.\nThis may be my first speech as a Fed Governor, but I am well aware of one\npractice associated with these occasions. That practice requires me to say that I am\nspeaking for myself alone. My views do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else at\nthe Board of Governors or in the Federal Reserve System.\nTechnology-Enabled Solutions to Pandemic Disruptions\nTurning to the subject of this conference, there is no question that technology\nhelped households and businesses to adapt and adjust in many ways to the disruption\nbrought about by the pandemic. Those adaptations—from enabling people to keep\nworking to helping businesses stay open—undoubtedly prevented worse outcomes. They\nalso likely changed the economic landscape for good and, in many cases, for the better—\nfrom hybrid working and how businesses approach distribution, investment, and\ninventories to the way consumers shop and pay for goods and services. Those changes\nare evident across broad categories, each of which this conference has discussed in some\ndetail.\n\n- 2 -\nSupply chain and business investment underwent, and are still experiencing,\nsignificant change. Large increases in computers and peripherals investment enabled\nremote work and helped to automate processes at physical establishments while\nsimultaneously minimizing in-person contact.\nLikewise, the labor market showed great adaptability in the rapidity and relative\nease that many sectors showed in shifting to remote working. Of course, that did not\ntranslate to all areas of employment, such as those jobs that require person-to-person\ninteraction. Nevertheless, technology allowed many employees to continue working\nduring a pandemic. Also, it likely had an indelible effect on current and future ways of\nworking, including encapsulating hybrid work and greater flexibility for employees as\nfixtures.\nThe shift to remote and hybrid learning, however, was difficult, but without\ntechnology, learning during lockdown might have ceased entirely. In some cases,\nschools were closed for only a few weeks or months, and the entire in-person learning\napparatus was replaced with technology-enabled remote learning. The teachers and\nadministrators—and I was one at the time—adapted remarkably quickly to a dramatically\ndifferent set of tools and techniques. Teachers, students, and parents made a rapid shift to\nan entirely new dynamic, often on entirely new platforms. We are still learning the\nlessons of that interlude, and they can influence how schools at all levels think about\nfuture planning. My colleagues and I recently heard from a community college\nadministrator about the challenges she faced. Training programs that fill worker demand\nin local industries require hands-on experience, which meant retooling the curriculum for\na hybrid environment. Student services also had to change to accommodate the increased\n\n- 3 -\nneed for childcare and other pandemic-related hurdles, or her school risked a drop in\nenrollment.\nThe payments system has also seen an acceleration in alternative online and\nmobile payment methods as well as contactless payment options. We all remember the\nonset of the pandemic, when social distancing became imperative and delivery and\ncurbside pickup became the norm for many. Remote card payments naturally rose as in-\nperson use fell. As stores reopened while the fear factor was still considerable, the\ncontactless payment options that were available on cards and mobile devices received\nmore attention. Such changes, coupled with the growing prominence of person-to-person\nmoney transfer apps, provided consumers with remote and touchless cash substitutes in\ntheir daily lives. The expanded use of those various payment options rested on the\nfoundation of an intricate, robust payments ecosystem. That system supported a\nmigration from in-person payment options to no-contact alternatives, helping restart the\neconomy during a time of deep stress.\nThese are just a few of the examples you have been discussing, and there are\nmany more. The pandemic, and the tech-enabled responses to it, changed the economy in\nfundamental ways that will likely not revert. It is vital to understand those changes and\nthe effects they will have going forward.\nAs an economist looking at these issues on a microlevel, I appreciate the expertise\non display at this conference. From my new perch as a Fed Governor taking the macro\nview, the research presented gives more context to the wider economic playing field.\nFrom either perspective, the technology-enabled responses and the changes brought about\n\n- 4 -\nby the pandemic itself are important issues for policymakers to understand. They affect\nhow we look at the economy overall.\nAs I look ahead, I am considering how those changes affect the outlook, and I\nwould like to speak a bit about how I see the economy evolving as we move forward.\nOutlook\nThe labor market remains strong, as can be seen across a variety of measures,\nfrom the low unemployment rate to the high quits rate, which illustrates the confidence of\nworkers who are willing to leave their jobs in pursuit of better ones. Labor force\nparticipation remains lower than it was prior to the pandemic, reflecting several factors,\nincluding people who left the workforce for early retirement and some remaining parents\nand other caregivers who stayed home through the pandemic. These are not factors that\nreverse on a dime.\nWith still-strong labor demand and sluggish labor supply, the job market remains\nvery tight. Workers are moving between jobs more rapidly than in the past, putting\nupward pressure on wages. In a market with more job openings than workers, the\ncompetition to fill vacancies is leading to rapid wage gains now, and the resulting salary\ncompression may lead to further upward wage pressures in the future. As growth has\nslowed this year, supply–demand conditions in the labor market—and the overall\neconomy—seem likely to ease some. We have already seen some indications from\nsurvey data, information from transportation hubs, and producer prices that supply\nbottlenecks have, at long last, begun to resolve.\nNonetheless, inflation remains elevated, and this is the problem that concerns me\nmost. Inflation creates economic burdens for households and businesses, and everyone\n\n- 5 -\nfeels its effects. It can also change people’s expectations about how long lasting price\nrises will be. Those inflation expectations can become entrenched and, in doing so,\nincrease the likelihood that high inflation will persist. While oil and gasoline prices have\ncome down in recent months, I am concerned that fluctuations in prices of the goods to\nwhich people pay the most attention, like food and housing, will affect expectations of\nfuture inflation. Thankfully, longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well\nanchored, consistent with our 2 percent target. I will be watching those expectations\nclosely.\nAn important outcome of the shifts you have been discussing, from firms’\nproduction patterns and distribution mechanisms to consumers’ purchasing decisions, is\nthat inflation dynamics likely changed also. How and why prices change require careful\nstudy and analysis, and a data-driven approach is more essential than ever.\nRestoring price stability may take some time and will likely entail a period of\nbelow-trend growth. However, I want to assure you that my colleagues and I are resolute\nthat we will bring inflation back down to 2 percent. The full effects of monetary policy\ntake time, but in my brief time on the Federal Open Market Committee, we have acted\nboldly to address rising inflation, and we are committed to taking the further steps\nnecessary.\nImplications for Policy Approaches\nThe fundamental shifts at the core of the economy shape my approach to policy.\nAs we are assessing the dynamics of the macroeconomy amid rapid changes, we will be\nwatching the data closely and applying rigorous analysis. My focus is on progress\ntoward our goal.\n\n- 6 -\nIt is too soon to say whether the pandemic and the changes it brought—many of\nwhich this conference has covered—are going to be permanent or ebb as time goes by.\nMy guess is that it is likely to be a combination of the two, with some features becoming\nembedded, such as new approaches to working and contactless payments, and others\nreturning to something like they were before, like the preference for in-person education.\nEither way, it will take time for these changes to prove themselves to be either\npermanent fixtures or temporary features. Research will play a key role as we try to\nanswer important questions. New data will help us analyze the changes to the economy,\nand research will assemble the pieces of the puzzle that show the bigger picture.\nAs we watch and assess developments in the U.S. economy, we will have to take\ninto consideration a multitude of factors, including those rooted in technology-enabled\ndisruption, and the strength and the staying power of the many forces that are shaping the\neconomy.\nThank you for your time, and I look forward to your questions.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n10:15 a.m. EST\nFebruary 24, 2023\nDiscussion of the Paper “Managing Disinflations”\nby Stephen G. Cecchetti, Michael E. Feroli, Peter Hooper,\nFrederic S. Mishkin, and Kermit L. Schoenholtz\nRemarks by\nPhilip N. Jefferson\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nU.S. Monetary Policy Forum\nNew York, New York\nFebruary 24, 2023\n\nThank you very much for inviting me to discuss this paper. It is a timely review\nfor central bankers charged with lowering inflation to targets or, in the terminology of the\nauthors, managing disinflation. I really enjoyed reading it. Before I begin, let me remind\nyou that the views I will express today are my own and not necessarily those of the\nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System.\nMy discussion time is limited. Therefore, I’ll be selective. I will begin by briefly\ndescribing what the paper is about. Then, I will summarize the authors’ takeaways from\ntheir analysis. Next, I will share my takeaways. Finally, I will offer some concluding\nremarks.\nSo what is this paper about? Conceptually, the paper can be divided into three\nparts. In the first part, the authors review historical disinflationary episodes in the United\nStates and other countries to see what lessons we might learn from past experience.\nIn the second part, the authors present a simple, tractable model that relates\ninterest rates, inflation, inflation expectations, and slack in the labor market. They use\nthe model to make predictions about future inflation.\nIn the third part, the authors provide advice to monetary policymakers on how to\naddress the current situation; that is, how to manage disinflation.\nWith that, let me cut to consideration of the authors’ takeaways.\nThe authors’ first takeaway, based on past disinflation episodes in the United\nStates and abroad, is that policymakers should expect that disinflation will be costly in\nterms of foregone output or employment. They find that all 16 of the large policy-\ninduced disinflations in the four advanced economies they study were associated with a\n\n- 2 -\nrecession.1 As the paper makes clear, however, a good measure of judgment comes into\nthe exercise of identifying and quantifying disinflationary episodes. History is replete\nwith confounding factors that make parsing difficult. These factors include supply\nshocks, labor market structure, economic conditions at the start of the disinflationary\nepisode, how “well anchored” are inflation expectations, and the speed at which a\ndisinflation is carried out. Even so, the authors are thorough in what they do. And while\none may quibble with bits and pieces, their argument that policymakers should accept\nthat disinflation is likely to be costly is well reasoned.\nThe authors’ second takeaway from history is that state dependencies or\nnonlinearities are also in play. The state dependency they note is that a higher initial\ninflation rate is associated with a lower sacrifice ratio. To explain this finding, they\nadvance an argument based on policy credibility. Specifically, they argue that a high\ninitial inflation rate enhances the plausibility of central banks’ willingness to incur the\ncost of reducing inflation. That strikes me as plausible on its face, but there are other\nstories that may also apply. In the interest of brevity, let me point out just one. Central\nbankers are constantly warning of combatting inflationary shocks before those forces\nbecome embedded in inflation expectations.2 The Volcker disinflation of 1981–82\n1 They draw this conclusion by replicating some of the methodology from the literature on sacrifice ratios.\nSee, for example, Ball (1994) and Tetlow (2022) and references therein.\n2 For example, Chair Powell, in testimony before the U.S. Senate, said, “We will use our tools to support\nthe economy and a strong labor market and to prevent higher inflation from becoming entrenched” (Powell,\n2022a). This reasoning has a lengthy history, as evidenced by remarks in 2008 by then Vice Chair of the\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System Donald Kohn: “As demonstrated by historical\nexperiences around the world and in the United States during the 1970s and 1980s, efforts to bring inflation\nand inflation expectations back to desirable levels after they have risen appreciably involve costly and\nundesirable changes in resource utilization” (Kohn, 2008). And the sentiment is shared internationally, as\nremarks by Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem attest: “If we don’t do enough [policy tightening],\nCanadians will continue to endure the hardship of high inflation. And they will come to expect persistently\nhigh inflation, which will require much higher interest rates and, potentially, a severe recession to control\ninflation. Nobody wants that” (Macklem, 2022).\n\n- 3 -\nresulted in a painful recession. But the reduction in inflation was large. Thus, measured\nin terms of percentage points of inflation reduction, as is conventionally done, it was not\nparticularly costly.3 A plausible, if partial, explanation for this finding is that the Volcker\ndisinflation was carried out before the inflation associated with the second OPEC oil\nprice shock had become entrenched in inflation expectations and more generally at a time\nwhen inflation expectations were fluid.4 This is relevant as my colleagues on the FOMC\nand I strive to bring down actual inflation promptly in order to preserve the “well\nanchored” longer-term inflation expectations we see in the data. It is also consistent with\nthe authors’ argument that swift and relatively painless disinflations of the past were due\nto early and sharp policy interest rate increases.\nThe authors’ third takeaway from history is that easing monetary policy before the\ndisinflation is complete, or easing by too much, is costly.5 My reading of this claim is\nthat while central bankers might entertain hopes that they will directly see a dividend\nfrom early, forceful policy actions, historical experience suggests that they should not\ncount on such a favorable outcome.\nAnd, finally, they argue that policy needs to look ahead and act preemptively.\nWhile the authors do not present evidence to support this claim, it is an argument with\nwhich policymakers nearly always agree, in principle, but find difficult to execute, in\npractice. As I’ll discuss in a minute, choosing the appropriate stance of monetary policy,\n3 Converting the unemployment sacrifice ratio in Ball (1994) into output space using an Okun coefficient of\ntwo renders an output sacrifice ratio of just 1.8, a small number by historical standards. For a summary of\nsacrifice ratios in history, see Tetlow (2022) and Cecchetti and others (2023).\n4 This may be related to the authors’ second conjecture on why initially high levels of inflation are\nassociated with lower sacrifice ratios—namely, that high inflation is associated with large global supply\nshocks (Cecchetti and others, 2023, p. 18). It is analytically distinct, however, in that they do not\nemphasize the timely monetary policy response to those shocks.\n5 This point is elaborated upon in Chair Powell’s 2022 Jackson Hole speech; see Powell (2022b).\n\n- 4 -\nin real time, to influence expected future economic conditions is a difficult task in the\nbest of circumstances. It is all that much more difficult when the economy is\nexperiencing a once-in-a-century disturbance of worldwide significance.\nAs you have already heard, the authors outline a very simple model that relates\ninterest rates, slack in the economy, inflation, and inflation expectations. They use this\nmodel to forecast inflation in the year 2021 and evaluate the model’s predictive\nperformance, employing alternative measures of slack, linear and nonlinear relationships,\nand different sample periods. Interestingly, the various measures of slack, and\nspecifications for slack, make little difference. The models do a little better when you\nallow them to see data from the era of high and volatile inflation in the 1960s and ’70s\ninstead of restricting consideration to the Great Moderation period, as empirical tests for\nstructural breaks would surely have suggested.6 Two key and related reasons for this\nimprovement are that inflation expectations in the 1960s and 1970s were more persistent\nand that the slope of the empirical Phillips curve was steeper than during recent history.\nThe authors’ policy takeaways fall into two classes. First, there are the\nconclusions that pertain to the current situation. They suggest that the unusually large\nand rapid tightening in policy in 2022 was good policy. In particular, the authors\ncontend, on page 19, that “the apparent anchoring of long-term [inflation] expectations\nmay reflect in part the FOMC’s unanticipated shift toward aggressive rate hikes.” In\naddition, despite the rapid tightening to date, the authors contend that additional monetary\n6 The borderline, as it were, between the inflationary era that the authors argue is critical for obtaining\nplausible results in their conditional forecasting exercise and the Great Moderation period is the Volcker\ndisinflation of 1981–82. Sims and Zha (2006) argue that the Volcker disinflation is the only regime shift\nthat can be unequivocally shown to be present in the data over the postwar period in their sample.\n\n- 5 -\npolicy tightening is likely to prove necessary to achieve 2 percent inflation by 2025 and is\nlikely to lead to a mild recession.\nSecond, there are the more general takeaways. The authors favor aggressive\nmonetary policy tightening—or preemption—over gradualism. And they argue that the\ncosts of increasing the target rate of inflation outweigh the benefits because the loss of\ncredibility from showing a lack of resolve to achieve 2 percent inflation will persist.\nNow, let me share my takeaways. First, figure 4.1 in the paper demonstrates that,\nstanding at the end of 2020, it would have been difficult to forecast the increase in\ninflation we observed in 2021 and 2022: The out-of-sample forecasts are far below the\nactual. This result stands despite the authors having benefited from knowledge of how\neconomic forces played out that would not have been available in real time. Here, I\nemphasize the unprecedented nature of the pandemic, with its wide-reaching economic\neffects and comingling of economic and public health policies. It’s just very difficult to\nformulate forecasts and implement preemptive monetary policy in real time, especially\nunder such extraordinary circumstances.\nA corollary, of sorts, of this observation is that the idiosyncratic nature of the\npandemic implies that economic models, while still useful in many respects, are going to\nhave limited applicability. Taken at face value, the model assumes, as all models do, that\nthe past tells policymakers what they need to know. But current inflation dynamics are\nbeing driven by some pandemic-specific factors not seen in the historical data. It follows\nthat policymakers need to look at a broader range of factors to understand recent inflation\ndynamics.\n\n- 6 -\nLet me illustrate this point by considering three large categories that make up core\npersonal consumption expenditures inflation. These are core goods inflation, housing\nservices inflation, and inflation in core services excluding housing. It’s useful to look at\nthese three categories separately because the driving forces behind each differ. Some of\nthese forces are pandemic specific, and understanding the different causes should help us\npredict what will happen to inflation going forward.\nFocusing on the price of core goods, the black line in the chart, you can see how\ngoods prices started climbing in the second half of 2020 and rose sharply in 2021 as the\npandemic-driven disruptions to social interactions induced a rapid shift in demand from\nservices to goods, exacerbating snags in global supply chains. By the end of 2021, once\nvaccines were developed and deployed and people slowly emerged from isolation, the\nshift in demand back to services began, and supply chain bottlenecks started to ease.\nThus, inflation in this category came down substantially over the course of 2022. The\nstrengthening of the overall economy may have played a role in core goods price\ninflation, but it was likely secondary to the roles played by goods-specific demand and by\nthe production and distribution network for goods over this period. In contrast, housing\nservices inflation, the blue line in the chart, picked up appreciably in 2022 after having\nsoftened early in the pandemic. Inflation in this sector is also driven by certain\npandemic-specific factors. In particular, the surge in work from home led to an abrupt\nincrease in the demand for bigger homes located in smaller metro areas or further from\ncity centers. House prices and rents increased significantly. We have not seen a decline\nin housing services inflation yet, but recent data on new leases and lease renewals\nindicate that we soon will. Lastly, we have inflation in other core services, the red line in\n\n- 7 -\nthe graph, a large category that covers activities as varied as travel and recreation, and\nmedical and legal services. Inflation for these services, most of which are labor\nintensive, has remained stubbornly high. An important source of inflation pressures in\nthis category has likely been the shortage of workers, which has pushed up labor costs at\nrates above those consistent with 2 percent inflation. The inflation outlook for this\nnonhousing category of core services will likely depend in large part on whether labor\ndemand moves into better balance with labor supply and growth in nominal labor costs.\nRecent data suggest that labor compensation has indeed started to decelerate somewhat\nover the past year but is still running too high to be consistent with returning inflation to\n2 percent in a timely and sustainable fashion. The point is that the inflationary forces\nimpinging on the U.S. economy at present represent a complex mixture of temporary and\nmore long-lasting elements that defy simple, parsimonious explanation.\nThe ongoing imbalance between the supply and demand for labor, combined with\nthe large share of labor costs in the services sector, suggests that high inflation may come\ndown only slowly. The paper notes the role of central bank credibility in managing\ndisinflations, but I do not attribute the persistence in inflation to a lack of Fed credibility.\nIndeed, there is evidence in support of central bank credibility, including that long-term\ninflation expectations are not far from the FOMC’s 2 percent target.\nLet me conclude with a summary of my takeaways.\nHistory is useful, but it can only tell us so much, particularly in situations without\nhistorical precedent.\nThe current situation is different from past episodes in at least four ways. First,\nthe pandemic created unprecedented disruptions to global supply chains. Second, the\n\n- 8 -\npandemic is having a long-lasting effect on labor force participation rates. Third, the\ncredibility of the central bank is higher now than it was in the 1960s and 1970s. Fourth\nand most importantly, unlike in the late 1960s and 1970s, the Federal Reserve is\naddressing the outbreak in inflation promptly and forcefully to maintain that credibility\nand to preserve the “well anchored” property of long-term inflation expectations.\nFinally, economic models are important tools but need to be used with careful\ninterpretation and judgment when history does not speak to the current situation. Sound\ndecisionmaking requires that their findings be complemented with additional analytical\ntools, including careful scrutiny of real-time data.\nThank you!\n\n- 9 -\nReferences\nBall, Laurence (1994). “What Determines the Sacrifice Ratio?” in N.

It is a pleasure to be with\nyou today and to be back in Cleveland and the beautiful Fourth district.1 It is always a\npleasure to visit the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland—and all the Reserve Banks. The\nhard work and dedication of Reserve Bank staff, leadership, and directors help ensure the\neconomic well-being of communities across the country, including in Ohio,\nPennsylvania, West Virginia, and Kentucky. One of the many important roles the\nReserve Banks have is to be the connection between policymakers and families, workers,\nand businesses in every corner of the country. That allows us to be well-informed and to\nmake the best decisions for the benefit of all Americans. I thank everyone here at the\nCleveland Fed for their service.\nAs we are gathered to discuss financial stability in an era of rapid economic and\ntechnological transformation, I would like to turn our attention to what many see as a\nsignificant catalyst of change: artificial intelligence (AI). Today, I will talk about how I\napproach thinking about AI. First, I will build on remarks I gave earlier this month and\ndiscuss how I see AI affecting the economy through the lens of the dual mandate given to\nthe Federal Reserve by Congress to pursue maximum employment and price stability.2\nNext, I will discuss AI in the context of financial stability because a stable and resilient\nfinancial system is, of course, critical to achieve that dual mandate. I will do so by\nhighlighting some of the findings in our recently released Financial Stability Report\n(FSR).

Afterwards, I would be happy to\nanswer your questions.\nAI technology has been advancing at an extraordinary pace in recent years.3\nHundreds of millions of people now regularly use AI to write and translate documents,\nobtain practical guidance on a variety of topics, and search for information.4 A recent\nreport from the St. Louis Fed showed that in August almost 55 percent of working-age\nadults said they used generative AI for personal or work use, up notably from a year\nearlier.5 Businesses are increasingly adopting AI, with use cases clearly moving from the\nexperimentation phase to operations. In the financial industry, AI adoption rates are even\nhigher.6 And while it may take some time before we see its full effects, many believe\nthat AI has the potential to generate substantial change across the economy and to be a\nvaluable tool for people all around the world.7\nAI and the Dual Mandate\nI see, as many others do, the promise for AI technology to be transformative,\nperhaps in ways as dramatic as past technological achievements, such as the printing\n3 See Microsoft (2025), “AI Diffusion Report: Where AI Is Most Used, Developed, and Built,” AI\nEconomy Institute, November, https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/aiei/ai-diffusion/.\n4 See Aaron Chatterji, Thomas Cunningham, David J.

When I think about the macroeconomic\nconsequences of AI, I consider how it will affect both sides of our dual mandate.\nAI can enable a worker to complete in seconds or a few minutes tasks that\npreviously took many minutes, if not hours. Already, it is boosting worker productivity\nin a wide range of industries and occupations, including customer service, logistics,\ncomputer programming, and medical research. Increased productivity leads to economic\ngrowth, which may also create new employment opportunities. There is already robust\ncompetition among high-tech firms for workers who possess the skills to develop and\neffectively deploy this technology.\nAt the same time, many people have legitimate concerns that AI will cause job\nloss. At least for certain firms and workers in certain occupations, this is likely to be true.\nIndeed, some large employers have recently indicated they are lowering overall hiring\nplans in light of advances in AI and other forms of automation.8 Some research has also\nsuggested that AI is having a more detrimental effect on the job prospects of younger,\nless-experienced workers, including recent graduates, compared with those further along\nin their careers.9\nThe net effect on employment is highly uncertain and may show variation across\nindustries and occupations over time. For the overall economy, one way to think about\nAI-related job losses—at least until it creates new jobs—is that AI can create economic\nslack. In a world where firms only deployed AI to replace existing workers, even at a\n8 For example, see Tom Huddleston Jr. (2025), “Walmart CEO: ‘AI Is Literally Going to Change Every\nJob’—How the Best Employees Can Still Stand Out,” CNBC, September 29; also, see Karen Weise (2025),\n“Amazon Plans to Replace More than Half a Million Jobs with Robots,” New York Times, October 21.\n9 See J.P. Morgan (2025), “AI’s Impact on Job Growth,” webpage,\nhttps://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/global-research/artificial-intelligence/ai-impact-job-growth.\n\n- 4 -\nlower level of overall employment, the productive capacity of the economy has increased\n(or stayed the same). Of course, if people get redeployed to more productive tasks, the\neconomy produces more without any additional slack. Whether AI substitutes for labor\nor complements it is an important question that requires continued study.\nOn the other side of our dual mandate—price stability—AI could help the\neconomy achieve higher growth through increased productivity while reducing\ninflationary pressures. Specifically, increased productivity could lower production costs\nand put downward pressure on prices. Not only could AI allow a specific worker to be\nmore efficient in their day-to-day tasks, but it also has the potential to allow for better\nthinking around complex problems. More efficient allocation of resources as well as\npotential improvements in supply chains could reduce associated costs, leading to lower\nprices for various goods and services. Conversely, AI could put upward pressure on\ncertain price categories as many firms push to scale up the technology. I mentioned the\nrising wages for certain workers with skills that complement AI. AI technology also\nrequires data centers, which compete with other production processes for land, energy,\nand other inputs. As with the labor market, the timing and degree of AI’s effect on prices\nare uncertain and should be monitored.\nIn terms of AI’s implications for monetary policy, it is likely still too soon to tell.\nPolicymakers must sort out changes in the economy that are due to cyclical factors from\nthose resulting from structural change, which AI may well represent. Productivity gains\nfrom AI may affect the relationship between employment and inflation and, hence, the\nconduct of monetary policy. Monetary policy decisions, of course, need to be made with\na broad view of what is happening in the economy, not just in one sector or technology.\n\n- 5 -\nThere is still much to learn. I counsel exercising humility about the challenges in\npredicting AI’s effects on employment and inflation.\nAI and Financial Stability\nNow, I will turn to discussing AI through the lens of financial stability. But first I\nwould like to step back and briefly offer my overall assessment. The financial system\nremains sound and resilient, with high levels of risk appetite and leverage at hedge funds\nbalanced by strong household and business balance sheets and high levels of capital in\nthe banking system. Because the continued resilience of the financial system is so\nimportant to achieving our dual-mandate goals, policymakers monitor a range of\nindicators associated with vulnerabilities, as is discussed in our semiannual FSR. The\nlatest version of that report was published a few weeks ago.10\nAs part of our financial stability monitoring work at the Fed, we routinely survey\nmarket contacts regarding potential risks to the U.S. financial system. A finding in the\nmost recent survey is likely of particular interest to a conference exploring financial\nstability in a time of technological change—30 percent of contacts surveyed cited a turn\nin the prevailing sentiment toward AI as a salient risk to the U.S. financial system and the\nglobal economy. That was up from 9 percent in the spring survey. Participants noted\nthat if such an unwinding were to occur, it could tighten financial conditions and restrain\neconomic activity more broadly. It is not my intention to make a judgement on the\nlikelihood of those, or other scenarios offered in the FSR. Rather, I want to reiterate that\nI am monitoring the scenarios.\n10 The most recent FSR is available on the Federal Reserve Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/financial-stability-report-20251107.pdf.\n\n- 6 -\nSome observers have asked about comparisons with the late 1990s, which was\nanother period when promising new technological advances were closely tied to strong\nstock market performance.11 They have asked, are we experiencing “dot-com boom\n2.0?” So, in the rest of my talk, I will address this question. I will argue that there are\nimportant differences between the recent period and the stock market experience during\nthe dot-com boom of the late 1990s. Of course, much has changed over the past quarter-\ncentury, so history can only be a useful reference and not a predictor of future outcomes.\nHow Current Conditions Compare with the Dot-Com Era\nI see clear differences across the two periods. Before I discuss three notable\ndifferences, let me first refresh our memory and mention a dimension along which the\ndot-com era and the AI era are similar—the particularly rapid stock price appreciation of\nfirms that encapsulate the promise of transformational technologies.12 Indeed, the stock\nprices of dot-com firms increased more than 200 percent during their boom between 1996\nand 1999, a little faster than the increase we have seen so far in the stock prices of AI-\nrelated firms since 2022.13\nA closer inspection of the firms driving the stock price increases, however,\nreveals the first critical difference in the stock market dynamics across the two periods.\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, many, albeit not all, dot-com firms typically had little\nto no realized earnings and only speculative revenue prospects even as they obtained\n11 For example, AI technology and its effect on financial markets is the focus of the 10th Foundation for\nAdvancement of Research in Financial Economics (FARFE) Conference. Information about the conference\nis available on FARFE’s website at https://farfe.org/Conference-2025.html.\n12 See Alexander Ljungqvist and William J. Wilhem Jr. (2003), “IPO Pricing in the Dot-Com Bubble,”\nJournal of Finance, vol. 58 (April), pp. 723–52; also, see Tim Loughran and Jay R. Ritter (2002), “Why\nDon’t Issuers Get Upset about Leaving Money on the Table in IPOs?” Review of Financial Studies, vol. 15\n(January), pp. 413–44. Dot-com firms are identified following the approach in Ljungqvist and Wilhelm Jr.\n(2003) and Loughran and Ritter (2002) by using a specific set of SIC codes.\n13 Similarly, the NASDAQ stock price index increased about 215 percent between 1996 and 1999.\n\n- 7 -\nexternal funding and were listed on public exchanges with relative ease amid pronounced\ninvestor enthusiasm. In contrast, the firms most closely identified with AI technologies\nin today’s market generally have well-established and growing earnings streams.\nThe second difference is that because of their solid earnings base, the price-to-\nearnings ratios of AI-related firms have thus far remained well below the peak ratios of\ndot-com firms in the late 1990s and early 2000s. During the dot-com episode, investors\nwere apparently far more willing to bet on the promise of the internet, with dot-com\nstocks commanding far larger premiums than AI stocks do today.\nThe third difference is that the proliferation of dot-com firms in the late 1990s and\nearly 2000s suggests a less discriminating enthusiasm than what we are observing in\ntoday’s market. At the peak in the late 1990s, more than 1,000 firms were publicly listed\nas dot-com companies, with many having minimal revenue and highly speculative\nbusiness models. Indeed, researchers have shown that the mere addition of “dot-com” to\na company name was sufficient to boost the stock price of the firm.14 By contrast, in the\ncurrent environment, by one measure about 50 publicly traded firms are considered to be\nAI-focused enterprises, in the sense that they are expected to derive revenue from other\nfirms using AI technologies, as opposed to the broad-based speculation that we saw in the\nlate 1990s. 15 However, it is important to acknowledge that the rapid growth of private\ncapital markets—which are not publicly traded—in recent years may obscure the extent\n14 See Michael J. Cooper, Orlin Dimitrov, and P. Raghavendra Rau (2001), “A Rose.com by Any Other\nName,” Journal of Finance, vol. 56 (December), pp. 2371–88.\n15 This assessment is based on the iShares Future AI & Tech ETF, which focuses on “companies that\nprovide products and services that are expected to contribute to AI technologies in areas including\ngenerative AI, AI data and infrastructure, AI software, and AI services.” Obviously, the number of firms\nthat use AI technology is much larger.\n\n- 8 -\nof investor enthusiasm for financing AI firms, as a growing number of private firms\nreportedly now identify as AI-focused or AI-native enterprises.\nFinally, with respect to financial leverage, both dot-com previously and AI firms\nrecently exhibited limited reliance on debt financing for the most part. This more limited\nuse of leverage may reduce the extent to which a shift in sentiment toward AI could\ntransmit to the broader economy through credit markets. That said, recent market reports\nsuggest that AI firms may be increasing their use of debt, from both public and private\ncredit markets, to fund substantial investments in computing infrastructure and talent\nacquisition. Just a few weeks ago, large volumes of corporate bonds were issued to\nsupport AI infrastructure buildout by key players in the industry. Some analysts estimate\nthat future investments in AI infrastructure will require a lot more debt.16 If that turns out\nto be the case, leverage in the AI sector could increase—and so could the losses if\nsentiment toward AI shifts. I will watch this developing trend closely.\nIn sum, looking at these dimensions, as of now, the differences between the\ncurrent market and the dot-com era make it less likely that we are witnessing a replay of\nthe late 1990s. Most notably, in contrast with the dot-com era, the current AI-related\nstock market activity appears more concentrated among established firms with actual\nearnings. Additionally, these developments are occurring against the backdrop of a\nfinancial system that is sound and resilient.\nConclusion\nTo conclude, it is important to acknowledge that assessing the implications of\nrapidly developing technology for financial stability is subject to a great deal of\n16 See Morgan Stanley (2025), “Bridging a $1.5tr Data Center Financing Gap,” July.\n\n- 9 -\nuncertainty. The ultimate implications of AI for both the macroeconomy and financial\nstability may take a long time to crystallize. Technology, the financial system, and the\nbroader economy are always evolving. The potential transition to our new world could\nbe bumpy, and it is too early to tell what trajectory will ultimately play out. Our research\nis continually enriched by the insights provided by market participants in regular\noutreach, keeping us abreast of the latest developments in AI and their economic\nimplications, and by an ever-expanding analytical toolkit, including AI. Ensuring that the\nAI revolution unfolds within the context of a stable financial system is not just\ndesirable—it is also imperative for achieving our dual-mandate objectives of maximum\nemployment and price stability.\nThank you.\n\n2025 Financial Stability Conference\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, Cleveland, Ohio\nNovember 21, 2025\nAI, the Economy, and Financial Stability\nPhilip N.

Jefferson\nVice Chair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nEuro20+, Deutsche Bundesbank\nFrankfurt, Germany\nNovember 7, 2025\n\nThank you, President Nagel and the Bundesbank, for the opportunity to meet with\nyou today.1 I am excited to be here. I cherish opportunities to talk with groups of young\npeople such as this. I spent most of my career as a professor and university administrator.\nI am glad to return to those roots a bit today. I will make sure I leave plenty of time for\nquestions. But I would like to start by speaking with you about a topic that’s been on my\nmind, and I bet it has been on many of yours: artificial intelligence (AI).\nOften, when I gather with students, consumers, or businesspeople, the\nconversation quickly turns to AI. And it is easy to understand why—you do not even\nneed to ask a chatbot! AI has the potential to transform how we work and how we live,\nand it could have a profound effect on the economy. Today, I will talk about AI’s rapid\ngrowth and how I approach thinking about AI by examining it through the lens of the\ndual mandate given to the Federal Reserve by the U.S. Congress. That mandate instructs\nAmerica’s central bank to pursue maximum employment and price stability. I will\ndescribe the effects that AI may have on both sides of that mandate. Finally, I will\nbriefly update you on my economic outlook before turning to your questions.\nAI’s Rapid Growth\nIn a few short years, AI morphed from the realm of science fiction to a tool that\nhigh schoolers use to help them do their science homework! Seriously, it is amazing to\nsee school children use AI to generate quizzes to prepare for exams, home chefs use it to\ncreate recipes for a wholesome dinner, and jobseekers use it to consider career tradeoffs,\namong many other purposes. Consumer use of AI has grown rapidly, and it is integrated\ninto a multitude of existing products, including search engines, phones, and vehicles.\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nAs of last month, ChatGPT, which is just one of a growing number of generative\nAI models, is used by more than 800 million people every week, an increase from 500\nmillion a week at the end of March.2 Enterprise use of AI has been growing too. A\nrecently released study showed that the proportion of Americans using AI at their jobs\nhas also been growing at a fast clip. Researchers found that workers’ adoption of\ngenerative AI rose from 30.1 percent as of December 2024 to 45.9 percent as of June and\nJuly of this year.3 And among survey respondents who had adopted AI tools, about a\nthird said they use them daily. That same study found that AI is most used at jobs by\nyounger, more highly educated, and higher-earning workers and that productivity for\nworkers increased substantially when using AI tools.\nThere is strong evidence that AI can increase labor productivity in various\nindustries and occupations. For example, a paper from Stanford economist, Erik\nBrynjolfsson, and coauthors showed the effects of AI implementation among customer\nsupport agents.4 They found that AI tools increased productivity—as measured by issues\nresolved per hour—14 percent, on average, and the improvement in productivity for\nnovice and low-skilled employees was much larger.\nAI is also advancing productivity in highly technical scientific research. Take\nprotein folding, for example. Proteins are the building blocks of the human body and life\n2 Rebecca Bellan (2025), “Sam Altman Says ChatGPT Has Hit 800m Weekly Active Users,” TechCrunch,\nOctober 6, https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/06/sam-altman-says-chatgpt-has-hit-800m-weekly-active-\nusers/.\n3 Jonathan Hartley, Filip Jolevski, Vitor Melo, and Brendan Moore (2024), “The Labor Market Effects of\nGenerative Artificial Intelligence,” unpublished paper, available at SSRN:\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.5136877.\n4 Erik Brynjolfsson, Danielle Li, and Lindsey R. Raymond (2023), “Generative AI at Work,” NBER\nWorking Paper Series 31161 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic Research, April; revised\nNovember 2023), https://www.nber.org/papers/w31161.\n\n- 3 -\nitself. They assume an almost infinite variety of shapes. Predicting those shapes—which\ndetermine their function—is vital for understanding how cells and diseases work and for\nfinding drugs to treat them. Just five years ago, scientists had a good understanding of\nthe structures of just 17 percent of the roughly 20,000 proteins in the human body.5 For\neach protein, that knowledge was earned through months or years of hard work and a\npotential cost of tens of thousands of dollars or more. Thanks to the development of the\nAlphaFold model, an AI system that predicts a protein’s structure, scientists now know\nthe structures of all the proteins in the human body—and some 200 million more.6\nMore broadly, like many others, I see the promise for AI technology to be\ntransformative, perhaps in ways as dramatic as past technological achievements, such as\nthe printing press, steam engine, and the Internet, which are known as general purpose\ntechnologies for their wide-ranging effects.\nLabor Market and Prices\nWhen I think about this technology, I consider how it will affect both sides of the\nFed’s dual mandate of promoting maximum employment and stable prices. As such, it is\nsomething that economists and policymakers must monitor.\nAI can allow a worker to complete tasks in moments that previously took many\nminutes, if not hours. That has caused many to question whether AI will lead to notable\njob loss. This potential disruption of labor is a real risk. By automating certain tasks, it\ncould lead to a reduction in some types of jobs. But increased productivity leads to\neconomic growth, which may create new employment opportunities. AI is also expected\n5 Eduard Porta-Pardo, Victoria Ruiz-Serra, Samuel Valentini, and Alfonso Valencia (2022), “The Structural\nCoverage of the Human Proteome Before and After AlphaFold,” PLoS Comput Biol., vol. 18 (1),\nJanuary 24.\n6 EMBL-EBI (2023), “AlphaFold Protein Structure Database,” webpage, https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/.\n\n- 4 -\nto create new job categories and transform existing ones. There has been robust\ncompetition among high-tech firms for workers who possess the skills to develop this\ntechnology.7\nMany have legitimate concerns that AI will cause job loss. At least for certain\nfirms and workers in certain occupations, this is likely to be true. There are many\nexamples where transformative technologies, such as the personal computer, did cause\nsome workers to lose their jobs, but we also saw new industries and occupations emerge\nbecause of the innovation. Indeed, some large employers have recently indicated they are\nlowering overall hiring plans in light of advances in AI and other forms of automation.8\nSome research has also suggested that AI is having a more detrimental effect on the job\nprospects of younger, less experienced workers, including recent graduates, relative to\nthose further along in their careers.9 The net effect on employment is highly uncertain\nand may show variation across industries and occupations over time. For the overall\neconomy, one way to think about AI-related job losses—at least until it creates new\njobs—is that it can create economic slack. In a world where firms only deployed AI to\nreplace existing workers, even at a lower level of overall employment, the productive\ncapacity of the economy has increased (or stayed the same). Of course, if people\nseamlessly get redeployed to more productive tasks, the economy produces more without\nany additional slack—more on this soon. Whether AI substitutes for labor or\ncomplements it is an important question that requires continued study.\n7 Meghan Bobrowsky, Berber Jin, and Ben Cohen (2025), “Zuckerberg Leads AI Recruitment Blitz Armed\nWith $100 Million Pay Packages,” Wall Street Journal, June 22.\n8 For example, see Tom Huddleston Jr. (2025), “Walmart CEO: ‘AI Is Literally Going to Change Every\nJob’—How The Best Employees Can Still Stand Out,” CNBC, September 29; and Karen Weise (2025),\n“Amazon Plans to Replace More Than Half a Million Jobs With Robots,” New York Times, October 21.\n9 J.P. Morgan (2025), “AI’s Impact on Job Growth,” webpage, https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/global-\nresearch/artificial-intelligence/ai-impact-job-growth.\n\n- 5 -\nOn the other side of our dual mandate, price stability, AI could help the economy\nachieve higher growth through increased productivity while reducing inflationary\npressures. Specifically, increased productivity could lower production costs and put\ndownward pressure on prices. Not only could AI allow a specific worker to be more\nefficient in their day-to-day tasks, but it also has the potential to allow for better thinking\naround complex problems—for example, in logistics and transportation. More efficient\nallocation of resources as well as potential improvements in supply chains could reduce\nassociated costs, leading to lower prices for various goods and services. Conversely, AI\ncould put upward pressure on certain price categories as many firms push to scale up the\ntechnology. I mentioned the rising wages for certain workers with skills that complement\nAI. AI technology also requires data centers, which compete with other production\nprocesses for land, energy, and other inputs. So, I think that AI’s effect on inflation is not\nsolely downward pressure.\nImplications for monetary policy\nSo, what do these still-developing labor and price effects mean for monetary\npolicy? The short answer is that it is likely still too soon to tell. As always, policymakers\nconfront the challenge of sorting out changes in the economy that are due to cyclical\nfactors from those resulting from structural change, which AI may well represent. Some\nof the recent changes in hiring patterns, productivity growth, and inflation are likely to\nrepresent AI-driven change, but it is difficult to know the degree.\nProductivity gains from AI may affect the relationship between employment and\ninflation and hence the conduct of monetary policy. For example, a productivity-induced\nboost to the growth rate of potential output could imply that monetary policy will not\n\n- 6 -\nneed to react strongly to what would have previously been perceived as tightness in the\nlabor market.\nThe uncertain implications of AI for employment and inflation could take some\ntime to filter broadly through economy. Also, AI’s effects will likely vary across\ndifferent industries and regions of both the U.S. and the world. And monetary policy\ndecisions need to be made with a broad view of what is happening in the economy, not\njust in one sector or technology. There is still much to learn. I counsel exercising\nhumility about the challenges in predicting AI’s effects on employment and inflation.\nPolicymakers, businesses, and individuals should remain flexible and prepared to adapt\nas the effects of AI continue to unfold.\nEconomic Outlook\nNow having discussed the policy implications of AI, I would like to briefly update\nyou about my current outlook for the U.S. economy. While federal statistical agencies\nare largely not producing data during the government shutdown, data available from\nother sources suggest that the overall economic picture in the U.S. has not changed much\nover the past few months. The economy has been growing at a moderate pace while\nlabor market conditions appear to be consistent with a gradually cooling. Inflation is\nrunning at a rate similar to that of a year ago. The lack of progress on headline inflation\nappears to be due to tariff effects, with signs that underlying inflation may be continuing\nto make progress to 2 percent. Market-based long-term inflation expectations continue to\nbe well-anchored. I remain firmly committed to returning inflation to the Fed’s 2 percent\ntarget.\n\n- 7 -\nI supported last week’s decision to reduce our policy rate by a quarter percentage\npoint. That step was appropriate because I see the balance of risks as having shifted in\nrecent months as downside risks to employment have increased. The current policy\nstance is still somewhat restrictive, but we have moved it closer to its neutral level that\nneither restricts nor stimulates the economy. Given this, it makes sense to proceed slowly\nas we approach the neutral rate.\nWith respect to the path of the policy rate going forward, I will continue to\ndetermine policy based on the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of\nrisks. I always take a meeting-by-meeting approach. This approach is especially prudent\nbecause it is unclear how much official data we will have before our December meeting.\nBefore I turn to your questions, let me conclude by saying that this is an exciting\ntime. It feels like we are at the dawn of a new age—an age your generation will shape\nand see come to its full maturity. By the end of your careers, many of you will take on\ntasks and accomplish feats you cannot even imagine at this moment, and AI technology\nmay well be part of that progress.\nThank you again for having me. It is an honor to be here. I am looking forward\nto our discussion.",

My thoughts are with the people and communities affected, including those in the\nDavidson College family. For our part, the Federal Reserve and other federal and state\nfinancial regulatory agencies are working with banks and credit unions in the affected\narea to help make sure they can continue to meet the financial services needs of their\ncommunities.\nI am happy to be back at Davidson College. This is a special community. I am\nbound to it by a shared experience defined not by its length, but by its intensity. As I\nvisited with you today, and as I look around this hall, I see the faces of colleagues who\nbecame dear friends during the COVID-19 pandemic. Back then, we spoke often about\nthe unprecedented uncertainty we faced. Amidst that uncertainty, however, we supported\neach other on this campus. Now, looking back, we can attest that this mutual support was\nvital. I am grateful to have been amongst you during that unprecedented time. Today, I\nam proud to see that Davidson is stronger than ever.\nI am excited to be here with you this evening and to talk to you about the history\nof the Federal Reserve’s discount window.2 The discount window is one of the tools the\nFed uses to support the liquidity and stability of the banking system, and to implement\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 The discount window is a monetary policy facility where depository institutions can request to borrow\nmoney against collateral from the Fed. The term “window” originates with the now obsolete practice of\nsending a bank representative to a Reserve Bank physical teller window when a bank needed to borrow\nmoney. The term “discount” refers to how depository institutions borrow money on a discount basis—\ninterest amount for the entire loan period (plus other charges, if any) is deducted from the principal at the\ntime a loan is disbursed.\n\n- 2 -\nmonetary policy effectively. It was created in 1913 when the Fed was established.\nToday, more than 110 years later, this tool continues to play an important role. At the\nFed, we always look for ways to improve our tools, including our discount window\noperations. Recently, the Fed published a request for information document to receive\nfeedback from the public regarding operational aspects of the discount window and\nintraday credit.3\nToday, I will do three things. First, I will discuss briefly my outlook for the U.S.\neconomy. Second, I will offer my historical perspective on the discount window, starting\nin 1913 and ending in 2000. Finally, I will provide a few details about the request for\ninformation the Fed recently published.\nTomorrow, I will say more about the discount window when I speak at the\nCharlotte Economics Club.\nEconomic Outlook and Considerations for Monetary Policy\nEconomic activity continues to grow at a solid pace. Inflation has eased\nsubstantially. The labor market has cooled from its formerly overheated state.\nAs you can see in slide 3, personal consumption expenditures (PCE) prices rose\n2.2 percent over the 12 months ending in August, well down from 6.5 percent two years\nearlier. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose\n2.7 percent, compared with 5.2 percent two years earlier. Our restrictive monetary policy\nstance played a role in restraining demand and in keeping longer-term inflation\nexpectations well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of inflation surveys of\n3 The Federal Reserve provides intraday credit to depository institutions to foster a safe and efficient\npayment system. For more information on intraday credit and the Board’s Payment System Risk policy,\nsee “Payment System Risk” on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/psr_about.htm.\n\n- 3 -\nhouseholds, businesses, and forecasters as well as measures from financial markets.\nInflation is now much closer to the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) 2 percent\nobjective. I expect that we will continue to make progress toward that goal.\nWhile, overall, the economy continues to grow at a solid pace, the labor market\nhas modestly cooled. Employers added an average of 186,000 jobs per month during\nJuly through September, a slower pace than seen early this year. A shown in slide 4, the\nunemployment rate now stands at 4.1 percent, up from 3.8 percent in September 2023.\nMeanwhile, job openings declined by about 4 million since their peak in March 2022.\nThe good news is that the rise in unemployment has been limited and gradual, and the\nlevel of unemployment remains historically low. Even so, the cooling in the labor market\nis noticeable.\nCongress mandated the Fed to pursue maximum employment and price stability.\nThe balance of risks to our two mandates has changed—as risks to inflation have\ndiminished and risks to employment have risen, these risks have been brought roughly\ninto balance. The FOMC has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving\nsustainably toward our 2 percent goal. To maintain the strength of the labor market, my\nFOMC colleagues and I recalibrated our policy stance last month, lowering our policy\ninterest rate by 1/2 percentage point, as shown in slide 5.\nLooking ahead, I will carefully watch incoming data, the evolving outlook, and\nthe balance of risks when considering additional adjustments to the federal funds target\nrange, our primary tool for adjusting the stance of monetary policy. My approach to\nmonetary policymaking is to make decisions meeting by meeting. As the economy\n\n- 4 -\nevolves, I will continue to update my thinking about policy to best promote maximum\nemployment and price stability.\nDiscount Window History\n1913: The Fed was established\nNow, I will turn to my perspective on the history of the discount window.\nUnderstanding this history is important as we consider ways to ensure the discount\nwindow continues to serve effectively in its critical role of providing liquidity to the\nbanking system as the economy and financial system evolve.\nBefore the Federal Reserve was founded, the U.S. experienced frequent financial\npanics. One example is illustrated in slide 6 with a newspaper clipping from the Rocky\nMountain Times printed on July 19, 1893. It depicts panic swirling against banks at a\ntime when bank runs swept through midwestern and western cities such as Chicago,\nDenver, and Los Angeles. The illustration shows how waves of panic hit public\nconfidence, the rocks in the picture, and how banks have a fortress mentality. They stand\nstrong against the panic, but they are not lending, and they are isolated.\nBack then, the supply of money to the economy was inelastic in the short term, in\npart because the monetary system in the U.S. was based on the gold standard. Demand\nfor cash, however, varied over the course of the year and was particularly strong during\nharvest season, when crops were brought to the market. The surge in demand for cash,\ncombined with the inelastic supply of money in the short term, caused financial\nconditions to tighten seasonally. The banking system was fairly good at moving money\nto where it needed to go, but it had little scope to expand the total amount of money\navailable in response to the U.S. economy’s needs. So if a shock hit the economy when\n\n- 5 -\nfinancial conditions were already tight, then the banking system struggled to provide the\nextra liquidity needed. Banks would seek to preserve liquidity by reducing their\ninvestments and denying loan requests, for example. Depositors, fearful that they might\nnot be able to access their funds when they needed them, would rush to withdraw their\nmoney. Of course, that caused the banks to conserve further on liquidity. In some cases,\nthey simply closed their doors until the storm passed. When banks closed their doors,\neconomic activity would contract.4 Activity would recover when the banks reopened, but\nthe economic suffering in the meantime was meaningful.\nIn addition to the supply of money in the economy being inelastic in the short\nterm, two prominent frictions, asymmetric information and externalities, made banks and\nprivate markets vulnerable to systemic crises. Here, asymmetric information refers to the\nfact that customers do not have access to all the information they need to evaluate\nwhether a bank is insolvent, illiquid, or both.5 Therefore, customers rely on imperfect\nsignals, such as news reports about another bank failing, to decide whether to withdraw\ntheir money from their own bank.\nThen there are externalities, in the sense that an individual bank may not consider\nhow an innocent bystander may be negatively impacted by its actions. When a financial\n4 See, for example, Goodhart (1988).\n5 Illiquidity is a short-term cash flow problem. An illiquid bank cannot pay its current obligations, such as\ndeposit withdrawals, even though the value of the bank’s assets exceeds the value of its liabilities. In other\nwords, illiquidity means the bank does not currently have the resources to meet its current obligations.\nWith a short-term loan, an illiquid bank would be able to pay its obligations. Insolvency is a long-term\nbalance sheet problem. Total obligations of an insolvent bank are larger than its total assets. A short-term\nloan would not help an insolvent bank. Of course, evaluating the quality of a bank’s loan book in real time\nto determine whether a bank is solvent can be extremely challenging during a crisis. In addition, in some\ncases, illiquidity caused by large deposit withdrawals can lead banks to sell assets at fire-sale prices that\nthen impairs their solvency. Conversely, concerns about insolvency, even if unfounded, can lead to\nliquidity problems. In the bank run literature, the connections between liquidity and solvency are a key\nfactor that gives rise to runs.\n\n- 6 -\ninstitution fails, that may lead depositors to withdraw money from other unrelated banks,\nwhich may in turn cause those banks to fail. Contagion can transform a single bank\nfailure into a systemic crisis, where many banks fail, credit evaporates, the stock market\ncollapses, the economy enters a recession, and the unemployment rate increases\ndramatically.\nThe severe financial panic of 1907 stands out as an example of market failure due\nto these two prominent frictions. The panic was triggered by a series of bad banking\ndecisions that led to a frenzy of withdrawals caused by asymmetric information and\npublic distrust in the liquidity of the banking system.6 Banks in many large cities,\nincluding financial centers such as New York and Chicago, simply stopped sending\npayments outside of their communities. The resulting disruption in the payment system\nand to the flow of liquidity through the banking system led to a severe, though short-\nlived, economic contraction. This experience led Congress to pass the Federal Reserve\nAct in 1913.7 This act created the Federal Reserve System, composed of the Federal\nReserve Board in Washington, D.C., and 12 Federal Reserve Banks across the country.8\nIn 1913, the main monetary policy tool at the Fed’s disposal was the discount\nwindow. At that time, the Fed did not use open market operations—the buying and\n6 The panic of 1907 started in October 1907 when three brothers—F. Augustus Heinze, Otto Heinze, and\nArthur P. Heinze—as well as Charles W. Morse attempted to manipulate the price of United Copper stock\nby purchasing a large number of shares of the company. Their plan failed, and the stock price of United\nCopper collapsed. The collapse led to depositor runs on banks and trust companies associated with the\nHeinzes and Morse. This included a run on the Knickerbocker Trust Company, whose president was\nconnected to Morse. The Knickerbocker Trust Company failed, and the New York Stock Exchange fell\nnearly 50 percent from its peak of the previous year in the wake of the failure. See Terrell (2021).\n7 To aid its thinking on reforming the monetary system, Congress established the National Monetary\nCommission. The landmark 24 volume report from the commission provides a rich review of the\noperations of central banks in other countries, a history of financial crises in the U.S., and an appraisal of\nthe state of the contemporary banking system in the U.S. at the time.\n8 See “History and Purpose of the Federal Reserve” on the St. Louis Fed’s website at\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/in-plain-english/history-and-purpose-of-the-fed.\n\n- 7 -\nselling of government securities in the open market—to conduct monetary policy.\nInstead, the Fed adjusted the money supply by lending directly to banks that needed\nfunds through the discount window. The Fed’s ability to provide funds to banks as\nneeded made the money supply of the U.S. more elastic and considerably reduced the\nseasonal volatility in interest rates.9 This ability also enabled the Fed to provide stability\nin times of stress, helping banks that experienced rapid withdrawals to satisfy their\ncustomers’ demand for liquidity and thereby potentially preventing banking panics.\n1920s: The Fed began to discourage strongly use of the discount window\nIn fact, many researchers have argued that the existence of the Fed’s discount\nwindow prevented a financial crisis in the early 1920s, when the banking sector came\nunder pressure as the U.S. economy transitioned to a peacetime economy following the\nend of World War I.10 There had been an agricultural boom during the war and a\nsignificant accumulation of debt within that sector. Farmers came under pressure as the\nprices of agricultural goods dropped from wartime highs. The banks sought to support\ntheir customers, and the Fed sought to support the banks. There were serious concerns\nabout the condition of several banks in parts of the country. The Fed’s discount window\nlending provided critical support that saved many banks but also resulted in habitual use\nof the discount window by some banks during the 1920s.11\nSlide 7 shows that as of August 1925, 593 member banks, 6 percent of the total,\nhad been borrowing for a year or more from Federal Reserve Banks. Moreover, there\nwere real solvency problems, and several banks failed with discount window loans\n9 See Miron (1986).\n10 See, for example, Gorton (1988). Willis (1923) and Board of Governors (1922) also suggest that the Fed\nprevented a crisis from happening in 1920.\n11 See Carlson (forthcoming).\n\n- 8 -\noutstanding. These challenges resulted in the Fed strongly discouraging banks from\ncontinuous borrowing from the discount window and the adoption of a policy of\nencouraging a “reluctance to borrow.”12\nBy 1926, the Fed was explicit that borrowing at the discount window was meant\nto be short term. As I emphasize in slide 8, the Federal Reserve’s annual report for 1926\nstated that while continuous borrowing by a member bank may be necessary, depending\non local economic conditions, “the funds of the Federal reserve banks are primarily\nintended to be used in meeting the seasonal and temporary requirements of members, and\ncontinuous borrowing by a member bank as a general practice would not be consistent\nwith the intent of the Federal reserve act.”13\nThe late 1920s also highlighted Fed concerns about the purpose of the borrowing.\nThe Fed sought to distinguish between “speculative security loans” and loans for\n“legitimate business.”14 A staff reappraisal of the discount mechanism stated that “[t]he\ncontroversy over direct pressure intensified in the latter part of the 1920s as an increasing\nflow of bank credit went into the stock market.”15 In short, the Fed observed that some\nbanks were becoming habitual borrowers from the discount window. It was concerned\n12 See Shull (1971, pp. 33–34).\n13 See Board of Governors (1927, p. 4). In 1926, approximately one-third of all banks in the U.S. were\nmember banks, holding about 60 percent of the total loans and investments for all banks; see Board of\nGovernors (1926). Banks receiving charters from the federal government were required to become\nmembers of the Federal Reserve System while banks receiving charters from state governments had the\noption to become members. Discount window borrowing was originally limited to Federal Reserve System\nmember banks. The Monetary Control Act of 1980 opened the window to all depository institutions.\n14 See Gorton and Metrick (2013).\n15 See Anderson (1971, p. 137). In the statement, “direct pressure” refers to the Fed policy of pressuring\nbanks not to borrow from the window. Congress may have shared some of those concerns, as the Federal\nReserve Act was amended in 1933 to include a passage in section 4 requiring Reserve Banks to be careful\nabout speculative uses of the Federal Reserve credit.\n\n- 9 -\nthat an overreliance on discount window borrowings would weaken banks and make\nthem more prone to failure.\nIn the late 1920s, the Fed switched to open market operations as its primary tool\nfor conducting monetary policy.16 That allowed the Fed to determine the aggregate\namount of liquidity in the system and to rely on private financial markets to distribute it\nefficiently. The discount window would thus serve as a safety valve if there was a shock\nthat caused conditions to tighten unexpectedly or if individual banks experienced\nidiosyncratic shocks or somehow lost access to interbank markets.\nThe intention of this set-up was for banks to use the discount window to borrow\nfrom the Fed only occasionally. Ordinarily and predominantly, financial institutions\nwere supposed to rely on private markets for their funding. This set-up was designed to\nlimit moral hazard—the possibility that institutions take unnecessary risks when there is\nno market discipline. This is the key balancing act. The Fed needs to be a reliable\nbackstop to prevent financial crises, but it also needs to minimize moral hazard that\ncomes from always standing ready to provide support.\n1930s–1940s: The Great Depression and WWII\nDuring the Great Depression in the 1930s, the banking system experienced severe\nstress, including many bank runs. There are many reasons why the discount window was\ninsufficient to address the problems in the banking system in the 1930s. I will highlight\nonly two. First, many banks were insolvent rather than illiquid. Central bank lending is\nnot a fundamental solution in those circumstances. When banks are insolvent, it is\n16 Open market operations are the purchase or sale of securities (for example, U.S. Treasury bonds) in the\nopen market by the Fed. In modern times, the short-term objective for open market operations is specified\nby the FOMC. For more information, please refer to “Open Market Operations” on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/openmarket.htm.\n\n- 10 -\nimportant to manage the closure in as orderly a manner as possible. The establishment of\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) in 1933 gave bank regulators\nincreased ability to do that. Relatedly, the challenging experiences of lending to troubled\nbanks in the 1920s likely made the Fed more reluctant to lend in circumstances in which\nsolvency concerns were material. Second, the types of collateral that the Fed was\ninitially able to accept when lending to banks were quite limited.\nIn response, in the early 1930s Congress expanded the range of banking assets\nthat could serve as collateral for discount window loans and added a variety of new Fed\nemergency lending authorities.17 These new lending authorities were used in the 1930s\nto help alleviate distress. Some were also used in the early 1940s as the Fed helped\nsupport the World War II mobilization effort.\nThe period following the war was relatively calm. The role of the discount\nwindow shifted from addressing distress in the banking system to acting as a safety valve\nto manage tightness in money markets and support monetary policy operations.\n1950–2000: Measures to discourage discount window borrowing\nIn March 1951, the U.S. Treasury and the Fed reached an agreement to separate\ngovernment debt management from the conduct of monetary policy, thereby laying the\nfoundation for the modern Fed.18\n17 There are several banking acts that do this, but especially the Banking Act of 1932, the Emergency Relief\nand Construction Act of 1932, and the Banking Act of 1935. Yet one more reason why the discount\nwindow was insufficient to address the problems of the banking system in the 1930s is that, during this\nperiod, nonmember banks did not have access to the discount window. These banks suffered the most\nduring the Great Depression. The ability of nonmember banks to access the window only changed in 1980\nwith the Monetary Control Act.\n18 After the U.S. entered World War II, the Federal Reserve supported efforts by the Treasury to hold down\nthe cost of financing the war by establishing caps on interest rates on Treasury securities (see, for instance,\nMeltzer, 2003, Chapter 7). The cap pertaining to longer-term interest rates continued to be in place until\nthe 1951 agreement.\n\n- 11 -\nIn the 1950s, the Fed set the interest rate on discount window loans above market\nrates. Thus, it served as an effective ceiling on the federal funds rate. The Fed continued\nto discourage extensive use of the discount window, but the relatively high interest rate\nalso made its sustained use less attractive.\nIn the 1960s, the Fed placed greater emphasis on open market operations to set its\nmonetary policy stance. Concurrently, the Fed shifted to a policy of setting the interest\nrate on discount window loans below the market rates. Because the interest rate no\nlonger deterred use of the window, the Fed turned increasingly to other measures, such as\nadministrative pressures and moral suasion, to limit the frequency with which banks\nrequested loans from the discount window. Indeed, between the late 1920s and the\n1980s, the Fed adopted and amended numerous restrictions on discount window\nborrowing. Whenever discount window usage increased too much, the Fed tightened the\nrestrictions to suppress borrowing.\nFor example, in the 1950s, the Fed defined appropriate and inappropriate discount\nwindow borrowing. In particular, the Board’s regulations in 1955 stated that “[u]nder\nordinary conditions, the continuous use of Federal Reserve credit by a member bank over\na considerable period of time is not regarded as appropriate” and provided more details\non how Reserve Banks should evaluate the “purpose” of a credit request.19 By 1973, the\nBoard had made additional changes to its regulations on discount window use and\ndefined three distinct discount window programs: adjustment credit, intended to help\ndepository institutions meet short-term liquidity needs; seasonal credit, intended to help\nsmall depository institutions manage liquidity needs that arise from seasonal swings in\n19 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Advances and Discounts by Federal Reserve\nBanks, 20 Fed. Reg. 261, 263 (Jan. 12, 1955).\n\n- 12 -\nloans and deposits; and extended credit, intended to help depository institutions that have\nsomewhat longer-term liquidity needs resulting from exceptional circumstances.20\nOver time, the Board added provisions in its regulations requiring banks to\nexhaust other sources of funding before using discount window credit.21 In addition, in\nthe early 1980s, the Fed levied a surcharge on frequent borrowings by large banks to\naugment the administrative restrictions.22 Despite these policies to discourage use of the\ndiscount window, slide 9 shows that discount window borrowing, adjusted for the size of\nthe Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, was notable in the 1970s and 1980s, suggesting that\nthe discount window was an important marginal source of funding for banks during that\nperiod.\nThat changed in the 1980s and early 1990s, when there were notable solvency\nproblems in the banking industry. During this period, the discount window provided\nsupport to troubled institutions, while the FDIC sought to find merger partners or\notherwise manage the failure of these institutions in an orderly manner. The discount\nwindow activity that took place while FDIC resolutions proceeded increased the\nassociation between use of the discount window and being a troubled institution.23 As a\nresult, banks became more reluctant to borrow from the discount window. The greater\n20 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Extensions of Credit by Federal Reserve Banks,\n38 Fed. Reg. 9065, 9076-9077 (April 10, 1973).\n21 By 1980, the Board’s regulations stated that adjustment credit “generally is available only after\nreasonable alternative sources of funds, including credit from special industry lenders, such as Federal\nHome Loan Banks, the National Credit Union Administration’s Central Liquidity Facility, and corporate\ncentral credit unions have been fully used”; seasonal credit was “available only if similar assistance is not\navailable from other special industry lenders”; and other extended credit was available only “where similar\nassistance is not reasonably available from other sources, including special industry lenders”; see Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System, Extensions of Credit by Federal Reserve Banks, 45 Fed. Reg.\n54009, 54009-54011 (Aug. 14, 1980). See also Clouse (1994).\n22 See Meulendyke (1992).\n23 A congressional inquiry found that this lending likely increased losses to the deposit insurance funds at\nthe time and led to limitations on the ability of the Federal Reserve to provide loans to troubled depository\ninstitutions as part of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991.\n\n- 13 -\nreluctance to borrow from the discount window made it less effective, both as a monetary\npolicy tool and as a crisis-fighting tool. That resulted in a series of efforts by the Fed in\nthe early 2000s to change how the discount window operates. Tomorrow, I will discuss\nthose efforts when I speak at the Charlotte Economics Club.\nA request for information\nBefore closing, I’d like to return to where I began. Understanding the history of\nthe discount window is important as we consider ways to ensure it continues to serve\neffectively in its critical role in providing liquidity to the banking system as the economy\nand financial system evolve. One way to ensure it continues to serve effectively is to\ncollect feedback from the public. Slide 10 provides some touch points on the Board’s\nrequest for information document. The request for information seeks feedback from the\npublic on a range of operational practices for the discount window and intraday credit,\nincluding the collection of legal documents; the process for pledging and withdrawing\ncollateral; the process for requesting, receiving and repaying discount window advances;\nthe extension of intraday credit; and Reserve Bank communications practices. My\ncolleagues and I are looking forward to this feedback to inform potential future\nenhancements to discount window operations. The period for responding to our request\nfor information ends on December 9, 2024.\nThank you to the event organizers and to the Davidson College community for the\nopportunity to discuss this important topic with you. It has been such a pleasure to be\nback on campus.\n\n- 14 -\nReferences\nAnderson, Clay (1971). “Evolution of the Role and the Functioning of the Discount\nMechanism,” in Reappraisal of the Federal Reserve Discount Mechanism, vol. 1.\nWashington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, pp. 133–65,\nhttps://fraser.stlouisfed.org/title/reappraisal-federal-reserve-discount-mechanism-\n1206?browse=1970s#3578.\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (1922). 8th Annual Report, 1921.\nWashington: Government Printing Office,\nhttps://fraser.stlouisfed.org/title/annual-report-board-governors-federal-reserve-\nsystem-117/1921-2479.\n——— (1926).

    "text": "For release on delivery\n9:10a.m. EDT\nMay 14, 2025\nEconomic Outlook\nRemarks by\nPhilip N. Jefferson\nVice Chair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nAnnual Conference of Second District Directors and Advisors,\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York\nNew York, New York\nMay 14, 2025\n\nThank you, President Williams. It is wonderful to be back in New York, and it is\nan honor to speak to you, the directors and advisers to the Second District. You all play\nan extremely important role for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and, indeed, for\nthe entirety of the Federal Reserve System. You, and your peers around the country,\ninform President Williams and the other Bank presidents about how you see the economy\nunfolding in your communities and in your industries. The presidents, in turn, share that\nvital information with all the members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)\nso that we can make the best monetary policy decisions to benefit all Americans. Thank\nyou for the important contributions.1\nIn the spirit of sharing information, I thought it would be helpful to share with you\nmy economic outlook. First, I will discuss how I see recent economic activity. Next, I\nwill talk about developments pertaining to both sides of our dual mandate, maximum\nemployment and price stability. Finally, I will offer my current view of monetary policy.\nEconomic Activity\nWhile the economy entered a period of heightened uncertainty this year, the\nunderlying data through the first quarter showed resilience. As you can see in figure 1,\ngross domestic product (GDP) contracted slightly by 0.3 percent in the first quarter, on an\nannualized basis, after expanding at a 2.4 percent rate in the fourth quarter of 2024. That\nchange, however, overstates the deceleration in activity. A surge in imports apparently\nahead of anticipated changes to trade policy did not seem to be reflected fully in\ninventory or spending data. That misalignment complicated the interpretation of\nmeasured GDP data. Private domestic final purchases, which exclude government\n1 The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nspending, inventory investment, and net exports, usually gives a better read than GDP on\nthe underlying momentum in the economy. That came in at a 3 percent rate in the first\nquarter, consistent with readings from last year.\nLooking at figure 2, you can see that inflation-adjusted consumer spending was\nstrong much of last year. Spending eased at the start of 2025, which could in part reflect\npoor weather and seasonal adjustment challenges. Spending bounced back in March,\nperhaps reflecting some purchases ahead of expected trade policy changes.\nOf course, those observations of first-quarter economic activity are now in the\nrearview mirror. Tariff announcements and heightened uncertainty about government\npolicies in general are the dominant economic developments of more recent weeks and\nhave caused me to look carefully at my forecasts. It is not my role to express views on\npolicies coming from the Administration or Congress, but I do study the implications of\nthose policies on economic activity and inflation.\nVarious surveys show a decline in business sentiment related to trade policy. The\nBeige Book reported that some retailers are expecting to raise prices in response to\ntariffs, which could then limit spending, especially by the most price-sensitive\nconsumers. Manufacturers saw risks of supply chain disruptions related to trade policy\nchanges. Moreover, uncertainty is quite high. As a result, I have adjusted down my\nexpectations for economic growth this year, but I see the U.S. economy as continuing to\nexpand. Of course, trade policy is still evolving, so its ultimate economic implications\nare not known, and I will be following developments carefully.\n\n- 3 -\nLabor Market\nTurning to the labor market, conditions continue to be solid. As you can see in\nfigure 3, the unemployment rate was 4.2 percent in April. It has fluctuated within a\nnarrow and historically low range between 4 and 4.2 percent since the middle of last year.\nU.S. employers added 177,000 jobs to payrolls last month, effectively matching the\naverage growth over the past six months. Payrolls have been rising at a pace consistent\nwith a stable unemployment rate and a flat labor force participation rate. Hiring has\nslowed from the rapid pace recorded earlier in the current expansion, but layoffs remain\nhistorically low. That can be seen in figure 4. New applications for unemployment\nbenefits this year remain in the same low range recorded over the previous three years.\nLooking at figure 5, you can see the ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers\nwas at 1 in March, well down from a peak of 2 in 2022. The measure is consistent with a\nlabor market that looks to be in balance and is not a source of inflationary pressure.\nLooking ahead, I am watching for signs that the labor market could cool as tariff\nincreases begin to weigh on economic activity.\nInflation\nRegarding inflation, recent data are consistent with further progress toward our\n2 percent inflation target; however, that goal has not yet been reached. Looking at figure\n6, the blue line shows inflation as measured by the price index for personal consumption\nexpenditures (PCE) has trended down from a peak above 7 percent in mid-2022. In\nMarch, PCE prices advanced 2.3 percent from a year earlier. Core PCE inflation, which\nexcludes volatile consumer energy and food prices and is usually a better indicator of\nfuture inflation, the dashed red line, was at 2.6 percent. Figure 7 shows the components\n\n- 4 -\nof core PCE inflation, which can provide insight into sources of inflationary pressures.\nHousing services inflation, the purple dotted line, has fallen notably since early 2023 and\ncould continue to provide support to the disinflation process. Core services inflation, the\ndashed red line, has largely moved sideways since the early part of last year, contributing\nlittle to further disinflation, and I largely expect that pattern to continue as well. In\ncontrast, goods inflation, outside of food and energy, the blue line, has picked up a bit\nthis year.\nThere is much uncertainty, however, around the future path of inflation. If the\nincreases in tariffs announced so far are sustained, they are likely to interrupt progress on\ndisinflation and generate at least a temporary rise in inflation. Whether tariffs create\npersistent upward pressure on inflation will depend on how trade policy is implemented,\nthe pass-through to consumer prices, the reaction of supply chains, and the performance\nof the economy. Short-term inflation expectations have increased in both survey- and\nmarket-based measures, but I think it is notable that most measures of longer-run\ninflation expectations have been largely stable, suggesting that the American people\nunderstand the Federal Reserve’s commitment to return inflation to our 2 percent target.\nWhile trade policy has received the bulk of recent attention, I remain focused on\nthe aggregate effect from the totality of different government policy changes, including\ntrade, immigration, regulatory, and fiscal policies, as well as their net effects on the\neconomy. This net effect will likely remain uncertain for some time.\nMonetary Policy\nLast week I supported the FOMC’s decision to hold the federal funds rate at\ncurrent levels as the best policy to achieve our dual mandate of maximum employment\n\n- 5 -\nand price stability. As you can see in figure 8, the FOMC acted last year to reduce the\npolicy rate by a full percentage point. Over the past several meetings, the rate has been\nheld at what I view as a moderately restrictive level. I view the current stance of policy\nas well positioned to respond to developments that may arise.\nWith respect to the path of the policy rate going forward, I will carefully assess\nincoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. Various measures of\nconsumer and business sentiment have declined sharply this year, and I will be watching\nvery carefully for signs of weakening economic activity in hard data. At the same time,\nhigher tariffs could lead to higher inflation this year. It is uncertain whether inflationary\npressures would be temporary or persistent. Our monetary policy actions are guided by\nour dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American\npeople. With the increased risks to both sides of our mandate, I believe that the current\nstance of monetary policy is well positioned to respond in a timely way to potential\neconomic developments.\nConclusion\nThe uncertain economic outlook presents a challenge for monetary policymakers.\nIt is critical that we have the best available information from a broad cross section of\nsources, which is again why your efforts to keep President Williams and other monetary\npolicymakers informed are so critical. Effective policymaking starts with hearing from\npeople in every corner of this country—including New York, New Jersey, Connecticut,\nPuerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Directors and advisers like you make that\npossible.

    "text": "For release on delivery\n9:30 a.m. EST (8:30 a.m. CST)\nNovember 17, 2025\nEconomic Outlook and Monetary Policy\nRemarks by\nPhilip N. Jefferson\nVice Chair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\nKansas City, Missouri\nNovember 17, 2025\n\nThank you, President Schmid, for the kind introduction and for the invitation to\nspeak here today.1 It is an honor to be in Kansas City and in the beautiful 10th District. I\nwelcome the opportunity to attend events like this one because I believe it is essential for\nFederal Reserve policymakers to share their views with the public and, just as important,\nto hear directly from business leaders, workers, and families about how they are\nexperiencing the economy.\nIn many ways, the Kansas City region is a perfect place to make those\nconnections. Sitting at the confluence of the Kansas and Missouri rivers, this area has\nbeen a place where people met and shared ideas long before the United States existed.\nAnd that tradition of making connections has continued to present day. The Pony\nExpress was founded just north of here in St. Joseph, this is the greeting card capital, and,\nnext year, this area will bring people together from around the globe for soccer’s World\nCup. I am happy to have the opportunity to continue the tradition of making connections\nin Kansas City with all of you.\nToday I would like to share my economic outlook. I will discuss how I see recent\neconomic activity and talk about developments pertaining to both sides of our dual\nmandate of maximum employment and price stability. I will then offer my current view\nof monetary policy including the Fed’s balance sheet before turning to our discussion.\nEconomic Outlook\nIn shaping my economic outlook, I consider a wide variety of government,\nadministrative, and private-sector data, including data collected by the Kansas City Fed\nand fellow Reserve Banks across the country. Casting a wide net for information on the\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\neconomy is especially important at this moment because the recent federal government\nshutdown has delayed the release of key economic indicators that I typically refer to in\nspeeches like this one, including the monthly jobs report and the personal consumption\nexpenditures price index. While I consider federal data to be the gold standard, other\nsources of information are also available for policymakers to do our jobs. And part of\nthat information comes from meetings like this one and hearing from contacts around the\ncountry. For example, ahead of our next policy meeting, I look forward to reviewing the\nBeige Book, a report on economic conditions in each of the twelve Reserve Bank\ndistricts, which will be released next week.\nEconomic Activity\nBefore the government shutdown, available data indicated that the U.S. economy\nwas on a trajectory of moderate growth this year. The shutdown has likely curtailed\neconomic activity this quarter, reflecting furloughed federal workers and the suspension\nof government purchases of goods and services, including payments to contractors.\nThere may also have been spillover effects to the private sector stemming from delays in\nfederal payments, approvals, and other government activity. I see those effects as largely\ntemporary and likely to reverse in the coming months. Thinking more broadly, I see the\nbalance of risks in the economy as having shifted in recent months with increased\ndownside risks to employment compared to the upside risks to inflation, which have\nlikely declined somewhat recently.\nLabor market\nIn the labor market, information available in recent weeks appears to be consistent\nwith a gradual cooling in both labor demand and labor supply. For instance,\n\n- 3 -\nunemployment insurance claims received from states have largely moved sideways in\nrecent weeks. Anecdotal reports about the state of the labor market have been mixed,\nwith some firms announcing a slower pace of hiring or cutbacks and others indicating\nthey are ready to move forward with previously delayed hiring and investment.\nI expect that the unemployment rate is likely to inch up slightly by the end of the\nyear from the relatively low 4.3 percent rate recorded in August. While still solid, I\ncontinue to view the risk to my employment forecast as skewed to the downside.\nInflation\nThe latest available readings show that inflation is running at a rate similar to that\nof a year ago, a bit below 3 percent, indicating that progress toward our 2 percent target\nhas stalled. This lack of progress appears to be due to tariff effects, with signs that\ninflation excluding the effects of tariffs may be continuing to make progress toward\n2 percent. Some firms have indicated that they expect pass-through of pricing pressure\nfrom tariffs to pick up in the fourth quarter as the inventory of non-tariffed merchandise\nis depleted.\nA reasonable base case is that tariffs result in a one-time shift in the price level,\nnot an ongoing inflation problem. That view is reinforced by inflation expectations\nreadings. Most measures of near-term inflation expectations have retraced their spring\nrise, and market-based long-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.\nSeveral factors will influence the size and persistence of the rise in inflation. Those\ninclude the final tariff rates that are implemented, the extent and timing of pass-through\nto consumer prices, the reaction of supply chains and domestic manufacturing, and\n\n- 4 -\noverall economic conditions. I will continue to monitor these factors closely. I remain\nfirmly committed to returning inflation to the Fed’s 2 percent target.\nMonetary Policy\nGiven that outlook, I supported last month’s decision to reduce our policy rate by\n1/4 percentage point. That step was appropriate because I see the balance of risks as\nhaving shifted in recent months as downside risks to employment have increased. The\ncurrent policy stance is still somewhat restrictive, but we have moved it closer to its\nneutral level that neither restricts nor stimulates the economy. The evolving balance of\nrisks underscores the need to proceed slowly as we approach the neutral rate.\nAt our past Federal Open Market Committee meeting, I also supported the\ndecision to conclude the reduction of our aggregate securities holdings as of December 1.\nOver the course of balance sheet runoff that started in June 2022, we shrank our securities\nholdings by about $2.2 trillion. The Committee’s long-stated plan had been to stop\nbalance sheet runoff when reserves were somewhat above the level judged as consistent\nwith ample reserve conditions. Signs emerged ahead of the October meeting indicating\nthat such a standard had been reached. In money markets, repurchase agreement (repo)\nrates moved up persistently relative to the interest on reserve balances (IORB) rate. In\naddition, more notable pressures on repo rates started to emerge on tax payment dates and\non Treasury issuance days along with more frequent use of our standing repo facility.\nWith repo rates trending up, the effective federal funds rate also began to move up\nsteadily relative to the IORB rate. Those developments were what was expected to be\nseen as the size of the balance sheet declined and led me to support the decision to end\nrunoff.\n\n- 5 -\nStarting in December, we intend to hold the size of our balance sheet steady for a\ntime as reserve balances continue to decline passively even as other non-reserve\nliabilities, such as currency, rise. We will continue to allow agency securities to run off\nour balance sheet and will reinvest these proceeds in Treasury bills, furthering progress\ntoward a portfolio consisting primarily of Treasury securities. Over the coming years,\nthis reinvestment strategy will help move the weighted average maturity of our portfolio\ncloser to that of the outstanding stock of Treasury securities.\nI will also note that, heading into our next meeting, it remains unclear how much\nofficial data we will see before then. With respect to the path of the policy rate going\nforward, I will continue to determine policy based on the incoming data, the evolving\noutlook, and the balance of risks. I always take a meeting-by-meeting approach. This is\nan especially prudent approach at this time.\nThank you again to the Kansas City Fed for hosting me today. I look forward to\nour discussion.",

Jefferson\nVice Chair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nMartin H. Crego Lecture in Economics, Vassar College\nPoughkeepsie, New York\nFebruary 19, 2025\n\nThank you, Professor Ho for that kind introduction and for the opportunity to talk\nto the Vassar community.1 I am happy to be back on campus. As a teenager in\nWashington, D.C., I had the very good fortune that a high school counselor pushed me to\napply to Vassar College. I was accepted, and I earned my bachelor’s degree here.\nAttending Vassar opened a wider variety of opportunities to me than I would have\notherwise had available. But I encountered one problem: Vassar did not offer any\nbanking or business courses, which is what I wanted to study. So, I enrolled in an\neconomics class, figuring it was the next best thing. I was hooked, and I have been\nstudying economics ever since.\nMy time here as a student was transformative, and I was honored to have served\non Vassar’s board from 2002 to 2022. Vassar is a vibrant intellectual community.\nTo motivate the topic of today’s speech, let me begin by sharing with you briefly\nmy assessment of the current state of the U.S. economy. The performance of the U.S.\neconomy has been quite strong overall.2 Last year, gross domestic product grew at a\nsolid pace of 2.5 percent. I see the labor market as being in a solid position, with job\ncreation steady and the unemployment rate at 4 percent in January. Inflation has come\ndown a great deal over the past two and a half years but remains somewhat elevated\nrelative to our 2 percent target. Based on recently released data, it is estimated that the\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 For a detailed discussion on my recent views on inflation, see Philip N. Jefferson (2025), “U.S. Economic\nOutlook and Monetary Policy,” speech delivered at the Economics Department Special Lecture, Lafayette\nCollege, Easton, Pennsylvania, February 4,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250204a.htm; and for my recent views on\nthe labor market, see Philip N. Jefferson (2025), “Do Non-inflationary Economic Expansions Promote\nShared Prosperity? Evidence from the U.S. Labor Market,” speech delivered at Swarthmore College,\nSwarthmore, Pennsylvania, February 5,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250205a.htm.\n\n- 2 -\n12-month change in the personal consumption expenditures price index was 2.4 percent\nin January. Progress toward our 2 percent objective has been slow in the past year. I\nexpect the path of inflation to continue to be bumpy. While a cumulative cut in the\npolicy rate by 100 basis points last year has brought the stance of monetary policy closer\nto a neutral setting, monetary policy continues to be restrictive. I believe that, with a\nstrong economy and a solid labor market, we can take our time to assess the incoming\ndata to make any further adjustments to our policy rate.\nHousehold consumption grew by 3.2 percent over last year. Understanding the\ncauses of the continued robustness in consumer spending is important because it accounts\nfor two-thirds of overall economic activity. Therefore, any accurate forecast of future\neconomic activity would need to get the growth in consumer spending right.\nToday, I will discuss one important factor behind the recent strength in consumer\nspending: households’ balance sheets—that is, their assets, such as stocks, bank\naccounts, and houses, and their liabilities, such as mortgages, car loans, and other forms\nof borrowing. At first glance, households appear to be in a strong financial position.\nOverall, American households currently possess a very high level of wealth that is driven\nby elevated house values, relatively low overall debt levels, and a strong stock market.\nAsset performance and the amount of debt, however, explain only part of the\npicture. The health of household finances also depends on the cost of new and existing\ndebt and the availability of credit. Household balance sheets are an important factor\nbehind the recent strength in consumer spending. That said, some households may have a\ndifficult time weathering unexpected costs or economic shocks. Looking at a variety of\nindicators across the income distribution shows that, while, in aggregate, household\n\n- 3 -\nbalance sheets are indeed strong, low- and middle-income households, and those with\nlower credit scores, may be stretched.\nThe remainder of my talk is organized as follows. I will begin by discussing\nhousehold wealth, both in aggregate and across the distribution of income. Then, I\nconnect elevated wealth to recent spending patterns. After that, I discuss the assets side\nof household balance sheets. Then, I turn to liabilities, including the cost of servicing\ndebt. Next, I discuss households’ ability to get new credit and the cost of such credit.\nBefore concluding, I discuss the role of households’ balance sheets in the transmission of\nmonetary policy.\nOverall Household Wealth and Its Implications for Spending\nLet me now turn to the overall picture of household wealth. Figure 1 shows a\nstylized household balance sheet, with assets on the left and liabilities on the right. Net\nworth, also called wealth, is the difference between the two sides of the balance sheet—\nassets less liabilities—and it is a key indicator of households’ financial health. Relative\nto income, households’ net worth is near its highest level in the past 30 years. Total net\nworth in the U.S. was over $50 trillion higher in the third quarter of last year than it was\nat the end of 2019. After one accounts for inflation, this accumulation represents an\nincrease in overall wealth of about 20 percent for U.S. households, as shown by the solid\nblack line in figure 2.\nThese recent gains in household net worth have been broad based across the\nincome distribution. The net worth of low- and middle-income households—defined as\nthe bottom 40 percent of the income distribution and shown by the dashed red line—has\n\n- 4 -\nincreased in line with aggregate net worth.3 Although these households account for\n25 percent of total consumption, which is less than their population share, they are still\nkey to the performance of the economy overall.\nLet me now turn to the implications of household net worth for our understanding\nof the recent strength in spending. Figure 3 shows the saving rate, which measures the\nshare of disposable income—that is, income after taxes and government transfers—that\nhouseholds save rather than spend. The saving rate has fluctuated widely over the past\nfew years. It rose during the pandemic, as many households received supplementary\nincome support from the government and some cut back on spending. Then, households\nspent some of the savings that they had accumulated during the pandemic, leading the\nsaving rate to fall to a relatively low level in 2022. The saving rate has recovered\nsomewhat since then. Now, it hovers around 1 to 1.5 percentage points below its level\nbefore the pandemic, indicating that households are still spending more of their income\nthan usual. It seems likely that elevated household wealth helps explain this higher-than-\nusual spending.\nOverall spending has been elevated, but how has high consumption been spread\nacross the income distribution? Recent research shows that the spending of low- and\nmiddle-income households has lagged that of higher-income households over the past\nfew years.4 As shown in figure 4, although real retail spending growth moved similarly\nfor all households before the pandemic, it has diverged since the middle of 2021. Since\nthen, spending for low-income households moved roughly sideways until the middle of\n3 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2024), “DFA: Distributional Financial\nAccounts,” webpage, https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/dataviz/dfa. These data provide quarterly\nestimates of the distribution of a comprehensive measure of U.S. household wealth.\n4 For more details, see Hacıoğlu Hoke, Feler, and Chylak (2024).\n\n- 5 -\nlast year, when it began to grow again. High-income households’ consumption, by\ncontrast, has grown more consistently over this period.\nAssets\nHaving discussed net worth and its implications for spending, now I drill down\ninto the two components of net worth—household assets and liabilities. With regard to\nthe asset side, elevated net worth largely reflects gains in two important asset categories:\nstock market holdings and real estate. Each category accounts for roughly one-fourth of\nhouseholds’ assets. The stock market valuation has increased at a very rapid pace over\nthe past five years, leading to a $20 trillion rise in the value of households’ stock\nportfolios. As house prices rose, the value of households’ real estate has also increased\nby about the same amount.\nReal estate is a particularly important source of wealth for low- and middle-\nincome households, comprising 40 percent of their net worth. Therefore, the growth in\nreal estate wealth over the past five years accounts for a very significant share—over\nhalf—of the increase in these households’ overall wealth. That said, many low-income\nhouseholds do not own their home, and so they did not benefit from the growth in house\nprices. Equities comprise a smaller share of these households’ wealth, and so they\naccount for only around 10 percent of the increase in their wealth.\nWealth allows households to weather unexpected shocks, such as the loss of a job\nor a surprise bill; however, not all forms of wealth are quickly and easily accessible in\ncase of such emergencies. It can be expensive for households to access the equity that\nthey have in their homes. Also, much of households’ stock holdings are in retirement\naccounts that are difficult to liquidate. So, to understand how resilient households’\n\n- 6 -\nfinancial situations are, I also pay close attention to the most liquid components of their\nnet worth, which include bank deposits and money market mutual funds. As the solid\nblack line in figure 5 shows, in aggregate, households hold about 20 percent more of\nthese liquid assets than they did before the pandemic. As the dashed red line shows, in\ncontrast to the aggregate, low- and middle-income households have a slightly smaller\nliquid asset buffer than they did before the pandemic. This smaller buffer suggests that\nsome of these households may not be as equipped to handle economic shocks as they\nwere five years ago. That said, low- and middle-income households still hold more of\nthese assets than they did 10 years ago, when many of them were still recovering from\nthe Great Recession.\nOn the whole, the asset side of households’ balance sheets paints a very healthy\npicture of their financial positions. Rising house and equity prices have increased net\nworth for households across the income distribution, and elevated asset valuations seem\nto help explain strong consumption growth last year.\nLiabilities\nLet me now turn to household liabilities—what households owe to their lenders.\nFigure 6 plots three major categories of household debt relative to disposable personal\nincome.5 You see home mortgages, the largest share, at the bottom in blue; consumer\ncredit, which includes credit cards, auto loans, student loans in orange; and other\nconsumer loans in beige.6\n5 Data are taken from Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2024), Statistical Release Z.1,\n“Financial Accounts of the United States,” https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/default.htm.\n6 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2024), Statistical Release Z.1, “Financial\nAccounts of the United States,” https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/default.htm.\n\n- 7 -\nTotal household debt rose through the 2000s and peaked around the time of the\nGlobal Financial Crisis of 2007 to 2009. It then began a slow decline as households\n“deleveraged.” The evolution of total debt is driven by mortgage debt, which currently\naccounts for about 60 percent of total household debt. Mortgage debt levels remain\nrelatively subdued after rising somewhat during the COVID-19 pandemic, partly due to\nincreasing home prices leading borrowers to take out larger loans.\nFigure 7 zooms in on revolving credit—largely, credit card balances—which is\npart of the previous “consumer credit” category.7 Balances were at about 7 percent of\ndisposable income until the COVID-19 pandemic. Households reduced their spending—\ndecreasing the need for credit card debt—and in part used income support programs to\npay down existing credit card debt. The result was a nearly 3 percentage point drop in\nrevolving credit relative to disposable personal income. As consumer spending rose and\nhouseholds began to take on more credit card debt, this ratio began to rebound in 2021\nbut remains about 1 percentage point below its pre-pandemic levels.\nAlthough levels of debt may be low, how costly is it for households to remain\ncurrent on that debt? Figure 8 plots the debt service ratio, which is the amount of\nrequired debt payments relative to disposable personal income.8 Along with the fall in\ndebt to which I just referred, this ratio plummeted during the initial stages of the COVID-\n19 pandemic. It has since risen, but it remains about 1 percentage point below its pre-\npandemic level. That said, interest payments on revolving debt, which excludes\n7 Data are taken from Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2025), Statistical Release G.19,\n“Consumer Credit,” https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g19/current.\n8 For the series and information on how it is computed, see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem (2024), “Household Debt Service Ratios,” https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/dsr.\n\n- 8 -\nmortgages, have risen over the past few years. The share of disposable personal income\ngoing to pay this interest rate is now slightly higher than it was just before the pandemic.\nCredit Availability and Costs\nSo far, I have discussed households’ current debt liabilities and how households\nare able to manage their current debt payments. Even households with elevated levels of\nassets may wish to obtain new credit. Policymakers and economists often ask, how easy\nis it for households, in general, to increase their borrowing, and at what cost?\nLenders consider a range of factors in determining whether to supply credit and\nhow much credit to extend. One key factor is the borrower’s “credit risk score.” These\nscores, which are calculated by private companies, use information on individuals’ past\npayment behavior and a variety of other factors to create a number that is predictive of\ntheir ability to repay debt.\nFigure 9 plots the fraction of individuals with credit risk scores in the subprime,\nnear-prime, and prime categories since 2014. There has been a gradual increase in the\nfraction of borrowers with prime scores, in part reflecting the deleveraging that I referred\nto earlier, which is mirrored by the decline in the fraction with subprime scores. As you\ncan see, the fraction of subprime scores took a sharp turn downward at the start of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. At that time, many people were able to use the pandemic-era\nincome support programs to become current on their debt and otherwise boost their\nscores into near-prime and prime categories. This “credit score migration” helped many\nindividuals obtain credit.9\n9 For more discussion, see Goodman and others (2021) and Driscoll and others (2024).\n\n- 9 -\nBefore obtaining new credit, people may first turn to lines of credit that they\nalready have—for example, credit cards. Figure 10 plots “utilization rates”—the ratio of\ncredit card balances to credit limits—for subprime, near-prime, and prime consumers.\nUtilization rates fell for all three groups at the beginning of the pandemic but have risen\nsince then and are now somewhat above their pre-pandemic levels for both subprime and\nnear-prime borrowers. These groups may be reluctant to draw down their credit lines\nfurther.\nIt can be challenging to determine the availability of new credit. While the total\namount of credit that people have and their new borrowing can be observed, these\nquantities are determined both by lenders’ willingness to supply credit and borrowers’\ndemand for credit. Borrowers taking out fewer new loans may be due to a reduced\nsupply of credit, lower demand for credit, or a combination of the two. Sometimes,\nhowever, one of these factors can be identified. For example, during the COVID-19\npandemic, reductions in household spending and increases in income support programs\nlikely reduced the demand for credit, contributing to the decline in debt levels during that\nperiod.\nA more systematic method that we have used at the Federal Reserve to help\ndisentangle credit supply from demand has involved questions in our Senior Loan Officer\nOpinion Survey, or SLOOS.10 This quarterly survey asks officials who oversee bank\nlending practices for their institutions about how they have changed loan underwriting\nstandards over the past quarter for a variety of loan categories. “Loan underwriting\nstandards,” also known more simply as lending standards, refers to the requirements that\n10 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2025), “Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on\nBank Lending Practices,” https://www.federalreserve.gov/data/sloos.htm.\n\n- 10 -\nbanks impose before extending a loan. For example, banks may establish minimum\ncredit risk scores for potential borrowers to qualify for certain kinds of consumer\nborrowing. Banks that raise minimum credit scores are said to have “tightened”\nstandards and those that lower them to have “eased” standards. Tightening standards\nlikely reduces the supply of credit.11\nBecause the SLOOS surveys commercial banks, its results are most informative\nfor those loan categories for which banks do a substantial amount of lending. Hence,\nfigure 11 shows survey results for consumer loans (credit card and auto loans), averaged\ntogether, weighting by balance sheet size.12 Banks make almost all credit card loans, and\nabout one-third of auto loans. The figure plots the fraction of banks that have reported\ntightening less the fraction that have reported easing each quarter, weighted by the bank’s\nloan portfolio—so that plus-100 percent would indicate that all banks tightened, and\nminus-100 percent would indicate that all banks eased standards. For both credit cards\nand auto loans, banks eased standards in the early days of the pandemic but began to\ntighten them in 2022. More recent responses suggest that banks continued to tighten\nstandards over 2024, making it more difficult for borrowers to obtain new loans.\nAlthough this tightening could limit growth in spending by those households that would\nneed more credit cards to do so, recall that higher-credit-score borrowers are not close to\nexhausting their credit lines. In the most recent survey, banks have eased standards,\nwhich could support spending.\n11 For an example of use of the SLOOS to help disentangle loan supply and demand, see Bassett and others\n(2014).\n12 The SLOOS results reported here are based on banks’ responses weighted by each bank’s outstanding\nloans in the respective loan category and might therefore differ from the results reported in the published\nSLOOS, which are based on banks’ unweighted responses.\n\n- 11 -\nMonetary Policy Transmission\nNow, before I conclude, let me say a few things about how the Federal Reserve’s\nmonetary policy has been affecting the cost of borrowing for households. The primary\ntool that the Federal Reserve uses to influence the economy is the federal funds rate. The\nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets eight times a year to discuss the\nappropriate setting of the committee’s target range for the federal funds rate. The\nFOMC’s objective when setting this range is to achieve its congressionally mandated\ngoals of maximum employment and price stability. Changes in the FOMC’s target for\nthe federal funds rate affect overall financial conditions through various channels,\nincluding its effect on interest rates that matter for consumers’ decisions to purchase\nhouses and cars or borrow on their credit cards. For example, when the FOMC eases\nmonetary policy—that is, reduces its target for the federal funds rate—the resulting lower\ninterest rates on consumer loans elicit greater spending on goods and services. Higher\nspending can, in turn, lead prices to rise. Lower mortgage rates make buying a house\nmore affordable and encourage existing homeowners to refinance their mortgages. Of\ncourse, the rates charged on longer-term loans, such as mortgages, are also affected by\nexpectations of how monetary policy and the broader economy will evolve over the\nduration of the loans, not just by the current level of the federal funds rate.\nWith respect to lending costs, the reductions in the target range for the federal\nfunds rate last year have begun to pass through to rates on consumer borrowing. In the\ncredit card market, interest rates are floating and are set as a fixed markup over the prime\nrate. By convention, the prime rate is equal to the upper end of the target range the\n\n- 12 -\nFOMC sets for the federal funds rate, plus 3 percentage points.13 As seen in figure 12,\nauto loan and credit card rates have fallen in recent months, with the decline in the prime\nrate. Rates on auto loans are also influenced by the interest rates on shorter-maturity\nTreasury securities and risk spreads lenders assess to account for delinquencies and\ndefaults. Auto loan rates have declined, thus far largely because of falls in risk spreads.\nIn the U.S., mortgages are generally fixed rate and have a longer duration than\nmost other forms of consumer borrowing. Consequently, rates on new and existing loans\ncan differ substantially. As shown by the solid blue line in figure 13, the majority of\nhouseholds still have mortgages with rates below 4 percent that were set some time ago.\nBut rates on new mortgages are elevated compared with the ranges observed since the\n2007–09 financial crisis, with the current average 30-year fixed rate around 7 percent. As\nI noted earlier, mortgages’ long duration means their rates are driven more by longer-\nterm interest rates, which are in turn determined by many factors beyond just monetary\npolicy. Households who recently became homeowners or moved must bear the cost of\npaying elevated mortgage rates. As a result, many are not moving.14\nOverall, interest rates for many forms of consumer credit—with the notable\nexception of mortgages—have declined in recent months, starting to show the effects of\nthe recent fall in shorter-term interest rates. Nonetheless, available data suggest that\nwhile new credit is available for households with higher credit scores and income levels,\nthose households with lower credit scores and income levels are finding it relatively more\ndifficult to obtain credit.\n13 Before the establishment in 2008 of a range for the federal fund rate, the convention was to use the target\nfor the federal funds rate plus 3 percentage points. See English (2021) for more discussion.\n14 See Aladangady, Krimmel, and Scharlemann (2024).\n\n- 13 -\nConclusion\nLet’s return to the title question: How strong are households’ balance sheets?\nGenerally, households appear to be in a good position: Asset holdings are high across the\nincome distribution, driven by high house and equity prices, and debt levels are subdued.\nInterest rates on some forms of debt have begun to come down, and required debt service\nis low as a share of income. That said, some households appear to be stretched. Lower-\ncredit-score households’ utilization rates are elevated, and banks have tightened loan\nunderwriting standards on some forms of credit. And even though, as a group, low- and\nmiddle-income households possess elevated levels of overall wealth, they have less of a\nbuffer of liquid assets than they did before the pandemic. These indicators suggest that\ncertain groups of households may have a hard time weathering unexpected costs or\neconomic shocks.\nIn closing, let me reiterate that it is important to monitor closely the strength of\nhousehold balance sheets, which inform forecasts of overall economic activity. Strong\nbalance sheets help support consumption spending, which in turn can help deliver the\neconomic growth that puts the Federal Reserve in the best position to achieve its policy\ngoals of maximum employment and price stability.\n\n- 14 -\nReferences\nAladangady, Aditya, Jacob Krimmel, and Tess Scharlemann (2024). “Locked In: Rate\nHikes, Housing Markets, and Mobility,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2024-\n088.

Jefferson\nVice Chair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Monetary Policy in the Shadow of Geopolitical Tensions and Trade Conflicts,” the\nfourth International Monetary Policy Conference hosted by the Bank of Finland\nHelsinki, Finland\nSeptember 30, 2025\n\nThank you, Governor Olli Rehn, for the invitation to visit the lovely city of\nHelsinki and participate in the Bank of Finland’s International Monetary Policy\nConference.1 I highly value the opportunity to interact with, and learn from, my fellow\ncentral bankers, so thank you again for having me.\nWhen considering the Bank of Finland, the European Central Bank (ECB), and\nthe Federal Reserve in the U.S., it is easy to point out some differences, including our\nmandates and our economies. But there are also important similarities across these\ncentral banks. As independent central banks, our objective is to set policy that will result\nin the best outcomes for the people we each serve. Another similarity, and one I would\nlike to focus on today, is that both the ECB and the Fed see value in establishing and\nclearly articulating to the public a framework on how we each approach monetary\npolicymaking. And, in fact, both the ECB and the Fed published revisions to our\nindividual framework documents earlier this year. Such revisions lead to more robust\nframeworks that help support the mission of central banks across a broad range of\neconomic conditions, including those that are also shaped by geopolitical tensions and\ntrade conflicts, as is the theme of this conference.\nToday, I will briefly review some consistent themes that emerged from the two\nrevised documents. Then, I will discuss in more depth the changes to the Fed’s\nStatement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, which Chair Powell\nannounced in his Jackson Hole speech in August. Finally, I will offer my views on the\neconomic outlook and its implications for U.S. monetary policy.\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nConsistent Themes\nUnderstanding the work of other central banks and speaking with their\npolicymakers is a healthy exercise. This is particularly true when studying other banks’\noverarching frameworks. The ECB’s Monetary Policy Strategy Statement dates to the\ncentral bank’s founding in 1998. The Fed is quite a bit older, but it still took us longer to\noffer a formal framework to the public. The Fed’s Statement on Longer-Run Goals and\nMonetary Policy Strategy was first issued in 2012, under Chair Ben Bernanke’s\nleadership. At the time, Fed leaders took note that other peer central banks issued public\nstatements of their frameworks and saw value in doing so. While the two documents\ndiffer in length and touch on some slightly different topics, reflecting each bank’s unique\nmandate, there are several similarities. One is that the governing bodies of both the ECB\nand the Fed target 2 percent inflation. Another is that they both have a commitment to\nrevisiting and revising their framework periodically. Also, both revised documents de-\nemphasized their previous focus on operating near the effective lower bound (ELB) of\ninterest rates in favor of considering a broad range of economic circumstances.\nOverall, both documents describe the central bank’s understanding of its\nmonetary policy mandates and its broad approach to achieving them. However, neither is\na mandatory policy prescription. Indeed, each framework provides a structure within\nwhich its respective policymakers can develop their individual policy views. That is a\ngood thing. It is a sign of a healthy, independent central bank. Robust discussions where\nalternative viewpoints are considered are more likely to lead to effective policies and\nbetter outcomes for the people we serve.\n\n- 3 -\nThe Fed’s Revised Framework\nNow, let me turn specifically to the framework document my Federal Open\nMarket Committee (FOMC) colleagues and I finished revising in August. The Fed’s dual\nmandate to foster maximum employment and stable prices, which was given to us by the\nU.S. Congress, underpins the Fed’s monetary policy framework. Our commitment to\ndelivering on our dual mandate is unwavering. The revisions to our framework will\nsupport that mission across a broad range of economic conditions.\nWe often refer to the framework document as the “consensus statement.” We call\nit that because it reflects the consensus view of the FOMC—and because having a nine-\nword title for a two-page document is a bit verbose!\nThe FOMC created the revised consensus statement after conducting a public\nreview, the second time the Committee has done so. That review consisted of three\nelements: first, we held Fed Listens events around the U.S., where members of the public\ncould share their views with policymakers; second, we hosted an academic research\nconference that featured presentations from leading experts, including former Chair\nBernanke; and third, we convened a series of policymaker discussions and deliberations\nat FOMC meetings this year, supported by staff analysis.\nThe statement is designed to give the public a clear sense of how we think about\nmonetary policy, and that understanding is important both for transparency and\naccountability, and for making monetary policy more effective. The changes\nimplemented as a result of this review were a logical progression, not a change in course,\ngrounded in our ever-evolving understanding of our economy. I will make note of four\nadjustments to the consensus statement and discuss each in turn.\n\n- 4 -\nFirst, the revised consensus statement removed language emphasizing the ELB as\na defining feature of the economic landscape. Instead, it states that our monetary policy\nstrategy is designed to promote maximum employment and stable prices across a broad\nrange of economic conditions. This revision, reflecting a move away from the post–\nfinancial crisis era of historically low interest rates, makes our framework more robust. It\nis useful to recall that at the time of the FOMC’s previous framework review, during\n2019 and 2020, policymakers were considering an economy that had for many years\ndemonstrated low growth, low inflation, and a very flat Phillips curve—meaning that\ninflation was not very responsive to slack in the economy. The overarching concern for\ncentral bankers at that time was how to operate with interest rates near the ELB. Today,\nof course, we are operating in a very different environment, at least in part brought on by\nthe economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSecond, the revised framework embraces a flexible inflation-targeting approach at\nall times and eliminates a “makeup” strategy that would be employed in certain\ncircumstances. The experience since the pandemic highlights different challenges to\nachieving our inflation mandate, such as supply shocks, sectoral developments, and\nnonlinear inflation dynamics. The flexible inflation targeting in our revised framework\nallows us to take a balanced approach in promoting our goals, considering the extent of\ndepartures from them. The revised framework appropriately emphasizes the\nCommittee’s commitment to ensuring that longer-term inflation expectations remain well\nanchored.\nThird, the revised consensus statement provides clarity around how the\nCommittee thinks about maximum employment. The 2020 version of the statement\n\n- 5 -\nindicated that the Fed would mitigate “shortfalls” from maximum employment. The\nshortfalls strategy grew out of the insight that real-time assessments of the natural rate of\nunemployment—and hence of “maximum employment”—are highly uncertain.\nHowever, the use of the word “shortfalls” created some communications challenges, as it\nwas not intended to be a commitment to always avoid preemption or to ignore tight labor\nmarket conditions. As a result, it was removed from the consensus statement. Instead,\nthe revised document more precisely states that “the Committee recognizes that\nemployment may at times run above real-time assessments of maximum employment\nwithout necessarily creating risks to price stability.”2 As Chair Powell pointed out,\npreemptive action could well be warranted if tightness in the labor market or other factors\npose risks to price stability. The revised statement defines maximum employment as “the\nhighest level of employment that can be achieved on a sustained basis in a context of\nprice stability.”3\nFourth, and closely aligned with the change I just discussed, the FOMC clarified\nits approach to monetary policy in times when the employment and inflation sides of our\nmandate may be at odds. The revised statement says that, in such periods, the Committee\nwill follow “a balanced approach in promoting them, taking into account the extent of\ndepartures from its goals and the potentially different time horizons over which\nemployment and inflation are projected to return to levels judged consistent with its\nmandate.” The revised language more closely aligns with the original 2012 statement. It\n2 The consensus statement is available on the Federal Reserve Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/monetary-policy-strategy-tools-and-communications-\nstatement-on-longer-run-goals-monetary-policy-strategy-2025.htm.\n3 See note 2 for the Fed’s consensus statement.\n\n- 6 -\nis also consistent with the Committee’s actions during the 2022–24 period, when the\ndeparture from our 2 percent inflation target was the overriding concern.\nWhile I have highlighted multiple changes, it is also important to note the\ncontinuity with the Fed’s past framework statements. The document continues to explain\nhow we interpret the mandate Congress has given us and describes the policy framework\nthat we believe will best promote maximum employment and price stability. We also\ncontinue to believe that monetary policy must be forward looking and consider the lags in\nits effects on the economy. We have never set a numerical goal for employment because\nthe maximum level of employment is not directly measurable and changes over time for\nreasons unrelated to policy. Likewise, we maintained our commitment to a 2 percent\ninflation objective because that is a key factor helping keep longer-term inflation\nexpectations well anchored. And we remain committed to conducting a public review\nroughly every five years.\nWhile the framework provides a structure through which to think about policy\ndecisions, I will continue to determine the appropriate stance of monetary policy based on\nthe incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. Consistent with such a\ndetermination, I would like to share with you my current outlook for the U.S. economy.\nEconomic Outlook\nRecent data indicate that U.S. economic growth has moderated, and the risks to\nboth sides of our dual mandate have shifted. Employment growth has slowed because of\nweaker growth in labor supply and a softening in labor demand. The uptick in the\nunemployment rate suggests that demand has fallen by a bit more than supply and that\n\n- 7 -\nthe downside risks to employment are rising. Meanwhile, higher tariffs are showing\nthrough to higher inflation for some goods. I expect that the effects of tariffs on inflation,\nemployment, and economic activity will further show through in coming months.\nThe softening of labor market activity comes as overall economic activity has\nmoderated this year. In the first half of 2025, U.S. GDP grew at about a 1.5 percent\nannual rate, which reflects a marked cooling from last year’s 2.5 percent growth rate.\nThe slowdown in economic activity in the first half of this year was primarily driven by\nweaker consumer spending. That said, U.S. retail spending picked up over the summer.\nOverall, I expect the U.S. economy to maintain the first half’s rate of growth through the\nremainder of the year.\nIn terms of the labor market, there has been notable slowing in both labor supply\nand labor demand. Net immigration into the U.S., an important contributor to workforce\ngrowth, has dropped sharply. At the same time, total employment growth has slowed.\nOver the past three months, American employers have added just 29,000 jobs to payrolls\na month on average. The recent pace of employment growth has been the slowest since\nthe U.S. economy recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic recession, which is largely\nexplained by the slower growth in the labor force. There are other measures of the labor\nmarket that also bear watching. For example, the ratio of unfilled jobs to unemployed\nAmericans seeking work remains near 1. And measures of job openings and initial\njobless claims have been mostly moving sideways.\nA low level of job creation would historically put upward pressure on the\nunemployment rate, though so far that effect has been muted because of the decline in\nlabor force growth. The U.S. unemployment rate in August was 4.3 percent, a still\n\n- 8 -\nrelatively low rate, and up just 0.1 percentage point from August of the previous year.\nThe unemployment rate could edge a bit higher this year before moving back down next\nyear.\nTurning to the other side of our dual mandate, it remains notable that inflation has\nslowed considerably from the highs that occurred when the economy reopened after\npandemic disruptions. Inflation, however, remains somewhat above our 2 percent target,\nand the tariffs that have been announced and implemented so far are showing up in some\ngoods prices. Overall, personal consumption expenditures (PCE) prices rose 2.7 percent\nover the 12 months ending in August. Core PCE inflation—which removes volatile food\nand energy prices—was 2.9 percent in August. Often, it is helpful to study the three\nmajor components of core PCE inflation. Currently, core goods prices have been rising,\nreflecting tariff effects. In contrast, core services inflation, outside of housing, has\ngenerally trended sideways this year, while housing inflation appears to be on a gradual\ndownward trend.\nI view the uncertainty around my baseline outlook as especially high, mainly due\nto the new policies being introduced by the current U.S. Administration and their effects\non employment and inflation. As the changes in these policies are finalized and we have\nmore time to judge how they are affecting the economy, I expect some of the broader\nuncertainty around the U.S. economy to diminish.\n\n- 9 -\nMonetary Policy\nConsidering the outlook I described, I see the risks to employment as tilted to the\ndownside and risks to inflation to the upside. It follows that both sides of our mandate\nare under pressure.\nWhile tariff-related inflation is apparent in the prices of some goods, it is also\nnotable that it so far has been lower than what many forecasters predicted this spring.\nSeveral factors—including the final tariff rates, the extent of pass-through to consumer\nprices, the effects on supply chains, overall economic conditions, and what happens to\nlonger-run inflation expectations—will influence the scope and persistence of the related\nrise in inflation. Short-term inflation expectations have come down from the peaks\nreached in the second quarter, and most measures of longer-run inflation expectations\nhave been largely stable, suggesting that the American people understand our\ncommitment to returning inflation to our 2 percent target. As such, I expect the\ndisinflation process to resume after this year and inflation to return to the 2 percent target\nin the coming years.\nWith the unemployment rate at 4.3 percent, the labor market is softening, which\nsuggests that, left unsupported, it could experience stress. To balance the risk of\npersistent above-target inflation and the risk of a deteriorating labor market, I supported a\n25 basis point cut in our target range at the last FOMC meeting. This change moved our\npolicy rate closer to a more neutral stance while maintaining a balanced approach to\npromoting our dual-mandate objectives.\nWith respect to the path of the policy rate going forward, I will continue to\nevaluate the appropriate stance of monetary policy based on the incoming data, the\n\n- 10 -\nevolving outlook, and the balance of risks. I will also consider and assess information\nabout government policies and their effects on the economy.\nConclusion\nIn this room, I know that I am not alone in putting careful thought and attention\ninto what should be the proper path of monetary policy moving forward. I have found\nthe Fed’s consensus statement to be a valuable tool in helping me organize my thinking\nand take a grounded approach to policymaking. I know that similar documents at your\ncentral banks also provide wise counsel to pursue your mandates.\nThank you again for the invitation to speak here and for allowing me to engage in\nthe sharing of ideas.\n\nMonetary Policy in the Shadow of Geopolitical Tensions and\nTrade Conflicts\nBank of Finland\nSeptember 30, 2025\nMonetary Policy Frameworks and the\nU.S. Economic Outlook\nPhilip N.

    "text": "For release on delivery\n10:30 a.m. EDT\nMay 20, 2024\nU.S. Economic Outlook and Housing Price Dynamics\nRemarks by\nPhilip N. Jefferson\nVice Chair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nMortgage Bankers Association’s\nSecondary and Capital Markets Conference and Expo 2024\nNew York, New York\nMay 20, 2024\n\nThank you, Mark, for the kind introduction, and good morning to all of you.1 I\nam happy to be here. Today, I will do three things. First, I’ll share with you my current\noutlook for the US economy. Second, I’ll discuss my thinking on the current stance of\nmonetary policy. Third, I’ll review the dynamics of housing prices which can feed into\nthe persistence of inflation.\nMy focus on housing price dynamic stems from the role housing plays in the\nAmerican economy. For most families, a home is their largest-ever purchase and their\nmost valuable asset. Capital markets professionals in real estate finance, like you, are\ncrucial to the smooth operation of the housing sector. Families making housing decisions\nrely on a healthy and productive housing finance sector.\nThe housing sector is also one of the most interest rate–sensitive sectors of the\neconomy. As such, it’s an important channel of monetary policy transmission.\nUnderstanding the various channels of monetary transmission is crucial to fulfillment of\nthe dual mandate given to the Federal Reserve by the Congress: maximum employment\nand stable prices. This mandate guides my thinking about monetary policymaking.\nWith that, I’ll turn to my outlook for the US economy.\nAggregate Economic Activity\nThe U.S. economy continues to grow at a solid pace. Adjusted for inflation, GDP\nwas reported to have increased at a 1.6 percent annual rate in the first quarter of 2024.\nThat was a moderation from a 3.4 percent expansion in the fourth quarter of last year.\nHowever, private domestic final purchases—which excludes inventory investment,\ngovernment spending, and net exports and usually sends a clearer signal on underlying\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\ndemand—grew 3.1 percent in the first quarter. That was about as strong as the second\nhalf of 2023.\nIndeed, consumer spending has been robust over the past several quarters.\nNevertheless, I expect spending growth to slow later this year as restrictive monetary\npolicy weighs on demand, particularly on interest-sensitive spending.\nAnother reason for the strong performance of the U.S. economy over the past year\nis improving supply conditions as pandemic bottlenecks have unwound. I will be\nmonitoring incoming data to understand better how much more help we will get from the\nsupply side to bring inflation down further.\nThe Labor Market\nThe labor market remains solid. Monthly payroll gains slowed in April, with\nemployers adding 175,000 jobs. Still, employers added an average of 242,000 jobs in the\nthree months ended in April, and the unemployment rate remained below 4 percent last\nmonth.\nThe supply of workers and the demand for labor continue to come into better\nbalance. The labor force participation rate of individuals aged 25 to 54 is now higher\nthan before the pandemic began, as shown in figure 1. Employers’ need for workers, as\nmeasured by job openings, declined 12 percent from a year earlier, as shown in figure 2.\nThis rebalancing of the labor market has resulted in nominal wage growth easing even as\nunemployment remains historically low.\nInflation\nOf course, I have been keeping a close eye on inflation. The good news is that\ninflation has eased dramatically from the peak reached almost two years ago, as shown in\n\n- 3 -\nfigure 3. However, inflation remains above the Federal Open Market Committee’s\n(FOMC) 2 percent inflation objective.\nCore personal consumption expenditures (PCE) prices, which exclude volatile\nfood and energy costs, rose at a faster pace over the first three months of the year than\nthey did in the latter part of 2023. The April consumer price index and producer price\nindex data point to a more modest increase last month. Even so, Federal Reserve staff\nestimate that core PCE prices rose at an annual rate of 4.1 percent over the first four\nmonths of the year. That is well above the 12-month change, which we estimate at 2.75\npercent. It is too early to tell whether the recent slowdown in the disinflationary process\nwill be long lasting. The better reading for April is encouraging.\nFortunately, data on expectations suggest that the FOMC’s inflation-fighting\ncredibility remains intact. While there has been a recent uptick in Americans’ inflation\nexpectations over the next 12 months, long-term inflation expectations, over the next 10\nyears, remain close to pre-pandemic levels. That shows the American people believe that\nwe will make good on our commitment to bring inflation fully back to our objective. I\nam acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes purchasing\npower, especially for those on fixed incomes and those least able to meet the higher costs\nof essentials, including housing, transportation, and food. That is why my colleagues at\nthe Fed and I are so committed to returning inflation to our target.\nMonetary Policy\nSo, what does the current state of the economy mean for the policy rate we set at\nthe Fed? At the most recent meeting, three weeks ago, my colleagues and I on the\nFOMC decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2\n\n- 4 -\npercent. I believe that our policy rate is in restrictive territory as we continue to see the\nlabor market come into better balance, and inflation decline although nowhere near as\nquickly as I would have liked. The FOMC noted that it does not expect it will be\nappropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation\nis moving sustainably toward 2 percent. In making judgements about the appropriate\nstance of policy rate over time, I will be carefully assessing the incoming data, the\nevolving outlook, and the balance of risks.\nAt its last meeting, the FOMC also decided to continue the process of reducing\nour balance sheet, but at a slower pace. The cap on Treasury redemptions will be\nlowered from the current $60 billion per month to $25 billion per month as of June 1.\nConsistent with the Committee’s intention to hold primarily Treasury securities in the\nlonger run, we’re leaving the cap on agency securities redemptions unchanged at $35\nbillion per month. We will reinvest any proceeds in excess of this cap in Treasury\nsecurities, as detailed in the May 1, 2024 operating policy statement published by the\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York.2\nThe Housing Market\nThe Fed sets policy to promote its dual-mandate objectives of maximum\nemployment and price stability, and employment and inflation depend on conditions in\nthe entire economy. Still, given our gathering today, I thought it would be appropriate to\ndive a bit deeper into the housing and home finance markets.\n2 See Federal Reserve Bank of New York (2024), Statement Regarding Reinvestment of Principal\nPayments from Treasury Securities, Agency Debt, and Agency Mortgage-Backed Securities, May 1,\nhttps://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/opolicy/operating_policy_240501.\n\n- 5 -\nAs I said earlier, the housing sector is one of the most interest rate–sensitive parts\nof the economy. We have seen that sensitivity in mortgage rates and mortgage\noriginations. As shown in figure 4, 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rates were close to 3\npercent when the federal funds rate was near the zero lower bound in 2020 and 2021.\nRates surged in 2022 as the federal funds rate increased. Consistent with the increase in\nmortgage rates, mortgage origination volume has fallen significantly.\nThe current restrictive stance of monetary policy has weighed on the housing\nmarket. That is helping to bring supply and demand into better balance and put\ndownward pressure on inflation. One aspect of inflation that has gotten a fair amount of\nattention is housing and rental costs. This is because housing costs make up such a large\nshare of household budgets. To calculate housing services inflation, government\nstatistics don’t use home prices because a home is partly an investment. Instead, housing\nservices inflation is computed using monthly rents that capture what tenants pay to rent a\nhouse or apartment and what homeowners would, in theory, pay to rent their own home.\nThe way this calculation is derived means changes in market rents—or what a new tenant\npays to rent—take a long time to pass through to PCE housing services prices, as shown\nin figure 5. In this figure, notice that increases in market rents, the blue and red lines,\npeaked in 2022, and PCE housing services inflation, the black line, lagged market rents\nand peaked in 2023.\nLags in Housing Services Inflation\nThe primary reason for this lag is that market rents adjust more quickly to\neconomic conditions than what landlords charge their existing tenants. This lag suggests\nthat the large increase in market rents during the pandemic is still being passed through to\n\n- 6 -\nexisting rents and may keep housing services inflation elevated for a while longer. This\nobservation is important because it is an example of one of the underlying sources of lags\nwith which monetary policy affects inflation.\nAnother factor affecting pass-through of restrictive monetary policy is that fixed-\nrate mortgages are common in the U.S. It is often argued that this loan structure dampens\nthe effect of monetary policy. Figure 6 shows that the 30-year fixed mortgage rate is\nabout 7 percent, while the average outstanding mortgage rate is about 4 percent. This\nlower outstanding mortgage rate is due to households who locked in rates during lower-\ninterest periods, including when the Fed cut the target range for the federal funds rate to\nnear zero shortly after the pandemic took hold. Fixed-rate mortgages do dampen the\neffect of monetary policy, but, according to recent research, not as much as previously\nthought.3\nThere is a delay between when mortgage rates go up and when household\nmortgage payments go up, as shown in figure 7. Board staff research documents that\nmortgage payments go up over time because many households continue to refinance their\nmortgage or move. Despite higher rates, households in the U.S. borrowed over $1.5\ntrillion in new mortgage loans in 2023. These borrowers include first-time homebuyers,\nexisting homeowners moving between homes, and homeowners obtaining cash-out\nrefinances. The payment they owe on that recently obtained mortgage is higher than it\nwould have been had lower rates been maintained, and their consumption may be\ncorrespondingly lower. The cumulative effect of a higher interest rate on aggregate\nmortgage payments grows over time as more new loans are originated at the higher rate.\n3 See, for example, Daniel Ringo (2024), “Inframarginal Borrowers and the Mortgage Payment Channel of\nMonetary Policy,” working paper, May.\n\n- 7 -\nThe staff’s research documents that, historically, borrowers like these who are not\ndeterred by higher rates are responsible for a little over half of the pass-through of\ninterest rates to mortgage payments.\nConclusion\nIn closing, let me reiterate why we care about housing. The housing sector is\nwhere many households have made, or will make, their largest investment. Therefore,\nthe prices that families pay for that housing can affect their overall well-being. The work\nyou do to make housing accessible is an important part of the economy.\nThe housing sector is also a key part of the transmission mechanism of monetary\npolicy. That is one reason why policymakers will continue to pay close attention to this\nvital sector. Of course, no one sector dictates monetary policy. We look at the totality of\nthe data to set policy and achieve the objectives given to the Fed by Congress: maximum\nemployment and price stability. Considering the lagged effects of monetary policy, I am\nencouraged that over the past two years, we have made good progress toward our dual-\nmandate objectives.\nThank you for your time and attention today.\n\nFigure 1: Prime−Age Labor Force Participation Rate Index\nMonthly Feb. 2020 = 0\n0.02\n0.01\nApr.\n0.00\n−0.01\n−0.02\n−0.03\n−0.04\n−0.05\n2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024\nNote: Labor force participation rate of workers aged 25 to 54, indexed by the difference from the February 2020 value.

    "text": "For release on delivery\n9:00 a.m. EDT\nMay 13, 2024\nCommunicating about Monetary Policy\nRemarks by\nPhilip N. Jefferson\nVice Chair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Central Bank Communications: Theory and Practice,”\na conference hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nCleveland, Ohio\nMay 13, 2024\n\nIntroduction\nThank you, Ed, for the kind introduction and for the opportunity to speak.1\nYou and the organizers of this conference have put together an excellent program\non a very important topic, central bank communication, which is key for effective\ntransmission of monetary policy to the economy. To fulfill our dual mandate of\npromoting maximum employment and price stability, it is vital that we make good\nmonetary policy decisions and that we communicate those decisions to the public\neffectively.\nToday, I’ll do three things. First, I’ll discuss the channels that the Federal\nReserve currently relies on in its communications with the public. Second, I’ll offer a\nfew historical examples of how economic thinking on monetary policy communication\nhas evolved over time. Along the way, I’ll highlight how President Mester has\ncontributed to this evolution. And, finally, I’ll share some thoughts on the\ncommunication challenges that policymakers face.\nCurrent Federal Reserve Communication Channels\nCurrently, Fed policymakers communicate often. The Fed publishes a statement\nafter every Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, FOMC minutes three\nweeks following each meeting, a Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) four times a\nyear, and monetary policy, financial stability, and supervision and regulation reports\ntwice a year. The Chair holds a press conference after every FOMC meeting and testifies\nin front of Congress on the Monetary Policy Report twice a year. Other written\ncommunications from the Board and the 12 Federal Reserve Banks, as well as\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\npolicymakers’ speeches, interviews, and other appearances, help inform the public about\nthe Fed’s goals and its strategies to achieve those goals.\nCommunication isn’t only about talking, it’s about listening also. Listening is\nreflected in our activities. In addition to listening to the steady beat of economic data, the\nBoard and the Reserve Banks conduct numerous surveys of financial market participants,\nbusinesses, and families. Some of what we hear is summarized in the Beige Book\npublished eight times a year. And the Fed has many forms of community outreach,\nincluding Fed Listens events where Fed policymakers go into local communities to hear\ndirectly from people living and working there. Alternatively, sometimes representatives\nfrom communities come to us. For example, earlier this year, I heard from a rancher, a\nmanufacturing consultant, and the head of a nursing school at one of these events.\nToday, it’s widely accepted that clear communication contributes greatly to the\neffective transmission of monetary policy, especially because clear communication can\naffect the expected path of interest rates and financial conditions more generally. Loretta,\nin one of her speeches, describes very well the role of central bank communication: “The\npublic will have a better understanding of monetary policy when policymakers are clear\nabout their policy goals, those aspects of the economy monetary policy can and can’t\ninfluence, and the economic information that influences their forecasts and policy\ndecisions” (Mester, 2018).\nShe went on to explain that when policymakers are systematic in their policy\nresponses to changing economic conditions, the public will have a better idea of how the\nCommittee’s monetary policy is likely to change in response to anticipated and\nunanticipated economic developments. In particular, she noted: “With such knowledge,\n\n- 3 -\nhouseholds and firms can plan better; they can make better saving, borrowing,\ninvestment, and employment decisions” (Mester, 2018).\nThe Evolution of Federal Reserve Communications\nThe view reflected in Loretta’s words seems commonplace now, but it wasn’t\nalways so. When Loretta joined the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia in 1985, the\nFOMC didn’t disclose its interest rate decisions. It didn’t even report that it had made a\ndecision. In 1981, Karl Brunner, the Swiss monetary economist, called central banking\nan esoteric art and lamented central banks’ “inherent impossibility to articulate its\ninsights in explicit and intelligible words and sentences” (Brunner, 1981). At the time,\ncentral banking wisdom dictated that monetary policymakers should say as little as\npossible. Some research of that vintage tried to rationalize this “secrecy” through the\nnotion that monetary policy would be particularly effective if it surprised markets.2\nIn the 1990s, central bank communication changed dramatically. In 1993, the Fed\nstarted to publish FOMC meeting minutes in their current form, and in 1994, it began\nreleasing FOMC meeting transcripts with a five-year lag. In February 1994, the Fed\nstarted to publish post-FOMC meeting statements following meetings at which there was\na change in the intended federal funds rate. In May 1999, the FOMC started to publish\nstatements after every meeting, even on occasions when there was no change in policy.\nBy then, the move toward greater transparency was fully embraced by Chairman\nGreenspan, who had once prided himself on “mumbling with great incoherence.”3\n2 See, for example, Goodfriend (1986) and Cukierman and Meltzer (1986).\n3 Lindsey (2003) provides an extensive account of the history of FOMC communications from 1975 to\n2002.\n\n- 4 -\nThere were two primary reasons for this change. First, it was thought that greater\ntransparency would demonstrate the Fed’s accountability to the public and safeguard its\npolitical independence. Second, there was a growing appreciation in the economics\nprofession that clarity about policy could improve macroeconomic outcomes.\nExpectations became a focal point in academic and policy circles with the emergence of\nNew Keynesian models in the 1990s as a framework for monetary policy. In these\nmodels, aligning the expectations of decisionmakers in the private sector with those of\npolicymakers produced superior economic outcomes.4 Mike Woodford, one of the\ndevelopers of the New Keynesian model, put it this way: “Not only do expectations\nabout policy matter, but . . . very little else matters” (Woodford, 2005, p. 402).\nCommunicating a policy strategy and following through on it increased the credibility of\nthe central bank and, therefore, its ability to steer expectations and the economy. Clear\ncommunication also helped stabilize the economy and keep inflation closer to target\nbecause, when the Fed clearly articulated a reaction function, financial markets would be\nable to anticipate the likely future course of monetary policy and help the central bank do\nits work by affecting long-term rates and other asset prices.\nDuring the tenure of Chairman Bernanke, there was another burst of innovation in\nthe way monetary policy was communicated. In 2007, the first SEP was published to\nconvey systematically the economic outlook of FOMC participants. In 2011, Chairman\nBernanke started holding press conferences after every other FOMC meeting. In 2012,\nthe Fed adopted an explicit inflation target of 2 percent and started publishing individual\nFOMC participants’ views on the appropriate future path of the federal funds rate, now\n4 See Orphanides and Williams (2005), among many others.\n\n- 5 -\nfamously known as the “dot plot.”5 During these years, Loretta, in her capacity as the\nresearch director at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, contributed to ongoing\nwork on communications, in collaboration with policymakers and Federal Reserve Board\nstaff.\nOf course, this was an extraordinary time for monetary policy, as interest rates in\nmost advanced economies were close to zero following the Global Financial Crisis. The\nFOMC employed forward guidance—explicit communication about the future path of the\npolicy rate—as a key tool to deal with the unprecedented situation. The research\ncommunity had found that such forward guidance could be very effective in the context\nof the New Keynesian paradigm.6 When Loretta became president of the Federal\nReserve Bank of Cleveland in 2014, she supported the continued use of forward guidance\nduring these extraordinary times, in particular to communicate a lower-for-longer policy\nthat could provide accommodation in the presence of the effective lower bound\nconstraint. She also insisted that forward guidance could be used effectively even in\nnormal times as a means of clarifying the FOMC’s reaction function.\nLoretta, as a member of the FOMC subcommittee on communications, developed\nand advocated for several proposals to improve communications. One proposal was to\npublish a measure of uncertainty surrounding the SEP forecast numbers. She was\nconcerned that uncertainty could be underestimated by the public if it wasn’t\ncommunicated. The proposal was adopted, and “fan” charts showing uncertainty\n5 The document containing the 2 percent inflation target, named the “Statement on Longer-Run Goals and\nMonetary Policy Strategy,” also clarified that the Committee would not set a quantitative target for\nmaximum employment and stated that the Committee would follow a “balanced approach” in promoting\nboth sides of the dual mandate.\n6 Notable early studies include Eggertsson and Woodford (2003) and Adam and Billi (2006).\n\n- 6 -\nassociated with the median projections have been a feature of the SEP materials since\n2017. Progress toward greater transparency and more effective communication has since\ncontinued. For example, since 2019 Chair Powell has been holding a press conference\nafter every FOMC meeting.\nResearchers at academic and policy institutions have made advances in recent\nyears in measuring the effectiveness of central bank communication. For example,\nseveral researchers are now using natural language processing techniques to analyze the\nimpact of central bank communications—including statements, press conferences,\nspeeches, and minutes—on asset prices and economic outcomes.7 Another development\nis the identification of the effect that Federal Reserve policy communications may have\non asset prices using high-frequency financial market data. This empirical strategy has\nallowed researchers to establish new facts. For example, some economists have found\nthat policymaker speeches affect asset prices as much as the information released via\nFOMC statements and press conferences, and the effects that central bank\ncommunications have on asset prices can differ, depending on whether the\ncommunication conveys news about the policy rate path or about the economic outlook.8\nCommunication Challenges Facing Policymakers\nAs my brief retelling indicates, we have come a long way. Over the past 30 years,\nthe Fed and many other central banks have embraced transparency and deliberately used\ntheir communications as a policy tool. And researchers keep developing better methods\nto measure and evaluate our communications.\n7 Some recent contributions include Acosta (2023), Gardner and others (2022), and Ehrmann and Wabitsch\n(2022).\n8 See Swanson (2023) and Jarocinski and Karadi (2020).\n\n- 7 -\nAt this point, you may be wondering how much longer I am going to talk. And\nthat question leads me to the following one, which is salient for my topic today: Are\nthere limits to the benefits of communication?\nSurely, sometimes central bank communications can have unintended\nconsequences. Let me give you two examples. First, there is always a risk that\npolicymakers’ statements about their economic outlook or their expected future path of\nthe policy rate are interpreted by the public with a false sense of certainty. For example,\na data-dependent forward-guidance announcement can be mistaken for a commitment to\na fixed path of interest rates. When that interpretation is proven wrong down the road, it\ncan create more volatility and uncertainty than if there had been no announcement. That\nis why policymakers always make sure to stress the data dependence of future policy\ndecisions. Second, it’s also possible that the public misinterprets the views of individual\npolicymakers as a Committee view. The potential for misinterpretation is especially\nacute when many policymakers speak at the same time and disagree with each other.9\nThe diversity of viewpoints among policymakers lends itself to stimulating debates and,\nultimately, better policy. But in such a situation, more communication could increase\nrather than reduce uncertainty about our policies.\nI think we stand to benefit a lot from more research in this area. Important\nquestions include, how does the diversity of views among policymakers affect the\neffectiveness of communications? And, more generally, what distinguishes effective\nfrom ineffective central bank communication?\n9 This “cacophony problem” could be severe if policymakers actively tried to sway market expectations to\nalign with their personal views (Vissing-Jorgensen, 2019).\n\n- 8 -\nConclusion\nLet me conclude by repeating what I said at the beginning: To fulfill our dual\nmandate of promoting maximum employment and price stability, we need to formulate\ngood policies and to make sure that our policies are clearly understood. Doing so helps\nmake monetary policy more effective. Therefore, I encourage researchers to continue to\naddress important questions related to central bank communication. Finally, I\ncongratulate President Mester on her outstanding career in the Federal Reserve System\nand wish her the best of luck in her new adventures.\nThank you.\n\n- 9 -\nReferences\nAcosta, Miguel (2023). “A New Measure of Central Bank Transparency and\nImplications for the Effectiveness of Monetary Policy,” International Journal of\nCentral Banking, vol. 19 (August), pp. 49–97.\nAdam, Klaus, and Roberto M.

    "text": "For release on delivery\n10:30 a.m. EST\nFebruary 27, 2023\nRecent Inflation and the Dual Mandate\nRemarks by\nPhilip N. Jefferson\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nEc10, Principles of Economics, Lecture\nFaculty of Arts and Sciences, Harvard University\nCambridge, Massachusetts\nFebruary 27, 2023\n\nThank you, Jason, for inviting me to join your economics class and for your kind\nintroduction. It is a pleasure to be here. I miss teaching economics classes.\nBefore I continue, I would like to note, as I always do, that the views I will express today\nare my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues at the Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\nWhat I like about economics is that it deals with real-world issues, and many times we\nexperience firsthand a topic discussed in textbooks. Take the recent inflation, for example. This\nmay be your first experience with high inflation. I am sure you noticed prices going up at\nrestaurants, supermarkets, and the gas pump without having to read about it in the newspaper. I,\nfor one, can confirm that the inflationary pressure in the rental housing market in the\nWashington, D.C., area is real. While we have all experienced prices going up, it’s challenging\nto measure inflation itself and its consequences.\nToday, I want to do the following: discuss with you different ways to measure inflation,\ncharacterize our recent inflation, and contextualize the battle against inflation in terms of the\nFed’s dual-mandate goals of price stability and maximum employment. Then, I will offer some\nconcluding remarks.\nDifferent Ways to Measure Inflation\nThe two primary measures of the price level in the United States are the consumer price\nindex, commonly referred to as the CPI, and the personal consumption expenditures price index,\ncommonly referred to as the PCE price index. Positive changes in these indexes are recorded as\ninflation. Each inflation measure has both total (or headline) and core subindexes, which I will\ntalk about later. The CPI and PCE price indexes are constructed in broadly similar ways, but\n\nthere are important differences between them.1 Both indexes measure inflation using a specific\nbasket of goods and services consumed by households. These baskets are similar but not\nidentical across the two measures. Both measures also weight each item in their basket roughly\nin accordance with its expenditure share. That is, the more households spend on an item, like\nrent, the higher the weight it receives in the overall index. The weights are broadly similar\nacross the two indexes, but, again, there are some important differences.\nNow, let’s talk in more detail about the differences between the CPI and the PCE price\nindexes. First, the PCE price index has a broader scope than the CPI. The CPI is limited to\nexpenditures that households pay out of pocket, while the PCE price index covers a broader set\nof goods and services as it seeks to cover prices for all consumer expenditures in the national\nincome and product accounts (NIPA). For example, the PCE price index includes prices of the\nhealth services provided to households through Medicaid, while the CPI excludes these items.\nSecond, the PCE price index and the CPI use different weighting systems. The PCE price\nindex, which is more comprehensive than the CPI, estimates expenditure shares using the\nnational income and product accounts, while the CPI measures expenditure shares using a\nseparate survey of households, the Consumer Expenditure Survey. This leads to some\ndifferences in expenditure weights that can at times be important. For example, the share of\nmedical services is notably higher in the PCE price index (partly because the PCE price index\nincludes more kinds of medical expenditures), and the share of housing services is noticeably\nsmaller (because overall expenditures are larger in the PCE price index). As a result, when\n1 See, for example, Johnson (2017), who explains methodological similarities and differences between PCE price\nindex and CPI.\n\nhealth-care services or housing services inflation behave differently than other prices, this can\nlead to differences in PCE versus CPI inflation.\nAnother difference in the weights is that the PCE price index uses time-varying weights,\nwhile the official CPI keeps weights fixed for a year. The PCE price index weights change to\nreflect changes in the goods consumers buy. For instance, at the start of the pandemic, the CPI\nwas still giving the same weights to cruise ship and airline fares, even though no one was\ntraveling. The time-varying weights in PCE also account for substitution behavior. Suppose the\nprice of apples goes up and the price of oranges stays the same. Consumers are then likely to\nsubstitute apples with oranges. In contrast, the CPI does not capture substitution behavior\nbecause the basket of goods consumers purchase is updated only once a year (instead of every\nmonth) and reflects expenditure patterns prevailing two years ago. The substitution effects\ncaptured by the PCE price index is one reason why PCE inflation (black line) is, almost always,\nlower than CPI inflation (red line), as you can see in figure 1.\nAs I mentioned earlier, there are both total and core PCE price and CPI indexes. The\ncore subindex is the total index excluding food and energy prices.2 Food and energy prices are\nmore volatile than other prices, which makes total inflation more volatile.\nThis volatility is evident in figure 2. You can see the black line (total PCE price index)\nexhibiting more drastic ups and downs than core PCE price index, the red line in the graph, and\nmany of the sharp movements are short lived. In other words, the volatility in the total PCE\nprice index makes it harder to discern trends (longer-lasting movements) from transitory\nmovements. In addition, food and energy prices often depend on factors that are beyond the\n2 Note that the core indexes are defined somewhat differently. Both core indexes exclude all energy prices. But\nwhile the CPI excludes all food prices, the core PCE price index excludes food bought for consumption at home\n(that is, food purchased at grocery stores) but includes food purchased at restaurants.\n\ninfluence of monetary policy, such as geopolitical developments (for example, those associated\nwith fluctuations in energy prices) or weather or disease or war (for example, in the case of food\nprices).\nIn summary, the differences between CPI and PCE price indexes are important. The\nFOMC has chosen to target the PCE price index because it is broader and it captures more\naccurately what households are actually consuming.3 In addition, food and energy account for a\nsignificant portion of household budgets, so the Federal Reserve’s inflation objective is defined\nin terms of the total PCE price index, but the Fed monitors the core PCE price index, as well as\nother inflation indicators, in order to identify evolving inflation trends.4\nSelect Components of Core PCE Inflation\nNow, I would like to dig a bit deeper into recent inflation trends. To do so, I find it\nuseful to look at three large categories that together make up the core PCE price index: goods\nexcluding food and energy, housing services, and services excluding housing and energy. Slide\n7 provides some examples of what is in each subcomponent.\nFigure 3 shows recent inflation rates for each component: goods excluding food and\nenergy (black line), housing services (blue line), and services excluding housing and energy (red\nline). I look at these three categories separately because what has been causing inflation in each\nof these sectors is somewhat different. Understanding the different causes and how they affect\nthe different components could help the FOMC predict the future course of inflation. Since\n3 The Fed’s Monetary Policy Report explains why the Fed chooses the PCE price index to the CPI (see Board of\nGovernors, 2000, footnote 1). Notwithstanding this preference, the FOMC relies on a variety of aggregate price\nmeasures, as well as other information on prices and costs, in assessing the path of inflation.\n4 For an explanation of how the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System evaluates changes in inflation,\nsee Board of Governors (2016).\n\nmonetary policy affects the economy (and inflation) with a lag, the Committee is always forward\nlooking.\nFocusing on the price of core goods, the black line in figure 3, you can see how goods\nprices rose sharply in the second half of 2020 due to both a rapid shift in demand toward goods\nand unprecedented disruptions to global supply chains. As so many were isolating themselves—\nespecially those of us lucky enough to have jobs that let us work remotely—there was a sharp\nshift in demand from services (eating out and traveling) to durable goods (like stationary\nbicycles) to make our stay-at-home experience more pleasant. The pandemic also severely\ndisrupted the global production and distribution of goods, leading to large backlogs at ports and\nwidespread shortages of materials, most notably semiconductors. The imbalance between supply\nand demand for goods resulted in a sharp increase of prices. At the end of 2021, once vaccines\nwere developed and deployed and people slowly emerged from isolation, there was a partial shift\nin demand back to services, and supply chain bottlenecks started to ease. Thus, inflation in this\ncategory started to come down and has come down substantially.\nIn contrast to core goods, housing services inflation, the blue dashed line in figure 3, has\nnot started to come down yet. Housing services prices are estimated using information on rents\nand measure the price that renters pay, and homeowners would pay, to live in their homes. Like\ncore goods, demand in the housing sector underwent a major shift during the pandemic.\nThe surge in work from home shown in figure 4 led to an increase in the demand for\nbigger homes located in smaller metro areas or further from city centers. These shifts in demand\nhappened much more rapidly than the response in housing supply. As a result, rents increased\nquite significantly.\n\nWe have not seen a decline in housing services inflation, but there are indications that we\nsoon will. To see this, consider figure 5. Because rental agreements tend to be renewed\ninfrequently (often only once a year), average rents (the black line), which is what the PCE price\nindex measures, tend to lag market rents (the green, blue, and red lines), the rent I would pay if I\nwere to sign a new lease as a new tenant. For this reason, market rents are a leading indicator of\nhow overall rents and housing services prices are likely to change over the next 6 to 12 months.\nMarket rents are now increasing much more slowly than over 2021 and much of 2022,\nsuggesting that housing services inflation will eventually slow.\nLastly, inflation in other core services, the red line back in figure 3, is a large category\nthat covers activities as varied as travel and recreation, and medical and legal services. Inflation\nfor these services has remained stubbornly high. As other Governors and I have noted in the\npast, an important source of inflation pressures in this category has likely been the shortage of\nworkers, which has pushed up labor costs at rates above those consistent with 2 percent inflation.\nThe inflation outlook for this nonhousing category of core services partly depends on whether\ngrowth in nominal labor costs comes back down, and recent data suggest that labor\ncompensation has indeed started to decelerate somewhat over the past year.\nAlthough I have focused on core inflation because it is more useful for assessing trends in\ninflation, we also closely follow food and energy prices given that our target is for total inflation\nand that food and energy prices are very important for many households. Both food and energy\ninflation rose sharply following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. But more recently, food\ninflation has slowed somewhat, as global food prices have retraced some of their earlier\nincreases, while energy prices have fallen noticeably. Because energy prices are shaped\n\nprimarily by global developments and not by U.S. monetary policy, there is a lot of uncertainty\nabout the future course of energy inflation.\nIn summary, core goods inflation has started to come down. Several indicators suggest\nthat housing services inflation is likely to come down in the coming months. There is more\nuncertainty surrounding inflation in core services excluding housing. Over time, we’ll learn\nmore about inflation dynamics in this sector.\nBenefits of Price Stability and a Target of 2 Percent\nSo far, I’ve talked about how to measure inflation, about different subcomponents, and\nabout drivers of inflation. I will now discuss the benefits of price stability and a longer-run 2\npercent inflation rate target.\nPrice stability is one of two goals assigned to the Federal Reserve by law, but there is also\na broad consensus among economic researchers and policymakers that price stability is a\ndesirable objective. Deviations from price stability in the form of persistently elevated inflation\nrates are costly for the economy for several reasons, some of which I’ll review now.5\nFundamentally, a low and stable inflation rate is beneficial for the decisionmaking\nprocesses of households and firms. Choices regarding work, savings, and the expansion of\nbusiness enterprises are likely to be harder when there is uncertainty about the likely future\ncourse of prices. Retirement planning by households and investment decisions by firms are,\nconsequently, put on a sounder footing if there is confidence about the future value of the\ncurrency. The avoidance of this uncertainty is also likely to be beneficial for national economic\nperformance. If the prospect of high inflation or uncertainty about future inflation factors\n5 For examples of research on the costs of inflation, see Fischer and Modigliani (1978), Fischer (1981), McCallum\n(1990), Shiller (1997), and Feldstein (1999). See also the implications for monetary policy drawn by Bernanke and\nothers (1999). Diercks (2019) provides a detailed analysis of work that has appeared on the issue since the mid-\n1990s.\n\nheavily into firms’ and households’ calculations, it is less likely that resources will be allocated\nto activities that raise the productive potential of the economy, rather than into areas that are only\nmade attractive by the presence of high and variable inflation.6\nThere are other economic costs of high inflation. In the labor market, as nominal wages\nare often set in advance, bouts of unanticipated inflation typically lead to a drop in workers’ real\nwages in the short run, and this is a burden on households in meeting their expenses.7\nMore generally, even anticipated rates of inflation can produce redistributions of income.\nSuch redistributions are also likely to be adverse for members of society who do not have ready\naccess to the kinds of financial instruments that would best protect them against high inflation.\nThe likelihood of wide-ranging distortions due to inflation is enhanced by the fact that the\nU.S. tax code does not fully take inflation into account. Consequently, as stressed in\nfundamental work by the late Martin Feldstein of Harvard University, high inflation can distort\nsaving and investment decisions, including through the treatment of after-tax capital gains.8\nAnother reason why deviations from price stability distort decisions and redistribute\nincome lies in the fact that much of our financial system, including many arrangements\npertaining to retirement plans, is structured in terms of streams of nominal payments.9 Absent a\nbackground of a steady and predictable inflation rate, the purchasing power of retirement income\nstreams and other payments may turn out to be very different from what was envisioned when\nthey were originally arranged.\n6 One long-standing effect of inflation is that it creates incentives that would not otherwise be present to economize\non low-interest-bearing money balances. More broadly, an inflationary environment may distort portfolio decisions.\n7 Ultimately, nominal wage contracts will adjust to reflect a higher longer-run inflation rate. In the short run,\nhowever, it has been a long-standing feature of the U.S. economy that nominal wages tend to lag developments in\nprices; see, for example, Mitchell (1913) and Barattieri, Basu, and Gottschalk (2014). Consequently, inflation tends\nto drain worker purchasing power in the short run.\n8 See, for example, Feldstein (1982).\n9 Owing to contractual and other institutional arrangements, it may be difficult to adjust these streams of payments\npromptly once it emerges that the inflation rate is higher or lower than expected.\n\nThe fact that much of the financial system is based on nominal payments also makes it\nclear that unexpectedly or unduly low inflation rates have important economic costs, too,\nincluding by saddling borrowers (debtors) with very high repayment burdens in real terms.\nConsider homeowners who take out a conventional fixed-rate mortgage, with the expectation\ntheir nominal incomes will rise about 2 percent per year. If the economy were instead to\nexperience deflation accompanied by flat or declining wages, then after a few years the\nhomeowners might find it considerably more difficult to cover their monthly fixed mortgage\npayments than they had originally anticipated. This increase in the real value of debts due to\nvery low inflation or, worse, outright deflation would also be a burden on all households that\nhave outstanding fixed nominal student loans, auto loans, or credit card debt, as well as\nbusinesses that had taken out bank loans or issued bonds.\nIn 2012, the FOMC set a formal inflation target to help households and businesses\nunderstand our goal and help keep inflation expectations anchored over time. The FOMC’s\nchoice of a 2 percent inflation rate, instead of zero, reflected the judgment that reasonable price\nstability was desirable while also recognizing the reality that very low inflation can also be\neconomically costly.10 In addition, a zero percent goal would make the longer-run nominal\ninterest rate 2 percentage points lower than would be the case under a 2 percent inflation goal. A\nzero-inflation environment would consequently restrict the FOMC’s scope to lower nominal\ninterest rates when this was necessary for stabilization purposes. In contrast, a 2 percent\ninflation rate is still low enough to be consistent with price stability but gives the FOMC greater\n10 The Federal Reserve has had price stability as a formal part of its mandate since 1977. In 2012, the 2 percent\ninflation objective was seen as formalizing judgments that the Committee had already made over the previous years\nabout the appropriate inflation rate. For analyses of how the Federal Reserve has interpreted its price-stability\nmandate over time, see the transcript of the FOMC’s January 24–25, 2012, meeting, which is available on the\nBoard’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC20120125meeting.pdf; see also\nOrphanides (2006) and Nelson (2021).\n\nscope to stimulate the economy in times when it judges that achievement of maximum\nemployment requires that the Committee provide policy accommodation.\nFrom these considerations flows the conclusion that a 2 percent inflation rate is the price-\nstability objective most consistent with the FOMC’s dual mandate. The 2 percent longer-run\ninflation goal has been maintained since 2012.\nPolicy Risks and the Benefits of Credibility\nOften, the FOMC must balance competing risks given its dual mandate of promoting\nmaximum employment and stable prices. In the current context, there is, on the one hand, the\nrisk that monetary policy will not be sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation back to 2 percent\nover time, and on the other hand there is a risk of policy being too restrictive and unnecessarily\nincreasing the likelihood of recession. In the face of this latter risk, some economists argue that\na higher inflation target is better than the Fed’s current 2 percent target rate.11 Changing the\nFOMC’s longer-run inflation objective, however, would introduce an additional risk by calling\ninto question the FOMC’s commitment to stabilizing inflation at any level because it might lead\npeople to suspect that the target could be changed opportunistically in the future. If so, then\nthese reputational costs will undermine the key benefits of well-anchored longer-run inflation\nexpectations discussed above: an increased ability of monetary policy to fight economic\ndownturns without sacrificing price stability. Moreover, if the purpose of a higher inflation\n11 See, for example, Summers (1991) and Reifschneider and Williams (2000). Blanchard, Dell’Ariccia, and Mauro\n(2010), among others, have suggested that central banks should consider raising their target inflation rate, on the\ngrounds that conditions since the financial crisis have demonstrated that monetary policy is more constrained by the\neffective lower bound (ELB) on nominal interest rates than was originally estimated. Ball (2013), for example, has\nproposed 4 percent as a more appropriate target for the FOMC. While it is certainly likely that earlier analyses of\nthe implications of the ELB significantly underestimated the likelihood of severe recessions and slow recoveries of\nthe sort recently experienced in the United States and elsewhere (see Chung and others, 2012), it is also the case that\nthese analyses did not consider central banks’ ability to use large-scale asset purchases and other unconventional\ntools as a means of providing economic stabilization in the presence of the ELB constraint.\n\ntarget is to increase the ability of the central bank to deal with the severe recessions that follow\nfinancial crises, then a better strategic approach might be to rely on more vigorous supervisory\nand macroprudential policies that could help reduce the likelihood of such events. Further,\nseeking an inflation rate in the vicinity of 4 percent or higher would certainly stretch the meaning\nof “stable prices” in the Federal Reserve Act.12\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, today, I have discussed with you how persistently high inflation hurts\neveryone and how the Fed must jointly achieve price stability and maximum employment to\nfulfill its dual mandate over time. I also discussed how persistently low inflation is costly, and\nhow changing the 2 percent inflation target would damage the central bank’s credibility. For\nthese reasons, I am committed to lowering inflation to our 2 percent target.\nThis is a very exciting time to study economics. I hope that the ways of thinking you are\ndeveloping in this class will help you better understand economic phenomena that you observe\nand the challenges that policymakers face.\nThank you.\n12 In rejecting a 4 percent inflation target, Bernanke (2010a) suggests that “inflation would be higher and probably\nmore volatile under such a policy” and “inflation expectations would also likely become significantly less stable.”\nAccording to Bernanke (2010b), “The Federal Reserve over a long period of time has established a great deal of\ncredibility in terms of keeping inflation low, around 2 percent . . . If we were to go to 4 percent, and say we’re going\nto 4 percent, we would risk I think losing a lot of that hard-won credibility because folks would say, well, if we go to\n4, why not go to 6 . . . It would be very difficult to tie down credible expectations at 4.”\n\nReferences\nBall, Laurence (2013). “The Case for Four Percent Inflation,” Central Bank of the Republic of\nTurkey, Central Bank Review, vol. 13 (May), pp. 17–31.\nBarattieri, Alessandro, Susanto Basu, and Peter Gottschalk (2014). “Some Evidence on the\nImportance of Sticky Wages,” American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics, vol. 6\n(January), pp. 70–101.\nBernanke, Ben (2010a). “The Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy,” speech delivered at the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Economic Symposium, Jackson Hole, Wyoming,\nAugust 27, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20100827a.htm.\n——— (2010b). “Statement of the Honorable Ben Bernanke, Chairman, Board of Governors of\nthe Federal Reserve System,” in The Economic Outlook, hearing before the Joint\nEconomic Committee, U.S. Congress, April 14, Senate Hearing 111-583, 111 Cong.\nWashington: Government Printing Office.\nBernanke, Ben S., Thomas Laubach, Frederic S.

    "text": "For release on delivery\n12:30 p.m. EDT\nOctober 9, 2024\nThe Fed’s Discount Window: 1990 to the Present\nRemarks by\nPhilip N. Jefferson\nVice Chair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nCharlotte Economics Club\nCharlotte, North Carolina\nOctober 9, 2024\n\nThank you, Steve, for that kind introduction and for the opportunity to talk to this\ngroup today.1\nLet me start by saying that I am saddened by the tragic loss of life, destruction,\nand damage resulting from Hurricane Helene in North Carolina, and throughout this\nregion. My thoughts are with the people and communities affected. For our part, the\nFederal Reserve and other federal and state financial regulatory agencies are working\nwith banks and credit unions in the affected area to help make sure they can continue to\nmeet the financial services needs of their communities.\nYesterday I shared my historical perspective on the discount window at Davidson\nCollege.2 In 1913, when the Federal Reserve was established, the discount window was\nthe main tool it used to provide the nation with a safer, more flexible, and more stable\nmonetary and financial system. More than 110 years later, the discount window\ncontinues to play an important role in supporting the liquidity and stability of the banking\nsystem, and the effective implementation of monetary policy.\nToday I would like to discuss with you how the discount window has evolved in\nthe 21st century, including recent steps the Federal Reserve Board has taken to solicit\nfeedback from the public on discount window operations. Before I address our most\nrecent efforts, however, I will review some important episodes in discount window\nhistory that brought us to where we are today.\nFirst, I will recount briefly events in the 1980s and early 1990s that provide\nimportant context for the reappraisal of the discount window in the early 2000s. Second,\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 See Jefferson (2024).\n\n- 2 -\nI will summarize revisions to the discount window that the Fed made in 2003 and some\nadditional changes made since then. Third, I will describe efforts that the Fed has taken\nto ensure that the discount window remains effective today, including the request for\ninformation that the Board recently issued on operational aspects of the discount window\nand intraday credit. After completing my discussion of the discount window, I will\nconclude with my outlook for the U.S. economy.\nEvents before the 2003 Discount Window Revisions\nI would like to pick up today where I left off yesterday in my speech at Davidson\nCollege: the 1980s and early 1990s. This was a period of widespread problems in the\ncommercial banking sector. Troubled institutions borrowed from the discount window\nfor extended periods of time as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) sought\nto find merger partners or otherwise manage the closure of these institutions. As a result,\nthe discount window became associated strongly with lending to troubled institutions.\nHealthy banks’ reluctance to borrow from the discount window increased. The greater\nreluctance to borrow from the discount window made it less effective both as a monetary\npolicy tool and as a crisis-fighting tool.3 This led to a reassessment of the discount\nwindow in the early 2000s and to eventual revisions implemented in 2003.\n3 For more details about this period, see Clouse (1994). In response to the wave of depository institution\nfailures, Congress placed legal limitations on Federal Reserve lending to troubled institutions. Specifically,\nsection 142 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) amended\nsection 10B of the Federal Reserve Act to place restraints on discount window lending to undercapitalized\nand critically undercapitalized insured depository institutions. FDICIA also imposed liability on the Board\nof Governors for excess losses incurred by the FDIC that are attributable to lending beyond those limits.\nThe provisions of FDICIA were intended to reduce moral hazard in the banking system and limit taxpayer\nlosses.\n\n- 3 -\nA Reassessment of the Discount Window in the Early 2000s\nThe key challenge in the reassessment of the discount window was to establish a\nlending program that would not only operate effectively and support monetary policy\nimplementation, but also mitigate moral hazard and provide sufficient controls to\nminimize risk to Reserve Banks and, ultimately, to American taxpayers. After the\nreassessment, the Fed implemented several changes aimed to achieve the right balance.\nThe Board replaced the adjustment credit program, which was extended at a\nbelow-market rate, with a new type of discount window credit called primary credit. This\nnew type of discount window credit became effective in 2003.4 It is available as a\nbackup source of liquidity to depository institutions in generally sound financial\ncondition at an above-market rate. Making the discount rate a penalty rate is more\nconsistent with the long-standing practice of other major central banks. This feature was\nintended to reduce the need for administrative pressures based on Reserve Bank staff\njudgment of inappropriate usage when the discount rate was below market rates.\nAlthough those measures effectively limited usage that was deemed inappropriate at the\ntime, they also presented communication challenges regarding when it was appropriate to\nuse the discount window and perpetuated the perception that the Fed discouraged its use.\nPrimary credit is a “no questions asked” facility in which eligible depository\ninstitutions are no longer required to have exhausted other sources of funding or be\nsubject to restrictions on the use of the borrowed funds. The Fed initially set the primary\ncredit rate 100 basis points above the target federal funds rate.5 Since March 2020, the\n4 For more details, see the October 31, 2002, Federal Reserve press release (Board of Governors, 2002b)\nand the final rule implementing the changes (Board of Governors, 2002a).\n5 In 2003, when primary credit was implemented, there was a single federal funds target rate. The Federal\nOpen Market Committee adopted a federal funds target range on December 16, 2008.\n\n- 4 -\nFed has set the primary credit rate at a level equal to the top of the target range for the\nfederal funds rate.6\nAt the same time primary credit was established, another new program, called\nsecondary credit, replaced the extended credit program. Secondary credit is available to\ndepository institutions that are not eligible for primary credit. It was initially available at\nan interest rate 50 basis points higher than the primary credit rate, which is the spread in\neffect today. In contrast to primary credit, extensions under secondary credit are subject\nto higher collateral discounts and may involve ongoing oversight on the use of funds\nobtained under the program, reflecting the less-sound condition of secondary credit\nborrowers. Typically, Reserve Banks review a depository institution’s plan to repay the\nloan and return to market sources of funding.\nThis two-tiered structure of providing the no-questions-asked primary credit\nprogram for healthy depository institutions and the secondary credit program for less-\nthan-healthy depository institutions was designed primarily to instill public confidence in\nthe health of institutions borrowing from the primary credit program and to reduce the\nreluctance of healthy depository institutions to borrow.7 In addition, having two separate\nfacilities would reinforce the notion that healthy and troubled depository institutions alike\nshould regard borrowing from the Fed as an option in the event of a need for additional\nfunds.\n6 For details on the change to the rate spread announced in March 2020, see the press release (Board of\nGovernors, 2020). As will be discussed in greater detail later, before 2020, the spread between the primary\ncredit rate and the target federal funds rate (or top of the target range) had changed a few times to address\neconomic conditions during the 2007–09 financial crisis and the subsequent recovery.\n7 This design feature also would help Reserve Banks manage risk more easily by establishing a\nstandardized approach and risk controls when lending through a facility reserved for troubled depository\ninstitutions. Loans to troubled depository institutions entail more risk to the lending Reserve Bank, and\ndepository institutions that are undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized are subject to lending\nlimitations under FDICIA.\n\n- 5 -\nIn the early years of the switch to the new facilities, there were signs that healthy\ndepository institutions became more willing to borrow from the discount window. For\nexample, some research found that after the 2003 discount window revisions, banks\nborrowed more from the discount window when the federal funds rate spiked than they\nhad previously.8 This finding suggests that the redesign of the discount window was\neffective in reducing banks’ reluctance to borrow. As a result, the discount window may\nhave been more effective in placing a ceiling on short-term funding rates, aiding the\nimplementation of monetary policy, and serving as a liquidity tool when needed.\nNevertheless, it is important to acknowledge that it is difficult to measure\nreluctance to borrow from the discount window. When the interest rate on primary credit\nis above the target federal funds rate and the federal funds rate is close to its target, the\naggregate volume of primary credit is expected to be low. In other words, a low average\nlevel of discount window borrowing does not necessarily mean that there is a reluctance\nto borrow; instead, it could simply reflect a situation in which depository institutions do\nnot currently need to borrow. In addition, when there is an abundance of liquidity in the\nbanking system, as is the case in the current ample-reserves monetary policy regime,\ndepository institutions may have less need to obtain additional liquidity via the discount\nwindow. Again, this does not necessarily mean that there is a reluctance to borrow.\nConversely, the presence of discount window borrowing does not necessarily reflect the\nabsence of a reluctance to borrow. It could be the case that, although aggregate usage\nincreases, there are still some depository institutions that are willing to pay well above\nthe primary credit rate even when they could have borrowed readily from the discount\n8 See Artuç and Demiralp (2010).\n\n- 6 -\nwindow. For these reasons, it is important that we complement data with market\noutreach information to assess the effectiveness of the discount window.\nChanges and Challenges since the Introduction of Primary and Secondary Credit\nPrimary and secondary credit exist today, but some changes have been made to\nprimary credit since its inception. For example, although the discount window was used\nextensively and played an important role in the emergency measures taken during the\nfinancial crisis of 2007–09, some depository institutions during this period still were\nwilling to borrow funds from the market at rates above the discount rate.9 This suggested\nthat there was a reluctance to borrow before the crisis, and that reluctance appeared to\ngrow over the course of the crisis. To promote the restoration of orderly conditions in\nfinancial markets and provide depository institutions with greater assurance about the\ncost and availability of funding, the Board approved temporary changes to its primary\ncredit discount window facility during the crisis.10 In addition, in late 2007, the Board\nestablished the Term Auction Facility (TAF).11\nConcerns about lending to troubled depository institutions reemerged after the\n2007–09 financial crisis. In the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer\n9 See Bernanke (2009a) and Madigan (2009) for a retrospective that elaborates on some of the emergency\nmeasures taken during the 2007–09 financial crisis and the reasoning for discount window rate changes\nduring the financial crisis.\n10 Throughout this crisis, the Board approved numerous reductions in the primary credit rate and narrowed\nthe spread between the primary credit rate and the target federal funds rate twice. With the narrowing of\nthe spread in August 2007 from 100 basis points to 50 basis points and in March 2008 to 25 basis points,\nthe Board announced that the maximum term for primary credit loans would be extended, first to 30 days\nand then to 90 days, respectively. As economic conditions improved, in 2010, the Board increased the\nspread between the primary credit rate and the target federal funds rate to 50 basis points and shortened the\nmaximum term for primary credit loans to overnight.\n11 The TAF provided fixed quantities of term credit to depository institutions through an auction\nmechanism and seemed to have largely addressed banks’ concern that borrowing from the Federal Reserve\nwould imply weakness. According to Bernanke (2009b, paragraph 7), this was “partly because the sizable\nnumber of borrowers provides a greater assurance of anonymity, and possibly also because the three-day\nperiod between the auction and auction settlement suggests that the facility’s users are not using it to meet\nacute funding needs on a particular day.”\n\n- 7 -\nProtection Act, which was enacted in 2010, Congress required the Fed to publish detailed\nindividual institution borrowing data with a two-year lag.12 This action was intended to\nenhance the transparency and accountability of Federal Reserve lending while still\npreserving a measure of confidentiality to avoid discouraging depository institutions from\nborrowing.\nMore recently, in March 2020, the Fed announced changes to the provision of\nprimary credit that were intended to encourage depository institutions to use the discount\nwindow to meet demands for credit from households and businesses in connection with\nthe COVID-19 pandemic. These changes included setting the primary credit rate at a\nlevel equal to the top of the federal funds target range—a step that enhanced the ability of\nthe discount window to support trading within the Federal Open Market Committee’s\n(FOMC) target range for the federal funds rate—and communicating the terms of\nborrowing as 90 days, prepayable and renewable on a daily basis. To further encourage\ndepository institutions to use the discount window, the Fed also made changes to its\nreporting of Reserve Bank–level aggregate weekly discount window borrowing. It\nconsolidated amounts previously reported as “loans,” which include discount window\nborrowing, into a broader category of assets.13 The changes made in 2020 remain in\neffect.\n12 See section 1103 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which amended section 11 of the Federal Reserve Act.\n13 The Board’s H.4.1 statistical release, “Factors Affecting Reserve Balances of Depository Institutions and\nCondition Statement of Federal Reserve Banks,” is published weekly\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h41). It presents a balance sheet for each Federal Reserve Bank, a\nconsolidated balance sheet for all 12 Reserve Banks, an associated statement that lists the factors affecting\nreserve balances of depository institutions, and several other tables presenting information on the assets,\nliabilities, and commitments of the Federal Reserve Banks. For additional details on the consolidation of\n“loans” into a broader category of assets, see the March 19, 2020, H.4.1 announcement, available on the\nBoard’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h41/20200319.\n\n- 8 -\nDuring and after the spring 2023 stress events, the discount window again played\nan important role in supporting both monetary policy and financial stability. Depository\ninstitutions that came under severe stress turned to the discount window. The discount\nwindow also served an important role in providing ready access to funding, especially for\ndepository institutions experiencing spillovers from the bank failures. To further ensure\nthat depository institutions had the ability to meet the needs of all their depositors, the\nBoard announced the creation of a new emergency program, the Bank Term Funding\nProgram (BTFP). Although the BTFP was established pursuant to the Board’s\nemergency lending authority in section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, the BTFP used\nthe discount window infrastructure to lend to eligible depository institution borrowers.14\nBy relying on the existing discount window infrastructure, the BTFP was able to begin\noperating right away. The program ceased extending new loans on March 11, 2024, as\nscheduled.\nToday the discount window continues to be an effective tool, but it is important to\nacknowledge that economic and banking conditions continue to evolve. Since the 2003\ndiscount window reassessment, we have seen an increased focus on liquidity in banking\nregulation, including the advent of quantitative liquidity requirements for large banking\norganizations; technological changes in the banking system; a general trend toward faster\nand 24-7-365 payment systems; changes in the composition and posture of Federal Home\n14 As with the discount window, an eligible institution participated in the BTFP through its local Reserve\nBank. The legal agreements and process for pledging securities in the BTFP also relied on those used in\ndiscount window lending. Nevertheless, the BTFP differed from the discount window in various ways,\nincluding the term of lending, scope of eligible collateral, collateral valuation, and interest rate. For more\ninformation on the differences between the BTFP and the discount window, see the response to question\nA.3 in Board of Governors (2024a, p. 3). For additional details on the BTFP, see the March 12, 2023, press\nrelease (Board of Governors, 2023).\n\n- 9 -\nLoan Bank lending; and the move to an ample-reserves monetary policy implementation\nregime.\nIn light of these developments, the Federal Reserve System has taken important\nsteps to ensure that the discount window performs its functions successfully in the 21st-\ncentury economy. For example, last year the Board, along with the other federal banking\nagencies and the National Credit Union Administration, issued guidance on contingency\nfunding plans that encouraged depository institutions to be ready to borrow from the\ndiscount window.15 This includes taking steps to establish borrowing relationships with\nthe Federal Reserve, such as providing certain legal documentation and ensuring that\ncollateral to secure loans is ready to pledge. In connection with interagency initiatives,\nReserve Banks have conducted outreach to depository institutions and made efforts to\nguide them in using the discount window.\nData suggest that this encouragement is working. By the end of 2023, 3,900\nbanks, or roughly 80 percent of all banks, had completed the legal documentation\nrequired to borrow from the discount window.16 Of those, nearly 2,000 banks had\npledged collateral, with an aggregate lendable value of over $2.6 trillion after applying\nappropriate discounts. These figures are notably above their levels at the end of 2021 and\n2022. Although I am pleased to see the improvements in discount window readiness\nstatistics, continued outreach is still important. To that effect, this summer, Federal\nReserve Banks hosted an Ask the Fed® session to discuss the purpose of the discount\n15 See Board of Governors and others (2023).\n16 The statistics in this paragraph are available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/discount-window-readiness.htm.\n\n- 10 -\nwindow, its facilities, and recommendations for depository institutions on how to prepare\nto borrow from the Fed.17\nAdditionally, the Federal Reserve System has made important investments to\nenhance the technology that supports discount window activities. Earlier this year, the\nSystem launched Discount Window Direct, which is an online portal for depository\ninstitutions to request and prepay loans as well as securely message their local Reserve\nBank.18 Discount Window Direct generally is accessible 24 hours a day. We are actively\nencouraging the use of Discount Window Direct.\nSeeking Feedback on the Discount Window\nTo complement our efforts to enhance discount window operations, the Federal\nReserve Board recently announced that it is collecting feedback from the public on\noperational frictions associated with the discount window and intraday credit through the\nissuance of a request for information. As some of you may know, a request for\ninformation is a formal document through which a government agency solicits feedback.\nMembers of the public can submit comments in response to the request for information\nuntil December 9, 2024.19\nThe Board requests input on various discount window and intraday credit\noperational practices, such as the process for requesting, receiving, and repaying discount\nwindow loans as well as Reserve Bank discount window and intraday credit\ncommunications practices. Through the request for information, the Board hopes to gain\n17 More information on Ask the Fed is available on the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis’s website at\nhttps://bsr.stlouisfed.org/askthefed/Auth/Logon.\n18 Additional details on Discount Window Direct can be found on the Federal Reserve Bank Services\nwebsite at https://www.frbservices.org/central-bank/lending-central.\n19 See the information on discount window operations in section II.A of Board of Governors (2024b).\n\n- 11 -\nfurther insight into the operational aspects that are the most costly or burdensome for\ndepository institutions. This will help the Fed consider further improvements to promote\nefficiency and reduce burden on depository institutions. Ultimately, the Fed’s goal is to\nbuild on the current discount window operations and processes so that the discount\nwindow will continue to provide ready access to funding against a wide range of\ncollateral in the future. I encourage members of the public to submit comments on the\nrequest for information, and I look forward to considering the feedback that we receive.\nEconomic Outlook\nBefore concluding, let me share with you a summary of my outlook for the U.S.\neconomy, as I did yesterday with the audience at Davidson. Economic activity continues\nto grow at a solid pace. Inflation has eased substantially. The labor market has cooled\nfrom its formerly overheated state.\nPersonal consumption expenditures (PCE) prices rose 2.2 percent over the\n12 months ending in August, well down from 6.5 percent two years earlier. Excluding\nthe volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.7 percent, compared with\n5.2 percent two years earlier. Our restrictive monetary policy stance played a role in\nrestraining demand and in keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored, as\nreflected in a broad range of inflation surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters,\nas well as measures from financial markets. Inflation is now much closer to the FOMC’s\n2 percent objective. I expect that we will continue to make progress toward that goal.\nWhile, overall, the economy continues to grow at a solid pace, the labor market\nhas modestly cooled. Employers added an average of 186,000 jobs per month during\nJuly through September, a slower pace than seen early this year. The unemployment rate\n\n- 12 -\nnow stands at 4.1 percent, up from 3.8 percent in September 2023. Meanwhile, job\nopenings declined by about 4 million since their peak in March 2022. The good news is\nthat the rise in unemployment has been limited and gradual, and the level of\nunemployment remains historically low. Even so, the cooling in the labor market is\nnoticeable.\nCongress mandated the Fed to pursue maximum employment and price stability.\nThe balance of risks to our two mandates has changed—as risks to inflation have\ndiminished and risks to employment have risen, these risks have been brought roughly\ninto balance. The FOMC has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving\nsustainably toward our 2 percent goal. To maintain the strength of the labor market, my\nFOMC colleagues and I recalibrated our policy stance last month, lowering our policy\ninterest rate by 1/2 percentage point.\nLooking ahead, I will carefully watch incoming data, the evolving outlook, and\nthe balance of risks when considering additional adjustments to the federal funds target\nrange, our primary tool for adjusting the stance of monetary policy. My approach to\nmonetary policymaking is to make decisions meeting by meeting.

    "text": "For release on delivery\n10:40 a.m. EST (9:40 a.m. CST)\nNovember 17, 2022\nOpportunity and Inclusive Economic Growth\nRemarks by\nPhilip N. Jefferson\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\n2022 Institute Research Conference, hosted by\nthe Opportunity and Inclusive Growth Institute\nFederal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis\nMinneapolis, Minnesota\nNovember 17, 2022\n\nGood morning, and thank you. It is a pleasure to be here. I would like to use my\ntime today to answer the question posed by the title of this session: What can the Fed\nlearn from research on opportunity and inclusive growth? But, first, let me remind you\nthat the views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else\non the Federal Open Market Committee or in the Federal Reserve System.\nSome of the Fed’s purview—including consumer protection, community\ndevelopment, and financial stability—can help to support inclusive growth. But\nmonetary policy cannot address these issues directly. I do, however, see a direct line\nbetween research on opportunity and inclusive growth and our dual mandate of maximum\nemployment and price stability. Fulfillment of our mandate is likely easier if certain\nother conditions are present. For example, if the channels of upward social mobility are\nopen and working for all, we are likely to see both higher labor market participation and\nhigher productivity—both of which make it easier to attain maximum employment amid\nlow and stable inflation. The better we understand the channels that affect the health and\nfunction of the overall economy, the better we can calibrate our policy decisions to\ndeliver on our dual mandate.\nThose channels consist of several areas that are, largely, not ours to make policy\nabout but are important for our policies to be effective in promoting the conditions for\nprosperity. They include health, housing, transportation, childcare, disability services,\neducation, access to the financial system, and access to capital.\nFirst, I would like to address monetary policy. In pursuing its dual mandate, the\nFederal Reserve is essentially trying to foster and maintain the conditions in which the\neconomy and all its participants can thrive. Research has shown that the benefits of a\n\n- 2 -\nstrong economy—with high employment and stable prices—are especially significant for\nless advantaged groups.1 These groups also tend to see the greatest gains later in an\nexpansion, meaning that they benefit the most from sustained periods of growth—like the\nexpansion we were experiencing before the pandemic, which was the longest on record.2\nFor example, during the pre-pandemic expansion, the long-standing disparity between\nunemployment rates for prime-age African Americans and Hispanics and their white\ncounterparts began to close. In fact, disparities in labor market outcomes just prior to the\nonset of the pandemic were the narrowest in at least 50 years. At the same time, inflation\nremained low—lower, in fact, than our 2 percent target for most of that time—and\nshowed little sign of picking up despite the strong labor market.\nUnfortunately, the pandemic brought about the most rapid and severe labor\nmarket contraction of the past 80 years. It also had a noticeably larger effect on the\nunemployment rates of women and of Black and Hispanic individuals than it did on most\nother demographic groups. And while job losses were widespread across all sectors of\nthe economy, workers with less education were particularly hard hit. This was especially\ntrue for those unable to work remotely or in jobs that required in-person interactions.\nAs the economy reopened and began to recover, unemployment rates for those\ngroups initially affected the most—Black and Hispanic workers—also fell more sharply.\nToday, while material disparities in unemployment rates along racial lines persist, these\ndisparities have almost returned to the narrower ranges we saw just before the pandemic.\n1 See Tomaz Cajner, Tyler Radler, David Ratner, and Ivan Vidangos (2017), “Racial Gaps in Labor Market\nOutcomes in the Last Four Decades and over the Business Cycle,” Finance and Economics Discussion\nSeries 2017-071 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, June),\nhttps://doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2017.071.\n2 See, for example, Stephanie R. Aaronson, Mary C. Daly, William L. Wascher, and David W. Wilcox\n(2019), “Okun Revisited: Who Benefits Most from a Strong Economy?” Brookings Papers on Economic\nActivity, Spring, pp. 333–75, https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Aaronson_web.pdf.\n\n- 3 -\nHowever, as the economy has recovered, strong demand and a variety of supply\nconstraints have contributed to the fastest increases in consumer prices since the early\n1980s. Inflation, too, has disproportionate effects on, and is felt most acutely by, those\nwho can least afford it. Price increases have been particularly sharp for necessities like\nfood, transportation, and shelter, which make up a substantial portion of household\nbudgets for people on the lower end of the pay scale. Lower-income households also\nhave less in savings to buffer price increases, meaning that they not only feel the effects\nmore forcefully, but they also feel them immediately. The savings they do have are more\nlikely to be in cash or noninterest-bearing accounts, which means inflation directly erodes\nthe purchasing power of their savings.\nMonetary policy cannot address the specific reasons that low-income households\nsuffer the most from high inflation. But these reasons help to illustrate the importance of\nlow inflation: Low inflation is key to achieving a long and sustained expansion—an\neconomy that works for all. Pursuing our dual mandate is the best way for the Federal\nReserve to promote widely shared prosperity. At the same time, it is critical for monetary\npolicymakers to understand the many and varied conditions that can make our policies\nmore effective in fostering prosperity.\nNow let me turn to these concomitant conditions for prosperity outside of the\nFed’s mandate, which nevertheless should be carefully studied. Many of them are\nstraightforward, like housing, transportation, and childcare. Even as remote work has\nincreased, many jobs remain in person and on site. If people cannot live near work,\neither because of the cost or because jobs are located in nonresidential areas, they must\ncommute. Commuting depends on public or personal transportation—which in turn\n\n- 4 -\nrelies on infrastructure, such as roads and highways. And time spent commuting affects\nchildcare decisions. Caring responsibilities overall—for children or for other relatives—\ncan keep people out of the workforce, and the onus falls disproportionately on women.\nThis was particularly evident during the pandemic, and particularly true for Black and\nHispanic mothers.3\nFinancial participation is also clearly connected to prosperity. Being unbanked\nmeans less financial security. Less access to credit means a smaller, or even nonexistent,\nsafety net, but it also means less opportunity, be that buying a house to build capital,\nfunding education, or starting a business.\nBut there are other, less obvious—or even less quantifiable—issues. Beyond\nlocation, a home provides both basic needs, such as shelter, and invaluable benefits, such\nas a sense of personal safety and dignity. It is a refuge in which our minds and bodies\ncan recuperate and regenerate so we are prepared to participate in all aspects of life,\nincluding the next day’s work. The costs of living in disadvantaged areas or of dealing\nwith financial hardship can be seen in all areas of life. Higher stress, the frequent\nnecessity of working more than one job, the absence of benefits, and the time and money\nspent commuting—all these exact a financial and psychological toll. There is a\nfundamental aspect of our humanity, which is to live a more fulfilling existence—to\nenjoy the richness of life. In an economy that works for all, we should not live to work,\nbut work to live. These are the factors that will allow people to thrive.\n3 See Joshua Montes, Christopher Smith, and Isabel Leigh (2021), “Caregiving for Children and Parental\nLabor Force Participation during the Pandemic,” FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System, November 5), https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-\nnotes/caregiving-for-children-and-parental-labor-force-participation-during-the-pandemic-20211105.html.\n\n- 5 -\nOf course, policies that can address these important issues are not made by Fed\npolicymakers. But the research agenda we are discussing today helps us to understand\nbetter those aspects of well-being that allow people to prosper and to enrich their lives\nmore broadly. Thank you.",

Jefferson\nVice Chair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nPeterson Institute for International Economics\nWashington, D.C.\nFebruary 22, 2024\n\nThank you, Adam, and thank you to Peterson for the opportunity to speak to you\ntoday.\nBefore I begin, let me remind you that the views I will express today are my own\nand are not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\nI will take this opportunity to share with you my outlook on the U.S. economy\nand some upside and downside risks to which I am paying special attention. Also, I will\nreview past monetary policy cycles and discuss what lessons we may learn from them.\nWith that, let me turn to my outlook for the U.S. economy.\nAggregate Economic Activity\nGrowth in real gross domestic product in 2023 came in much higher than\nexpected by most professional forecasters, buoyed by strength in consumer spending.\nToward the end of 2023, however, household balance sheets began to weaken, as\nindicated by higher delinquency rates and a further decline in savings. These\ndevelopments lead me to expect slower growth in spending and output in 2024. Even so,\nwithout a clear understanding of why consumer spending has been so resilient, I see\ncontinuing strength in spending as an important upside risk to my forecast. One possible\nexplanation is that consumers do not want to give up previous levels of consumption,\nperhaps because of habit formation as described by Robert Pollak (1970) and an\noptimistic view of future income prospects. Another possibility is the one raised in\npioneering work by James Duesenberry (1949) 75 years ago and later developed in the\ncontext of modern macroeconomics by Jordi Gali (1994). Socially motivated\nconsumption—or “keeping up with the Joneses”—could cause individuals to consume\nmore than what is predicted by models that only consider household wealth and income.\n\n- 2 -\nThe Labor Market\nThe imbalance between labor demand and labor supply has narrowed, as labor\ndemand has cooled while labor supply has improved. There is evidence of cooling labor\ndemand, such as the decline in job openings by 3 million from their peak in March 2022.\nNevertheless, the labor market remains tight and job openings remain about 20 percent\nabove their pre-pandemic level, as shown in figure 1. At the same time, layoffs have\nremained very low, and the pace of payroll employment gains remains strong, with\nnonfarm payroll monthly job gains in the past three months averaging 289,000. The\nunemployment rate in January was 3.7 percent, a level that is still near historical lows.\nThe fact that the unemployment rate and layoffs have remained low in the U.S. economy\nover the past year amid disinflation suggests that there is a path to restoring price stability\nwithout the kind of substantial increase in unemployment that has often accompanied\nsignificant tightening cycles.\nThe Inflation Outlook\nInflation made clear progress over 2023 toward the Federal Open Market\nCommittee’s (FOMC) 2 percent inflation objective. I believe that this progress reflects\nboth the unwinding of pandemic-related supply and demand distortions in the economy\nas well as restrictive monetary policy, which has cooled strong demand and given the\nsupply side of the economy time to catch up. As shown in figure 2, over the 12 months\nended in January, the Federal Reserve’s staff estimates that total personal consumption\nexpenditures (PCE) prices rose 2.4 percent, down from 5.5 percent over the preceding 12\nmonths. Core PCE prices, which excludes energy and food prices, rose 2.8 percent,\ndown from 4.9 percent. The figures for January are estimates that incorporate the\n\n- 3 -\nsomewhat larger consumer price index (CPI) increase we saw last month. That\ndisappointing CPI reading highlights that the disinflation process is likely to be bumpy.\nThe January data notwithstanding, the slowing in core inflation has been especially\npronounced in recent months, as the 3- and 6-month changes in core PCE prices through\nJanuary, at 2.5 percent and 2.4 percent, respectively, clearly remain below the 12-month\nchange shown in figure 2. The most striking moderation has been in core goods prices,\nas shown in figure 3, which have declined outright over the past year. Inflation in core\nservices, both in its housing component and nonhousing services, has also slowed, but not\nas much. I believe that as the labor market continues to cool, core services price\nincreases will continue to moderate. Of course, I remain attentive to other possibilities.\nA Longer-Term Perspective on Monetary Policy Cycles\nNext, I would like to highlight key aspects of past monetary policy cycles and\nwhat lessons we may learn from these past experiences. For exposition purposes, my\nreview focuses on easing cycles and their preceding peak-rate episodes that extend back\nto 1989; however, I also will make some comments on an important episode prior to\n1989.1 As of our last meeting in January, my colleagues on the FOMC and I believe that\nour policy rate is likely at its peak for this tightening cycle and that, if the economy\nevolves broadly as expected, it will likely be appropriate to begin dialing back policy\nrestraint at some point this year. I will therefore start with a description of economic\nconditions during past peak-rate episodes, given where we are today.\n1 The start date of 1989 is motivated by the fact that this was the earliest cycle in which the FOMC was\nviewed as considering monetary policy actions in terms of discrete 25 basis point, 50 basis point, etc., rate\nmoves in the federal funds rate target and, as such, is more comparable to today. See Stigum and Crescenzi\n(2007) for a discussion of the FOMC’s increased focus on federal funds rate targeting in the late 1980s as\nwell as Lindsey (2003), who describes the FOMC’s further shift toward targeting the federal funds rate in\n1989 by discontinuing the practice of targeting borrowed reserves.\n\n- 4 -\nThe first column of table 1 lists the dates of the latest six peak-rate episodes\npreceding easing cycles, defined as a sequence of rate cuts without rate hikes in between.\nThe second and third columns summarize economic conditions as described in official\naccounts of monetary policy released at the time, such as FOMC statements, minutes of\nCommittee meetings, and the Federal Reserve Board’s semiannual Monetary Policy\nReport. The table also records inflation at the time of the peak rate as measured by the\n12-month percent change in headline and core PCE price indexes.2\nMy main inference is that most of the time, in five out of the six episodes, the\npeak rate is reached once inflation is contained, albeit in some cases with risks still\npresent. There is only one exception in this sample, the March 1989 to May 1989 peak-\nrate episode, when inflation was elevated—noted in the first row of the table. The easing\ncycle following this particular peak-rate episode began as core and headline PCE\ninflation were starting to come down from an elevated level, as illustrated in figure 4.3\nThis figure shows headline and core inflation two years before and after the start date of\neach of the six easing cycles. The red line, which corresponds to the March 1989 peak-\nrate episode, stands out, with core PCE inflation at 4 percent at the beginning of the\neasing cycle, while all the other easing cycles show core PCE inflation at about 2 percent\nat commencement. Our situation today is closer to the norm during these episodes than\nto the exception, as PCE inflation is closer to 2 percent than to 4 percent.\n2 The PCE inflation numbers in table 1 are revised data, which means the data that policymakers were\nreviewing at the time—the so-called real-time data—could have been different. In addition, for some of\nthese cycles, policymakers focused on CPI inflation more than PCE inflation. Also, note that while the\ntable frequently references inflation relative to a 2 percent rate, it was only for the last peak-rate episode for\nwhich the FOMC had established a 2 percent rate of inflation to be most consistent over the longer run with\nits price-stability goal, per its first “Statement on Longer-run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy” adopted\nin January 2012.\n3 The data shown in figure 4 are revised data.\n\n- 5 -\nTable 2 summarizes the reasons given in Federal Reserve documents at the time\nto explain the rationale for easing policy. When studying monetary policy cycles, it is\nimportant to recognize the often-multistage nature of cycles and, because of this, table 2\ndistinguishes between the reasons underpinning the start of the easing cycle, listed in\ncolumn 2, and those underpinning subsequent easings, listed in column 3. One clear\nexample of a cycle with different phases and involving more than one reason for easing is\nthe most recent easing cycle—the one listed in the last row—which took place between\nAugust 2019 and March 2020. The initial 75 basis points of easing in this cycle were a\nresult of downside risks to the U.S. economy due to weaker global growth and high trade\nuncertainties. The subsequent easings in this cycle were due to the disruptions to the\neconomy resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nLooking at table 2, two facts stand out. First, most easing cycles start because of\nconcern about slowing economic growth. In table 2, the one exception is the easing cycle\nthat started in July 1995 and is associated with what Alan Blinder (2023) has labeled a\n“perfect soft landing” example.4 That particular easing cycle started predominantly\nbecause of reduced inflation concerns. All the other easing cycles started because either\nthere was a concern about slowing economic growth, or, in one case, because there was a\nconcern about slowing economic growth and there were reduced inflation concerns.\n4 Blinder (2023) labels the July 1995 episode as the “perfect soft landing” and identifies other “softish”\nlandings (see his Table 1, page 119). Blinder (2023) defines a softish landing as an outcome in which real\nGDP declines by less than 1 percent or there is no NBER recession for at least a year after an FOMC\ntightening cycle.\n\n- 6 -\nThe second fact that stands out is that history is replete with events that\ncomplicate monetary policy decisions. The third column in table 2, which notes the\nreasons for subsequent easings, demonstrates this point. It shows that four out of the six\neasing cycles had multiple “easing phases,” with later phases triggered by events like the\n1991 Gulf War, the 9/11 terrorist attack, the Global Financial Crisis, and the pandemic.\nThese events required policymakers to take a different course of policy easing from the\ncourse they may have anticipated earlier in the cycle. Specifically, because these events\ncontributed to the contraction of economic activity, policymakers may have accelerated\npolicy easing. The main messages that I see emerging from this review of the record are\nthat policymakers need to remain vigilant and nimble, in case of adverse shocks hitting\nthe economy, and that policymakers need some good luck.\nThe lesson that policymakers need to remain vigilant and nimble is further\nillustrated in figure 5, which shows the unemployment rate around the start of each\neasing cycle. As can be seen from this chart, in some easing cycles—for example, the\neasing cycles that began in January 2001, shown in blue, and September 2007, shown in\ngreen—the unemployment rate ramps up quickly, shortly after the easing cycle began. In\nboth these cases, the economy weakened rapidly.\nIn the easing cycle that began in January 2001, moderating growth over the\nsecond half of 2000 gave way abruptly to sluggish growth around the end of the year.\nEconomic weakness spread and intensified over the first half of 2001 and—as shown by\nthe blue line—a year after the easing cycle began, the unemployment rate had increased\njust short of 2 percentage points.\n\n- 7 -\nIn the easing cycle that began in September 2007, the macroeconomic data were\nnot showing much weakening at the time of the cycle’s first couple of rate cuts, although\nfinancial markets were exhibiting heightened and broad-based volatility and short-term\nfunding markets were significantly impaired. It was only in December 2007 that\nincoming data started to show more significant spillovers of the housing downturn to\nother parts of the economy, while several financial firms also began to report larger-than-\nexpected losses. As the green line in the chart shows, the unemployment rate was around\n4-1/2 percent at the start of the 2007–08 easing cycle—having remained broadly stable\naround that level in 2006—but then rapidly rose to 6 percent within a year of the first\neasing. My motivation for discussing these two episodes is to highlight how quickly\neconomic activity can weaken.\nAnother reason why policymakers need to watch all available information and be\nnimble in their decisionmaking is that developments concerning inflation can likewise\nchange rapidly. This was highlighted recently by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in March\n2022. The invasion compounded the effects of post-pandemic supply constraints on\ninflation. In addition, we always need to keep in mind the danger of easing too much in\nresponse to improvements in the inflation picture. Excessive easing can lead to a stalling\nor reversal in progress in restoring price stability. Former Fed Chair Paul Volcker\nstressed this danger in a 1981 speech, when he pointed to 1967 as a year when monetary\npolicy eased in response to concerns about slowing economic growth and reduced\ninflation concerns, yet inflation subsequently turned back up.\nFinally, another observation from reviewing past episodes is that careful easing in\nthe July 1995 easing cycle allowed the FOMC to assess incoming data and other\n\n- 8 -\ninformation to make sure that inflation was under control. As I noted earlier, the July\n1995 easing cycle is associated with the so-called perfect soft landing. In this particular\neasing cycle, the FOMC started to ease as it observed a lessening in inflation concerns,\nleft rates unchanged for three meetings as it waited for more information, and then\ncontinued to ease.\nLessons for Current Monetary Policy\nWith the knowledge of past experiences in hand, let me say a few words about the\ncurrent monetary policy cycle and the extent to which future policy is likely to resemble,\nif at all, past experiences. Between March 2022 and July 2023, the FOMC raised the\ntarget range for the federal funds rate 5-1/4 percentage points. Our strong actions have\nmoved our policy rate well into restrictive territory, and our restrictive stance of monetary\npolicy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation. If the economy\nevolves broadly as expected, it will likely be appropriate to begin dialing back our policy\nrestraint later this year.\nGetting back to the title of my talk today: Will this time be different? My answer\nis, of course it will. Every time is different. But we can still learn from past episodes.\nWe cannot know if there will be unanticipated exogenous shocks that require a policy\nresponse different from what will be envisaged at the beginning of the easing cycle. All\nwe can do is assess the risks as best we can, given the available information and our best\nforecasts. In the absence of unanticipated exogenous shocks, policymakers can weigh\nmultiple factors, including keeping policy restrictive enough to tamp down a possible\nresurgence of inflation due to the strength of aggregate demand or easing sooner to avoid\nan undue increase in unemployment. Unfortunately, the history that I have reviewed\n\n- 9 -\ntoday suggests that we should not be surprised if some kind of unanticipated shock\noccurs. Given that we must accept that uncertainty is present, we consider the risks that\ncan affect our outlook and forecasts.\nLooking ahead, I see at least three key risks. First, as I mentioned at the\nbeginning, consumer spending could be even more resilient than I currently expect it to\nbe, which could cause progress on inflation to stall. Second, employment could weaken\nas the factors supporting economic growth fade. Third, geopolitical risks could remain\nelevated, and a widening of the conflict in the Middle East could have greater effects on\ncommodity prices, such as oil, and on global financial markets.\nI remain cautiously optimistic about our progress on inflation, and I will be\nreviewing the totality of incoming data in assessing the economic outlook and the risks\nsurrounding the outlook and in judging the appropriate future course of monetary policy.\n\n- 10 -\nReferences\nBlinder, Alan S.

Jefferson\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nH. Parker Willis Lecture\nWashington and Lee University\nLexington, Virginia\nMarch 27, 2023\n\nThank you very much for inviting me to be part of the H. Parker Willis Lecture\nSeries. As you know, Dr. Willis was a distinguished professor here at Washington and\nLee University. Among many other accomplishments, he helped create the Federal\nReserve System. He served as the first secretary to the Federal Reserve Board from 1914\nto 1918 and later as the first research director.\nBefore I go further, let me remind you that the views I will express today are my\nown and are not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\nMany discussions of monetary policy simply talk about the Federal Reserve\nsetting the federal funds rate to promote our goals of maximum employment and price\nstability, without giving attention to the specific actions we take to put the federal funds\nrate where we want it—that is, to the way we implement monetary policy. And even in\neconomics classes that cover this topic, the teaching materials have not always caught up\nwith the fact that we have purposely changed our implementation framework over the\npast decade.1 My colleagues at the Fed are working with educators to close the\ncurriculum gap, and I hope this lecture will further help this endeavor.2\nIn honor of Dr. Willis’s important contributions to the design and creation of the\nFederal Reserve, today I would like to talk to you about how the Fed currently uses a\nspecific set of tools to implement monetary policy and how monetary policy is\ntransmitted to the economy. Then, I will offer some concluding remarks.\n1 See the NPR interview with Jane Ihrig and Scott Wolla (2022a).\n2 Some of the teaching materials that Jane Ihrig and Scott Wolla have created to close the curriculum gap\nare available on the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis’s website at\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/education/teaching-new-tools-of-monetary-policy. For more information,\nplease see Ihrig and Wolla (2022b).\n\n- 2 -\nThe Federal Funds Market and the Fed’s Policy Target Range\nAs mandated by the U.S. Congress, the Federal Open Market Committee’s\n(FOMC) objectives are to promote maximum employment and price stability. The\nmembers of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks\nconstitute the FOMC. The FOMC gathers for eight regularly scheduled meetings each\nyear to discuss economic and financial conditions and to deliberate on monetary policy.\nIn each meeting, the FOMC establishes a target range for the federal funds rate. Figure 1\nshows the upper bound in red and the lower bound in blue of the federal funds target\nrange since 2015. We see the range increasing in 2018 as the job market was\nstrengthening and inflation was moving up toward 2 percent. That’s right—for much of\nthe decade before then, the inflation rate was below 2 percent. In March 2020, when the\nCOVID-19 pandemic hit the economy, the FOMC quickly moved the target range down\nto near zero to support economic activity.\nOnce monetary policy is set, the Fed implements monetary policy by using its\npolicy tools to ensure that the federal funds rate (FFR) stays within the range. The\neffective federal fund rate is determined by market forces. It is a volume-weighted\nmedian of federal funds rates across all borrowers each day. In figure 1, you can see that\nthe Fed has been able to implement monetary policy in such a way that the effective\nfederal funds rate (EFFR), the black line in the figure, has indeed stayed within the target\nrate range most of the time.\nTo understand how the Fed’s tools work, it is important to understand the federal\nfunds market. It is a market where depository institutions borrow funds overnight from\ncertain financial institutions, including other depository institutions and government-\n\n- 3 -\nsponsored enterprises. These loans are uncollateralized, and the interest rate or cost of\nthe loans is the federal funds rate, which is determined by the supply and demand for\nreserve balances that financial institutions hold in their “checking accounts” at the Fed.3\nThe Fed can change the total amount of reserves available to the banking system through\nopen market operations or its lending programs. Since the Fed controls the supply of\nreserves and the amount that it supplies is independent of the interest rate, the supply of\nreserves is illustrated as a vertical line in the stylized supply and demand curves shown in\nfigure 2.4 Later, I will explain why this supply curve intersects the demand curve, as\nshown in figure 2.\nThe demand curve for reserves in figure 2 has three segments. The top portion of\nthe demand curve is capped by the discount rate that the Fed sets. The middle of the\ncurve is downward sloping, like most demand curves. The higher the interest rate or cost\nto borrow, the lower the quantity of reserves demanded. The bottom portion is nearly flat\nbecause, at some point, banks do not find much benefit from holding additional reserves\nother than earning the interest on reserve balances (IORB) rate from the Fed. In other\nwords, banks prefer to earn money by making loans to consumers and businesses or\npurchasing securities only if doing so generates a higher return. In what follows, I will\ngo deeper into the top and bottom segments of the demand curve.\n3 An uncollateralized or unsecured loan is a loan that does not require any type of collateral. In contrast, a\ncollateralized or secured loan is a loan that is backed by collateral, meaning something the borrower owns\n(collateral), such as U.S. Treasury securities, can be taken by the lender in case the borrower does not pay\nback the loan under the agreed terms.\n4 The Fed understands that several factors affect the supply of reserves and that it can choose what\noperations to take, if any, in response. As a result, one should think of the Fed as controlling the supply of\nreserves in the banking system. For a detailed discussion of supply and demand of reserves, see Ihrig,\nSenyuz, and Weinbach (2020).\n\n- 4 -\nImplementation Tool 1: Discount Window Rate Sets a Ceiling\nAt the top of the demand curve, we see the discount rate, which is the interest rate\nthe Fed charges when it lends money to banks.5 The discount rate is an administered\nrate, or a rate set by the Fed, and it is one of the tools the Fed uses to implement monetary\npolicy. It sets a ceiling for the federal funds rate because banks, if they are in good\nstanding and have collateral for the discount window loan, can always borrow overnight\nfunds at the discount rate from the Fed. Therefore, they are not willing to pay a higher\nrate to borrow funds.\nIn practice, however, banks have demonstrated, in the absence of stress, some\nreluctance to borrow from the discount window. They are concerned that borrowing\nfrom the Fed may indicate that the bank is unable to borrow from other financial\ninstitutions, and that it sends a negative signal about their financial condition to the\nworld.6 Such dynamics are referred to as the “stigma” associated with the use of the\ndiscount window.7 Stigma dampens the discount rate’s effectiveness as a day-to-day tool\nthe Fed can use to implement monetary policy. Thus, alternative implementation tools\nare required. This brings me to the next rate I want to talk to you about, the interest rate\non reserve balances.\n5 Depository institutions have access to three types of discount credit from their regional Federal Reserve\nBank: primary credit, secondary credit, and seasonal credit, each with its own interest rate. We use the\nterm “discount rate” as a shorthand for primary credit rate. Most credit at the discount window is done at\nthe primary credit rate. For more information, please refer to Board of Governors (2022).\n6 The list of banks that borrow money from the discount window is published with a two-year delay.\nDiscount window borrowing increased recently following the failure of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature\nBank. On March 12, 2023, the Fed announced a Bank Term Funding Facility to complement the funding\navailable at the discount window; see Board of Governors (2023).\n7 For a detailed discussion about the stigma associated with discount window borrowing, please see Carlson\nand Rose (2017).\n\n- 5 -\nImplementation Tool 2: Interest on Reserve Balances\nClose to the bottom of the demand curve is the interest on reserve balances rate\ndenoted by IORB rate in figure 2. This is the interest rate the Fed pays on reserves\neligible institutions keep at Federal Reserve Banks.8 This interest rate is the primary tool\nthe Fed uses currently to implement monetary policy.9 In the graph, observe that the\nfederal funds rate is close to this rate. The economic force that keeps these two rates\nclose to each other is called arbitrage, the simultaneous purchase and sale of funds (or\ngoods) to profit from a difference in price. Arbitrage keeps prices of financial\ninstruments with similar payoffs close to each other.10 I will illustrate how arbitrage\nworks with an example that makes it clear why the federal funds rate cannot be much\nlower nor much higher than the interest on reserve balances rate.\nArbitrage Keeps Rates Close to Each Other\nLet’s assume that the federal funds rate is 4 percent and the interest on reserves\nis 4.5 percent. Banks will quickly realize that they can borrow funds in the federal funds\nmarket at 4 percent and deposit those funds at the Fed and earn the interest on reserve\n8 Section 19(b)(2) of the Federal Reserve Act requires each depository institution to maintain reserves\nagainst certain liabilities of the bank. The Board’s Regulation D (Reserve Requirements of Depository\nInstitutions in title 12, part 204, of the Code of Federal Regulations) implements the reserve requirements\nprovisions in section 19. Eligible institutions include depository institutions and certain other institutions\nas specified in the act; see the definition in 12 C.F.R. § 204.2 at https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-\n12/chapter-II/subchapter-A/part-204/section-204.2#p-204.2(y).\n9 On October 6, 2008, the Fed started to pay interest on reserves of eligible institutions with master\naccounts at Federal Reserve Banks. Up to and including July 28, 2021, interest was paid on required\nreserves at an IORR (interest on required reserves) rate and at an IOER (interest on excess reserves) rate.\nThe IORR rate was paid on balances maintained to satisfy reserve balance requirements, and the IOER rate\nwas paid on excess balances. Effective March 24, 2020, the Board amended Regulation D to set all reserve\nrequirement ratios for transaction accounts to 0 percent, eliminating all reserve requirements. As a result,\nthere is no longer a need to describe interest rates based on whether the balance satisfies a reserve balance\nrequirement. To account for those changes, the Board approved a final rule amending Regulation D to\nreplace references to an IORR rate and to an IOER rate with references to a single IORB rate.\n10 This idea is called the law of one price, and it assumes that markets are competitive—that is, investors\ncannot manipulate prices to their advantage—and the absence of trade restrictions and trading costs.\n\n- 6 -\nbalances rate of 4.5 percent, which means that they can earn a profit of 0.5 percent (the\ndifference between the two rates).11 This riskless investment strategy is called an\narbitrage opportunity. As long as this arbitrage opportunity exists, banks will borrow\nfunds in the federal funds market and deposit those funds at the Fed, putting upward\npressure on the federal funds rate. This upward pressure will continue until the federal\nfunds rate rises to a level close to the interest on reserves and the arbitrage opportunity no\nlonger exists.\nA similar logic applies when the federal funds rate is much higher than the\ninterest on reserves.12 If this is the case, banks can make money by withdrawing funds\nfrom their “checking account” at the Fed and lending that money at the higher federal\nfunds rate. More banks willing to lend money in the federal funds market will put\ndownward pressure on the federal funds rate, causing the federal funds rate to decline\ntoward the interest rate on reserves.\nImplementation Tool 3: Overnight Reverse Repurchase Agreement\nSo far, I have talked about two of the Fed’s administered rates; the discount rate,\nand the interest on reserve balances rate. Now, I will talk about the third key\nadministered rate, the overnight reverse repurchase agreement rate denoted by ON RRP\nin figure 2. Not all institutions that lend money in the federal funds market and who are\nkey players in short-term money markets are eligible to receive interest on reserves.\nConsider, for example, Federal Home Loan Banks. They were set up in the 1930s to\nsupport mortgage lending. Today, they manage about $1.5 trillion in assets. They are\n11 This profit calculation assumes operational and regulatory costs are zero.\n12 For the arbitrage strategies described earlier to work, the system needs to have sufficient reserves and\nenough competition among banks.\n\n- 7 -\nmajor lenders in the federal funds market, but they are ineligible to receive interest on\nreserves. Therefore, they may have an incentive to lend funds at a much lower rate than\nthe interest rate on reserves rather than earn zero interest on idle cash balances. To\nensure that these and other institutions do not charge an interest rate much lower than the\ninterest rate on reserves, the Fed uses an overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility\nas a supplementary policy tool to help control the federal funds rate.13\nThis facility is open to a broad set of financial institutions, including money\nmarket funds (MMFs), government-sponsored enterprises, and banks that are active in\nfinancial markets where short-term interest rates are determined. At this facility,\ninstitutions agree to buy a Treasury security from the Fed and sell it back the next day. In\nreturn, the Fed pays the institution the overnight reverse repurchase rate.14 Even though\nthis transaction seems complicated, it is similar to banks depositing reserves at the Fed\nand receiving interest on them. This transaction, illustrated on slide 5, is equivalent to\nfinancial institutions depositing cash at the Fed and the Fed giving them a Treasury\nsecurity as collateral, paying them the overnight reverse repurchase rate on the deposit,\nand agreeing to buy back the security the next day.\nThis facility sets a floor for the federal funds rate because not only banks, but\nother financial institutions can always earn the overnight reverse repurchase agreement\n13 The Fed introduced the ON RRP facility in September 2013 and conducted test operations through late\n2015. In September 2014, the FOMC indicated that it intended to use the facility as needed to help control\nthe federal funds rate. For more information, see Board of Governors (2018) and Federal Reserve Bank of\nNew York (2023).\n14 The interest rate that a counterparty receives is the facility’s offering rate except in the highly unlikely\nevent that the amount of propositions the Fed receives exceeds the amount of securities available for the\noperation. In that case, the interest rate would be determined by an auction process conducted by the\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York, as described in Federal Reserve Bank of New York (2023).\n\n- 8 -\nrate when lending money to the Fed.15 In other words, the interest rate at this facility\nserves as a reservation rate, or the lowest rate lenders are willing to accept for lending out\ntheir cash.\nAmple Reserves\nAs I mentioned earlier, the federal funds rate is determined by borrowers and\nlenders. In figure 3, it is the point where supply and demand intersect. In this figure,\nnotice that the supply curve is off to the right and it intersects the flat part of the demand\ncurve. This is on purpose because we are currently in what we call an ample-reserves\nenvironment.16 In this environment, the Fed is supplying an “ample” level of reserves to\nthe banking system, and small movements in the supply curve will not affect the\nequilibrium federal funds rate much. Instead, as I mentioned earlier, the key tool the Fed\nuses to implement monetary policy is the interest rate on reserves balances. In figure 3,\nyou can see that by moving the interest rate on reserves down, the Fed shifts the demand\nfor reserves down and affects the federal funds rate even if the demand curve is flat.17 A\nsimilar mechanism follows by moving the rate up. As suggested by the graph, the FOMC\n15 For banks eligible to receive the IORB rate, the IORB rate is their reservation rate, and it explains why\nthe federal funds market is currently dominated by nonbank lenders with the EFFR remaining below the\nIORB rate.\n16 In January 2019, the Fed announced that “the Committee intends to continue to implement monetary\npolicy in a regime in which an ample supply of reserves ensures that control over the level of the federal\nfunds rate and other short-term interest rates is exercised primarily through the setting of the Federal\nReserve’s administered rates, and in which active management of the supply of reserves is not required.”\nSee Board of Governors (2019a, para 2). Afonso and others (2022), among others, investigate how to\nidentify ample-reserves regimes.\n17 In periods when reserves are ample, there might be an increase in overnight reverse repurchase activity\nfollowing an increase in reserve supply because nonbank financial institutions absorb liquidity that banks\nfind costly to hold on their balance sheet because of regulatory capital rules. If a prime MMF lends money\nto a bank in the federal funds market instead of lending it money in the ON RRP facility, the bank increases\nits liabilities (borrowing from the prime MMF) and assets (reserves), which expands its balance sheet. It\nwill affect the banks’ various regulatory ratios and count toward calculating the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation fee.\n\n- 9 -\nis mindful about adjusting its other administered rates in sync with the interest rate on\nreserve balances. This practice helps ensure arbitrage works to shift the demand curve as\nindicated.\nImplementation Tool 4: Open Market Operations\nSo far, I have talked about how the Fed influences the demand curve by changing\nits administered rates. Now, I will talk about how the Fed shifts the supply of reserves in\nthe system. It does so by buying or selling securities, so-called open market operations.\nWhen the Fed purchases securities, it pays for them by depositing cash into the\nappropriate banks’ reserve balance accounts, adding to the overall level of reserves (cash)\nin the banking system.\nBefore 2008, open market operations were the Fed’s primary monetary policy tool\nbecause there were limited reserves in the banking system, a so-called scarce-reserves\nregime. In a scarce-reserves environment, the supply curve intersects the demand curve\non the downward-sloping part of the demand curve, as illustrated in the left panel of\nfigure 4. Open market operations are the tool old textbooks emphasize. The Fed would\ninject or drain reserves through open market operations to keep the vertical supply curve\nat the desired location—where it intersects the demand curve at the intended federal\nfunds rate. Since the supply of reserves naturally changes—for example, because of the\nwithdrawal of reserves into physical currency—the Fed conducted these operations\nfrequently. Today, being in an ample-reserves regime, the Fed operates on a different\nsegment of the demand curve and uses different tools, as illustrated in the right panel of\nfigure 4.\n\n- 10 -\nTechnical Adjustments to the Supply of Reserves: A Case Study\nAlthough active management of the supply of reserves is not, by design, a feature\nof an ample-reserves regime, there are times when the Fed may take steps to adjust the\nsupply of reserves to support interest rate control. For example, in mid-September 2019,\nstrains in funding markets emerged as quarterly corporate tax payments and the\nsettlement of Treasury securities coincided and resulted in a large amount of cash being\ndrained from short-term interest rate investments. In fact, reserve balances fell more than\n$100 billion over just two days. Although the drain in reserves associated with seasonal\ntax payments was expected to put some upward pressure on short-term interest rates, the\nincreases in rates that materialized were exceptionally large by historical standards. One\nsuch interest rate is the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, a broad measure of the cost of\nborrowing cash overnight collateralized by Treasury securities. As shown in figure 5, the\nblue dashed line denoted as SOFR spiked, and the effective federal funds rate, the red\nsolid line, moved 5 basis points above the target range during this episode.\nIn response to these market developments the Fed undertook open market\noperations to purchase securities to add reserves temporarily. Specifically, the Fed\nconducted repurchase agreement (repo) transactions to provide immediate liquidity to the\nmarket and help alleviate the funding strains, ensuring the federal funds rate resumed\ntrading within the target range. In addition, the FOMC judged that the prevailing level of\nreserve supply at that time may have been a bit too low to be consistent with operating in\nan ample-reserves regime. Accordingly, in early October 2019, the FOMC directed the\n\n- 11 -\nFed to maintain over time reserve balances at least as large as the level that had prevailed\nin “early September,” a time when there were no evident pressures in money markets.18\nThe Fed’s Balance Sheet\nThe Fed’s balance sheet contains a great deal of information about the scale and\nscope of its open market operations. Figure 6 shows the evolution of the Fed’s balance\nsheet, where the holdings of U.S. Treasury securities, agency mortgage-backed securities\n(MBS), and other securities are recorded as assets and reserve balances are recorded as\nliabilities. Both series are divided by gross domestic product because the Fed’s balance\nsheet should naturally increase over time with economic growth. We entered the ample-\nreserves regime in 2008, during the 2007–09 financial crisis, as the Fed sharply increased\nits total assets. In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, there was another sharp\nincrease in total assets. In both instances, the Fed reduced its interest rate target near zero\nand purchased securities, injecting reserves into the banking system. The effect of\npurchasing securities was to reduce longer-term interest rates to support the economy.\nThe expansion of the Fed’s balance sheet is popularly known as quantitative easing (QE).\nWhen QE ended, the Fed reinvested any maturing securities it held to maintain the size of\nthe balance sheet. Now, the Fed is fighting inflation by raising its interest rate target\nrange and is in the process of shrinking the Fed’s balance sheet, which is referred to as\nquantitative tightening (QT), by passively stopping the reinvestment in some maturing\nTreasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS).19\n18 For more details on this event, please see Ihrig, Senyuz, and Weinbach (2020) and Board of Governors\n(2019b, para. 2).\n19 Lopez-Salido and Vissing-Jorgensen (2023) provide a framework for understanding banks’ demand for\ncentral bank reserves and assess how much QT is feasible to maintain an ample-reserves environment.\n\n- 12 -\nSummary of Tools\nI’ve talked about how the Fed has four tools in its toolbox to implement monetary\npolicy. Three of the tools and their associated administered rates, shown in green text on\nslide 10, are used to steer the market-determined federal funds rate into the FOMC’s\ntarget range. These tools also interact with other short-term market interest rates through\narbitrage relationships. The fourth tool, shown in blue text, is open market operations—\nthe purchase and sale of government securities—which is used to adjust the supply of\nreserves in the banking system.\nMonetary Policy Transmission\nNow that you understand the Fed’s implementation tools, let’s see how the Fed\nuses them to achieve its two mandated goals: maximum employment and price stability.\nCurrently, the unemployment rate is low, and the inflation rate is above the Fed’s\n2 percent target. Beginning in the second half of 2021, as the magnitude and persistence\nof the increase in inflation became clearer and as the job market recovery accelerated, the\nFOMC pivoted toward a tighter stance of monetary policy. In March 2022, the FOMC\nincreased its target range for the federal funds rate, for the first time since the onset of the\npandemic. In June 2022, we began the process of significantly reducing the size of our\nbalance sheet, after announcing our plans in May.\nMonetary policy is transmitted to the rest of the economy by affecting financial\nmarket prices, such as long-term interest rates, which in turn affect the decisions of\nhouseholds and businesses. Previously, I discussed how changes in the federal funds\ntarget range are transmitted to short-term interest rates, such as the overnight reverse repo\nrates, through arbitrage relationships. Short-term interest rates, in turn, affect long-term\n\n- 13 -\ninterest rates through investors’ expectations. More specifically, according to the\nexpectations theory of the term structure of interest rates, intermediate- and long-term\ninterest rates are the weighted average of expected future short-term interest rates.20 In\naddition, monetary policy affects risk premiums. Tighter monetary policy tends to reduce\nthe willingness of investors to bear risk, making them less willing to invest in long-term\nassets, which means that their return (interest rate) must increase for investors to buy\nthese assets.21\nFigure 7 illustrates how long-term interest rates, which are widely viewed as\nimportant for businesses’ and households’ economic decisions, move in anticipation of\nchanges in the federal funds rate. The red line is the average 10-year triple-B corporate\nbond rate. It is a measure of corporate borrowing costs. The blue line is the average 30-\nyear mortgage rate. It is a measure of household borrowing costs. Notice that both\nmeasures increased in early 2022 in response to Fed communications and in anticipation\nof increases in the effective federal funds rate, the black line. Higher long-term interest\nrates increase the cost of borrowing money for households and businesses. Therefore,\nhigh interest rates raise the incentive to save, which in turn dampens consumer spending\non interest rate-sensitive expenditures, like housing and automobiles, and slows\nbusinesses’ investment in new equipment. The decrease in spending decreases the\n20 Strictly speaking, the expectations theory states that long-term interest rates are entirely governed by the\nexpected future path of short-term interest rates. While this theory has strong implications that have been\nrejected in many studies, it nonetheless contains important elements of truth. For a review of the empirical\nevidence and implications, please see King and Kurmann (2002).\n21 Bernanke and Kuttner (2005), Hanson and Stein (2015), and Gertler and Karadi (2015), among others,\nhighlight that monetary policy affects risk premiums. Policy tightening tends to reduce the willingness of\ninvestors to bear risk—for example, by reducing expected levels of consumption (Campbell and Cochrane,\n1999). If policy tightens in response to inflationary shocks, term premiums also tend to rise as longer-\nmaturity bonds become riskier (Piazzesi and Schneider, 2006). Policy tightening can also lower stock\nprices by increasing the expected equity premium—for example, by weakening the balance sheet of\nleverage firms and making their stocks riskier.\n\n- 14 -\noverall demand for goods and services in the economy, thereby reducing the\ndemand/supply imbalances we have seen, and, consequently, reduce inflationary\npressures. As a result, the inflation rate should fall back toward 2 percent, the FOMC’s\ninflation rate target.\nA key question is how much the tightening of financial conditions since late 2021\nhas contributed to reducing aggregate demand and inflationary pressures. In figure 8,\nyou can see that inflation, measured using the personal consumption expenditures price\nindex, has started to come down. Some of the disinflation, or reduction in the inflation\nrate, is due to monetary policy tightening, and some of this disinflation is due to other\nfactors, such as supply chain bottlenecks easing and falling energy prices. Chair Powell\nand other colleagues in the Federal Reserve System have pointed out that monetary\npolicy affects the economy and inflation with long, variable, and highly uncertain lags,\nand we are still learning about the full effect of our tightening thus far.22\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, the Fed has a congressional mandate of maximum employment and\nprice stability. The FOMC conducts monetary policy by setting the target range for the\nfederal funds rate. Then, the Fed uses its monetary policy tools to implement the policy,\nwhich guides market interest rates toward the Fed’s desired setting of policy. The Fed\nimplements monetary policy using administered rates. The interest rate on reserve\nbalances is the Fed’s primary tool for adjusting the federal funds rate. The overnight\n22 Assessing the timing and magnitude of the effects of monetary policy on economic activity and inflation\nis both important and difficult. The challenges arise because monetary policy both responds to and\ninfluences key macroeconomic variables, because the structure of the economy may change over time, and\nbecause no two economic episodes are precisely the same. While a common theme in the economic\nliterature is that economic activity and inflation fall in response to a tightening monetary policy shock, the\nestimated size and timing of the maximum effects on activity and on inflation vary substantially across\nstudies.\n\n- 15 -\nreverse repurchase agreement facility is a supplementary tool that sets a floor for the\nfederal funds rate. The discount rate serves as a ceiling for the federal funds rate. The\nFed ensures that the banking system has ample reserves, using open market operations, if\nneeded. Currently, we are tightening monetary policy. Changes in the federal funds rate\nare transmitted to other interest rates through arbitrage and by affecting investors’\nexpectations. Changes in interest rates affect the decisions of consumers and businesses\nwith a lag. Their decisions ultimately move the economy toward maximum employment\nand price stability.\nThank you.\n\n- 16 -\nReferences\nAfonso, Gara, Domenico Giannone, Gabriele La Spada, and John C.

    "text": "For release on delivery\n1:40 p.m. EDT\nOctober 3, 2025\nEconomic Outlook and the Fed’s Monetary Policy Framework\nRemarks by\nPhilip N. Jefferson\nVice Chair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nDrexel Economic Forum\nDrexel University\nLeBow College of Business\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania\nOctober 3, 2025\n\nThank you, Dean Madan. I appreciate the opportunity to speak here at Drexel\nUniversity and to visit Philadelphia, an area where I have spent much of my personal and\nprofessional life.1 I will not go on too much about the City of Brotherly Love other than\nto say I am considering jogging up the steps of the art museum before I catch my train\nhome.\nIt is an honor to take part in the inaugural Drexel Economic Forum and to meet\nsome of the students, researchers, and business leaders who are here. It is an important\ntime for these groups to hold this event because there is much to discuss about the\nquickly evolving economy. For my part, as a Federal Reserve policymaker, I am\ncommitted to achieving the dual mandate given to us by Congress of promoting\nmaximum employment and stable prices. Delivering on these goals matters to\ncommunities, families, and businesses across the country, including right here in\nPhiladelphia.\nTo inform our discussion today, I will share with you my economic outlook and\noffer my current view of monetary policy before sharing with you some highlights from\nthe Federal Reserve’s newly revised monetary policy framework. After my remarks I\nlook forward to answering a few questions.\nEconomic Outlook\nLooking broadly across the U.S. economy, I see that growth has moderated this\nyear, and the risks to both sides of our dual mandate have shifted. Employment growth\nhas slowed because of weaker growth in labor supply and a softening in labor demand.\nThe uptick in the unemployment rate relative to the start of the year suggests that demand\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nhas fallen by a bit more than supply and that the downside risks to employment are rising.\nMeanwhile, higher tariffs are showing through to higher inflation for some goods. I\nexpect that the effects of tariffs on inflation, employment, and economic activity will\nfurther show through in coming months.\nIn the first half of 2025, U.S. GDP grew at a 1.6 percent annual rate, which\nreflects a marked cooling from last year’s 2.4 percent growth rate. The slowdown in\neconomic activity in the first half of this year was primarily driven by weaker consumer\nspending. That said, U.S. retail spending picked up over the summer. Overall, I expect\nthe U.S. economy to maintain the first half’s rate of growth through the remainder of the\nyear.\nIn terms of the labor market, we did not receive the September jobs report this\nmorning because of a lapse in federal government funding. While this is less than ideal, I\nnever focus on a single report; rather, I look across an array of indicators to assess the\nlabor market and the economy.\nThe available data from both government and private-sector sources point out that\nlabor supply and demand are slowing together, as reflected in the ratio of job openings to\nunemployed Americans seeking work. A few years ago, available jobs well exceeded the\nunemployment level. That came back into balance over the past year or so. Data\nreleased earlier this week showed the unemployment level slightly exceeded openings\nthis summer, but what economists call the V/U ratio remains near 1. Similarly, last week\nthe Labor Department reported that initial jobless claims continue to mostly trend\nsideways. Net immigration into the U.S., an important contributor to workforce growth,\n\n- 3 -\nhas dropped sharply, and that is a factor restraining a more significant increase in\nunemployment.\nTurning to the other side of our dual mandate, it is notable that inflation has\nslowed considerably from the highs that occurred when the economy reopened after\npandemic disruptions. Inflation, however, remains somewhat above our 2 percent target,\nand the tariffs that have been announced and implemented so far are showing up in some\ngoods prices. Overall, personal consumption expenditures (PCE) prices rose 2.7 percent\nover the 12 months ending in August. Core PCE inflation—which removes volatile food\nand energy prices—was 2.9 percent in August.\nOften, it is helpful to study the three major components of core PCE inflation to\nbetter understand what is driving overall price measures. Currently, core goods prices,\nwhich declined modestly last year, have been rising, reflecting tariff effects, although it is\nalso notable that the increase so far has been smaller than what many forecasters\npredicted this spring. Meanwhile, core services inflation, outside of housing, has\ngenerally trended sideways this year, while housing inflation appears to be on a gradual\ndownward trend.\nI view the uncertainty around my baseline outlook as especially high, mainly due\nto the changes in government policies and the challenges around assessing their net\neffects on employment and inflation. As the changes in these policies are finalized and\nwe have more time to judge how they are affecting the economy, I expect some of the\nbroader uncertainty around the U.S. economy to diminish.\n\n- 4 -\nMonetary Policy\nConsidering the outlook I described, I see the risks to employment as tilted to the\ndownside and risks to inflation to the upside. It follows that both sides of our mandate\nare under pressure.\nWhile tariff-related inflation is apparent in the prices of goods, tariff increases\ntypically represent a one-time change in the price level. The scope and persistence of the\nrelated rise in inflation will be determined by several factors—including the final tariff\nrates, the extent of pass-through to consumer prices, the effects on supply chains, overall\neconomic conditions, and what happens to longer-run inflation expectations. Short-term\ninflation expectations have come down from the peaks reached in the second quarter, and\nmost measures of longer-term inflation expectations have been largely stable, suggesting\nthat the American people understand our commitment to returning inflation to our 2\npercent target. As such, I expect the disinflation process to resume after this year and\ninflation to return to the 2 percent target in the coming years.\nAs I noted above, trends across several data series indicate that the labor market is\nsoftening, which suggests that, left unsupported, it could experience stress. To balance\nthe risk of persistent above-target inflation and the risk of a deteriorating labor market, I\nsupported a 25 basis point cut in our target range at the last FOMC meeting. This change\nmoved our policy rate closer to a more neutral stance while maintaining a balanced\napproach to promoting our dual-mandate objectives.\nWith respect to the path of the policy rate going forward, I will continue to\nevaluate the appropriate stance of monetary policy based on the incoming data, the\n\n- 5 -\nevolving outlook, and the balance of risks. I will also consider and assess information\nabout government policies and their effects on the economy.\nThe Fed’s Revised Framework\nNow that I have discussed my outlook and the latest policy decision, I want to\nturn to an important document that I use to guide those decisions: the Statement on\nLonger-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy. This statement is designed to give the\npublic a clear sense of how we think about monetary policy. As Chair Powell discussed\nat his Jackson Hole speech, a revised version of that document was issued in August.2\nThe framework document, often called the consensus statement, was first issued\nin 2012, under Chair Ben Bernanke’s leadership. The Fed’s dual mandate, established by\nCongress, to foster maximum employment and stable prices underpins this framework.\nOur commitment to delivering on our dual mandate is unwavering. The revisions to our\nframework will support that mission across a broad range of economic conditions.\nThe FOMC revised its consensus statement after conducting a public review.\nThat review consisted of three elements: first, Reserve Banks hosted Fed Listens events;\nsecond, the Board hosted a research conference; and third, we convened a series of\npolicymaker discussions at FOMC meetings this year, supported by staff analysis. The\nchanges implemented as a result of this review were a logical progression, not a change\nin course, grounded in our ever-evolving understanding of our economy. I will make\nnote of four adjustments to the consensus statement and discuss each in turn.\n2 Jerome Powell (2025), “Monetary Policy and the Fed’s Framework Review,” speech delivered at “Labor\nMarkets in Transition: Demographics, Productivity, and Macroeconomic Policy,” a symposium sponsored\nby the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, held in Jackson Hole, Wyo., August 22,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20250822a.htm.\n\n- 6 -\nFirst, the revised consensus statement removed language emphasizing the\neffective lower bound (ELB) as a defining feature of the economic landscape. Instead, it\nstates that our monetary policy strategy is designed to promote maximum employment\nand stable prices across a broad range of economic conditions. This revision, reflecting a\nmove away from the post–financial crisis era of historically low interest rates, makes our\nframework more robust. It is useful to recall that at the time of the FOMC’s previous\nframework review, during 2019 and 2020, policymakers were considering an economy\nthat had for many years demonstrated low growth, low inflation, and a very flat Phillips\ncurve—meaning that inflation was not very responsive to slack in the economy. The\noverarching concern for central bankers at that time was how to operate when short-term\ninterest rates are near the ELB. Today, of course, we are operating in a very different\nenvironment, at least in part brought on by the economic consequences of the COVID-19\npandemic.\nSecond, the revised framework embraces a flexible inflation-targeting approach at\nall times and eliminates a “makeup” strategy that would be employed in certain\ncircumstances. The experience of the U.S. economy since the pandemic highlights\ndifferent challenges to achieving our inflation mandate—such as supply shocks, sectoral\ndevelopments, and nonlinear inflation dynamics. The flexible inflation-targeting strategy\noutlined in our revised framework allows us to take a balanced approach in promoting\nour goals by considering the extent of departures from them. The revised framework\nappropriately emphasizes the Committee’s commitment to ensuring that longer-term\ninflation expectations remain well anchored.\n\n- 7 -\nThird, the revised consensus statement provides clarity on how the Committee\nthinks about its legislated goal of maximum employment. The 2020 version of the\nstatement indicated that the Fed would mitigate “shortfalls” from maximum employment.\nThis shortfalls strategy was partly motivated by our recognition that real-time\nassessments of the natural rate of unemployment—and hence of “maximum\nemployment”—are highly uncertain. However, the use of the word “shortfalls” created\nsome communications challenges, as it was not intended to be a commitment that the\nCommittee would never follow preemptive policy actions or ignore tight labor market\nconditions. As a result, we have removed it from the consensus statement. Instead, the\nrevised document more precisely states that “the Committee recognizes that employment\nmay at times run above real-time assessments of maximum employment without\nnecessarily creating risks to price stability.”3 As Chair Powell pointed out, preemptive\naction could well be warranted if tightness in the labor market or other factors pose risks\nto price stability. The revised statement defines maximum employment as “the highest\nlevel of employment that can be achieved on a sustained basis in a context of price\nstability.”\nFourth, and closely aligned with the change I just discussed, the FOMC clarified\nthe approach that it would take to monetary policy in times when the employment and\ninflation sides of our mandate may be at odds. The revised statement says that, in such\nperiods, the Committee will follow “a balanced approach in promoting them, taking into\naccount the extent of departures from its goals and the potentially different time horizons\n3 The consensus statement is available on the Federal Reserve Board's website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/monetary-policy-strategy-tools-and-communications-\nstatement-on-longer-run-goals-monetary-policy-strategy-2025.htm.\n\n- 8 -\nover which employment and inflation are projected to return to levels judged consistent\nwith its mandate.” The revised language more closely aligns with the original 2012\nstatement. It is also consistent with the Committee’s actions during the 2022–24 period,\nwhen the departure from our 2 percent inflation target was the overriding concern.\nI have just highlighted a series of changes that we made to the framework\nstatement, but it is also important to note the continuity with past versions of our\nstatement. The document continues to explain how we interpret the mandate Congress\nhas given us and describes the policy framework that we believe will best promote\nmaximum employment and price stability. We also continue to believe that monetary\npolicy must be forward looking and consider the lags in its effects on the economy. We\nhave never set a numerical goal for employment because the maximum level of\nemployment is not directly measurable and changes over time for reasons unrelated to\npolicy. Likewise, we maintained our commitment to a 2 percent inflation objective\nbecause that is a key factor helping keep longer-term inflation expectations well\nanchored, thus supporting both sides of our dual mandate. And we remain committed to\nconducting a public review roughly every five years.\nConclusion\nThe FOMC remains fully committed to fulfilling its statutory mandate, and the\nrevisions to the framework will support that mission across a broad range of economic\nconditions. Thank you for allowing me to share with you details of the revised monetary\npolicy framework and my views on the current economic outlook. I hope both will serve\nas jumping-off points for your discussions over the rest of the afternoon. Once again, I\nam honored to take part in this inaugural event and look forward to our conversation.\n\nDrexel Economic Forum\nDrexel University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\nOctober 3, 2025\nEconomic Outlook and the Fed's\nMonetary Policy Framework\nPhilip N.

    "text": "For release on delivery\n1:30 p.m. EDT\nMay 31, 2023\nFinancial Stability and the U.S. Economy\nRemarks by\nPhilip N. Jefferson\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\n22nd Annual International Conference on Policy Challenges for the Financial Sector\nWashington, D.C.\nMay 31, 2023\n\nGood afternoon, everyone. It is a pleasure to be here and share my perspective on\nsome key challenges policymakers currently face. Before I begin, let me remind you that\nthe views I will express today are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues\nin the Federal Reserve System.\nThis conference is timely and relevant. Among the topics covered are current\nfinancial stability risks and vulnerabilities, potential developments in banking supervision\nand regulation, and operational risk and resilience under evolving technologies. During\nthe next three days, you will have an opportunity to engage in stimulating discussions\nwith expert panelists on these and other critical issues.\nToday, I would like to share with you, at a high level, some of the Federal\nReserve’s recent and ongoing initiatives on a few of these issues. I also want to share\nwith you an overview of the Federal Reserve’s approach toward financial stability and\nmy thoughts on interactions between the economic outlook and financial stability. My\nremarks will be U.S. focused, fully understanding that other countries monitor financial\nstability similarly and that the health of the U.S. economy and financial system has an\nimpact on other countries, and vice versa.\nThe Federal Reserve’s Approach Toward Financial Stability\nA stable financial system is resilient even in the face of sharp downturns or stress\nevents. It provides households and businesses with the financing they need to participate\nand thrive in a well-functioning economy. It is difficult to anticipate or prevent shocks,\nbut sound policies can mitigate their impact. At the Federal Reserve, we work hard to\nmake sure that an initial shock in one area of the financial system does not spill over to\nother markets or institutions and cause severe or widespread strains. Such spillovers\n\n- 2 -\ncould disrupt the flow of credit and cause outsized declines in employment and economic\nactivity. It is not our role, nor should it be our objective, to influence the allocation of\ncredit within or across sectors of the U.S. economy.\nFinancial and nonfinancial institutions and households are linked through a web\nof relationships. The economic activities of households and businesses depend on the\nstrength of financial institutions’ balance sheets, as households and businesses obtain\nfunding through the financial sector. Similarly, the health of the financial sector hinges\non the strength of the balance sheets of households, businesses, and financial institutions,\nas financial institutions’ assets are the liabilities of these sectors.\nThe Federal Reserve monitors and assesses potential vulnerabilities that may\ndevelop because of interactions among key participants. We do that by focusing on the\nsafety and soundness of individual supervised institutions and by looking across the\nentire financial and nonfinancial system for potential risks and vulnerabilities. These\nrisks and vulnerabilities can include elevated valuation pressures, excessive borrowing by\nhouseholds and businesses, excessive leverage in the financial system, and elevated\nfunding risks. In other words, at the Federal Reserve, we use both microprudential and\nmacroprudential approaches to monitor the health of financial institutions and the\nfinancial sector.\nThe recent banking stress events remind us that risks and vulnerabilities in\nfinancial markets are continuously changing. That is why the staff at the Federal Reserve\nis constantly monitoring domestic and foreign financial markets and institutions, as well\nas the financial condition of households and businesses, with the goal of identifying\ncurrent and future vulnerabilities. Such forward-looking financial stability monitoring\n\n- 3 -\nhelps inform policymakers about ongoing vulnerabilities in the financial system that may\namplify a range of potential adverse events or shocks.\nThe U.S. Financial System and Economic Outlook\nU.S. financial markets and institutions remain resilient even though financial\nstability risks and vulnerabilities in the U.S. financial system have increased since the\nrecent stress events. Conditions in the banking sector have stabilized thanks, in part, to\ndecisive emergency actions taken in March by the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation, and the Treasury. The Federal Reserve, using existing regulatory\nand supervisory tools, is working to ensure that banks improve and update their liquidity,\ncommercial real estate, and interest rate risk-management practices.\nI expect spending and economic growth to remain quite slow over the rest of\n2023, due to tight financial conditions, low consumer sentiment, heightened uncertainty,\nand a decline in household savings that had built up after the onset of the pandemic.\nInflation has come down substantially since last summer, but it is still too high, and by\nsome measures progress has been decelerating recently, particularly in the core services\nsector. While it is reasonable to expect that the recent banking stress events will lead\nbanks to tighten credit standards further, the amount of tightening and the magnitude of\nthe effect such tightening might have on the U.S. economy is not yet clear, and this\nuncertainty complicates economic forecasts.\nShort-term interest rates are 5 percentage points higher than they were a little\nover a year ago. History shows that monetary policy works with long and variable lags,\nand that a year is not a long enough period for demand to feel the full effect of higher\ninterest rates. While my base case forecast for the U.S. economy is not a recession,\n\n- 4 -\nhigher interest rates and lower earnings could test the ability of businesses to service\ndebt. In addition, and perhaps more in focus given the recent events affecting certain\nareas of the banking sector, higher interest rates could further exacerbate stress at banking\norganizations, especially those that are highly exposed to longer-duration assets and have\na relatively high ratio of uninsured deposits to total deposits. Since late last year, the\nFederal Open Market Committee has slowed the pace of rate hikes as we have\napproached a stance of monetary policy that will be sufficiently restrictive to return\ninflation to 2 percent over time. A decision to hold our policy rate constant at a coming\nmeeting should not be interpreted to mean that we have reached the peak rate for this\ncycle. Indeed, skipping a rate hike at a coming meeting would allow the Committee to\nsee more data before making decisions about the extent of additional policy firming.\nWith that said, let me turn to the topics covered in our two sessions this afternoon.\nCurrent Financial Stability Risks and Vulnerabilities\nDuring the first session this afternoon, you will be discussing current financial\nstability risks and vulnerabilities as well as historical parallels. As we have seen in the\npast couple of months, the failure of a large banking organization, even if not deemed\nindividually systemically important under our regulations, can cause markets to reassess\nthe condition of other firms with roughly similar size and risk profiles, and the resulting\nspillovers can generate significant negative consequences for the broader economy. As I\nmentioned earlier, conditions in the banking sector have stabilized. Moreover, broader\nU.S. financial markets and the overwhelming majority of financial institutions have been\nresilient to the recent stress events.\n\n- 5 -\nThe resilience of the financial system to current salient risks can be appreciated\nby contrasting it to the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. Leading up to the Global Financial\nCrisis, housing markets were substantially overvalued, mortgage underwriting standards\nwere weak, and home mortgages were at substantial risk of falling underwater if house\nprices fell. Yet banks had limited loss-absorbing capacity and were heavily reliant on\nwholesale short-term funding, and interconnections across the financial system were\nopaque. When housing markets weakened, opacity contributed to investors’ fears, short-\nterm funding pulled away, and excessive leverage led to fire sales as financial institutions\nexperienced losses and major firms failed or were rescued by the government. The\neconomy experienced a deep recession, and unemployment ultimately reached\n10 percent.\nThe current resilience of the financial sector points to substantially more limited\nspillovers from recent events. The failures of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and\nFirst Republic Bank showed excessive reliance at those institutions on uninsured deposits\nand excessive exposure to interest rate risk. Even so, the overwhelming majority of\nbanks have strong balance sheets with limited leverage, high levels of loss-absorbing\ncapacity, and healthy liquidity. Moreover, household and business balance sheets are\ngenerally strong, and the credit quality of loans is generally much better than on the eve\nof the Global Financial Crisis. Leverage across key parts of the financial sector,\nincluding especially the largest banks and broker-dealers, is much lower than in the mid-\n2000s.\nEven so, we remain vigilant to the potential for vulnerabilities to emerge. Three\nareas of potential concern have been the focus of our supervisory and regulatory work.\n\n- 6 -\nFirst, recent stresses highlighted the importance of effective liquidity and interest rate risk\nmanagement, including both reliance on uninsured deposits and exposure to duration risk\nin asset holdings. While the resilience of the financial sector will limit the spillovers\nfrom recent events, I expect those strains to lead to a further tightening in credit supply\nfrom banks that will weigh on economic activity. Second, it is also important to assess\nhow changes in the financial sector, including expanded use of online banking and shifts\nin behavior that may be driven by access to social media, may alter the potential speed of\ndeposit flows. Third, the weakness in some sectors of commercial real estate will affect\nthe credit quality of those types of commercial real estate loans and thereby place strains\non lenders with high concentrations of those loans. Changes in work preferences and the\nincrease in remote work is leading to a reassessment of the outlook for office and\nassociated retail properties, and it will take time for the extent of that weakness to\nbecome clearer.\nOngoing Regulatory Capital Initiatives\nLater in the afternoon, during the second session of the conference, you will be\ndiscussing a few key ongoing regulatory capital initiatives, focusing on the completion of\nthe Basel III reforms. As Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr has noted, finalizing\nthe Basel III reforms is a high priority for the Federal Reserve. The revised framework\nshould improve the resilience of the banking system by producing more robust and\ninternationally consistent capital requirements for large firms, building on improvements\nmade to the capital framework following the Global Financial Crisis. Importantly, the\nrevised framework is expected to reduce unwarranted variability in capital requirements.\n\n- 7 -\nBy increasing standardization, these reforms aim to increase transparency and public\nconfidence in risk-weighted assets while also reducing complexity.\nAs we speak, the staffs of the U.S. federal banking agencies are diligently\nworking on a Basel III endgame proposal that should be issued for public comment soon.\nAt the same time, the Federal Reserve staff is considering ways to enhance the ability of\nstress tests to capture a wider range of risks and identify vulnerabilities at the largest\nbanking organizations.\nConclusion\nBased on this brief overview of the issues, this afternoon promises to be\ninvigorating and informative. I look forward to hearing how the panel discussions go. I\nhope that you enjoy the conference.\nThank you.",

Jefferson\nVice Chair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nMacroeconomics and Monetary Policy Conference\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nSan Francisco, California\nFebruary 21, 2025\n\nThank you, President Daly, for organizing this conference and for the opportunity\nto talk to this group.1 I have paid close attention to the papers presented at this annual\nconference in the past, and I look forward to today’s presentations and discussion.\nToday, I will talk about central bank communications and the use of textual\nanalysis tools. These tools help process qualitative information that may be hard to\ncapture in numerical forecasts. Also, they can improve our understanding of economic\nconcepts that are otherwise difficult to measure. This topic has been covered at this\nconference in the past. Last year, for example, there was a paper on the program that\nhighlighted the importance of considering the impact that speeches by the Chair of the\nFederal Reserve (Fed) have on asset prices when evaluating the transmission of monetary\npolicy to the rest of the economy.2 This paper also shows that speeches by the Vice Chair\nare less important than those by the Chair. So this might be a good time to catch up on\nyour text messages! (Just kidding!)\nMy talk is organized as follows. First, I will briefly discuss central bank\ncommunication and its effect on asset prices. Next, I will discuss how recent advances in\nautomated textual analysis may be having an impact on how the information in central\nbank communication is incorporated into asset prices. Then I will review how\nresearchers and market participants use textual analysis techniques, among other\ntechniques, to gauge who is listening to central bank communication and to understand\nhow monetary policy is transmitted to the economy. Before concluding, I will broaden\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 See Swanson and Jayawickrema (2024).\n\n- 2 -\nmy coverage and discuss how textual analysis tools can be used to estimate difficult-to-\nmeasure concepts in economics such as uncertainty and supply chain disruptions.\nThese new textual analysis techniques are important to me as a policymaker\nbecause I want to understand how our communications are being heard, interpreted,\nunderstood, and acted upon.\nCentral Bank Communication and its Effect on Financial Markets\nFormer Fed Chair Ben Bernanke often highlighted the importance of central bank\ncommunication, saying that “monetary policy is 98 percent talk and 2 percent action.”3\nObviously, the “98 percent” is hyperbole; it is not meant to be taken as an exact measure\nof how much of the transmission of monetary policy is due to central bank\ncommunication. Even so, research and my own experience confirm that central bank\ncommunication is key for the transmission of monetary policy. In remarks I delivered\nalmost two years ago, I discussed how monetary policy is transmitted to the rest of the\neconomy through financial market prices. 4 Changes in the federal funds target range are\ntransmitted to overnight money market rates and other short-term interest rates through\narbitrage relationships. The configuration of short-term interest rates, central bank\ncommunication about the likely future path of short-term interest rates, and the associated\neconomic outlook, in turn, affect long-term interest rates through investors’\nexpectations.5 Higher long-term interest rates increase the cost of borrowing for\n3 See Bernanke (2015, 2022).\n4 See Jefferson (2023a). Arbitrage is the economic force that keeps prices of financial instruments with\nsimilar payoffs, such as the federal funds rate and repo rates, close to each other.\n5 More specifically, according to the expectations theory of the term structure of interest rates,\nintermediate- and long-term interest rates are importantly affected by the weighted average of expected\nfuture short-term interest rates. In addition, monetary policy affects risk premiums (see, for example,\nBernanke and Kuttner, 2005; Hanson and Stein, 2015; and Gertler and Karadi, 2015) and term premiums (if\nmonetary policy tightens in response to inflationary shocks, term premiums also tend to rise as longer-\nmaturity bonds become riskier; see, for example, Piazzesi and Schneider, 2006).\n\n- 3 -\nhouseholds and businesses, thereby affecting households’ and businesses’ spending,\nsavings, and investment decisions.\nEvolution of Fed Communications\nPolicymakers’ approach to communication has evolved over time. In the past,\npolicymakers were not focused on clarity and transparency in their communications as\nthey are today. For example, former Fed Chair Alan Greenspan famously quipped in\n1987, “If I seem unduly clear to you, you must have misunderstood what I said.”6 In the\n1990s, however, he started to embrace transparency. Figure 1 shows a timeline of the\nsteps taken toward increasing transparency at the Fed since the 1990s. In 1993, the Fed\nstarted to publish Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting minutes in their\ncurrent form, and, soon after, it began releasing FOMC meeting transcripts with a five-\nyear lag. In February 1994, the FOMC started to issue post-FOMC meeting statements\nfollowing meetings at which there was a change in the intended policy stance. Later, it\nregularly incorporated the target federal funds rate into these statements. In May 1999,\nthe FOMC started to publish statements after every meeting, even on occasions when\nthere was no change in policy. In 2004, the FOMC accelerated the release of the minutes\nto three weeks after the meeting as opposed to after the subsequent FOMC meeting.\nDuring the tenure of former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke, the Fed’s transparency increased\nsignificantly. In November 2007, the FOMC began releasing the Summary of Economic\nProjections (SEP). In 2011, Chair Bernanke started holding press conferences after every\nother FOMC meeting. In 2012, under his leadership, the FOMC adopted an explicit\ninflation target of 2 percent in its new Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary\n6 See Appelbaum (2012).\n\n- 4 -\nPolicy Strategy. Also, it started publishing anonymized individual FOMC participants’\nviews on the appropriate future path of the federal funds rate, now famously known as the\n“dot plot.” In 2019, Chair Powell continued this march toward transparency and started\nholding press conferences after every FOMC meeting.\nOf course, Chair Powell and other policymakers testify regularly before Congress,\nas required by law. Also, FOMC participants give public speeches and transparently\ndiscuss their views on monetary policy and associated issues, as evidenced by my speech\nhere today.\nPreviously, I have spoken about two primary reasons for the increase in\ntransparency.7 First, transparency allows for greater accountability to the public.\nSecond, there is a growing appreciation in the economics profession that clarity about\npolicy actions helps the transmission of monetary policy to the rest of the economy by,\nfor example, making asset prices more informationally efficient. Relatedly, by conveying\naspects of the Fed’s reaction function, communications can help inform investors’ views\nabout the likely future path of monetary policy in a way that helps achieve the Fed’s\nmonetary policy objectives.\nUsing Textual Analysis to Quantify Central Bank Communication\nCentral bank communication is clearly important in shaping the path of interest\nrates, so it is not surprising that investors and researchers use textual analysis techniques,\nincluding artificial intelligence, to quantify in an automated way information conveyed\nthrough FOMC statements and other communications, such as speeches by Governors\n7 See Jefferson (2023b).\n\n- 5 -\nand Fed Bank presidents.8 Researchers have tested the hypothesis that clarity about\npolicy actions would help the transmission of monetary policy to the rest of the economy.\nUsing textual analysis, high-frequency asset price data, and high-frequency central bank\ncommunication data, this research shows that investors’ reactions to specific sentences\ncommunicated by the central bank are quickly incorporated into asset prices.9 In\naddition, economists have used textual analysis to understand how media reporting of\ncentral bank communication affects short-term interest rates.10 For example, some have\nused a bag-of-words technique to estimate media sentiment during FOMC announcement\ndays.11 By design, a high media sentiment is meant to capture times when journalists\nreport that the FOMC is more likely to tighten monetary policy in the near future. Figure\n2 shows that the correlation between media sentiment and six-month U.S. Treasury yield\nchanges is positive and relatively high (40 percent), which suggests that media reporting\nof central bank communication plays an important role in the transmission of monetary\npolicy.\nPolicymakers know that their communications are likely to affect the course of\nshort-term interest rates, other asset prices, and the associated economic outlook,\nresulting in an easing or tightening of financial conditions. Therefore, policymakers have\n8 See, for example, Cieslak and McMahon (2023); Gardner, Scotti, and Vega (2022); Gómez-Cram and\nGrotteria (2022); and Sharpe, Sinha and Hollrah (2023).\n9 See, for example, Gómez-Cram and Grotteria (2022), who use textual analysis, high-frequency asset price\ndata, and high-frequency central bank communication data to understand investors’ reactions to specific\nsentences communicated by the FOMC.\n10 See Schmanski and others (2023).\n11 A bag-of-words technique is a natural language processing technique that uses a collection (or “bag”) of\nwords and a scoring system to quantify qualitative textual information. Schmanski and others (2023) use\nthis technique to pair a set of topic keywords with modifiers and determine whether the combination of\ntopic-modifier communicates tightening, neutral, or easing news. By construction, the sentiment is high\nwhen the media thinks the FOMC is more likely to tighten monetary policy in the near future.\n\n- 6 -\nalways paid close attention to what they say, well before market participants started\napplying artificial intelligence tools to central bank communications.\nIn general, researchers argue that automated textual analysis and automated\ntrading have increased the speed with which information is incorporated into asset prices.\nThat suggests that asset prices have become more informationally efficient, sometimes in\na matter of seconds or even milliseconds instead of minutes after information is\nreleased.12 Thus, increased transparency and advances in technology have potentially\nmade asset prices more informationally efficient, which, in turn, helps with the\ntransmission of monetary policy. Yet others argue that automated algorithms may be\nmore prone to mistakes than humans, may provide an incentive for investors to value\nspeed over accuracy, and may reduce the long-run informativeness of asset prices, which\ncould hurt the transmission of monetary policy.13\nI look forward to the findings of future research as we develop a deeper\nunderstanding of this issue. For now, I do not think artificial intelligence is changing the\nway policymakers communicate, but research shows that it has affected how quickly\ninformation about policy is incorporated into asset prices.\nCentral Bank Communication: Is Anyone Listening?\nNext, I will discuss whether research using textual analysis is helping\npolicymakers to understand better who is listening to central bank communication. In\n2018, former Fed Vice Chair Alan Blinder predicted that “central banks will keep trying\n12 See Chaboud and others (2014) for evidence that automated trading has increased the informational\nefficiency of foreign exchange markets by reducing the frequency of triangular arbitrage opportunities and\nthe autocorrelation of high-frequency returns. See von Beschwitz and others (2020) for evidence that\nautomated textual analysis speeds up the stock price response to news.\n13 See, for example, von Beschwitz, Keim, and Massa (2020); Dugast and Foucault (2017); and O’Hara\n(2015).\n\n- 7 -\nto communicate with the general public, as they should. But for the most part, they will\nfail.”14 He explained further that “many economic models presume that central bank\ncommunication is aimed at wage-setters, price-setters, consumers, or investors—maybe\nall of them. But are they listening?” His answer was no, they are not listening to central\nbank communications, and he cited economic research using survey data to support his\nanswer.15\nMore recently, however, research shows that nonexperts and households are\nlistening to central bank communications. Some of this research uses textual analysis,\nand some uses randomized control trials. Researchers have used textual analysis to\nprocess automatically and quantify more than 3.2 million posts on social media by\nexperts and nonexperts. This research shows that journalists and professional forecasters\nwho comment often on central bank policies, as well as nonexperts who do not comment\nregularly on central bank policies do listen to central bank communications.16\nCentral Bank Communication and Monetary Policy Transmission\nFurther, research shows that direct central bank communication and the media’s\nreporting of central bank communication are highly correlated. Yet when they do not\nalign, the media’s reporting tends to have a larger effect on asset prices and professional\nforecasters’ views about the future than the central bank’s direct communication.17 In\naddition, a randomized control trial with nearly 20,000 U.S. individuals shows that\n14 See Blinder (2018, p. 569).\n15 See Kumar and others (2015).\n16 Ehrmann and Wabitsch (2022) document that the number of expert and nonexpert comments posted on\nthe X platform (formerly known as Twitter) that discuss central bank communication increases after\nEuropean Central Bank (ECB) press conferences and other ECB communications, such as speeches by the\nECB president. The authors also document that the content of the discussion tends to be objective (factual)\nrather than subjective, according to the authors’ dictionary base subjectivity measure.\n17 See Schmanski and others (2023).\n\n- 8 -\ncentral bank communication affects households’ inflation expectations, which, in turn,\naffects their behavior as measured by scanner-collected data.18 This research shows that\nwhile central bank communication tends to affect household expectations and spending\nbehavior, the way households receive information matters. In particular, households\nappear to react more to information conveyed by social media, friends, and family than to\ninformation conveyed by traditional media. All told, this research suggests that central\nbank efforts to communicate with the general public are having some success, but there is\nstill room for improvement.\nMeasuring Economic Concepts Using Textual Analysis\nTextual analysis is not only helping researchers understand who is listening to\ncentral bank communication. Generally, it is helping them to measure qualitative\ninformation that is hard to capture with numerical forecasts and estimate difficult-to-\nmeasure economic concepts such as uncertainty, supply chain disruptions, and financial\nconditions.19 As I mentioned in a previous speech, uncertainty is not directly observable\nin the same way that inflation and economic output are.20 Notwithstanding the difficulty\nin measuring uncertainty, researchers have developed tools to assess it. In fact, in the\npast two decades, there has been tremendous growth in research devoted to the subject,\nespecially on text-based measures of uncertainty. For example, researchers created an\neconomic policy uncertainty index, shown in figure 3, based on the number of leading\nnewspaper articles that contain a combination of words related to economic policy\n18 See Coibion, Gorodnichenko, and Weber (2022).\n19 See, for example, Baker, Bloom, and Davis (2016) for textual analysis measures of economic policy,\nSoto (2023) and Young and others (2021) for textual analysis measures of supply chain disruptions, and\nAdams and others (2023) for a textual analysis measure of financial conditions.\n20 See Jefferson (2023c).\n\n- 9 -\nuncertainty.21 As shown in the figure, economic uncertainty in the U.S. reached an all-\ntime high at the onset of the pandemic, came down slightly after the pandemic, and has\nrecently increased as the potential economic implications of new government policies are\ndiscussed in newspaper articles. Research also shows that newspaper text-based\nmeasures are highly correlated with stock price volatility, and that higher values of these\nmeasures are associated with lower investment and employment. A corollary to that\ninsight is that policymakers should communicate as clearly as possible to avoid\nincreasing uncertainty.\nRecent research has also discovered that narrative sentiment conveys information\nthat may be hard to capture in numerical forecasts. For example, it was shown that the\ntone of text accompanying a set of economic forecasts produced by the Fed’s staff,\npredicts forecast errors of the Fed’s staff as well as Blue Chip participants.22 The\npredictive power of sentiment seems to be arising from signaling the downside risks to\neconomic performance for output, employment, and stock returns. These findings\nsuggest that the tone of the narrative captures information that is not necessarily provided\nby corresponding forecasts. Not surprisingly, given this information, the tonality has\npredictive power for stock prices as well as monetary policy surprises.\nAnother example of how textual analysis is helping researchers estimate difficult-\nto-measure concepts is new measures of firms’ demand and supply shocks. Traditionally,\nacademic researchers use sign restrictions in price and quantity measures to identify and\ndifferentiate demand shocks from supply shocks. An increase in price and quantity is\nconsidered a demand shock; an increase in price accompanied by a decline in quantity is\n21 See Baker, Bloom, and Davis (2016).\n22 See Sharpe, Sinha, and Hollrah (2023).\n\n- 10 -\nconsidered a supply shock. These so-called sign restrictions are useful tools; however, it\nis possible that an increase in price and quantity can be due to a surge in demand in the\nface of supply chain disruptions. Other popular measures of supply chain disruptions are\nsupplier delivery times and order backlogs provided by the Institute for Supply\nManagement (ISM). These measures, however, only estimate firm activity relative to the\nprevious month and can lack important context for understanding short-term dynamics\nthat can otherwise be captured in qualitative, text-based measures. Thus, it can be useful\nto complement sign restriction methods, supplier delivery times, and order backlogs with\ntextual analysis techniques that quantify firms’ narratives in earnings calls and the Beige\nBook to identify better demand and supply shocks.23 For example, figure 4 shows the\nSupply Chain Bottleneck Sentiment Index, the solid black line, estimated by a Board\neconomist using textual analysis techniques to quantify the information conveyed in the\nFed’s Beige Book publications, along with the ISM Supplier Delivery Index, the dashed\nred line.24 For illustration purposes, both indexes are normalized to have a zero mean and\na standard deviation equal to one, with large positive numbers indicating that supply\nchains are stressed. Both indexes surged in the 1970s after the oil price increase and\nensuing energy crisis. Supply chain disruptions reappeared in the 2000s with chip\nshortages, and, most recently, bottlenecks arose during the COVID-19 pandemic. The\nfigure illustrates how the text-based measure signals a more prolonged period of supply\nchain disruptions during the pandemic. Comparing both measures, we see that the\nmonthly changes in delivery times improved at a fast pace, as shown in the ISM index,\n23 See Young and others (2021) and Soto (2023).\n24 See Soto (2023).\n\n- 11 -\nbut narratives of the post-pandemic recovery, as captured in the Beige Book, were\nsignaling elevated levels of supply chain disruptions that eased more slowly.\nConclusion\nThe idea of using qualitative information on media, government records, central\nbank, or management communication in economic research to understand better the\ntransmission of monetary policy is not new.25 What is novel is that, in the past two\ndecades, there have been advances in textual analysis techniques and incredible growth of\ndata that are easily available to researchers and investors, in terms of both volume and\nvariety. The advances in textual analysis techniques and the growth in alternative data\nhave, in turn, helped researchers to better estimate difficult-to-measure economic\nconcepts, to more easily identify who listens to central bank communications, and to\ninvestigate how quickly central bank communication is incorporated into asset prices,\namong other things. Also, we have greater access to high-frequency data, such as\nmillisecond timestamp financial transactions, and “alternative data,” which includes\ntextual information from social media posts. As I mentioned earlier, these new textual\nanalysis techniques are important to policymakers because we seek to understand how\nour communications are being heard, interpreted, understood, and acted upon.\nWhile I am grateful that textual analysis techniques and data access have\nimproved over the years, I will end on a cautionary note. Automatic textual analysis\nshould not be regarded as superseding other analysis of the historical record on monetary\npolicy. A wealth of data and techniques to analyze text does not necessarily translate into\ngreater insight. Therefore, it is important that policymakers, researchers, and investors\n25 See, for example, Romer and Romer (1989, 2023, 2024) for a description of the “narrative” approach.\n\n- 12 -\ncontinue to be diligent in using the right tools and the right data to make the best possible\ninferences.26\nThank you!\n26\nFor example, Dessaint, Foucault, and Fresard (2024) suggest that alternative data mainly help forecast\nshort-term outcomes, and not so much long-term outcomes.\n\n- 13 -\nReferences\nAdams, Travis, Andrea Ajello, Diego Silva, and Francisco Vazquez-Grande (2023).\n“More than Words: Twitter Chatter and Financial Market Sentiment,” Finance\nand Economics Discussion Series 2023-034.

    "text": "For release on delivery\n4:45 p.m. EST\nNovember 8, 2023\nResearch and Statistics Centennial Anniversary: Past, Present and Future\nClosing Remarks by\nPhilip N. Jefferson\nVice Chair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“A Look at the Past, Present, and Future,” a conference celebrating\nthe Centennial of the Division of Research and Statistics\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nWashington, D.C.\nNovember 8, 2023\n\nThank you, Stacey, and thank you to the organizers for a thought-provoking\nconference.1 Provoking thought and discussion are very fitting ways to mark the\ncentenary of the Division of Research and Statistics (R&S).\nIn keeping with the conference theme, I have organized my remarks around the\npast, present, and future of R&S. My reflection on the past, while idiosyncratic, is also, I\nbelieve, indicative of a through line that characterizes the division historically. For me,\nthat past begins in 1983, when I came to the Board as a newly minted college graduate to\nbe a research assistant (RA) in the Government Finance Section, now known as Fiscal\nAnalysis. One of our primary tasks was to keep track of the volatile, and somewhat\nunpredictable, fluctuations in tax receipts. The daily numbers were transmitted not by\ncomputer, but by telephone. Other data retrieval required RAs to go to the Treasury\ndirectly in the luxurious conveyance of a D.C. taxicab, reimbursed by the Board—a little\nperk that, as it happened, never came my way. In our section, though, it was a lot of time\non the phone, and the two economists I worked with, Al Teplin and Wolf Ramm, would\ntake down the numbers and pass them to me.\nObviously, many things have changed in R&S over the past 40 years. But one\nthing that hasn’t changed much is the role of RAs in analyzing data and participating in\nother important functions performed by the division. Back then, armed with those tax\nreceipt numbers, I would be expected to put together a projection. My bosses had their\nown projections, of course, and they subjected my work to very careful review. But I\nwas given that assignment because there was a widespread view then that RAs were here\nto learn and to contribute meaningfully to research and policy work, and I felt a\n1 The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of\nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nconsiderable responsibility to do the very best I could with the important work I had been\ngiven. Much has changed at R&S, but those values remain. As a young college\ngraduate, I was impressed with how seriously people in R&S took their responsibilities,\nwhatever their role. I am not the only person whose experience as a young person in\nR&S was formative. In my case, it might seem remarkable that a former R&S RA has\nreturned as Vice Chair, but for decades, former RAs have been returning and serving in\nleadership roles at the Board and throughout the System.\nMoving from the past to the present, it has been a while since the things we\nthought we understood well about the economy were subject to as much debate as they\nare today. At the same time, an explosion of available data, much of it of high frequency\nand from unconventional or alternative sources, has given R&S many more potential\navenues for analyzing the economy and, hence, much more to do. The list of alternative\ndata sources available to forecast economic outcomes seems almost endless, including\nsocial media posts and web traffic, credit card purchases, geolocation, and satellite\nimagery. These alternative data have transformed the way economists forecast future\noutcomes and measure the effectiveness of monetary policy. For example, economists\ncan use postings to social media sites to analyze investors’, journalists’, and households’\nreal-time interpretation of central bank communications.2 However, a wealth of data\ndoes not necessarily translate into better forecasts and better insights. Recent academic\nresearch suggests that alternative data mainly help forecast short-term outcomes and not\nso much long-term outcomes.3 This is why it is important that R&S continues to be at\n2 For an example of recent research that looks at Twitter posts during FOMC days, see Schmanski and\nothers (2023).\n3 Dessaint, Foucault, and Fresard (2023) find that alternative data mainly helps forecast short-term\noutcomes.\n\n- 3 -\nthe forefront of research, making sure we are making the right inferences with new tools\nand new data sources.\nWith respect to the future, my expectation is that today’s challenges will persist. I\nhave already mentioned one challenge, which is to make sure we are acquiring the right\n“alternative” data, making the right inferences, and appropriately using tools such as\nartificial intelligence, including machine learning, to analyze this wealth of data. These\ntools may be very good at estimating correlations, but we know that correlation does not\nimply causation; thus, their usefulness may be limited. Identifying a correlation in the\ndata without identifying causation may lead policymakers to incorrect conclusions and\ntherefore lead us to implement inappropriate policies. In addition, these tools are very\ngood at data mining, which can be dangerous if it gives us the false sense that a good in-\nsample fit leads to a good out-of-sample forecasting model. Economists in R&S and\nother divisions, as well as academics, have made progress on this front, but there is room\nfor further improvement. In addition to the challenge of how to best use these tools and\ndata at the Fed, R&S faces the challenge of understanding what these new technologies\nmean for labor productivity and the economy.\nThe other challenge I want to highlight is that of making decisions under\nuncertainty. This is not a new challenge, of course. John Maynard Keynes and Frank\nKnight provided book-length treatments of the subject a century ago (Keynes, 1921;\nKnight, 1921). In addition, in 2003, Alan Greenspan observed, “Uncertainty is not just\nan important feature of the monetary policy landscape; it is the defining characteristic of\nthat landscape” (Greenspan, 2003). The fact that uncertainty has been a challenge for so\n\n- 4 -\nlong makes me think that it will continue be a challenge going forward, and in the wake\nof the pandemic, it is highly salient.\nIn 1967, William Brainard argued that uncertainty about the power of monetary\npolicy implied that policy should respond more cautiously to shocks than would be the\ncase if this uncertainty did not exist (Brainard, 1967). Brainard’s attenuation principle is\na classic example of what has come to be known as the Bayesian approach to uncertainty\nand is often cited as the foundation for the gradualism in the adjustment of monetary\npolicy. That said, methods based on theories of ambiguity aversion led to anti-\nattenuation. In other words, to protect against uncertainty, the appropriate response may\nbe a quick and strong monetary policy response. Of course, the right response to\nuncertainty is probably context specific and thus varies over time.\nAs Chair Powell mentioned in a speech in 2018, there are two particularly\nimportant cases in which doing too little when there is high uncertainty comes with\nhigher costs than doing too much (Powell, 2018). The first case is when attempting to\navoid severely adverse events such as a financial crisis. In this situation, words like “we\nwill do whatever it takes” will likely be more effective than “we will take cautious steps.”\nThe second case is when inflation expectations threaten to become unanchored. If\nexpectations were to begin to drift, the reality or expectation of a weak monetary policy\nresponse would exacerbate the problem.4\nHow to respond to uncertainty is a matter that the Federal Open Market\nCommittee, with the help of R&S, has been wrestling with for a long time. While I could\nbe wrong, as of today, I do not foresee that some all-powerful artificial intelligence will\n4 For example, Soderstrom (2002) shows that when there is uncertainty about the persistence of inflation, it\nis better to implement monetary policy that is aggressive than gradual.\n\n- 5 -\nbe able to perfectly balance the risks of doing too little or too much. Therefore, I expect\nthat long into the future, we’ll be relying on the knowledge and good judgment of the\npeople of R&S to weigh the risks and to help in providing options to monetary\npolicymakers so that they can make informed decisions.\nIn closing, congratulations on a century of service to the Fed and the American\npeople. I have every expectation that the next 100 years of the Division of Research and\nStatistics will be just as integral to the prosperity and well-being of the American people\nas it has been to date.\nThank you!\n\n- 6 -\nReferences\nBrainard, William C.

Jefferson\nVice Chair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Beyond the Business Cycle: Adapting to a New Global Paradigm”\n65th Annual Meeting of the National Association for Business Economics\nDallas, Texas\nOctober 9, 2023\n\nIntroduction\nThank you for inviting me to join this conference and for the kind introduction. It\nis a pleasure to be here.\nBefore I begin, let me remind you that the views I will express today are my own\nand are not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\nI will take this opportunity to share with you my outlook on the U.S. economy. I\nwill also discuss risks facing the economy. Then, I will turn to the transmission of\nmonetary policy, including some recent evidence on a source of lagged effects of policy.\nFinally, I will discuss considerations for monetary policy that follow from efforts to\nmanage risks given the lagged effects of monetary policy. These considerations include\nthe need to proceed carefully as the risks of tightening monetary policy too much relative\nto those of not tightening enough move closer into balance. With that, let me turn to my\noutlook for the U.S. economy.\nThe Inflation Outlook\nEven though recent inflation data have been encouraging, inflation remains too\nhigh. Over the 12 months ending in August, total Personal Consumption Expenditures\n(PCE) prices rose 3.5 percent, the black line in figure 1. Excluding the volatile food and\nenergy categories, core PCE prices rose 3.9 percent, the red line. To better understand\ncore inflation trends, I find it useful to look at three large categories that together make\nup the core PCE price index, because what has been causing inflation in each of these\nsectors is somewhat different. The first category, core goods inflation, the red line in\nfigure 2, has slowed strikingly, as supply chain–related price pressures continue to ease.\nThe second category, housing services price inflation, the black line, has clearly stepped\n\n- 2 -\ndown, as was anticipated given the previous slowing of increases in rents for new tenants.\nIn contrast, price increases for the third category, core nonhousing services, the blue line,\nhave yet to show a significant slowdown. Since this segment accounts for more than 50\npercent of the overall core PCE index, we will need to see further slowing in this area to\nmeet our inflation objective. Nevertheless, I believe that core PCE prices will moderate\nfurther as the labor market comes into better balance.\nThe Labor Market\nDespite the strong September labor market data we received last week, there is\nevidence that the imbalance between labor demand and labor supply continues to narrow,\nas labor demand cools while labor supply improves. Even so, the labor market remains\ntight.\nConsistent with cooling labor demand, job openings declined by nearly 1 million\nfrom the end of January to the end of August. Nevertheless, as shown in figure 3, job\nopenings remain about 30 percent above their pre-pandemic level. At the same time,\nlayoffs have remained very low, and the pace of payroll employment gains remains\nstrong, with September nonfarm payroll job gains coming in higher than expected. In\naddition, the unemployment rate is 3.8 percent, a level that is still near historical lows.\nThe fact that the unemployment rate and layoffs have remained low over the past year\namid disinflation suggests that there is a path to restoring price stability without the kind\nof substantial increase in unemployment that has often accompanied significant\ntightening cycles.\nImprovements in labor supply are also contributing to rebalancing the labor\nmarket. For instance, since the start of the year, the prime-age labor force participation\n\n- 3 -\nrate, shown in figure 4, has moved up further. Immigration has also picked up, further\ncontributing to the increase in labor supply. Slowing labor demand and improving labor\nsupply have eased pressure in the labor market, and my expectation is for further gradual\neasing in labor market conditions, as restrictive monetary policy continues to slow labor\ndemand without causing an abrupt increase in layoffs or the unemployment rate.\nAggregate Economic Activity\nData we have received so far point to solid economic growth in the third quarter,\ncontrary to expectations earlier this year that the economy would slow. Consumer\nspending was strong in both July and August. Housing starts, shown in figure 5, are\nrebounding after a slowdown that was widely seen as caused by higher interest rates.\nDespite the signs of resilience in the economy this year, some analysts expected slower\neconomic growth this fall, which leads me to the next topic: What are some near-term\nrisks facing the U.S. economy?\nRisks Facing the U.S. Economy\nSo far, the economy has been resilient, and inflation has been subsiding; however,\nI attach a high degree of uncertainty to my outlook and see multiple risks. I am\nparticularly attentive to upside risks to inflation, such as those associated with the\neconomy and labor market remaining too strong to achieve further disinflation, as well as\nrisks associated with unexpected increases in energy prices. Since energy prices are\nvolatile, I tend to look through changes in energy prices and focus more on core inflation\nin my deliberations. I am mindful that persistent inflation above the Federal Open\nMarket Committee’s (FOMC) 2 percent target increases the risk that inflationary\n\n- 4 -\nexpectations become unanchored. Thus, regardless of its source, my objective is to return\ninflation to the FOMC’s 2 percent target.\nI just mentioned upside risks to inflation, but there are also important downside\nrisks to economic activity, such as the slowdown in foreign economic growth. China’s\neconomy appears to have lost momentum as real estate activity has fallen, and other\nindicators, including retail sales, also suggest softness in economic activity. In Europe,\nmanufacturing and services purchasing managers indexes were both in contractionary\nterritory recently. I am following these developments to the extent that they may have\nimplications for the U.S. economy, especially if conditions deteriorate sharply abroad.\nOn the Transmission of Monetary Policy\nAs you know, monetary policy is transmitted to the rest of the economy by\naffecting broad financial conditions, including market interest rates. Higher market rates\nraise the interest rates that households and businesses face and reduce the spending they\nundertake—most notably, spending on business fixed investment, residential\nconstruction, and consumer durables. Higher interest rates also affect asset prices. For\nexample, higher interest rates, all else being equal, raise the exchange value of the dollar,\nwhich then boosts imports and reduces exports. Additionally, higher interest rates, along\nwith a higher anticipated path of policy, lead investors to discount cash flows associated\nwith longer-term investments at higher rates. This reduces the value of the stock market,\nwhich then reduces consumption through wealth effects and business investment through\nthe cost of capital. In addition, monetary policy affects risk premiums.1 Tighter\n1 Bernanke and Kuttner (2005), Hanson and Stein (2015), and Gertler and Karadi (2015), among others,\nhighlight that monetary policy affects risk premiums. Policy tightening tends to reduce the willingness of\ninvestors to bear risk—for example, by reducing expected levels of consumption (Campbell and Cochrane,\n1999). If policy tightens in response to inflationary shocks, term premiums also tend to rise as longer-\n\n- 5 -\nmonetary policy tends to reduce the willingness of investors to bear risk, increasing yield\nspreads and reducing the prices for a range of asset classes and augmenting the direct\neffects on interest rates and asset prices described earlier.\nFigure 6 illustrates how long-term interest rates move in anticipation of changes\nin the federal funds rate. The red line is the average long-term triple-B corporate bond\nrate, a measure of corporate borrowing costs. The blue line is the average 30-year\nmortgage rate, a measure of household borrowing costs. Notice that both measures\nincreased in early 2022 in response to Fed communications and in anticipation of\nincreases in the effective federal funds rate, the black line. Recently, these long-term\nrates have increased further. More generally financial conditions have tightened further,\nand real long-term Treasury yields have risen significantly. More on this later.\nIn a speech last spring, I noted that we are still learning about the full effect of our\npolicy tightening in this post-pandemic cycle.2 Thus, I am also mindful of factors that\ncould attenuate or delay the transmission of monetary policy. One such factor is that the\nbulk of corporate debt issued by large firms has not yet had to be refinanced since the\nFOMC started to tighten monetary policy in March 2022.\nLarge businesses rely on corporate bonds and bank loans as sources of debt\nfinancing. Corporate bonds tend to be fixed-rate debt, while bank loans tend to be\nfloating-rate debt. As most nonfinancial corporate debt is in the form of corporate bonds\nthat were issued before 2022, the interest rate averaged across all outstanding corporate\ndebt is still low, as shown in figure 7. This rate will likely increase next year when a\nmaturity bonds become riskier (Piazzesi and Schneider, 2006). Policy tightening can also lower stock\nprices by increasing the expected equity premium—for example, by weakening the balance sheet of\nleverage firms and making their stocks riskier.\n2 See Jefferson (2023).\n\n- 6 -\nlarger fraction of maturing corporate bonds needs to be refinanced. Given that this\nadditional tightening is in train, it may be too soon to say confidently that we’ve\ntightened enough to return inflation to our 2 percent target. At the same time, I will be\nmindful of the additional tightening in train because of our past rate hikes as I consider\nwhether there is a need to tighten policy further in the future. This leads me to my next\ntopic: considerations for monetary policy that follow from my economic outlook and\nrisks to it that I have already mentioned.\nMonetary Policy Considerations\nAfter increasing the target range for the federal funds rate by 525 basis points\nsince early 2022, my view is that the FOMC is in a position to proceed carefully in\nassessing the extent of any additional policy firming that may be necessary. We are in a\nsensitive period of risk management, where we have to balance the risk of not having\ntightened enough, against the risk of policy being too restrictive. The balancing of these\ntwo risks was a good reason for holding the policy rate constant at our most recent\nFOMC meeting.\nAs I mentioned earlier, real long-term Treasury yields have risen recently. In\npart, the upward movement in real yields may reflect investors’ assessment that the\nunderlying momentum of the economy is stronger than previously recognized and, as a\nresult, a restrictive stance of monetary policy may be needed for longer than previously\nthought in order to return inflation to 2 percent. But I am also mindful that increases in\nreal yields can arise from changes in investor’s attitudes toward risk and uncertainty.\nLooking ahead, I will remain cognizant of the tightening in financial conditions through\nhigher bond yields and will keep that in mind as I assess the future path of policy. I will\n\n- 7 -\nbe taking financial market developments into account along with the totality of incoming\ndata in assessing the economic outlook and the risks surrounding the outlook and in\njudging the appropriate future course of policy.\nThank you!\n\n- 8 -\nReferences\nBernanke, Ben S., and Kenneth N.

I am very much attuned\nto the important work that you’re doing on uncertainty. Indeed, as a monetary\npolicymaker, the subject is rarely far from my mind. It’s not a new subject, of course.\nJohn Maynard Keynes and Frank Knight provided book-length treatments of the subject a\ncentury ago (Keynes, 1921; Knight, 1921). In addition, in 2003, Alan Greenspan\nobserved, “Uncertainty is not just an important feature of the monetary policy landscape;\nit is the defining characteristic of that landscape” (Greenspan, 2003).\nBefore I begin, let me remind you that the views I express today are my own and\nare not necessarily shared by my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\nMy plan is to talk about recent advances in how to measure uncertainty, what may\ncause uncertainty, what effect uncertainty may have on economic outcomes, and the\nconduct of monetary policy in the presence of uncertainty.\nDefining and measuring uncertainty\nUncertainty is not directly observable in the same way inflation and economic\noutput are observable. It is therefore more difficult to measure. To complicate matters\nfurther, there are three related concepts that are often used interchangeably: risk,\nvolatility, and uncertainty. According to Frank Knight, risk describes a situation in which\nthe outcome is unknown, but the probability distribution governing that outcome is\nknown. Volatility, often used synonymously with risk, is a statistical measure of the\nvariation in observed outcomes. In contrast, uncertainty is characterized by both an\nunknown outcome and an unknown probability distribution. These concepts are used\ninterchangeably, in part, because empirically it can be difficult to identify them\n\n- 2 -\nseparately, and because they all capture aspects of what policymakers do not know when\nmaking decisions. Therefore, the uncertainty measures I will discuss are a mixture of\nthese three concepts, and a theme for me will be the necessity of monetary policymakers\nto consider what they don’t know in their decisionmaking, an argument often attributed to\nFriedrich Hayek (1974).\nNotwithstanding the difficulty in measuring uncertainty, economists have\ndeveloped tools to assess it. In fact, in the past two decades, there has been tremendous\ngrowth in research devoted to the subject. In my talk today, I will focus on four broad\ncategories of uncertainty measures: text-based, survey-based, econometric-based, and\nfinancial market-based measures.1 There have been advances in all four categories, and\nthere are advantages and disadvantages to each of these measures.\nOne example of text-based measures of uncertainty is that by Baker, Bloom, and\nDavis (2016), who created an uncertainty index based on the number of leading\nnewspaper articles that contain a combination of words related to economic policy\nuncertainty. They showed that newspaper text-based measures are highly correlated with\nstock price volatility, and that higher values of these measures are associated with lower\ninvestment and employment. An advantage of these measures is that they are high-\nfrequency, real-time measures that can narrow the type of uncertainty being measured by\nlinking particular words regarding uncertainty to a specific topic, such as inflation or\nmonetary policy. A limitation of these measures is that they suffer from dual causality\nwith the economic outcomes we are trying to measure, and therefore it is difficult to use\nthem to ascertain what impact (if any) uncertainty has on economic outcomes. For\n1 For a detailed description of these four categories of uncertainty measures, please see Cascaldi-Garcia and\nothers (2023).\n\n- 3 -\nexample, does stock price volatility cause journalists to worry about uncertainty, or is the\nuncertainty discussed in newspaper articles causing volatility? I note, though, that this\ndisadvantage is common to all four broad categories of uncertainty measures to greater or\nlesser degrees.\nThe second set of uncertainty measures is survey based. These measures use\nresponses to questions by households, businesses, and market participants about their\nforecasts and how certain they are about those forecasts. Advantages of survey-based\nmeasures are that they are explicit about the segments of society facing uncertainty, and\nthey are relatively precise in pinpointing the horizon over which the uncertainty prevails.\nDisadvantages are that these measures are not necessarily timely in capturing uncertainty\naround fast-breaking new events, and, depending on the issue, they may be less\nrepresentative than those based on the news.\nThe third set of uncertainty measures is econometric based. In general, these\ncalculate how far off econometric model forecasts are from actual values at each point in\ntime. Intuitively, when uncertainty increases, it becomes harder to predict economic\nvariables. Advantages of these measures are that they are easy to interpret and calculate\nand are less prone to dual causality associated with the economic outcomes of interest.\nDisadvantages are that they are sensitive to the choice of the econometric forecasting\nmodel used to calculate them, and their timeliness depends on the availability of the data\nthe forecasting model uses.\nThe last set of uncertainty measures is market-based measures, which use\nfinancial market prices to estimate either realized volatility or option-implied volatility.\nFor example, one widely used uncertainty measure is the Chicago Board of Options\n\n- 4 -\nExchange’s Volatility Index, the VIX, which is calculated using equity index options that\nmeasure market participants’ expectations for the volatility of the S&P 500 index over\nthe coming 30 days. The advantages and disadvantages of these measures are similar to\nthe text-based measures: They are high-frequency, real-time estimates of market\nparticipants’ views, but they suffer from dual causality with the economic outcomes we\nare trying to measure. An additional disadvantage is that it is often difficult to specify the\ntype of uncertainty being measured.\nCurrent state of uncertainty\nBased on the range of measures discussed above, what can we say about the\ncurrent state of uncertainty? Figure 1 shows three measures of uncertainty. The red line\nis an econometric-based measure constructed by Federal Reserve Board staff (Londono,\nMa, and Wilson, 2023) called U.S. economic uncertainty. According to this measure,\nU.S. economic uncertainty reached an all-time high at the onset of the pandemic, came\ndown slightly after the pandemic, but has remained elevated ever since. Consistent with\nthis measure, policymakers, including Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)\nparticipants and central bankers around the globe, have been emphasizing the elevated\nlevel of uncertainty, especially related to inflation, and the challenge this poses for\nmonetary policy. Since the onset of the pandemic, most FOMC participants have been\nindicating in the Summary of Economic Projections that they view uncertainty around\ntheir forecast of personal consumption expenditure inflation to be higher than the average\nlevel of uncertainty over the past 20 years. But we policymakers are not alone in this.\nThe July 2023 and September 2023 issues of the Federal Reserve Beige Book, which\nsummarizes the commentary on current economic conditions of businesses, repeat the\n\n- 5 -\nwords “uncertain” and “uncertainty” much more than the historical average and with\nmuch of the uncertainty associated with inflation.2\nIn contrast to policymakers and commentary from businesses and the\neconometric-based U.S. economic uncertainty measure, the other two uncertainty\nmeasures in figure 1—the VIX index, the black line, and the news-based economic policy\nuncertainty measure, the blue line—declined quickly after the onset of the pandemic in\n2020 and have remained relatively subdued since then. One interpretation of the\ndivergence in the measures is that they are capturing different aspects of uncertainty.\nOver the past year or so, the lack of predictability of economic outcomes, as captured by\nthe elevated econometric-based U.S. economic uncertainty measure, did not lead to\nheightened expectations of near-term equity market volatility by market participants or to\na higher frequency of discussions of economic policy uncertainty in the news. This leads\nme to the next topics I want to discuss—namely, what causes uncertainty to increase, and\ndoes it matter that the harder-to-predict outcomes are not correlated, at least for now, with\na higher VIX index?\nWhat causes uncertainty to increase?\nFigure 2 shows the econometric-based U.S. economic uncertainty measure since\n1960, scaled in standard deviations from its mean. The figure illustrates a certainty about\nuncertainty: Uncertainty tends to increase during recessions, the shaded gray areas in the\ngraph. Economic theory offers four mechanisms through which bad events—such as\nrecessions, oil supply disruptions, terrorist attacks, wars, and pandemics—can increase\nuncertainty (Bloom, 2014). First, it is easier to predict the future when “business as\n2 The historical average is computed over the sample period from 1996 to the present.\n\n- 6 -\nusual” prevails in a growing economy (Orlik and Veldkamp, 2022). Forecasting is harder\nduring recessions and when bad events hit the economy. This was especially the case\nduring the pandemic, a once-in-a-century disturbance of worldwide consequence. Some\nhave even argued that the pandemic has caused structural changes that will make it harder\nto predict future economic outcomes. Second, when business is good, firms are trading\nactively, which helps to generate and spread information (Van Nieuwerburgh and\nVeldkamp 2006; Fajgelbaum, Schaal, and Taschereau-Dumouchel, 2017). Bad events\ndisrupt trading activity and the flow of information, and this lack of information increases\nuncertainty. Third, public policy that is unclear, hyperactive, or both may raise\nuncertainty (Pastor and Veronesi, 2013). Fourth, when business is slow, it is cheap to try\nnew ideas and to divert unused resources to research and development; this dynamic\nleads to microeconomic uncertainty, which may in turn lead to macroeconomic\nuncertainty (Bachmann and Moscarini, 2011; D’Erasmo and Moscoso-Boedo, 2011).\nOf these four theoretical mechanisms, the first one strikes me as a highly likely\nexplanation for uncertainty remaining high today. We are still learning about the effects\nof pandemic-specific factors on the economy. Additionally, heightened geopolitical risks\nhave recently contributed to increased uncertainty.3\nIn figure 3, I decompose the econometric-based U.S. economic uncertainty\nmeasure into three subcomponents to investigate which economic outcomes are harder to\npredict since the pandemic and after the increase in geopolitical tensions. The\nsubcomponents are inflation indicators, the black line; labor market conditions, the red\nline; and economic output, the blue line. All three subcomponents rose significantly\n3 See, for example, Caldara and Iacoviello (2022) for a measure of geopolitical risk.\n\n- 7 -\nduring the pandemic but have behaved quite differently since 2021, with inflation\nuncertainty becoming the dominant source of aggregate economic uncertainty, especially\nsince the Russian invasion of Ukraine. A message one could take from this is that,\nthrough the eyes of an econometrician with a rich set of predictors, inflation over the past\ntwo years was objectively difficult to predict.\nThe rise in inflation and inflation uncertainty in the post-COVID era has been a\nglobal phenomenon. The left panel of slide 7, figure 4.1, plots an econometric-based\nforeign economic uncertainty index calculated as the equally weighted average of the\nmeasures of 38 foreign countries. As in the case of the U.S. economic uncertainty index,\nthe foreign index spikes around the Global Financial Crisis and soars around the COVID\npandemic, and it has remained quite elevated since, at around 3 standard deviations from\nits historical mean. The right panel of slide 7, figure 4.2, shows the components of\nforeign economic uncertainty: inflation, the black line; labor, the red line; and output, the\nblue line. Again, as in the U.S., foreign inflation uncertainty has become the dominant\nsource of economic uncertainty.\nWhat effect may uncertainty have on economic outcomes?\nNow that I have established that some measures of economic uncertainty are\nelevated, one may wonder, to what extent does it matter? Economic theory offers at least\ntwo channels for uncertainty to influence growth negatively.4 The first channel comes\nfrom the “real options” literature and the fact that the option value of waiting to make\n4 Economic theory also offers at least two channels for uncertainty to influence growth positively. The\n“growth options” theory argues that uncertainty can encourage investment if it increases the potential prize\n(Bar-Ilan and Strange, 1996). The “Oi-Hartman-Abel” theory after Oi (1961), Hartman (1972), and Abel\n(1983), argues that if firms can expand to exploit good outcomes and contract to insure against bad\noutcomes, they may be risk loving.\n\n- 8 -\ndecisions increases with uncertainty (for example, Bernanke, 1983). According to this\ntheory, it is optimal for firms to not invest and to not hire new employees when\nuncertainty is high. This lack of investment and hiring in turn exacerbates recessions.\nThe second channel comes from the reaction of financial markets to uncertainty.\nInvestors require compensation for higher risk and uncertainty in the form of higher risk\npremia, which manifests in lower equity prices, and higher borrowing costs. In the\npresence of financial constraints, these tighter financial conditions will reduce economic\ngrowth (for example, Christiano, Motto, and Rostagno, 2014). In addition, higher\nuncertainty is often accompanied by higher equity market volatility and illiquidity, which\nin turn exacerbates uncertainty. As I mentioned earlier, the elevated econometric-based\nuncertainty measure this past year has not been accompanied by higher equity market\nvolatility, as measured by the VIX index. This suggests that the economic effects of the\nhigher economic uncertainty may be somewhat mitigated, relative to the more serious\ncase where higher economic uncertainty is accompanied by a higher VIX index\n(Ludvigson, Ma, and Ng, 2021).\nBecause uncertainty can influence growth negatively, policymakers often aim to\nreduce uncertainty about their objectives. One way they attempt to do this is by adopting\na systematic approach to achieving their objectives, as circumstances allow. This point\nleads me to my final topic, the conduct of monetary policy in the presence of uncertainty.\nWhat should policy makers do when uncertainty is high?\nIn 1967, William Brainard argued that uncertainty about the power of monetary\npolicy implied that policy should respond more cautiously to shocks than would be the\ncase if this uncertainty did not exist (Brainard, 1967). Brainard’s attenuation principle is\n\n- 9 -\na classic example of what has come to be known as the Bayesian approach to uncertainty\nand is often cited as the foundation for gradualism in the adjustment of monetary policy:\nCalculate what you think your best policy response is for the economy you observe—and\nthen do less.\nIt is often suggested, however, that the ambiguity aversion approach to\nuncertainty leads to anti-attenuation. That is, in the face of uncertainty over which a\npolicymaker is unwilling or unable to attach prior probabilities, the appropriate response\nis to apply stronger monetary medicine than in the certainty equivalence case. For\nexample, as Chair Powell mentioned in a speech in 2018 that, during crisis periods,\nwords like “we will do whatever it takes” will likely be more effective than “we will take\ncautious steps” (Powell, 2018).\nAdvocates for both approaches have their theoretical justifications. In practice,\nhowever, the best response to uncertainty can be context specific and can vary over time.5\nFortunately, sometimes the context leads to the same conclusion, broadly speaking,\nregardless of the approach. One case of perennial interest to central bankers is inflation\npersistence where both the Bayesian and ambiguity aversion approaches tend to lead to\npolicy that is stronger than the certainty equivalent case to forestall the possibility of\ninflationary forces becoming embedded in inflation expectations.6\n5 See Barlevy (2011) for an accessible survey and Tetlow and von zur Muehlen (2001) for a more technical\ntreatment.\n6 Bernanke (2007) and Powell (2018) highlight this case. Söderstöm (2002) establishes the result for the\nBayesian case. Tetlow (2019) is a simple demonstration of that case alongside the ambiguity aversion case.\nAdam and Woodford (2012) show that uncertainty regarding the data generating process for inflation in the\nNew Keynesian model retains as the optimal policy the same general form as in the standard model but\nwith a more aggressive response to inflation.\n\n- 10 -\nConclusions\nLet me end where I began. Monetary policymakers need to consider what they\ndon’t know in their decisionmaking, along with what they do know. This is not a new\nidea. We have long appreciated that policy decisions under uncertainty should consider a\nrange of possible scenarios about the state, and the structure, of the economy. Economic\nhistory and recent research have sharpened some of the questions, even if they have not\nproduced the easy policy narratives we might prefer. What is clear is that policy\ndecisions taken under uncertainty may look quite different from those that would be\noptimal under certainty, and properly so.\nThe fact that economic agents are uncertain about their environment and must\nlearn about the economy—and policy—means that monetary policy can be a positive\nforce in stabilizing expectations. In my thinking, this prospect serves as a reason for\ncentral banks to strive for predictability and transparency in policy actions and\ncommunications while avoiding the hubris of overrepresenting the state of our\nknowledge.\n\n- 11 -\nReferences\nAbel, Andrew B.

Jefferson\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“How to Get Back on Track: A Policy Conference”\nHoover Institution\nStanford, California\nMay 12, 2023\n\nGood afternoon, everyone. Thank you to the organizers for inviting me to speak.\nIt is a pleasure to be here. I welcome hearing diverse views on how to best conduct\nmonetary policy, and this conference is certainly providing an invigorating debate on that\ntopic.\nBefore I begin, I want to address quickly some news from this morning. I am\ndeeply honored by the trust President Biden and Vice President Harris have shown me\nwith the nomination to be the next Vice Chair of the Board. I am humbled by this\nextraordinary opportunity and thankful to my colleagues, friends, and family for their\nsupport.\nTurning back to the conference, as I join this debate, let me remind you that the\nviews I will express today are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues in\nthe Federal Reserve System.\nIntroduction\nThe title of the conference “How to Get Back on Track: A Policy Conference” is\npotent. Its intent and ambiguity are striking. First, the title presupposes that U.S.\nmonetary policy is currently on the wrong track. Second, the webpage for this\nconference advances a puzzling definition of the phrase “on track.” How so? According\nto the Hoover webpage, “A key goal of the conference is to examine how to get back on\ntrack and, thereby, how to reduce the inflation rate without slowing down economic\ngrowth” (emphasis added).1 As this audience knows, there are macroeconomic models\nthat permit disinflation with no slowdown in economic growth, but the assumptions\n1 See the conference’s webpage at www.hoover.org/events/how-get-back-track-policy-conference.\n\n- 2 -\nunderlying these models are very strong.2 It’s not clear, at least to me, why such a strict\nmetric would be used to assess real-world monetary policymaking. Third, the definition\nof “on track” in the title contrasts with more commonplace definitions such as “achieving\nor doing what is necessary or expected,” as offered by a standard reference such as the\nMerriam-Webster dictionary.3 My view is that this commonplace definition provides a\nmore practical lens through which to assess real-world policymaking.\nAgainst this semantic backdrop, I will begin my remarks with my perspective on\nthe current inflation and economic situation. Then, I will consider credit conditions in\nresponse to the recent bank stress events. Next, I will offer some normative thoughts\nabout strategic monetary policymaking in highly uncertain environments. Finally, I will\nargue that if you are willing to widen your lens to include a more commonplace\ndefinition, then it is possible to conclude that current monetary policy is, in fact, “on\ntrack.”\nCurrent Inflation in the U.S.\nCurrent inflation is still high. Figure 1 illustrates this point. Personal\nconsumption expenditures (PCE) inflation, the black line, stands at 4.2 percent, and core\nPCE inflation, the red line, stands at 4.6 percent for year-end March 2023.\nOverall, news on inflation so far this year has been mixed. The good news is that\nfood and energy prices both fell in March, and total PCE inflation slowed to 4.2 percent\nfrom 5 percent in February. Since peaking last June, inflation has declined about\n2 Estimates of the cost of disinflation depend on the model used to measure it. Classical models, in which\nrational expectations play a dominant role in determining the cost of disinflation, show low cost, while\nKeynesian models, in which slack in the economy is needed to reduce inflation, show high cost. See, for\nexample, Sargent (1982), Croushore (1992), Goodfriend and King (2005), and Tetlow (2022) for a\ncomparison of the cost of disinflation across macroeconomic forecasting models.\n3 See the definition for “track” at https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/on%20track.\n\n- 3 -\n2.75 percentage points—with nearly all the step-down explained by falling energy prices\nand slowing food prices. The bad news is that there has been little progress on core\ninflation.\nTo understand why, I find it useful to separately analyze three large categories\nthat together make up core PCE: goods excluding food and energy, the red line in figure\n2; housing services, the black line; and services excluding housing and energy, the blue\ndashed line. The drivers of inflation in each of these sectors differ somewhat and\nunderstanding the different causes and how they affect the different components can help\npredict the future course of inflation.\nCore goods inflation, the red line in figure 2, has come down since its peak of\n7.6 percent in February 2022, but the most recent news has been discouraging. Outside\nof used motor vehicle prices, which fell unexpectedly in March, disinflation in core\ngoods prices is occurring at a slower pace than expected. Supply and demand imbalances\nin the goods sector seem to be resolving less quickly than expected. Core housing\nservices inflation, the black line in figure 2, surged over the past couple of years as\ndemand in the housing sector underwent a major shift during the pandemic. The latest\nmonthly readings have started to slow, though that is not yet evident in the 12-month\nchanges shown in figure 2. The recent slowing was presaged by a flattening out of rents\non new leases to new tenants since the middle of last year. In contrast, core services\nexcluding housing inflation, the blue dashed line in figure 2, has not shown much sign of\nslowing.\n\n- 4 -\nLabor Market and GDP Growth\nTurning to labor markets, the April 2023 employment report data continue to\npoint to a strong labor market amid improvements in labor supply, with the prime-age\nlabor force participation rate exceeding its pre-pandemic level. Wage growth has\ncontinued to run ahead of the pace consistent with 2 percent inflation and current trends\nin productivity growth. Wage gains are welcome as long as they are consistent with price\nstability. Over the 12 months ended in March 2023, the employment cost index (ECI) for\ntotal hourly compensation for private-sector workers rose 4.8 percent, down only a little\nfrom its peak of 5.5 percent last June.\nDespite strong growth in consumption spending, gross domestic product (GDP)\ngrew modestly at an annual rate of 1.1 percent in the first quarter of 2023 as inventory\ninvestment slowed down substantially, similar to the below-trend pace of growth in 2022.\nLooking ahead, last quarter’s growth in consumer spending seems unsustainable. Indeed,\nafter rising very steeply in January 2023, consumer spending ticked down in February\nand was flat in March. Moreover, I expect slower consumer spending growth over the\nremainder of the year in response to tight financial conditions, depressed consumer\nsentiment, greater uncertainty, and declines in overall household wealth and excess\nsavings.\nRecent Stress in the Banking Sector\nThe tightening in financial conditions we have seen in response to our monetary\npolicy actions is likely to be augmented by the effects on credit conditions from recent\nstrains in the banking sector. The U.S. banking system is sound and resilient. The\nFederal Reserve, working with other agencies, has taken decisive actions to protect the\n\n- 5 -\nU.S. economy. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to expect that recent stress events will lead\nbanks to tighten credit standards further.4 Even though it is too early to tell, my view is\nthat these incremental credit restraints will have a mild retardant effect on economic\ngrowth because the recent bank failures were isolated and addressed swiftly by\naggressive macro- and micro-prudential policy actions.\nNevertheless, I acknowledge that there is significant uncertainty around the\namount of tightening of credit conditions in the coming year in response to the bank\nstress and the magnitude of the effect that tightening might have on the U.S. economy.\nTherefore, there is some downside risk that the incremental effect of the credit shock is\nlarger than I expect.\nMonetary Policymaking and Current Uncertainties\nThe pandemic aftermath, geopolitical instability, and banking-sector stress have\ncontributed to a highly uncertain economic environment. Additionally, the numerous\npost-pandemic “surprises” in inflation, employment, and economic growth suggest that\nthe underlying structure of the U.S. economy may be in flux. More simply, the data-\ngenerating process for the post-pandemic U.S. macroeconomy is less clear.\nDue to the proximity of the pandemic and its unprecedented disruptions of\neconomic and social activity, there are currently insufficient post-pandemic data to\nidentify the parameters and stable relationships that characterize the possible new\nstructure of the economy. Given this observation, what is a reasonable monetary\n4 The April 2023 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS) shows that\nbanks, especially small and midsize banks, reported further tightening in credit standards on loans to\nbusinesses and households over the past three months, following widespread tightening in previous\nquarters. The April 2023 SLOOS is available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/data/sloos/sloos-202304.htm.\n\n- 6 -\npolicymaking strategy? The answer to this question is likely to be different for each\nmonetary policymaker.\nI want to share with you a few strategic principles that are important to me. First,\npolicymakers should be ready to react to a wide range of economic conditions with\nrespect to inflation, unemployment, economic growth, and financial stability. The\nunprecedented pandemic shock is a good reminder that under extraordinary\ncircumstances it will be difficult to formulate precise forecasts in real time. Our dual\nmandate from the Congress is especially helpful here. It provides the foundation for all\nour policy decisions. Second, policymakers should clearly communicate monetary policy\ndecisions to the public. Our commitment to transparency should be evident to the public,\nand monetary policy should be conducted in a way that anchors longer-term inflation\nexpectations. Third—and this is where I am revealing my passion for econometrics—\npolicymakers should continuously update their priors about how the economy works as\nnew data become available. In other words, it is appropriate to change one’s perspective\nas new facts emerge. In this sense, I am in favor of a Bayesian approach to information\nprocessing.\nWhile these principles do not constitute a complete monetary policymaking\nframework, I think they are useful when thinking about features of such frameworks.\nConclusion\nBy way of concluding, I would like to return to the question of whether current\nmonetary policy is “on track” but allow for the wider defining lens of “achieving or doing\nwhat is necessary or expected.” The national unemployment rate was 3.6 percent in\nMarch 2022 when the current monetary policy tightening cycle began. Today, after\n\n- 7 -\n500 basis points of tightening of the policy rate, the national unemployment rate stands at\na near-record low of 3.4 percent. At its recent peak, total PCE inflation was 7 percent in\nJune 2022. Currently, it is 4.2 percent in March 2023. Is inflation still too high? Yes.\nHas the current disinflation been uneven and slower than any of us would like? Yes. But\nmy reading of this evidence is that we are “doing what is necessary or expected” of us.\nFurthermore, monetary policy affects the economy and inflation with long and varied\nlags, and the full effects of our rapid tightening are still likely ahead of us. We are\nbalancing the directives of the dual mandate given to us by the U.S. Congress. This is not\nan easy task in these uncertain times, but I can assure you that I and my colleagues on the\nFOMC take it quite seriously and with great humility. It is in this sense that I believe that\nwe are well “on track.”\nThank you.\n\n- 8 -\nReferences\nCroushore, Dean (1992). “What Are the Costs of Disinflation?” Federal Reserve Bank of\nPhiladelphia, Business Review, May/June, pp. 3–15,\nhttps://www.philadelphiafed.org/-/media/frbp/assets/economy/articles/business-\nreview/1992/brmj92dc.pdf.\nGoodfriend, Marvin, and Robert G.

Jefferson\nVice Chair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\n18th Central Bank Conference on the Microstructure of Financial Markets\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nWashington, D.C.\nOctober 19, 2023\n\nIt is my pleasure to welcome you to the 18th Central Bank Conference on the\nMicrostructure of Financial Markets. This is the first time that this event has been held at the\nFederal Reserve Board, and we are very pleased to host the conference.\nBefore I begin, let me remind you that the views I will express today are my own and are\nnot necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\nOur guests include academics from a number of institutions, both in the U.S. and abroad;\nfellow central bankers, including colleagues from the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, and\nthe Bank for International Settlements; and friends from across the Federal Reserve System and\nfrom several U.S. government agencies, such as the Commodity Futures Trading Commission\n(CFTC), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the U.S. Treasury, including the\nOffice of Financial Research (OFR).\nNow, since this is what you have gathered here to discuss, I do not have to convince this\ngroup of the critical importance of well-functioning financial markets for the economy. In my\ncase, coming as a macroeconomist from the academic world to the Federal Reserve has only\nreinforced that conviction.\nMarket Microstructure Is Important\nCentral bankers, regulators, and market participants ask a lot of financial markets. We\nwant financial markets to be effective and efficient, and to aggregate and reflect all pertinent\ninformation. We rely on these markets to help us gauge how the economy is performing, to help\nus measure market expectations of monetary policy, and even to help us predict how the\neconomy might evolve in the future. We want financial markets to be deep and liquid in good\ntimes, but also to remain deep and resilient when the economy is stressed. We want financial\nmarkets to be fair, so as not to favor certain participants. And central bankers, obviously, rely\n\ncritically on financial markets for the implementation and transmission of monetary policy. As\nwe have broadened our arsenal of policy tools over the past two decades and as markets have\nbecome larger, more complex, and more diverse, I would argue that it has become even more\ncritical for us to understand in detail how financial markets operate.\nEffective and efficient financial markets do not happen automatically. The precise\nstructure of each financial market, its trading rules, the mix of market participants and the\nconstraints they face, how and how fast information is transmitted, all part of the microstructure\nof that market, do make an important difference. I think that fact has now become more widely\nrecognized by economists. But it was not the case just a couple of decades ago, when most\nmacroeconomists almost routinely assumed in their models that financial markets would function\nperfectly in the background. I believe that has changed—witness, for instance, the growth of\nmacrofinance in recent years—and that change has certainly been an improvement.\nA Few Words about the Program and Interagency Work\nNow, let me say a few words about the first financial market this conference will focus\non, the market for U.S. Treasury securities. The U.S. Treasury market clearly remains the largest\nand deepest government securities market in the world. But it has changed a lot. To quote a\nrecent speech by our former Fed colleague Nellie Liang, who is now the Under Secretary for\nDomestic Finance at the Treasury, “The market has changed significantly over time, with\nchanges in technology, participants, and regulations, and Treasury debt outstanding has grown\nsubstantially.”1\nSome episodes of stress in the Treasury market, including a flash event in 2014 and, more\nrecently, the Treasury repo market disruptions of September 2019 and the so-called dash-for-\n1 See Nellie Liang (2022), “Remarks by Under Secretary for Domestic Finance Nellie Liang at the 2022 Treasury\nMarket Conference,” remarks, November 16, https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1110.\n\ncash episode in 2020, have focused the attention of researchers and U.S. government agencies on\nthe plumbing of the market and on the composition and behavior of its participants. For\nexample, an interagency working group, composed of staff from the U.S Treasury, the SEC, the\nCFTC, the New York Fed, and the Board of Governors—several members of the group are\nhere—has been studying a broad range of ideas to enhance the resilience of the market. The U.S.\nTreasury has also spearheaded initiatives to enhance data transparency. And the SEC has sought\ncomments on several proposals that could materially alter the structure of the market.\nThe Federal Reserve does not regulate markets, but we obviously have a special interest\nin the Treasury market, in part because some of our policy tools operate through that market and\nbecause of how important Treasury market functioning is to financial stability. And the recent\ndiscussions on the Treasury market have involved a lot on market microstructure and market\ndesign, including questions such as the following:\n• Is the current intermediation capacity of dealers sufficient given the size of the market?\n• Would an increase in the share of transactions that are centrally cleared help that\nintermediation capacity?\n• Is a decentralized dealer-intermediated market optimal, or could an all-to-all market for\nTreasury securities be more resilient under stress?\n• What are the respective roles of banks and nonbanks in this market?\n• Are the incentives faced by market participants naturally leading the Treasury market to\nbecome more resilient over time? Or would some carefully crafted intervention be\nhelpful?\nAs you can hear, this list of research questions contains a heavy dose of market\nmicrostructure content. Why am I sharing them with you? Just to make my final point: As\n\neconomists focused on market microstructure, what you do is important, and what you do is\nimmediately relevant.\nSo, again, welcome to the Federal Reserve Board. I wish you an excellent conference.",

Jefferson\nVice Chair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nInternational Research Forum on Monetary Policy\nWashington, D.C.\nApril 16, 2024\n\nThank you, Matteo. It is my pleasure to welcome you to the 13th International\nResearch Forum on Monetary Policy. The vibrant discussions you will engage in at this\nconference, and your research more broadly, will help us to understand better the origins\nand implications of uncertainty. I became a member of the Federal Reserve Board just as\nit was grappling with the economic after-effects of the pandemic, a once-in-a-century\ndisturbance of worldwide significance. As a result, I know from firsthand experience that\nunderstanding the main sources of uncertainty and how best to make monetary policy\ndecisions in the presence of uncertainty are crucial to policymaking.\nI will take this opportunity to do a couple of things. First, I will review a few\nhistorical examples of how economic thinking on monetary policymaking in the presence\nof uncertainty has evolved. Second, I will consider lessons learned from these examples\nthat could influence how monetary policymakers think about the policy choices the\nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC) faces currently.1\nThe 1960s to the 1980s\nIn the 1960s, during the heyday of Keynesian macroeconomics, researchers\nwidely believed that monetary policymakers faced a long-run tradeoff between inflation\nand unemployment, and that the tradeoff could be calibrated to keep unemployment\nindefinitely low at an acceptable cost in terms of higher inflation. Improvements in\neconometric modeling abounded, and the harnessing of optimal-control methods\ndeveloped in the field of engineering held out the prospect that business cycle\nfluctuations could be stabilized.\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThere were contrarians, of course, most notably Milton Friedman, who\nhighlighted the necessity of monetary policymakers to consider what they don’t know in\ntheir decisionmaking process (Friedman, 1968). Friedman’s statement that monetary\npolicy works with “long and variable lags” was, among other things, an argument against\npolicymakers trying to fine-tune the level of economic activity. In recognition of\npolicymakers’ limited knowledge of short-run economic relationships, Friedman\nadvocated the use of simple rules for monetary policy, such as the k-percent money\ngrowth rule. He argued that rules that focused on monetary growth and that eschewed\ndirect feedback on macroeconomic variables would work reasonably well, on average,\nand avoid the hubris of fine-tuning policy in a dynamic and uncertain world.\nHistory proved Friedman right in his take on the importance of uncertainty, even\nif his prescription of a k-percent money growth rule fared less well.\nDuring roughly the same period when Friedman authored his famous presidential\naddress to the American Economic Association disputing the purported long-run tradeoff\nbetween inflation and unemployment, William Brainard published an influential paper on\nthe implications of uncertainty. Brainard (1967) argued that uncertainty about the power\nof monetary policy implied that policy should respond more cautiously to shocks than\nwould be the case if this uncertainty did not exist. Brainard’s attenuation principle is a\nclassic example of what is today known as the Bayesian approach to uncertainty.2 The\nBrainard approach to uncertainty consisted of two steps. The first step is to compute the\noptimal policy for a world without uncertainty; that is, the certainty equivalence case.\n2 For example, in 1998, Alan Blinder wrote that the Brainard result was “never far from my mind when I\noccupied the Vice Chairman’s office at the Federal Reserve. In my view . . . a little stodginess at the\ncentral bank is entirely appropriate” (Blinder, 1998, p. 12).\n- 2 -\n\nThe second step is to adjust that policy response to account for the particular uncertainty\nunder study. One strand of research followed these steps through the 1970s and beyond.3\nA parallel strand of research that embraced at least part of the message of Friedman was\nalso under way. It bypassed the optimal policy benchmark altogether, on the grounds that\nuncertainty is pervasive, and sought instead to find simple rules that performed well\nacross a large class of models and for a large range of conditions.\nBrainard’s insight was important. There are many circumstances in which the\nprinciple of gradualism applies, but as I will discuss later, economic research has also\nfound that there are circumstances in which the presence of uncertainty does not warrant\na gradual policy response.\nThe 1990s and 2000s\nJumping ahead to the 1990s, a “new economy” was emerging. The\nunemployment rate was below what many analysts at the time judged to be its natural\nrate, and many FOMC participants and others were forecasting growth above the\neconomy’s potential. Chairman Alan Greenspan, however, suspected that technological\nadvances and other forces were fostering a “new economy” of sustained high productivity\ngrowth that would allow a period of persistently low unemployment without generating\ninflationary pressure. In the absence of hard evidence to the contrary, he was able to\npersuade the FOMC to go along with him by implicitly employing the Bayesian logic of\nBrainard’s attenuation principle with a disarmingly simple suggestion: Let’s just wait\none more meeting and see. Chairman Greenspan repeated this message as inflation fell\n3 An incomplete list of the early contributions includes Prescott (1972), Chow (1976), Craine and Havenner\n(1977), and Kendrick (1982).\n- 3 -\n\nfrom above 2 percent in 1996 to below 2 percent in 1997 and 1998 while the economy\nadded 9.3 million jobs, and the FOMC raised the federal funds rate just once.4\nAround the same time, there was an explosion of interest in simple policy rules\nfor monetary policy, beginning, in most people’s reckoning, with the rule John Taylor\n(1993) published in the early 1990s. These simple feedback rules, which specify how\ncentral banks’ policy instrument would respond to the state of the economy, differed from\ntheir predecessors by replacing monetary aggregates as the instrument of monetary policy\nwith a short-term policy interest rate. This research embraced the message that restricting\nfeedback to a small number of key macroeconomic variables would result in more robust\noutcomes than adhering to the prescriptions of, say, optimal-control policies, which in\nessence imposed feedback on all aspects of these models.5 Whether much of the\nrobustness gains of simple rules can be realized when central banks only use such rules as\n“guides” for monetary policy is a topic worthy of further research.6\n4 The estimate of 9.3 million jobs uses total nonfarm seasonally adjusted numbers from the St. Louis Fed\nFRED database (https://fred.stlouisfed.org; PAYEMS series) and takes the difference between the\nDecember 1998 and January 1996 numbers.\n5 Optimal-control policies are optimal conditional on the structure of the model to which they are applied.\nProvided the model is a reliable approximation of the true economy, and policymakers’ preferences are\ncorrectly specified, the policy prescriptions derived from optimal-control exercises are, by definition, the\nbest that can be achieved. However, the underlying assumptions are stringent in many applications. There\nis also a literature on risk-adjusted optimal control dating back at least to Whittle (1981). See Taylor and\nWilliams (2010) and references therein for a detailed argument on the efficacy of simple rules as hedges\nagainst model misspecification. Svensson (2003) is a critique of the use of all simple monetary policy\nrules—sometimes referred to as instrument rules—as opposed to what are called targeting rules.\nIn a 2012 speech, then Vice Chair Janet Yellen observed, “In evaluating the stance of policy, I find the\nprescriptions from simple policy rules a logical starting point” (Yellen, 2012). She went on to argue that\nsimple rules “by no means deserve the ‘last word’” on guidance for monetary policy, in part because they\ndo not fully account for factors that might be idiosyncratic, such as risk-management concerns. That\nspeech introduced the Fed’s optimal-control simulations to the public as an alternative source of guidance\nfor monetary policy that could be used alongside that of simple monetary policy rules, together with\njudgment. Since 2017, the Monetary Policy Report has discussed simple monetary policy rules and their\nlimitations.\n6 Nikolosko-Rzhevskyy, Papell, and Prodan (2014), among others, explore this question.\n- 4 -\n\nThe claimed robustness of simple rules across a set of fixed models is arguably\nonly part of their appeal. Another part is the notion that their parsimony presumably\nmakes simple rules relatively easy for households, businesses, and financial market\nparticipants to learn. One useful finding was that gradualism in policy setting, in the\nform of a sizable weight on the lagged policy rate in the policy rule, is helpful for\nfacilitating learnability.7 In any event, the literature on learning in macroeconomics\nextended the dimension of uncertainty for monetary policymakers from the cross section\nof candidate models to the time dimension of any given model.\nThe bulk of the early literature assumed private-sector decisionmakers were\nknowledgeable, rational agents, while policymakers lacked detailed knowledge of the\nstructure of the economy. The assumed imbalance of information and knowledge was\nstriking. It was usually assumed, sometimes only implicitly, that private agents\nunderstood not only the economic environment in which they operated, but also the\npolicy regime that was in place. Considering this background, some more recent\ncontributions explored two related departures from the assumption of a fixed model with\nuncertain parameters: time-variation in the true (population) model, and private agents\nlearning about the economy.\nAs I just observed, the rational expectations paradigm presupposes that economic\nagents have a great deal of knowledge about their environment, but policymakers do not\nknow the true (population) parameters of the models they use. Instead, they must use\n7 By “learnable” I mean in the sense that least-squares learning would converge, in the limit, on rational\nexpectations equilibrium. See Evans and Honkapohja (2001) for a textbook treatment of learning in\nmacroeconomics. Bullard and Mitra (2002) established the benefits of inertia in monetary policy for\nmaking a wider set of models “E-stable,” meaning the process of least-squares learning leads to a unique\nand stable equilibrium. Tetlow and von zur Muehlen (2009) broadened that conclusion to a wider set of\nlearning rules.\n- 5 -\n\nestimates of those parameters. As Sargent (1993) noted, it makes sense to assume that\nthe decisionmakers within the models that policymakers employ are no more\nsophisticated than the econometricians who estimate them. Doing so means accepting\nthat the true (population) parameters of one’s model could be time varying—the outcome\nof the interplay between shocks, uncertainty, learning, and policy. That realization\nchanges the way you think about monetary policy.\nHow might this matter? Let me give you one example. As many of you know,\neconometricians have found sizable declines in recent decades in the response of inflation\nto the unemployment rate.8 Taken at face value, these declines in the slope of the Phillips\ncurve have important implications for the optimal conduct of monetary policy. But what\nshould policymakers take from such econometric results? Some researchers argue that\nthe apparent decline in the response to slack in the Phillips curve could be a manifestation\nof the improved control of inflation by the central bank.9 That is, policymakers could be\n“victims of their own success” in the sense that good performance in controlling inflation\nover the Great Moderation period may have weakened the information content of the\ndata.\nNow, take this notion a step further, as a strand of the literature does, and\nsuppose that private agents within our models are themselves skeptical—that is, that they\nhave doubts about their methods for formulating expectations and making decisions, and\nthat they act accordingly. Economists now have new means of modeling uncertainty both\nwithin a given model and across a set of rival models. These methods draw on theories\n8 See, for example, Stock and Watson (2021) for time-series evidence and Smith, Timmermann, and Wright\n(2023) for panel data results.\n9 See, for example, Bullard (2018) for a demonstration and McLeay and Tenreyo (2019) for a detailed\nargument along these lines.\n- 6 -\n\nof ambiguity aversion.10 Under ambiguity aversion, agents are particularly concerned\nabout types of uncertainties that do not lend themselves to being represented in terms of\nprobabilities. Agents’ choices are motivated, in part, by an incentive to minimize the\nadverse consequences of these types of uncertainties. The ambiguity aversion approach\nto uncertainty suggests that to protect against uncertainty over which a policymaker is\nunwilling or unable to attach prior probabilities, the appropriate response is often anti-\nattenuation; that is, policy should apply stronger monetary medicine than in the certainty\nequivalence case.\nFor the reasons I have outlined, there are circumstances when uncertainty might\nappropriately induce a gradual response and other circumstances when a nongradual\nresponse to uncertainty may be justified. Furthermore, under either the Bayesian\napproach or the ambiguity aversion approach, the best response to uncertainty is context\nspecific and can vary over time.11 Sometimes the context leads to the same conclusion,\nbroadly speaking, regardless of the approach. One case of perennial interest to central\nbankers is inflation persistence where the Bayesian approach, the ambiguity aversion\napproach, and its close cousin, robust control, all tend to lead to policy that is stronger\nthan the certainty equivalent case to forestall the possibility of inflationary forces\nbecoming embedded in inflation expectations.12 Another case is that of crisis periods.\n10 The literature on robust control in economics (for example, Hansen and Sargent, 2008) began with the\nnormative case of how policymakers might address their doubts. The literature on ambiguity aversion (for\nexample, Epstein and Schneider, 2003) had agents within models confront their doubts in making\ndecisions. Works at the intersection of these two strands of the literature expand the concept of uncertainty\n(in the sense of Knight, 1921) in a micro-founded manner and relax the rational expectations hypothesis in\na disciplined way. See, for example, Hansen and Sargent (2021).\n11 See Barlevy (2011) for an accessible survey and Tetlow and von zur Muehlen (2001) for a more\ntechnical treatment.\n12 Söderstöm (2002) establishes the result for the Bayesian case. Tetlow (2019) is a simple demonstration\nof that case alongside an ambiguity aversion case. With uncertain inflation persistence, the Bayesian and\n- 7 -\n\nThe Global Financial Crisis\nTake, for example, the Global Financial Crisis of 2008. During this period, the\ntension between caution, on the one hand, and vigorous action, on the other, as a way to\nconduct monetary policy in the face of uncertainty was evident. In September 2007, the\nFOMC decided to lower its target for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points to\n“forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that might otherwise arise\nfrom the disruptions in financial markets” and noted that “developments in financial\nmarkets since the Committee’s last regular meeting have increased the uncertainty\nsurrounding the economic outlook.”13 In subsequent meetings, the FOMC gradually\nlowered its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points and, in January 2008,\ndecided to quicken its pace by lowering the target by 75 basis points in an unscheduled\nmeeting and by 50 basis points, 75 basis points, and 25 basis points in subsequent\nmeetings. Inflation, however, was rising over that period. By June 2008, it was well\nover 2 percent and still increasing, and the FOMC paused its rate cutting. It was a\ndecision that weighed the upside risks to inflation and inflation expectations with the\ndownside risks to economic growth.14 In September 2008, the circumstances changed\nambiguity aversion approaches lead to a policy that is stronger than the certainty equivalent case because a\nsymmetric distribution for inflation persistence results in asymmetric (downward-skewed) distributions for\neconomic outcomes when evaluated for the certainty equivalent policy. Adam and Woodford (2012) show\nthat uncertainty regarding the data generating process for inflation in the New Keynesian model retains as\nthe optimal policy the same general form as in the standard model but with a more aggressive response to\ninflation.\n13 See paragraphs 2 and 4 of the September 2007 FOMC statement, which is available on the Federal\nReserve Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.\n14 See paragraph 4 of the June 2008 FOMC statement, which, in explaining the FOMC’s decision to keep\nits target for the federal funds rate at 2 percent at that meeting, noted, “Although downside risks to growth\nremain, they appear to have diminished somewhat, and the upside risks to inflation and inflation\nexpectations have increased.” See also the minutes of the June 24–25, 2008, FOMC Meeting, in particular\nthe summary of the Committee’s discussion on downside risks to growth and upside risks to inflation on\npages 7 and 8. Both documents are available on the Federal Reserve Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.\n- 8 -\n\nprecipitously, as did the FOMC’s approach to policy. The Committee quickly cut the\nfederal funds rate effectively to zero and took extraordinary steps to stabilize the financial\nsystem and support the economy. The motivation to respond assertively to the emerging\ncrisis, and the uncertainty surrounding it, was no doubt accentuated by the knowledge\nthat future policy actions might be circumscribed by a lengthy spell of the funds rate at its\nlower bound, which would magnify losses associated with adverse outcomes.15 My\nconclusion, as Chair Powell mentioned in a speech in 2018, is that during crisis periods,\nwords like “we will do whatever it takes” will likely be more effective than “we will take\ncautious steps.”16\nLessons Learned\nSome clear lessons flow from the history that I have summarized. First, when\nuncertainty is high, policymakers should sometimes act quickly and should sometimes act\ncautiously. The right action depends on the circumstances. Second, while simple\nmonetary policy rules are appealing for several reasons, rigid adherence to the\nprescriptions of simple rules is unwarranted. Historically, policymakers have only used\nrules as “guides” or benchmarks in setting policy, and there are good reasons for this. It\nis clearly beneficial to look at the totality of the data to identify changes in the economy\nin real time, to embrace the risk-management considerations associated with uncertainty\nthat factor into FOMC decisions, and to adapt policy to the evolution of the economy.\nThird, in the presence of a high degree of uncertainly, policymakers benefit from a\n15 The literature on the implications of the effective lower bound on nominal interest rates for the conduct\non monetary policy is large and includes Reifschneider and Williams (2000).\n16 See Powell (2018).\n- 9 -\n\nhealthy dose of humility. There are limits to what we know about the economy,\nespecially after periods of economic upheaval such as a pandemic.\nCurrent Situation\nReflecting on the situation we are facing today, over the past year, inflation has\ncome down significantly but is still running above the FOMC’s 2 percent goal. In March,\nheadline personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation was 2.7 percent over the\npast 12 months based on the Federal Reserve’s staff estimates. A year earlier, it was 4.4\npercent. Core PCE inflation, which excludes the volatile food and energy components,\nstood at 2.8 percent; a year ago, it was 4.8 percent. While we have seen considerable\nprogress in lowering inflation, the job of sustainably restoring 2 percent inflation is not\nyet done.\nReal GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2023 was 3.4 percent, and I expect first-\nquarter economic growth to slow down but remain solid as indicated by the solid growth\nin retail sales in March and February. Recent readings on both job gains and inflation\nhave come in higher than expected. The economy added an average of 276,000 nonfarm\njobs per month in the three months through March, a faster pace than we have seen since\nlast March. And the inflation data over the past three months were above the low\nreadings in the second half of last year.\nMy baseline outlook continues to be that inflation will decline further, with the\npolicy rate held steady at its current level, and that the labor market will remain strong,\nwith labor demand and supply continuing to rebalance. Of course, the outlook is still\nquite uncertain, and if incoming data suggest that inflation is more persistent than I\n- 10 -\n\ncurrently expect it to be, it will be appropriate to hold in place the current restrictive\nstance of policy for longer. I am fully committed to getting inflation back to 2 percent.\nConclusion\nI would like to conclude by saying that in this environment of heightened\nuncertainty, it is increasingly important to comprehend what is driving uncertainty and\nhow monetary policy might play a role in limiting the negative impact of uncertainty on\nbusinesses, households, and financial markets. Many of you in this audience have\ndevoted a considerable amount of time to understanding the intricate link between\nuncertainty and economic outcomes. Your work has enriched our collective knowledge\nand has been instrumental in helping us policymakers understand the complexities of our\ndecisions.

    "text": "For release on delivery\n10:15 a.m. EST\nFebruary 24, 2023\nDiscussion of the Paper “Managing Disinflations”\nby Stephen G. Cecchetti, Michael E. Feroli, Peter Hooper,\nFrederic S. Mishkin, and Kermit L. Schoenholtz\nRemarks by\nPhilip N. Jefferson\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nU.S. Monetary Policy Forum\nNew York, New York\nFebruary 24, 2023\n\nThank you very much for inviting me to discuss this paper. It is a timely review\nfor central bankers charged with lowering inflation to targets or, in the terminology of the\nauthors, managing disinflation. I really enjoyed reading it. Before I begin, let me remind\nyou that the views I will express today are my own and not necessarily those of the\nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System.\nMy discussion time is limited. Therefore, I’ll be selective. I will begin by briefly\ndescribing what the paper is about. Then, I will summarize the authors’ takeaways from\ntheir analysis. Next, I will share my takeaways. Finally, I will offer some concluding\nremarks.\nSo what is this paper about? Conceptually, the paper can be divided into three\nparts. In the first part, the authors review historical disinflationary episodes in the United\nStates and other countries to see what lessons we might learn from past experience.\nIn the second part, the authors present a simple, tractable model that relates\ninterest rates, inflation, inflation expectations, and slack in the labor market. They use\nthe model to make predictions about future inflation.\nIn the third part, the authors provide advice to monetary policymakers on how to\naddress the current situation; that is, how to manage disinflation.\nWith that, let me cut to consideration of the authors’ takeaways.\nThe authors’ first takeaway, based on past disinflation episodes in the United\nStates and abroad, is that policymakers should expect that disinflation will be costly in\nterms of foregone output or employment. They find that all 16 of the large policy-\ninduced disinflations in the four advanced economies they study were associated with a\n\n- 2 -\nrecession.1 As the paper makes clear, however, a good measure of judgment comes into\nthe exercise of identifying and quantifying disinflationary episodes. History is replete\nwith confounding factors that make parsing difficult. These factors include supply\nshocks, labor market structure, economic conditions at the start of the disinflationary\nepisode, how “well anchored” are inflation expectations, and the speed at which a\ndisinflation is carried out. Even so, the authors are thorough in what they do. And while\none may quibble with bits and pieces, their argument that policymakers should accept\nthat disinflation is likely to be costly is well reasoned.\nThe authors’ second takeaway from history is that state dependencies or\nnonlinearities are also in play. The state dependency they note is that a higher initial\ninflation rate is associated with a lower sacrifice ratio. To explain this finding, they\nadvance an argument based on policy credibility. Specifically, they argue that a high\ninitial inflation rate enhances the plausibility of central banks’ willingness to incur the\ncost of reducing inflation. That strikes me as plausible on its face, but there are other\nstories that may also apply. In the interest of brevity, let me point out just one. Central\nbankers are constantly warning of combatting inflationary shocks before those forces\nbecome embedded in inflation expectations.2 The Volcker disinflation of 1981–82\n1 They draw this conclusion by replicating some of the methodology from the literature on sacrifice ratios.\nSee, for example, Ball (1994) and Tetlow (2022) and references therein.\n2 For example, Chair Powell, in testimony before the U.S. Senate, said, “We will use our tools to support\nthe economy and a strong labor market and to prevent higher inflation from becoming entrenched” (Powell,\n2022a). This reasoning has a lengthy history, as evidenced by remarks in 2008 by then Vice Chair of the\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System Donald Kohn: “As demonstrated by historical\nexperiences around the world and in the United States during the 1970s and 1980s, efforts to bring inflation\nand inflation expectations back to desirable levels after they have risen appreciably involve costly and\nundesirable changes in resource utilization” (Kohn, 2008). And the sentiment is shared internationally, as\nremarks by Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem attest: “If we don’t do enough [policy tightening],\nCanadians will continue to endure the hardship of high inflation. And they will come to expect persistently\nhigh inflation, which will require much higher interest rates and, potentially, a severe recession to control\ninflation. Nobody wants that” (Macklem, 2022).\n\n- 3 -\nresulted in a painful recession. But the reduction in inflation was large. Thus, measured\nin terms of percentage points of inflation reduction, as is conventionally done, it was not\nparticularly costly.3 A plausible, if partial, explanation for this finding is that the Volcker\ndisinflation was carried out before the inflation associated with the second OPEC oil\nprice shock had become entrenched in inflation expectations and more generally at a time\nwhen inflation expectations were fluid.4 This is relevant as my colleagues on the FOMC\nand I strive to bring down actual inflation promptly in order to preserve the “well\nanchored” longer-term inflation expectations we see in the data. It is also consistent with\nthe authors’ argument that swift and relatively painless disinflations of the past were due\nto early and sharp policy interest rate increases.\nThe authors’ third takeaway from history is that easing monetary policy before the\ndisinflation is complete, or easing by too much, is costly.5 My reading of this claim is\nthat while central bankers might entertain hopes that they will directly see a dividend\nfrom early, forceful policy actions, historical experience suggests that they should not\ncount on such a favorable outcome.\nAnd, finally, they argue that policy needs to look ahead and act preemptively.\nWhile the authors do not present evidence to support this claim, it is an argument with\nwhich policymakers nearly always agree, in principle, but find difficult to execute, in\npractice. As I’ll discuss in a minute, choosing the appropriate stance of monetary policy,\n3 Converting the unemployment sacrifice ratio in Ball (1994) into output space using an Okun coefficient of\ntwo renders an output sacrifice ratio of just 1.8, a small number by historical standards. For a summary of\nsacrifice ratios in history, see Tetlow (2022) and Cecchetti and others (2023).\n4 This may be related to the authors’ second conjecture on why initially high levels of inflation are\nassociated with lower sacrifice ratios—namely, that high inflation is associated with large global supply\nshocks (Cecchetti and others, 2023, p. 18). It is analytically distinct, however, in that they do not\nemphasize the timely monetary policy response to those shocks.\n5 This point is elaborated upon in Chair Powell’s 2022 Jackson Hole speech; see Powell (2022b).\n\n- 4 -\nin real time, to influence expected future economic conditions is a difficult task in the\nbest of circumstances. It is all that much more difficult when the economy is\nexperiencing a once-in-a-century disturbance of worldwide significance.\nAs you have already heard, the authors outline a very simple model that relates\ninterest rates, slack in the economy, inflation, and inflation expectations. They use this\nmodel to forecast inflation in the year 2021 and evaluate the model’s predictive\nperformance, employing alternative measures of slack, linear and nonlinear relationships,\nand different sample periods. Interestingly, the various measures of slack, and\nspecifications for slack, make little difference. The models do a little better when you\nallow them to see data from the era of high and volatile inflation in the 1960s and ’70s\ninstead of restricting consideration to the Great Moderation period, as empirical tests for\nstructural breaks would surely have suggested.6 Two key and related reasons for this\nimprovement are that inflation expectations in the 1960s and 1970s were more persistent\nand that the slope of the empirical Phillips curve was steeper than during recent history.\nThe authors’ policy takeaways fall into two classes. First, there are the\nconclusions that pertain to the current situation. They suggest that the unusually large\nand rapid tightening in policy in 2022 was good policy. In particular, the authors\ncontend, on page 19, that “the apparent anchoring of long-term [inflation] expectations\nmay reflect in part the FOMC’s unanticipated shift toward aggressive rate hikes.” In\naddition, despite the rapid tightening to date, the authors contend that additional monetary\n6 The borderline, as it were, between the inflationary era that the authors argue is critical for obtaining\nplausible results in their conditional forecasting exercise and the Great Moderation period is the Volcker\ndisinflation of 1981–82. Sims and Zha (2006) argue that the Volcker disinflation is the only regime shift\nthat can be unequivocally shown to be present in the data over the postwar period in their sample.\n\n- 5 -\npolicy tightening is likely to prove necessary to achieve 2 percent inflation by 2025 and is\nlikely to lead to a mild recession.\nSecond, there are the more general takeaways. The authors favor aggressive\nmonetary policy tightening—or preemption—over gradualism. And they argue that the\ncosts of increasing the target rate of inflation outweigh the benefits because the loss of\ncredibility from showing a lack of resolve to achieve 2 percent inflation will persist.\nNow, let me share my takeaways. First, figure 4.1 in the paper demonstrates that,\nstanding at the end of 2020, it would have been difficult to forecast the increase in\ninflation we observed in 2021 and 2022: The out-of-sample forecasts are far below the\nactual. This result stands despite the authors having benefited from knowledge of how\neconomic forces played out that would not have been available in real time. Here, I\nemphasize the unprecedented nature of the pandemic, with its wide-reaching economic\neffects and comingling of economic and public health policies. It’s just very difficult to\nformulate forecasts and implement preemptive monetary policy in real time, especially\nunder such extraordinary circumstances.\nA corollary, of sorts, of this observation is that the idiosyncratic nature of the\npandemic implies that economic models, while still useful in many respects, are going to\nhave limited applicability. Taken at face value, the model assumes, as all models do, that\nthe past tells policymakers what they need to know. But current inflation dynamics are\nbeing driven by some pandemic-specific factors not seen in the historical data. It follows\nthat policymakers need to look at a broader range of factors to understand recent inflation\ndynamics.\n\n- 6 -\nLet me illustrate this point by considering three large categories that make up core\npersonal consumption expenditures inflation. These are core goods inflation, housing\nservices inflation, and inflation in core services excluding housing. It’s useful to look at\nthese three categories separately because the driving forces behind each differ. Some of\nthese forces are pandemic specific, and understanding the different causes should help us\npredict what will happen to inflation going forward.\nFocusing on the price of core goods, the black line in the chart, you can see how\ngoods prices started climbing in the second half of 2020 and rose sharply in 2021 as the\npandemic-driven disruptions to social interactions induced a rapid shift in demand from\nservices to goods, exacerbating snags in global supply chains. By the end of 2021, once\nvaccines were developed and deployed and people slowly emerged from isolation, the\nshift in demand back to services began, and supply chain bottlenecks started to ease.\nThus, inflation in this category came down substantially over the course of 2022. The\nstrengthening of the overall economy may have played a role in core goods price\ninflation, but it was likely secondary to the roles played by goods-specific demand and by\nthe production and distribution network for goods over this period. In contrast, housing\nservices inflation, the blue line in the chart, picked up appreciably in 2022 after having\nsoftened early in the pandemic. Inflation in this sector is also driven by certain\npandemic-specific factors. In particular, the surge in work from home led to an abrupt\nincrease in the demand for bigger homes located in smaller metro areas or further from\ncity centers. House prices and rents increased significantly. We have not seen a decline\nin housing services inflation yet, but recent data on new leases and lease renewals\nindicate that we soon will. Lastly, we have inflation in other core services, the red line in\n\n- 7 -\nthe graph, a large category that covers activities as varied as travel and recreation, and\nmedical and legal services. Inflation for these services, most of which are labor\nintensive, has remained stubbornly high. An important source of inflation pressures in\nthis category has likely been the shortage of workers, which has pushed up labor costs at\nrates above those consistent with 2 percent inflation. The inflation outlook for this\nnonhousing category of core services will likely depend in large part on whether labor\ndemand moves into better balance with labor supply and growth in nominal labor costs.\nRecent data suggest that labor compensation has indeed started to decelerate somewhat\nover the past year but is still running too high to be consistent with returning inflation to\n2 percent in a timely and sustainable fashion. The point is that the inflationary forces\nimpinging on the U.S. economy at present represent a complex mixture of temporary and\nmore long-lasting elements that defy simple, parsimonious explanation.\nThe ongoing imbalance between the supply and demand for labor, combined with\nthe large share of labor costs in the services sector, suggests that high inflation may come\ndown only slowly. The paper notes the role of central bank credibility in managing\ndisinflations, but I do not attribute the persistence in inflation to a lack of Fed credibility.\nIndeed, there is evidence in support of central bank credibility, including that long-term\ninflation expectations are not far from the FOMC’s 2 percent target.\nLet me conclude with a summary of my takeaways.\nHistory is useful, but it can only tell us so much, particularly in situations without\nhistorical precedent.\nThe current situation is different from past episodes in at least four ways. First,\nthe pandemic created unprecedented disruptions to global supply chains. Second, the\n\n- 8 -\npandemic is having a long-lasting effect on labor force participation rates. Third, the\ncredibility of the central bank is higher now than it was in the 1960s and 1970s. Fourth\nand most importantly, unlike in the late 1960s and 1970s, the Federal Reserve is\naddressing the outbreak in inflation promptly and forcefully to maintain that credibility\nand to preserve the “well anchored” property of long-term inflation expectations.\nFinally, economic models are important tools but need to be used with careful\ninterpretation and judgment when history does not speak to the current situation. Sound\ndecisionmaking requires that their findings be complemented with additional analytical\ntools, including careful scrutiny of real-time data.\nThank you!\n\n- 9 -\nReferences\nBall, Laurence (1994). “What Determines the Sacrifice Ratio?” in N.
