Clarida\nVice Chair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“The Euro Area: Staying the Course through Uncertainties”\nBDF Symposium and 34th SUERF Colloquium\nsponsored by\nBanque de France and the European Money and Finance Forum\nParis, France\nMarch 28, 2019\n\nGood afternoon. It is a pleasure to be here at the Banque de France and take part\nin this important symposium on the “Euro Area: Staying the Course through\nUncertainties.”1\nBoth in the financial press and in international policy circles, one hears a great\ndeal about the spillovers of U.S. monetary policy to other economies. One hears\nsomewhat less, though, about how global shocks affect the U.S. economy.2 So, in my\nremarks today, I will discuss how the U.S. economy’s increasing integration with the rest\nof the world has made it more exposed to foreign shocks, and I will focus in particular on\nthe channels of transmission through which these shocks operate. I will close with a few\nwords on current prospects, in which global crosscurrents are again posing challenges for\nthe U.S. economy and monetary policy.\nGreater Integration between the United States and the Rest of the World\nThe U.S. economy’s integration with the rest of the world, both in terms of trade\nand finance, has risen substantially over the past 60 years. Since the 1960s, both U.S.\nexports and imports have about tripled as a share of gross domestic product (GDP), with\ntheir sum now about 30 percent of GDP--still relatively small by international standards,\nbut certainly notable.\nFinancial linkages have grown enormously as well. The United States has had\nopen capital markets for a long time, but the sum of U.S. external assets and liabilities\n1 The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of other Federal Reserve Board members or\nFederal Open Market Committee participants. I am grateful to Shaghil Ahmed of the Federal Reserve\nBoard staff for his assistance in preparing this text.\n2 A recent exception is Ferrara and Teuf (2018), who construct an international environment indicator,\nbased on a textual analysis of Federal Open Market Committee minutes, and examine the connection\nbetween this indicator and U.S. monetary policy.\n\n- 2 -\nhas grown from about 25 percent of GDP in 1960 to more than 300 percent today. And,\nreflecting the greater integration of global financial markets, the correlation of U.S. and\nforeign equity and bond markets has trended broadly upward for several decades.3\nChannels of Transmission of Global Shocks to the U.S. Economy\nThis increased integration I have described has heightened the exposure of the\nU.S. economy to external shocks. But what are the channels of transmission of these\nshocks to the United States?\nFor concreteness, let us consider the case of a negative demand shock originating\nabroad, such as a foreign recession. First, this shock affects the United States through\ndirect trade links, lowering demand for U.S. exports and, thus, lowering U.S. GDP.\nSecond, the foreign recession leads to lower interest rates abroad and, other things\nbeing equal, raises the value of the dollar, which in turn lowers U.S. exports and boosts\nU.S. imports. The dollar appreciation also puts downward pressure on U.S. import prices\nand, thereby, inflation. The extent to which foreign worries lead to safe-haven flows may\nadd to the dollar’s strength.\nFinally, there is contagion to U.S financial markets. Let me first elaborate on the\nexchange rate channel I just mentioned. The traditional determinants of exchange rates--\nthat is, differentials in expected rates of return--apply to the United States as to other\ncountries. But the U.S. economy is different because of the special role of U.S.\ngovernment bonds as global safe assets. As a consequence, an adverse foreign shock that\ndamped the demand for risky assets would be expected to trigger safe-haven flows that\n3 Among others, Kohn (2008) documents the increase in recent decades of U.S. trade links with the rest of\nthe world, including through internationally integrated production as well as the increased financial\nlinkages of the United States with the rest of the world.\n\n- 3 -\nboost the dollar, weighing on the U.S. economy.4 The spillover of risk aversion to U.S.\nmarkets might well also push down equity prices and widen corporate credit spreads,\nadding to the contractionary pressures. However, the same safe-haven flows into\nTreasury securities would cause U.S. long-term yields to fall, mitigating these adverse\neffects on domestic demand and activity.5\nHistorical Experience\nLet us consider some historical examples of the effect of adverse foreign shocks\non the U.S. economy. The Mexican peso crisis of 1994 and ’95 and the Asian financial\ncrisis of 1997 through ’98 resulted in substantial hits to aggregate emerging market\neconomy (EME) growth, but they had fairly muted effects on U.S. growth.6 In part, this\nlimited response in previous decades reflected the smaller share of the EMEs in the\nglobal economy and, as a related matter, in U.S. trade. Furthermore, the weight of EMEs\nin the global financial system was lighter in previous decades, so their crises were less\ndisruptive to global markets.7 Finally, even back then, the safe-haven flows into dollar\n4 Other countries that are also recipients of safe-haven flows include Japan and Switzerland.\n5 An additional channel I have abstracted from here is that of commodity prices, which often move\nsignificantly in response to foreign factors. Since the United States is both a large exporter of some\ncommodities and a large importer of some other commodities, the overall implications for U.S. activity are\nlikely to be mixed. In particular, the effects of oil prices on the U.S. economy have been quite extensively\nstudied. For example, Kilian (2008) and Kilian and Vigfusson (2017) present evidence on how increases in\noil prices have historically adversely affected U.S. economic performance, as the United States is a net\nimporter of oil. More recently, as outlined in Board of Governors (2018, pp. 16-17), with the net oil import\nshare trending lower in the United States, the drag on U.S. GDP from higher oil prices has likely declined.\n6 Most studies discussing contagion effects of the Mexican peso crisis focus on effects on other Latin\nAmerican countries and do not highlight effects on U.S. growth. Studies on the effects of the Asian\nfinancial crisis on U.S. activity generally find from modest adverse to even slightly positive effects (see, for\nexample, Duca, Gould, and Taylor, 1998; Harrigan, 2000; and van Wincoop and Yi, 2000). Duca, Gould,\nand Taylor (1998) called the effect on the United States “more of a swell rather than a tsunami” (p. 1). One\nstudy, Pollard and Coughlin (1999), found significant negative effects of the Asian crisis on U.S. exports in\ncertain industries, but it also concluded that this effect did not translate into much of an effect on industry\noutputs.\n7 Support provided by the official international financial community also helped mute global market\ndisruptions during these EME crises.\n\n- 4 -\nassets that I highlighted earlier were an important mitigating factor, pushing down U.S.\nlong-term yields. To be sure, the Russian default of August 1998, followed by the\ncollapse of Long-Term Capital Management, had more-substantial effects on global\nmarkets and posed greater risk to the U.S. economy, which triggered a policy response by\nthe Fed in which the federal funds rate was cut 75 basis points between September and\nNovember of that year.8 Of note, after economic prospects appeared to stabilize, the Fed\nreversed those cuts in 1999.\nIn recent times, global shocks have also been consequential for U.S. economic\nprospects and monetary policy. Examples include the 2011-13 euro-zone recession and\nthe China devaluation and capital flight episode of 2015 and ’16, when worries about a\nhard landing and renminbi depreciation, respectively, roiled world markets. Both of\nthese shocks originated in economies with large footprints in the global economy and\nfinancial system, and, as a result, they induced substantial disruptions in global financial\nmarkets. During both episodes, U.S. stock markets fell and the dollar appreciated,\nespecially during 2015 and 2016. As ever, these negative shocks were associated with\nsafe-haven flows that pushed U.S. Treasury yields down.9 Despite the drop in yields,\noverall financial conditions in the United States tightened, weighing on aggregate\ndemand.10\n8 Dell’Ariccia, Zettelmeyer, and Schnabel (2002) argue that the more-substantial response of global\nfinancial markets to the Russian default was because investors were expecting Russia to be rescued from\nhaving to default by the International Monetary Fund, and there was a global retreat from risk when that did\nnot happen.\n9 Media commentary from 2015 and 2016 is replete with descriptions of the rout in global financial markets\nresulting from financial turbulence in China. See, for example, Economist (2015).\n10 In May 2012, I gave an interview at the Council on Foreign Relations highlighting the potential risks to\nthe fragile U.S. economic recovery posed by the euro-zone sovereign debt crisis; see Clarida (2012).\n\n- 5 -\nYet, in these episodes, accommodative policy responses in the United States\nhelped ward off actual contractions of U.S. activity. During the 2011-13 euro-zone\nrecession, the United States was already pursuing very accommodative policies in the\nwake of the Global Financial Crisis, but the timing of the maturity extension program and\nthe third phase of U.S. quantitative easing suggests they were helpful responses to the\nspillovers to the United States from this downturn.11 For the China episode of 2015 and\n’16, Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) statements from the time indicate that\nconcerns about foreign developments and their effect on U.S. financial conditions were a\nfactor contributing to the delay in previously anticipated policy rate increases, thereby\nsupporting the economy.\nThe message from these recent episodes is not just about the importance of timely\npolicy adjustments by the central bank. It is also about the importance of the enhanced\nresilience of financial institutions that has been achieved since the Global Financial\nCrisis. Undoubtedly, this resilience helped prevent adverse financial shocks from\ncontributing to a more serious downturn.\nRecent Developments\nLet me conclude with some remarks on recent developments. U.S. and other\nfinancial markets are attuned to a number of prominent downside global risks, which\ninclude Brexit, a sharp slowdown in global growth prospects, and trade tensions.\nEven though the Fed has been and is committed to a dual mandate to achieve\nmaximum employment and price stability, in today’s world, U.S. policymakers can\n11 The quantitative easing was important, because the United States had already reduced the policy rate to\nzero and--as argued, for example, in Bodenstein, Erceg, and Guerrieri (2009)--the spillover effects of\nadverse foreign demand shocks to the U.S. economy are significantly amplified at the zero lower bound for\nthe policy rate in the absence of other expansionary policies.\n\n- 6 -\nhardly ignore these risks, and three of our most recent FOMC statements have\nhighlighted concerns about global economic and financial developments. In addition, in\nour policy statements, as well as in other communications, we have indicated that, in the\npresence of these risks and with inflation pressures muted, we can afford to be patient and\ndata dependent as we assess in future meetings what adjustments in our policy rate might\nbe necessary to sustain growth, employment, and price stability in the U.S. economy.\n\n- 7 -\nReferences\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2018). “The Recent Rise in Oil\nPrices,” Monetary Policy Report.

Clarida\nVice Chair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Fed Listens: Education, Employment, and Monetary Policy in the Third District”\nhosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania\nMay 17, 2019\n\nI am pleased to participate in this event, part of the listening tour that Reserve\nBanks are hosting around the country and a key input into the Federal Reserve’s review\nof our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices.1 We are bringing\nopen minds to our review and are seeking a broad range of perspectives. To us, it simply\nseems like good institutional practice to engage with a wide range of interested\nindividuals and groups as part of a comprehensive approach to enhanced transparency\nand accountability.2\nPresident Harker already mentioned the Federal Reserve’s statutory goals of\nmaximum employment and price stability. Our review will take these dual mandate goals\nas given. We will also take as given that a 2 percent rate of inflation in the price index\nfor personal consumption expenditures is the operational goal most consistent with our\nprice-stability mandate. While we believe that our existing strategy, tools, and\ncommunications practices have generally served the public well, we are eager to evaluate\nways they might be improved. That said, based on the experience of other central banks\nthat have undertaken similar reviews, our review is more likely to produce evolution, not\na revolution, in the way we conduct monetary policy.\nWith the U.S. economy operating at or close to our maximum-employment and\nprice-stability goals, now is an especially opportune time for this review. The\n1 Information about the review and the events associated with it are available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review-of-monetary-policy-strategy-tools-and-\ncommunications.htm.\n2 Fuhrer and others (2018) explore the desirability of comprehensive reviews of the monetary policy\nframework. They argue that such reviews may help the Fed more effectively identify and implement\nneeded changes. See Jeffrey Fuhrer, Giovanni Olivei, Eric Rosengren, and Geoffrey Tootell (2018),\n“Should the Fed Regularly Evaluate Its Monetary Policy Framework?” paper presented at the Brookings\nPapers on Economic Activity Conference, Fall, held at the Brookings Institution, Washington, September\n13–14, https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/BPEA_Fall2018_Should-the-Fed-\nRegularly-Evlauate-its-Monetary-Policy-Framework.pdf.\n\n- 2 -\nunemployment rate is at a 50-year low, and inflation is running close to our 2 percent\nobjective. We want to ensure that we continue to meet our statutory goals in coming\nyears. Furthermore, the U.S. and foreign economies have evolved significantly since\nbefore the Global Financial Crisis. The review will afford us the opportunity to evaluate\nthe new policy tools and enhanced communication practices the Federal Reserve\ndeployed in response to the crisis and the recession that followed it.\nOur monetary policy review will have several components. Listening sessions—\nsuch as today’s—give us an opportunity to hear from the people and communities\naffected by monetary policy. Next month, we are holding a System research conference\nat the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, with academic experts and panelists from\noutside the Fed. Building on the perspectives we hear and on staff analysis, the Federal\nOpen Market Committee will perform its own assessment of how it conducts monetary\npolicy, beginning around the middle of the year. We expect to make our conclusions\npublic in the first half of 2020.\nThe economy is constantly evolving, bringing with it new policy challenges. So it\nmakes sense for us to remain open minded as we assess current practices and consider\nideas that could potentially enhance our ability to deliver on the goals the Congress has\nassigned us. For this reason, my colleagues and I do not want to preempt or to predict\nour ultimate findings. What I can say is that any changes to our conduct of monetary\npolicy that we might make will be aimed solely at improving our ability to achieve and\nsustain our dual-mandate objectives in the world we live in today.",

Clarida\nVice Chair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\n2019 U.S. Monetary Policy Forum, sponsored by\nthe Initiative on Global Markets at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business\nNew York, New York\nFebruary 22, 2019\n\nI am pleased to participate in this year’s U.S. Monetary Policy Forum, which,\nsince its inception, has brought together policymakers, academics, and market\nparticipants to share ideas and perspectives on U.S. monetary policy. Today I would like\nto discuss the broad review of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy framework that we\nare undertaking this year. We will examine the policy strategy, tools, and communication\npractices that we use to pursue our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and\nprice stability. In my remarks, I will describe the motivation for and scope of this review\nand will preview some of the events we are planning as part of it.1 The U.S. Monetary\nPolicy Forum is an excellent venue for this presentation. For more than a decade, it has\nfocused attention and timely analysis on critical issues confronting the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (FOMC). Its programs have drawn on the latest economic research\nand considered a range of views. Similarly, the Federal Reserve’s review of its monetary\npolicy framework will be transparent, will be open minded, and will seek perspectives\nfrom a broad range of interested individuals and groups, including academics, other\nspecialists, and the public at large.\nMotivation for the Review\nThe fact that the System is conducting this review does not suggest that we are\ndissatisfied with the existing policy framework. Indeed, we believe our existing\nframework has served us well, helping us effectively achieve our statutorily assigned\ndual-mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability. Nonetheless, in light of\nthe unprecedented events of the past decade, we believe it is a good time to step back and\nassess whether, and in what possible ways, we can refine our strategy, tools, and\n1 I would like to thank Etienne Gagnon for his assistance in preparing these remarks.\n\n- 2 -\ncommunication practices to achieve and maintain these goals as consistently and robustly\nas possible.2 I note that central banks in other countries have conducted periodic reviews\nof their monetary policy frameworks, and their experience has informed the approach we\nare pursuing.\nAs Chairman Powell has indicated, with the U.S. economy operating at or close to\nour maximum-employment and price-stability goals, now is an especially opportune time\nto conduct this review. The unemployment rate is near a multidecade low, and inflation\nis running close to our 2 percent objective. By conducting this review, we want to ensure\nthat we are well positioned to continue to meet our statutory goals in coming years. In\naddition, the Federal Reserve used new policy tools and enhanced its communication\npractices in response to the Global Financial Crisis and the Great Recession, and the\nreview will evaluate these changes. Furthermore, U.S. and foreign economies have\nsignificantly evolved since the pre-crisis experience that informed much of the research\nthat provided the foundation for our current approach.\nPerhaps most significantly, neutral interest rates appear to have fallen in the\nUnited States and abroad.3 Moreover, this global decline in r* is widely expected to\npersist for years. The decline in neutral policy rates likely reflects several factors,\nincluding aging populations, changes in risk-taking behavior, and a slowdown in\ntechnology growth. These factors’ contributions are highly uncertain, but irrespective of\ntheir precise role, the policy implications of the decline in neutral rates are important. All\n2 Fuhrer and others (2018) explore the desirability of comprehensive reviews of the monetary policy\nframework. They argue that such reviews may help the Fed more effectively identify and implement\nneeded changes to its framework.\n3 For evidence of a fall in neutral rates of interest in the United States and abroad, see, among several\ncontributions, King and Low (2014); Holston, Laubach, and Williams (2017); Rachel and Smith (2017);\nand Brand, Bielecki, and Penalver (2018).\n\n- 3 -\nelse being equal, a fall in neutral rates increases the likelihood that a central bank’s policy\nrate will reach its effective lower bound (ELB) in future economic downturns. That\ndevelopment, in turn, could make it more difficult during downturns for monetary policy\nto support spending and employment, and keep inflation from falling too low.4\nAnother key development in recent decades is that inflation appears less\nresponsive to resource slack. That is, the short-run Phillips curve appears to have\nflattened, implying a change in the dynamic relationship between inflation and\nemployment.5 A flatter Phillips curve is, in a sense, a proverbial double-edged sword. It\npermits the Federal Reserve to support employment more aggressively during\ndownturns--as was the case during and after the Great Recession--because a sustained\ninflation breakout is less likely when the Phillips curve is flatter.6 However, a flatter\nPhillips curve also increases the cost, in terms of economic output, of reversing\nunwelcome increases in longer-run inflation expectations. Thus, a flatter Phillips curve\nmakes it all the more important that longer-run inflation expectations remain anchored at\nlevels consistent with our 2 percent inflation objective.7\n4 For assessments of the risks that U.S. monetary policy will be constrained by the ELB and its implications\nfor economic activity and inflation, see Kiley and Roberts (2017), Erceg and others (2018),\nSwanson (2018), and Chung and others (2019).\n5 For evidence of a flattening of the slope of the Phillips curve in the United States and abroad, see, among\nothers, Simon, Matheson, and Sandri (2013); Blanchard, Cerutti, and Summers (2015); and Bank for\nInternational Settlements (2017).\n6 One potential contributor to the flattening of the Phillips curve is a change in the conduct of monetary\npolicy since the 1980s toward greater stabilization of inflation and economic activity; for evidence of such\na change, see Clarida, Galí, and Gertler (2000); Boivin and Giannoni (2006); and Boivin, Kiley, and\nMishkin (2010). As discussed in Roberts (2006) and Bullard (2018), greater stabilization on the part of a\ncentral bank can lead to the estimation of flatter Phillips curves in reduced-form regressions. Similarly, the\nadoption of an explicit inflation objective, along with greater certainty regarding the conduct of monetary\npolicy, can help anchor longer-term inflation expectations and stabilize actual inflation in response to\nshocks.\n7 See Yellen (2015) for a discussion of inflation dynamics and monetary policy; see Erceg and others\n(2018) for a quantitative exploration of the monetary policy implications of a flat Phillips curve in an\nuncertain economic environment. Since the mid-1980s, movements in both realized inflation and measures\nof longer-term inflation expectations have been somewhat muted, complicating the task of extracting the\nprecise role of inflation expectations as a determinant of realized inflation. Faust and Wright (2013) review\n\n- 4 -\nScope of the Review\nIn the Federal Reserve Act, the Congress assigned the Federal Reserve the\nresponsibility to conduct monetary policy “so as to promote effectively the goals of\nmaximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.”8 Our\nreview this year will take this statutory mandate as given and will also take as given that\ninflation at a rate of 2 percent is most consistent over the longer run with the\ncongressional mandate.\nOur existing monetary policy strategy is laid out in the Committee’s Statement on\nLonger-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.9 First adopted in January 2012, the\nstatement has been reaffirmed at the start of each subsequent year, including at the\nFOMC’s meeting last month with unanimous support from all 17 FOMC participants.\nThe statement indicates that the Committee seeks to mitigate deviations of inflation from\n2 percent and deviations of employment from assessments of its maximum level. In\ndoing so, the FOMC recognizes that these assessments of maximum employment are\nnecessarily uncertain and subject to revision. According to the Federal Reserve Act, the\nemployment objective is on an equal footing with the inflation objective.\nthe literature on inflation forecasting and present evidence in support of the conclusion that measures of\ninflation expectations help predict the trend in inflation. In a paper discussed at this forum two years ago,\nCecchetti and others (2017) showed that while the level of realized inflation and four-quarter-ahead\ninflation expectations are positively correlated, changes in these variables have been largely uncorrelated\nsince the mid-1980s. These authors suggest that, in a low and stable inflation environment, policymakers\nshould pay attention to a wide array of other indicators in determining the implications of movements in\nrealized inflation and measures of inflation expectations.\n8 Even though the act lists three distinct goals, the Federal Reserve’s mandate for monetary policy is\ncommonly known as the “dual mandate.” The reason is that an economy in which people who want to\nwork either have a job or are likely to find one fairly quickly and in which the price level (meaning a broad\nmeasure of the price of goods and services purchased by consumers) is stable creates the conditions needed\nfor interest rates to settle at moderate levels. For a discussion, see Mishkin (2007).\n9 The statement is available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals.pdf.\n\n- 5 -\nAs a practical matter, our current strategy shares many elements with the policy\nframework known in the research literature as “flexible inflation targeting.”10 However,\nthe Fed’s mandate is much more explicit about the role of employment than that of most\nflexible inflation-targeting central banks, and our statement reflects this by stating that\nwhen the two sides of the mandate are in conflict, neither one takes precedent over the\nother. We believe this transparency about the balanced approach the FOMC takes has\nserved us well over the past decade when high unemployment called for extraordinary\npolicies that entailed some risk of inflation.\nThe review of our current framework will be wide ranging, and we will not\nprejudge where it will take us, but events of the past decade highlight three broad\nquestions.\nThree Questions\nThe first question is, “Can the Federal Reserve best meet its statutory objectives\nwith its existing monetary policy strategy, or should it consider strategies that aim to\nreverse past misses of the inflation objective?”\nUnder our current approach as well as that of most flexible inflation-targeting\ncentral banks around the world, the persistent shortfalls of inflation from 2 percent that\nmany advanced economies have experienced over most of the past decade are treated as\n“bygones.” This means that policy today is not adjusted to offset past inflation shortfalls\nwith future overshoots of the inflation target (nor do persistent overshoots of inflation\ntrigger policies that aim to undershoot the inflation target). Central banks are generally\nbelieved to have effective tools for preventing persistent inflation overshoots, but the\n10 For a discussion of this terminology and references, see English, López-Salido, and Tetlow (2015) and\nClinton and others (2015).\n\n- 6 -\neffective lower bound on interest rates makes persistent undershoots more likely.\nPersistent inflation shortfalls carry the risk that longer-term inflation expectations become\npoorly anchored or become anchored below the stated inflation goal.11\nIn part because of that concern, some economists have advocated “makeup”\nstrategies under which policymakers seek to undo, in part or in whole, past inflation\ndeviations from target. Such strategies include targeting average inflation over a\nmultiyear period and price-level targeting, in which policymakers seek to stabilize the\nprice level around a constant growth path.12 These strategies could be implemented\neither permanently or as a temporary response to extraordinary circumstances. For\nexample, the central bank could commit, at the time when the policy rate reaches the\nELB, to maintain the policy rate at this level until inflation over the ELB period has, on\naverage, run at the target rate.13 Other makeup strategies seek to reverse shortfalls in\npolicy accommodation at the ELB by keeping the policy rate lower for longer than\n11 These risks could be exacerbated if households and businesses expect monetary policy to be\ninsufficiently accommodative because of proximity to the ELB. For related discussions, see Reifschneider\nand Williams (2000); Adam and Billi (2007); Nakov (2008); and Hills, Nakata, and Schmidt (2016).\n12 Eggertsson and Woodford (2003) provide an early discussion of how optimal monetary policy at the ELB\nentails a commitment to reflate the price level during the subsequent economic expansion. Nessén and\nVestin (2005) discuss the relationship between average inflation targeting and price-level targeting. There\nis a dearth of empirical evidence on strategies seeking to make up for inflation deviations. Central banks\nthat pursue an inflation goal generally seek to achieve a specific rate of inflation by some time horizon--\ntypically a couple years ahead or over the “medium run”--without regard to past inflation deviations. One\nexception is the Reserve Bank of Australia, whose inflation goal is specified as a range of “2-3 per cent, on\naverage, over the medium term” and thus might embed some notion of history dependence. However,\nRuge-Murcia (2014) argues that the drift in the price level in Australia is comparable with the drifts\nobserved in economies with purely forward-looking specification of the inflation goal. The only known\nhistorical example of price-level targeting occurred in Sweden from 1931 to 1933 when the country\nabandoned the gold standard and attempted instead to maintain its price level. The temporary adoption of\nprice-level targeting is credited with helping Sweden avoid deflation, an outcome that contrasted with that\nin countries that stayed on the gold standard. See Berg and Jonung (1999).\n13 See Bernanke (2017) for a discussion of such a strategy. See Hebden and López-Salido (2018) for a\nquantitative assessment of that and other strategies. See also Kiley and Roberts (2017) for a strategy in\nwhich policymakers aim for inflation higher than 2 percent during economic expansions to compensate for\nbelow-target realizations of inflation during economic downturns.\n\n- 7 -\notherwise would be the case.14 In many models that incorporate the ELB, these makeup\nstrategies lead to better average performance on both legs of the dual mandate and\nthereby, viewed over time, provide no conflict between the dual-mandate goals.15\nThe benefits of the makeup strategies rest heavily on households and firms\nbelieving in advance that the makeup will, in fact, be delivered when the time comes--for\nexample, that a persistent inflation shortfall will be met by future inflation above 2\npercent. As is well known from the research literature, makeup strategies, in general, are\nnot time consistent because when the time comes to push inflation above 2 percent,\nconditions at that time will not warrant doing so. Because of this time inconsistency, any\nmakeup strategy, to be successful, would have to be understood by the public to represent\na credible commitment. That important real-world consideration is often neglected in the\nacademic literature, in which central bank “commitment devices” are simply assumed to\nexist and be instantly credible on decree. Thus, one of the most challenging questions is\nwhether the Fed could, in practice, attain the benefits of makeup strategies that are\npossible in models.\nThe next question the review will consider is, “Are the existing monetary policy\ntools adequate to achieve and maintain maximum employment and price stability, or\nshould the toolkit be expanded? And, if so, how?” The FOMC’s primary means of\nchanging the stance of monetary policy is by adjusting its target range for the federal\nfunds rate. In the fall of 2008, the FOMC cut that target to just above zero in response to\n14 See Reifschneider and Williams (2000) for a strategy in which a central bank following a Taylor rule\nmakes up for shortfalls in policy accommodation during ELB episodes by subsequently keeping the policy\nrate lower than otherwise. The box “Complexities of Monetary Policy Rules” in the Board’s July 2018\nMonetary Policy Report contains an application of such a modified rule; see Board of Governors (2018,\npp. 37-41).\n15 See English, López-Salido, and Tetlow (2015) for applications of flexible price-level targeting and\nnominal income-targeting strategies to a quantitative model of the U.S. economy.\n\n- 8 -\nfinancial turmoil and deteriorating economic conditions. Because the U.S. economy\nrequired additional policy accommodation after the ELB was reached, the FOMC\ndeployed two additional tools in the years following the crisis: balance sheet policies and\nforward guidance regarding the likely path of the federal funds rate.16\nThe FOMC altered the size and composition of the Fed’s balance sheet through a\nsequence of three large-scale securities purchase programs, via a maturity extension\nprogram, and by adjusting the reinvestment of principal payments on maturing securities.\nWith regard to forward guidance, the FOMC initially made “calendar based” statements,\nand, later on, it issued “outcome based” guidance. Overall, the empirical evidence\nsuggests that these added tools helped stem the crisis and support economic recovery by\nstrengthening the labor market and lifting inflation back toward 2 percent. That said,\nestimates of the effects of these unconventional policies range widely.17\nIn addition to assessing the efficacy of these existing tools, we will consider\nadditional tools to ease policy when the ELB is binding. For example, as is presently\nBank of Japan policy, the FOMC could, when the ELB is binding, establish a temporary\nceiling for Treasury yields at longer maturities by standing ready to purchase them at a\n16 As an illustration of the shortfall in policy support created by a binding ELB during the Global Financial\nCrisis, the simple policy rules considered in a January 2017 speech by then-Chair Janet Yellen prescribed\nsetting the federal funds rate between negative 1-1/2 and negative 9 percent; see Yellen (2017). In addition\nto using these two additional monetary policy tools, the Federal Reserve implemented a number of other\nmeasures to stabilize the financial system, increase households and business confidence, and more\ngenerally support the economic recovery. These supplementary measures included the setting up of several\ncredit facilities and the introduction of stress tests for systemically important financial institutions.\n17 On the transmission channels of balance sheet policies, see D’Amico and others (2012), Joyce and others\n(2012), Clarida (2012), Woodford (2012), and Bauer and Rudebusch (2014). On the financial market\neffects of balance sheet policies, see Gagnon and others (2011), Joyce and others (2011), Hamilton and Wu\n(2012), D’Amico and King (2013), and Swanson (2017). For discussions of the macroeconomic effects of\nthese policy actions, see Chen, Cúrdia, and Ferrero (2012); Baumeister and Benati (2013); Engen, Laubach,\nand Reifschneider (2015); Chung and others (2019), and the references therein. For related assessments of\nforward guidance, see Campbell and others (2012); Engen, Laubach, and Reifschneider (2015); Campbell\nand others (2017); and Swanson (2017).\n\n- 9 -\npreannounced floor price.18 During the crisis and its aftermath, the Federal Reserve\nreviewed but ultimately found this tool and some others deployed by foreign central\nbanks wanting relative to the alternatives it did pursue. But the review will reassess the\ncase for these and other tools in light of more recent experience in other countries.\nThe third question the review will consider is, “How can the FOMC’s\ncommunication of its policy framework and implementation be improved?” Our\ncommunication practices have evolved considerably since 1994, when the Federal\nReserve released the first statement after an FOMC meeting. Over the past decade or so,\nthe FOMC has enhanced its communication practices to promote public understanding of\nits policy goals, strategy, and actions, as well as to foster democratic accountability.\nThese enhancements include the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy\nStrategy; postmeeting press conferences; various statements about principles and strategy\nguiding the Committee’s normalization of monetary policy; and quarterly summaries of\nindividual FOMC participants’ economic projections, assessments about the appropriate\npath of the federal funds rate, and judgments of the uncertainty and balance of risks\naround their projections.19\n18 Compared with asset purchases during the financial crisis, this approach might give us greater rate\ncontrol at medium to long maturities but carry a risk that the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet could become\nunduly large. Japan arguably offers the most direct example of such an approach. In September 2016, the\nBank of Japan announced a target for the yield on the Japanese 10-year government bond and stated its\ncommitment to expand the monetary base until inflation exceeded its 2 percent objective and stayed above\nthat level in a stable manner.\n19 Starting in 1979, the Federal Reserve published a summary of individual economic projections from\nvarious Board members, FOMC members, or FOMC participants in the semiannual Monetary Policy\nReport. With the introduction of the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) in 2007, the FOMC\nincreased the frequency of the releases of policymaker projections, expanded the set of economic variables\nincluded, and extended the forecast horizon. Because the SEP includes individual contributions of\nprojections and assessments from all FOMC participants, it captures a broader range of views than those of\nFOMC members. For a discussion and data, see Bernanke (2007) and Romer (2010).\n\n- 10 -\nAs part of the review, we will assess the Committee’s current and past\ncommunications and additional forms of communication that could be helpful. For\nexample, there might be ways to improve communication about the coordination of\npolicy tools or the interplay between monetary policy and financial stability.\nActivities and Timeline for the Review\nThe review will have several components.20 The Board and the Reserve Banks\nwill be conducting town hall-style “Fed Listens” events this year. We will hear from a\nbroad range of interested individuals and groups, including business and labor leaders,\ncommunity development professionals, and academics. The first of these events will take\nplace Monday in Dallas. Another is scheduled at the Federal Reserve Bank of\nMinneapolis in early April, and other Reserve Banks will host events over the course of\nthe year.\nIn addition, we will sponsor a System research conference on June 4-5, 2019, at\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, with speakers and panelists from outside the Fed.\nThe sessions will include overviews by academic experts of themes that are central to the\nreview, including the FOMC’s monetary policy since the financial crisis, assessments of\nthe maximum sustainable level of employment, alternative policy frameworks and\nstrategies to achieve the dual mandate, policy tools, global considerations, financial\nstability considerations, and central bank communications. Other sessions will feature\npanels of community leaders who will share their perspectives on the labor market and\nthe effects of interest rates on their constituencies.\n20 Information about the review and the events associated with it are available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review-of-monetary-policy-strategy-tools-and-\ncommunications.htm.\n\n- 11 -\nWe expect to release summaries of the “Fed Listens” events and to livestream the\nChicago conference. Building on the perspectives we hear and on staff analysis, the\nFOMC will conduct its own assessment of its monetary policy framework, beginning\naround the middle of the year. We will share our conclusions with the public in the first\nhalf 2020.\nConcluding Thoughts\nThe economy is constantly evolving, bringing with it new policy challenges. So it\nmakes sense for us to remain open minded as we assess current practices and consider\nideas that could potentially enhance our ability to deliver on the goals the Congress has\nassigned us. For this reason, my colleagues and I do not want to preempt or to predict\nour ultimate finding. What I can say is that any refinements or more material changes to\nour framework that we might make will be aimed solely at enhancing our ability to\nachieve and sustain our dual-mandate objectives in the world we live in today.\n\n- 12 -\nReferences\nAdam, Klaus, and Roberto M.

    "text": "For release on delivery\n7:00 p.m. EST\nJanuary 10, 2019\nMonetary Policy Outlook for 2019\nRemarks by\nRichard H. Clarida\nVice Chairman\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nMoney Marketeers of New York University\nNew York, New York\nJanuary 10, 2019\n\nHappy New Year. I am very glad to be speaking to you here in New York, a city\nI lived and worked in for 30 years before joining the Federal Reserve Board in\nSeptember. The new year is often a time when people make resolutions--resolutions to\nexercise more, learn a new skill, or spend more quality time with family and friends. My\nresolution, as a member of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), is to work with\nmy colleagues to implement a monetary policy that will sustain economic growth and\nmaximum employment at levels consistent with our 2 percent inflation objective.1\nInitial Conditions and What I Am Looking for in 2019\nAs we begin 2019, the initial conditions for the real economy are favorable.\nThrough the first three quarters of last year, gross domestic product growth averaged\n3.2 percent. Private-sector forecasts as well as our Summary of Economic Projections\nindicate that, when the data for the fourth quarter are released, they will show the\neconomy likely grew at 3 percent or perhaps a little faster in 2018 for the year as a whole.\nIf so, economic growth in 2018 would be the fastest annual growth rate recorded in\n13 years. In terms of the economic outlook, ongoing momentum heading into this year\nindicates that that above-trend growth is likely to continue in 2019. If the economy\ncontinues to grow in 2019 along the lines that I expect, in July the current expansion will\nbecome the longest in recorded U.S. history.\nThe labor market remains healthy, with an unemployment rate near the lowest\nlevel recorded in 50 years and with average monthly job gains continuing to outpace the\nincreases needed over the longer run to provide employment for new entrants to the labor\n1 The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of other Federal Reserve Board members or\nFOMC participants. I would like to thank Brian Doyle, David Lebow, and Ellen Meade for their assistance\nin preparing these remarks.\n\n- 2 -\nforce. Moreover, the declines in the unemployment rate have been widespread across\nracial and ethnic minority groups, though gaps for African Americans and Hispanics\nrelative to whites remain sizable. At 3.9 percent, the overall unemployment rate is below\nthe median of FOMC participants’ estimates of its full employment level, u*, of\n4.4 percent. That said, the participants’ median estimate of u* has been falling for\nseveral years as strong employment gains have not triggered a worrying rise in price\ninflation.\nIn a welcome development, nominal wage growth is picking up, with most\nmeasures now running around 3 percent on an annual basis. And, for the past couple of\nyears, wage gains have been notably faster for lower-income workers.2 Aggregate wage\ngains are broadly in line with productivity growth and our 2 percent inflation objective,\nand they are consistent with a labor market that is operating in the vicinity of full\nemployment. They are not, at present, a source of upward, cost-push pressure on price\ninflation.\nWith regard to labor supply, we have had a pickup in labor force participation\namong prime-age workers (those 25 to 54 years old) that is, at least for now, boosting the\nsupply side of the economy. The participation rate of prime-age workers has risen about\n1-1/2 percentage points over the past few years. And participation in the job market may\n2 Wage gains for workers with different wage levels can be calculated using data from the Current\nPopulation Survey from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Economic Policy Institute provides convenient\ntabulations of these data. For data through 2017, see Economic Policy Institute (2018), State of Working\nAmerica Data Library (Washington: EPI, March), table (“Wages by Percentile”),\nhttps://www.epi.org/data/#?subject=wage-percentiles. For an update through the first half of 2018, see\nElise Gould and Heidi Shierholz (2018), “Average Wage Growth Continues to Flatline in 2018, While\nLow-Wage Workers and Those with Relatively Lower Levels of Educational Attainment See Stronger\nGains,” Economic Policy Institute, Working Economics Blog, July 18, https://www.epi.org/blog/average-\nwage-growth-continues-to-flatline-in-2018-while-low-wage-workers-and-those-with-relatively-lower-\nlevels-of-educational-attainment-see-stronger-gains.\n\n- 3 -\nstill have some further room to rise, as the prime-age participation rate is still a couple of\npercentage points below the levels that prevailed in the late 1990s, when the labor market\nwas last this strong.\nPrice stability, of course, is the other leg of our dual mandate, and PCE (personal\nconsumption expenditures) inflation over the past 12 months has been running close to\nour 2 percent objective. That said, and notwithstanding strong economic growth and a\nlow unemployment rate, inflation has surprised to the downside recently, and it is not yet\nclear that inflation has moved back to 2 percent on a sustainable basis.\nBecause expectations of future inflation are such an important determinant of\nactual inflation, central banks are as much in the business of anchoring inflation\nexpectations as they are of managing actual inflation. Longer-run inflation expectations,\nbased on straight readings of inflation compensation from TIPS (Treasury Inflation-\nProtected Securities), have drifted downward, although, when adjusted for term\npremiums and liquidity, they remain near 2 percent. The University of Michigan Surveys\nof Consumers’ measure of expected inflation over the next 5 to 10 years has been broadly\nstable but has edged down over the past few years and is now at the very lower end of the\nrange that has prevailed historically. Inflation expectations of professional forecasters\nhave remained stable and consistent with our 2 percent objective.\nAt each future FOMC meeting, as I consider what, if any, adjustment to our\npolicy stance is warranted to achieve and sustain our dual-mandate objectives, I will\nclosely monitor the incoming data on inflation expectations as well as actual inflation,\namong the broad range of real and financial indicators that I consult. To me, it is\n\n- 4 -\nimportant that any future policy decisions we may consider in 2019 be consistent with\nboth pillars of our dual mandate.\nI will also be monitoring closely the incoming data on labor supply and\nproductivity.3 Not only has aggregate demand growth been robust, but so, too, has been\nthe growth in realized aggregate supply. Over the first three quarters of 2018, hours\nworked in the nonfarm business sector were up 2.0 percent (at an annual rate), and\nproductivity was up 1.8 percent. Realized productivity growth over the past eight\nquarters has averaged 1.3 percent, which is up from the 0.7 percent average recorded\nbetween 2011 and 2016. Strong growth supported by supply-side gains in hours worked\nand productivity is not inflationary, as the experience of 2018 confirms. With labor\nsupply and productivity growth in 2018 having surprised on the upside, some mean\nreversion in 2019 is not unreasonable to forecast. But right now, that is just a forecast,\nand if the positive developments on the supply side of the economy continue in 2019,\nthey would need to be factored into the inflation outlook and thus the appropriate settings\nfor monetary policy.\nAs I have indicated previously, I believe we may have seen the bottom on the\nproductivity slowdown, but how much of the recent welcome uptick in productivity\ngrowth can be sustained or extended is hard to judge at this point. It will depend in part\non how much business investment spending adds to the stock of capital in the economy.\nWe saw a welcome pickup in investment in the first half of last year, but growth of\n3 For an analysis of the effect of a positive boost to productivity in the FRB/US model, see Jean-Philippe\nLaforte (2018), “Overview of the Changes to the FRB/US Model (2018),” FEDS Notes (Washington:\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, December 7), fig. 4,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/overview-of-the-changes-to-the-frb-us-model-\n2018-20181207.htm. In the model, higher productivity lowers inflation, which calls for a flatter path for\npolicy normalization than would otherwise be the case.\n\n- 5 -\ncapital spending slowed notably in the third quarter and the manufacturing indexes from\nthe Institute for Supply Management have softened, though other data are consistent with\na rebound in business spending in the fourth quarter. If a pickup in the growth of\ninvestment spending was realized and sustained, it would be expected to contribute to\nfuture productivity growth.\nThe December Decision and the Outlook for Monetary Policy in 2019\nWith a robust labor market and inflation running close to our 2 percent inflation\nobjective, the Committee decided at its December meeting to raise the target range for the\nfederal funds rate to 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent.4 That said, growth and growth prospects in\nother economies around the world have moderated somewhat in recent months, and\noverall financial conditions have tightened materially. These recent developments in the\nglobal economy and financial markets represent crosswinds to the U.S. economy. If\nthese crosswinds are sustained, appropriate forward-looking monetary policy should\nrespond to keep the economy as close as possible to our dual-mandate objectives of\nmaximum employment and price stability.5 I will closely monitor the incoming data on\n4 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2018), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC\nStatement,” press release, December 19,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20181219a.htm.\n5 In the model of optimal monetary policy discussed in a paper by Clarida, Galí, and Gertler, the central\nbank is able to offset fully exogenous declines in aggregate demand through adjustments in the expected\npath for the policy rate. See Richard H. Clarida, Jordi Galí, and Mark Gertler (1999), “The Science of\nMonetary Policy: A New Keynesian Perspective,” Journal of Economic Literature, vol. 37 (December),\npp. 1661-1707. A paper by Clarida shows that this result extends to the open economy facing, for example,\na decline in exports. While monetary policy in practice must confront real-world complications that\ntheoretical models ignore, the crucial point is that economic projections for growth and inflation under\nappropriate monetary policy may be much less affected by adverse or positive “demand” fluctuations than\nwould be the case if policy did not respond appropriately to these developments. That is, under present\ncircumstances and under appropriate monetary policy, one can be more optimistic about the economic\noutlook than would be a “pessimist” who focuses only on the crosswinds without factoring in the\nappropriate policy response to the crosswinds. See Richard H. Clarida (2017), “The Global Factor in\nNeutral Policy Rates: Some Implications for Exchange Rates, Monetary Policy, and Policy Coordination,”\nNBER Working Paper Series 23562 (Cambridge, Mass.: NBER, June).\n\n- 6 -\nthese global economic and financial developments as, at each future FOMC meeting, I\nconsider what adjustment to our monetary policy stance is warranted to achieve and\nsustain our dual-mandate objectives.\nWith our December decision, the 2.5 percent upper limit of our target range for\nthe federal funds rate is now equal to the lower end of the range of Committee\nparticipants’ estimates of its longer-run equilibrium level, r*. One defines r* as the level\nof the policy rate that, if sustained, would maintain full employment and price stability in\nthe long run. As I have discussed in a previous speech, r* is both unobserved and time\nvarying, so it must be inferred from macroeconomic and financial data.6\nIt is for this reason that, at this stage of the business cycle and with the economy\noperating close to our dual-mandate objectives, it will be especially important for our\npolicy decisions to continue to be data dependent. We need to be data dependent in two\nrelated but distinct ways. First, we need to base our policy decisions on what trends in\nthe data tell us about where the economy is at the time of each meeting relative to our\ndual-mandate objectives for unemployment and inflation. Second, we need to be data\ndependent by looking at a wide range of real and financial data that can provide\ninformation on where the economy is heading under appropriate policy, including the\nultimate destination for u* and r*. Over the past seven years, FOMC participants have\ncontinually revised down their estimates of long-run u* and r* as the unemployment rate\nfell and historically low policy rates did not trigger a surge in inflation and inflation\nexpectations above target. This process of learning about u* and r* as new data arrive\n6 See Richard H. Clarida (2018), “Data Dependence and U.S. Monetary Policy,” speech delivered at the\nClearing House and the Bank Policy Institute Annual Conference, New York, November 27,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/clarida20181127a.htm.\n\n- 7 -\ncontinues and reinforces that we are not on a preset course. With inflation muted, I\nbelieve that the Committee can afford to be patient as we see how the data evolve in 2019\nand as we assess what monetary policy stance is warranted to sustain strong growth and\nour dual-mandate objectives.\nIn terms of monetary policy implementation, the FOMC is assessing how the\ndemand for our liabilities, especially reserve balances held at the Fed by depository\ninstitutions and U.S. currency holdings, is evolving in a world in which regulation and\nprudence boost holdings of liquid assets by financial institutions. Ultimately, these\nfactors, along with the choice we make with regard to our operating framework, will be\nthe primary determinants of the size of our balance sheet, which since October 2017 has\nbeen shrinking as we allow our holdings of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-\nbacked securities to roll off as they mature and prepay. There have been significant\nchanges in financial regulation pertaining to high-quality liquid assets and liquidity\ncoverage ratios, and the legacy of the Global Financial Crisis has likely led financial\ninstitutions to want to have higher liquidity even outside of regulation. And that means\nthat we are going to be in a world in which financial institutions are likely either required\nor going to want to hold onto liquid assets, including reserves at the Fed.\nThe FOMC is discussing the pros and cons of different longer-run approaches to\nmonetary policy implementation and is still learning about the evolution of the demand\nfor reserves in the banking system. As noted in the FOMC’s Policy Normalization\nPrinciples and Plans, the Committee intends to, in the longer run, hold “no more\n\n- 8 -\nsecurities than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively.”7 In\nthat vein, as indicated in the minutes from our recent meetings, the Committee has been\nweighing the costs and benefits of an implementation system with abundant reserves.\nThe current system for policy implementation with abundant reserves has, to date, served\nus well. We have good control of short-term money market rates in a variety of market\nconditions, and these rates have been effectively transmitting to broader financial\nconditions in the economy. However, while the assessment of our operating framework\nis ongoing, let me be clear that any decisions we make on the ultimate size of the balance\nsheet and the implementation of policy will be taken so as to be consistent with our goals\nof sustaining strong growth, maximum employment, and price stability. If we find that\nthe ongoing program of balance sheet normalization or any other aspect of normalization\nno longer promotes the achievement of our dual-mandate goals, we will not hesitate to\nmake changes.\nReview of the Federal Reserve’s Strategy, Tools, and Communication\nIn November, the Federal Reserve announced that it will conduct a wide-ranging\nand public review in 2019 of how we go about achieving the twin goals of maximum\nemployment and price stability assigned to us by the Congress. The review will cover the\nFed’s monetary policy strategy, policy tools, and communication practices and will\ninclude outreach to businesses, community groups, academics, and other interested\nparties. As Chairman Powell has indicated, with labor market conditions close to\nmaximum employment and inflation near our 2 percent objective, now is a good time to\n7 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2014), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement\non Policy Normalization Principles and Plans,” press release, September 17, paragraph 9,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20140917c.htm.\n\n- 9 -\ntake stock of how the Federal Reserve formulates, conducts, and communicates monetary\npolicy. As part of this outreach effort, the Federal Reserve System will hold a research\nconference June 4-5, 2019, hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and featuring\noutside speakers and panelists. The Federal Reserve Board and Reserve District Banks\nwill also be holding outreach and public events as we seek views from a wide range of\ninterested parties. Beginning in the summer of 2019, the FOMC will draw on what it has\nlearned from the conference and the System outreach events as it assesses possible ways\nin which the Fed’s strategy, tools, and communication practices might evolve to best\nachieve, on a sustained basis, the twin goals of maximum employment and price stability\nassigned to it by the Congress. We anticipate making our findings public after the FOMC\nconcludes this review sometime in 2020.\nConcluding Thoughts\nThe U.S. economy enters 2019 after a year of strong growth, with inflation near\nour 2 percent objective, and with the unemployment rate near 50-year lows. That said,\ngrowth and growth prospects in other economies around the world have moderated\nsomewhat in recent months, and overall financial conditions have tightened materially.\nThese recent developments in the global economy and financial markets represent\ncrosswinds to the U.S. economy. If these crosswinds are sustained, appropriate\nforward-looking monetary policy should seek to offset them to keep the economy as\nclose as possible to our dual-mandate objectives of maximum employment and price\nstability. As we have long said, monetary policy is not on a preset course. Going\nforward, we need, I believe, to be cognizant of the balance we must strike between\n(1) being forward looking and preemptive and (2) maximizing the odds of being right.\n\n- 10 -\nFor example, were models to predict a surge in inflation, a decision for preemptive hikes\nbefore the surge is evident in actual data would need to be balanced against the cost of\nthe model being wrong. Speaking for myself, I believe we can afford to be patient about\nassessing how to adjust our policy stance to achieve and sustain our dual-mandate\nobjectives. We begin the year as close to our assigned objectives as we have in a very\nlong time. In these circumstances, I believe patience is a virtue and is one we can today\nafford. Thank you.",

Clarida\nVice Chair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\n2020 Annual Membership Meeting of the Institute of International Finance\nWashington, D.C.\n(via webcast)\nOctober 14, 2020\n\nIt is my pleasure to meet virtually with you today at the 2020 Annual Membership\nMeeting of the Institute of International Finance.1 I regret that we are not doing this\nsession in person, and I hope the next time Tim Adams invites me back, we will be\ngathering together in Washington. I look forward, as always, to my conversation with\nTim, but first, please allow me to offer a few remarks on the economic outlook, Federal\nReserve monetary policy, and our new monetary policy framework.\nCurrent Economic Situation and Outlook\nIn the first half of this year, the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic\nand the mitigation efforts put in place to contain it delivered the most severe blow to the\nU.S. economy since the Great Depression. Gross domestic product (GDP) collapsed at\nan almost 32 percent annual rate in the second quarter, and more than 22 million jobs\nwere lost in March and April. This recession was by far the deepest one in postwar\nhistory, but it also may go into the record books as the briefest recession in U.S. history.\nThe flow of macrodata received since May has been surprisingly strong, and GDP growth\nin the third quarter is estimated by many forecasters to have rebounded at perhaps a 25 to\n30 percent annual rate. This development is especially noteworthy when set in relief\nagainst the surge in new COVID-19 cases that were reported this summer in a number of\nU.S. states and the coincident flatlining in a number of high-frequency activity indicators\nthat we follow to track the effect of the virus on economic activity.\nAlthough spending on many services continues to lag, the rebound in the GDP\ndata has been broad based across indicators of goods consumption, housing, and\n1 The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of other Federal Reserve Board members or\nFederal Open Market Committee participants. I would like to thank Chiara Scotti for her assistance in\npreparing these remarks.\n\n- 2 -\ninvestment. These components of aggregate demand have benefited from robust fiscal\nsupport—including the Paycheck Protection Program and expanded unemployment\nbenefits—as well as low interest rates and efforts by the Federal Reserve to sustain the\nflow of credit to households and firms. In the labor market, about half of the 22 million\njobs that were lost in the spring have been restored, and the unemployment rate has fallen\nsince April by nearly 7 percentage points to 7.9 percent as of September.\nI remind you that in the spring, many voices questioned what good rate cuts,\nforward guidance, asset purchases, and lending programs could do in an economy in\nwhich people do not venture out to buy cars or build houses and in which companies do\nnot invest to augment their capital stock. Well, the data show us that with rates low,\ncredit available, and incomes supported by fiscal transfers, the answer is—at least so\nfar—that they do build houses, buy cars, and order equipment and software. That said,\nthe COVID-19 recession threw the economy into a very deep hole, and it will take some\ntime, perhaps another year, for the level of GDP to fully recover to its previous 2019\npeak. It will likely take even longer than that for the unemployment rate to return to a\nlevel consistent with our maximum-employment mandate. However, it is worth\nhighlighting that the Committee’s baseline projections summarized in the most recent\nSummary of Economic Projections foresee a relatively rapid return to mandate-consistent\nlevels of employment and inflation as compared with the recovery from the Global\nFinancial Crisis (GFC).2 In particular, the median Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC) participant projects that by the end of 2023—a little more than three years from\n2 The most recent Summary of Economic Projections, an addendum to the minutes of the September 2020\nmeeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, is available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.\n\n- 3 -\nnow—the unemployment rate will have fallen to 4 percent, and PCE (personal\nconsumption expenditures) inflation will have returned to 2 percent. Following the GFC,\nit took more than eight years for employment and inflation to return to similar mandate-\nconsistent levels. My baseline outlook is close to these projections, but I must also\nacknowledge that the economic outlook is unusually uncertain, and, moreover, that the\nultimate course the economy follows will depend on the course of the virus, social-\ndistancing norms, and mitigation efforts put in place to contain it.\nThe September FOMC Decision and the New Monetary Policy Framework\nAt our September FOMC meeting, the Committee made important changes to our\npolicy statement that upgraded our forward guidance about the future path of the federal\nfunds rate, and that also provided unprecedented information about our policy reaction\nfunction. We indicated that, with inflation running persistently below 2 percent, our\npolicy will aim to achieve inflation outcomes that keep inflation expectations well\nanchored at our 2 percent longer-run goal. We said that we expect to maintain an\naccommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes—as well as our\nmaximum-employment mandate—are achieved, and also that we expect it will be\nappropriate to maintain the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate\nuntil labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s\nassessments of maximum employment, until inflation has risen to 2 percent, and until\ninflation is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. We also stated that\nthe Federal Reserve will, over coming months, continue to increase our holdings of\nTreasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities at least at the current pace to\n\n- 4 -\nsustain smooth market functioning and help foster accommodative financial conditions,\nthereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses.\nThe September FOMC meeting was the first since the Committee approved in\nAugust our new Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy and\nadopted a new policy framework.3 The changes we made in our September FOMC\nstatement bring our policy guidance in line with this new framework. In our new\nframework, we acknowledge that policy decisions going forward will be based on the\nFOMC’s estimates of “shortfalls [emphasis added] of employment from its maximum\nlevel”—not “deviations.” This language means that going forward, a low unemployment\nrate, in and of itself, will not be sufficient to trigger a tightening of monetary policy\nabsent any evidence from other indicators that inflation is at risk of moving above\nmandate-consistent levels. With regard to our price-stability mandate, while the new\nstatement maintains our definition that the longer-run goal for inflation is 2 percent, it\nelevates the importance—and the challenge—of keeping inflation expectations well\nanchored at 2 percent in a world in which an effective-lower-bound constraint is, in\ndownturns, binding on the federal funds rate. To this end, the new statement conveys the\nCommittee’s judgment that, in order to anchor expectations at the 2 percent level\nconsistent with price stability, it “seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over\ntime,” and—in the same sentence—that therefore “following periods when inflation has\nbeen running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to\nachieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.” As Chair Powell indicated\n3 The statement is available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review-of-monetary-policy-strategy-tools-and-\ncommunications-statement-on-longer-run-goals-monetary-policy-strategy.htm.\n\n- 5 -\nin his Jackson Hole remarks, we think of our new framework as an evolution from\n“flexible inflation targeting” to “flexible average inflation targeting.”4 While this new\nframework represents a robust evolution in our monetary policy strategy, this strategy is\nin service to the dual-mandate goals of monetary policy assigned to the Federal Reserve\nby the Congress—maximum employment and price stability—which remain unchanged.5\nConcluding Remarks\nWhile economic recovery since the spring collapse has been robust, let us not\nforget that full economic recovery from the COVID-19 recession has a long way to go.\nAlthough the unemployment rate has declined sharply since April, it remains elevated as\nof September at 7.9 percent and would be about 3 percentage points higher if labor force\nparticipation remained at February 2020 levels. Moreover, despite a recent uptick,\ninflation is still running below our 2 percent longer-run objective. It will take some time\nto return to the levels of economic activity and employment that prevailed at the business\ncycle peak in February, and additional support from monetary—and likely fiscal—policy\nwill be needed. Speaking for the Fed, I can assure you that we are committed to using\nour full range of tools to support the economy and to help ensure that the recovery from\nthis difficult period will be as robust and rapid as possible.\n4 See Jerome H.

Clarida\nVice Chair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nWashington Policy Summit\nsponsored by Institute of International Finance\nWashington, D.C.\nApril 11, 2019\n\nThank you for the opportunity to participate in the Institute of International\nFinance’s Washington Policy Summit. Before we begin our conversation, I want to share\na few thoughts about the outlook for the economy and monetary policy.1\nCurrent Economic Situation and Outlook\nThe U.S. economy is in a good place and operating close to both of the Federal\nReserve’s dual-mandate objectives of maximum employment and price stability. Real\ngross domestic product (GDP) rose about 3 percent last year, and in July, just a few\nmonths from now, the current economic expansion almost certainly will become the\nlongest on record. The unemployment rate is near the lowest level recorded in 50 years,\nand average monthly job gains have continued to outpace the increases needed over the\nlonger run to provide jobs for new entrants to the labor force. Average hourly earnings\nare showing a welcome increase consistent with a healthy labor market, yet inflation\nremains near our 2 percent objective.\nAll that said, the incoming data have revealed signs that U.S. economic growth is\nslowing somewhat from 2018’s robust pace. Prospects for foreign economic growth have\nbeen marked down, and important international risks, such as Brexit, remain. U.S.\ninflation as measured by the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index,\nwhich excludes volatile food and energy prices and is a better gauge of underlying\ninflation pressures, has been muted. And some indicators of longer-term inflation\nexpectations remain at the low end of a range that I consider consistent with our price-\nstability mandate.\n1 The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of other Federal Reserve Board members or\nFederal Open Market Committee participants. I am grateful to Brian Doyle of the Federal Reserve Board\nstaff for his assistance in preparing this text.\n\n- 2 -\nThe considerations I just mentioned have led most private-sector forecasters to\nproject that growth will continue in 2019 but at a somewhat slower pace than in 2018. At\nthe Federal Reserve, in our most recent Summary of Economic Projections, the median\nparticipant on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) projected that in 2019, GDP\ngrowth of 2 percent will be the modal, or most likely, outcome; that core PCE inflation\nwill rise to 2 percent; and that the unemployment rate will fall a bit further, to 3.7 percent,\nby the end of the year. Again, these are modal outcomes, and, of course, my FOMC\ncolleagues and I should and do factor in risks on either side of these projections in our\npolicy deliberations.\nMonetary Policy\nGiven this outlook for the U.S. economy, we decided at our March meeting that\nthe current stance of monetary policy is appropriate.2 The federal funds rate is now in the\nbroad range of estimates of neutral--the rate that tends neither to stimulate nor to restrain\nthe economy. Our baseline economic projections see economic growth for the year as a\nwhole running somewhat above the Committee’s median estimate of its longer-run trend\nand core PCE inflation remaining near our 2 percent objective. For these reasons, we\nhave indicated we can be patient as we assess what adjustments, if any, will be\nappropriate to the stance of monetary policy.\nAt our March meeting, the Committee also released revised Balance Sheet\nNormalization Principles and Plans, and it announced that the FOMC intends to slow the\n2 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2019), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC\nStatement,” press release, March 20,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20190320a.htm.\n\n- 3 -\nrunoff of our securities starting in May and to cease the runoff entirely in September.3\nThis decision is the culmination of discussions that we had over the previous four\nmeetings about our operating framework and reflects our desire to converge to a balance\nsheet that is no larger than it needs to be to conduct monetary policy efficiently and\neffectively. In September, reserve balances likely will remain above the minimum level,\nincluding a buffer, consistent with this goal. In that case, we anticipate we will likely\nhold the size of our balance sheet at the level reached in September for a time thereafter\nand let the gradual increase in other (nonreserve) liabilities, such as currency, slowly\nshrink the level of reserves. Importantly, with this decision on the size of our balance\nsheet now taken, we can turn our attention in future meetings to discussing and deciding\non the maturity composition of our System Open Market Account portfolio.\nAs you may know, last November the Federal Reserve announced that in 2019 we\nare undertaking a System review of our monetary policy strategy, tools, and\ncommunications practices. Information about this review can be found on the Federal\nReserve Board’s website.4 In this review, we will listen to a broad range of stakeholders\nat public events held around the country, and we will draw on their insights as we assess\nhow best to achieve and maintain maximum employment and price stability in the most\nrobust fashion possible. Taking these viewpoints on board, the FOMC will begin its own\ndiscussions this summer on how we might refine our framework, and we will provide a\npublic assessment after the review is complete.\n3 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2019), “Balance Sheet Normalization Principles\nand Plans,” press release, March 20,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20190320c.htm.\n4 Information about the review and the events associated with it are available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review-of-monetary-policy-strategy-tools-and-\ncommunications.htm.\n\n- 4 -\nThank you, and I look forward to our conversation.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n1:00 p.m. EDT\nMay 21, 2020\nU.S. Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy\nRemarks by\nRichard H. Clarida\nVice Chair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nNew York Association for Business Economics\nNew York, New York\n(webcast)\nMay 21, 2020\n\nIt is my pleasure to meet virtually with you today at the New York Association\nfor Business Economics.1 I have been looking forward to this session, and I am sorry\nthat I cannot join you in person, as I always value my opportunities for dialogue with\nbusiness and market economists. Since mid-March, along with my Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC) colleagues, I have been working from home. While I certainly miss\nthe opportunities for face-to-face interactions along the corridors of the Board’s Eccles\nBuilding, I am grateful to be able to work from home and want to convey my deep\ngratitude to all of those on the frontlines of the crisis, who are working outside the\ncomfort of their homes in hospitals, emergency services, and care facilities.\nCurrent Economic Situation and Outlook\nWhile the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has taken a tragic human toll\nmeasured in terms of lives lost and suffering inflicted, as a direct result of the necessary\npublic health policies put in place to mitigate and control the spread of the virus, the\npandemic has also inflicted a heavy toll on the levels of activity and employment in the\nU.S. economy. Real gross domestic product (GDP) declined at a 4.8 percent annual rate\nin the first quarter of the year and will almost surely continue to contract at an\nunprecedented pace in the second quarter. The unemployment rate, which was at a\n50-year low of 3.5 percent as recently as February, surged in April by more than\n10 percentage points to 14.7 percent, an 80-year high, and it is likely to rise further in\nMay. To put the numbers in some context, more jobs were lost in March and April of\nthis year than had been created in the previous nine years.\n1 These remarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee. I am grateful to Chiara Scotti of the Federal Reserve Board\nstaff for her assistance in preparing this text.\n\n- 2 -\nBut while the economic news has been unremittingly awful in recent weeks,\nfinancial conditions since the middle of March have eased—and considerably so in many\nmarkets. I believe—and most outside observers agree—that this easing of financial\nconditions is, at least in part, a direct consequence of the actions the Federal Reserve took\nat our March 15 meeting, the subsequent announcements over the following days of the\ncreation of nine new credit facilities to support the flow of credit to households and\ncompanies, the robust expansion of our existing foreign exchange swap arrangements\nwith major foreign central banks, and the establishment of a new FIMA (Foreign and\nInternational Monetary Authorities) Repo Facility with potential eligibility for a broad\nrange of countries.2 While this easing of financial conditions is, of course, welcome,\nwhether it proves to be durable will depend importantly on the course that the\ncoronavirus contagion takes and the duration of the downturn that it causes. At a\nminimum, the easing of financial conditions is buying some time until the economy can\nbegin to recover, growth resumes, and unemployment begins to fall.\nAs I speak to you today, there is extraordinary uncertainty about both the depth\nand the duration of the economic downturn. Because the course of the economy will\ndepend on the course of the virus and the public health policies put in place to mitigate\nand contain it, there is an unusually wide range of scenarios for the evolution of the\neconomy that could plausibly play out over the next several years. In my baseline view,\nwhile I do believe it will likely take some time for economic activity and the labor market\n2 For additional information on the Federal Reserve actions taken at the March 15 FOMC meeting, see the\nmeeting statement, which is available (along with statements from other FOMC meetings) on the Board’s\nwebsite at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.\nMore details about the new credit facilities, the expansion of foreign exchange swap arrangements, and\nthe FIMA Repo Facility, as well as other regulatory actions, can be found on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/covid-19.htm.\n\n- 3 -\nto fully recover from the pandemic shock, I do project right now that the economy will\nbegin to grow and that the unemployment rate will begin to decline starting in the second\nhalf of this year. In terms of inflation, my projection is for the COVID-19 contagion\nshock to be disinflationary, not inflationary, and the data we are seeing so far are\nconsistent with this projection. For example, core CPI (consumer price inflation) prices\nfell 0.45 percent in April, the largest monthly decrease since the beginning of the series in\n1957. While the COVID-19 shock is disrupting both aggregate demand and supply, the\nnet effect, I believe, will be for aggregate demand to decline relative to aggregate supply,\nboth in the near term and over the medium term. If so, this decrease will put downward\npressure on core inflation, which was already running somewhat below our 2 percent\nobjective when the downturn began in March. Moreover, as I have indicated previously,\nI judge that measures of longer-term inflation expectations were, when the downturn\nbegan, at the low end of a range that I consider consistent with our 2 percent inflation\nobjective.\nThe Policy Response\nAt the Federal Reserve, we take our dual-mandate obligations of maximum\nemployment and price stability very seriously, and, since March 3, we have deployed our\nentire toolkit to provide critical support to the economy during this challenging time. In\ntwo unscheduled meetings, we voted on March 3 and 15 to cut the target range for the\nfederal funds rate by a total of 150 basis points to its current range of 0 to 25 basis points.\nIn our FOMC statements, we have indicated we expect to maintain the target range at this\nlevel until we are confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track\nto achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.\n\n- 4 -\nOn March 16, we launched a program to purchase Treasury securities and agency\nmortgage-backed securities in whatever amounts needed to support smooth market\nfunctioning, thereby fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader\nfinancial conditions. To date, these purchases have totaled more than $2 trillion, and, as\nwe indicated following our April FOMC meeting, they are continuing but at a reduced\npace, reflecting the substantial improvement in market functioning that has occurred\nsince the program was launched two months ago.\nSince March 17, the Federal Reserve Board has announced the establishment of\nno fewer than nine new facilities to support the flow of credit to households and\nbusinesses. These programs are authorized under emergency lending powers granted to\nthe Fed under section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act and are available only in “unusual\nand exigent” circumstances and with the consent of the Secretary of Treasury.3 I think\nyou will agree that today we face circumstances that are both exigent and unusual. These\nfacilities are supported with money invested by the Department of the Treasury, drawing\non appropriations of more than $450 billion authorized by the Congress in the Cares Act\n(Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act) for the specific purpose of\ninvesting in Fed programs to sustain the flow of credit to households, firms, and\ncommunities during the coronavirus pandemic.\nWith these facilities, we are providing a bridge by stepping in and supporting\nlending throughout the economy until the recovery takes hold. These programs are\ndesigned to offer backstop sources of funding to the private sector, and just the\nannouncement that these backstop facilities would soon be launched appears to have\n3 See Federal Reserve Act, 12 U.S.C. § 343 (1932), quoted text in paragraph 3.A,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/section13.htm.\n\n- 5 -\nbolstered confidence in capital markets, allowing many companies to finance themselves\nprivately even before the facilities were up and running. But importantly, these are, after\nall, emergency facilities, and someday—hopefully soon—the emergency will pass.\nWhen that day comes and we are confident the economy is solidly on the road to\nrecovery, we will wind down these lending facilities at such time as we determine the\ncircumstances we confront are no longer unusual or exigent.\nNot only is the Federal Reserve using its full range of tools to support the\neconomy through this challenging time, but our policies will also help ensure that the\nrebound in activity when it commences will be as robust as possible. That said, it is\nimportant to note that the Fed’s statutory authority grants us lending powers, not\nspending powers. The Fed is not authorized to grant money to particular beneficiaries, to\nmeet the payroll expenses of small businesses, or to underwrite the unemployment\nbenefits of displaced workers. Programs to support such worthy goals reside squarely in\nthe domain of fiscal policy. The Fed can only make loans to solvent entities with the\nexpectation the loans will be paid back. Direct fiscal support for the economy is thus also\nessential to sustain economic activity and complement what monetary policy cannot\naccomplish on its own. Direct fiscal support can make a critical difference, not just in\nhelping families and businesses stay afloat in a time of need, but also in sustaining the\nproductive capacity of the economy after we emerge from this downturn.\nFortunately, the fiscal policy response in the United States to the coronavirus\nshock has been both robust and timely. In four pieces of legislation passed in just over\ntwo months, the Congress has voted $2.9 trillion in coronavirus relief, about 14 percent\nof GDP. This total includes nearly $700 billion for the Paycheck Protection Program to\n\n- 6 -\nsupport worker retention at small companies and more than $450 billion for the U.S.\nTreasury to provide first-loss equity funding for the Fed credit facilities that I discussed\nearlier. While the scale, scope, and timing of the monetary and fiscal policy responses to\nthe coronavirus pandemic are unprecedented and will certainly cushion the blow the\nshock inflicts on the economy, the shock is severe. Depending on the course the virus\ntakes and the depth and duration of the downturn it causes, additional support from both\nmonetary and fiscal policies may be called for.\nConcluding Remarks\nThe coronavirus pandemic poses the most serious threat to maximum employment\nand, potentially, to price stability that the United States has faced in our lifetimes. There\nis much that policymakers—and epidemiologists—simply do not know right now about\nthe potential course that the virus, and thus the economy, will take. But there is one thing\nthat I am certain about: The Federal Reserve will continue to act forcefully, proactively,\nand aggressively as we deploy our toolkit—including our balance sheet, forward\nguidance, and lending facilities—to provide critical support to the economy during this\nchallenging time and to do all we can to make sure that the recovery from this downturn,\nonce it commences, is as robust as possible.",

Clarida\nVice Chair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Strategies for Monetary Policy,”\na Hoover Institution Monetary Policy Conference\nStanford University\nStanford, California\nMay 3, 2019\n\nIt is an honor and a privilege to participate once again in this annual Hoover\nInstitution Monetary Policy Conference. The topic of this year’s conference, “Strategies\nfor Monetary Policy,” is especially timely. As you know, the Federal Reserve System is\nconducting a review of the strategy, tools, and communication practices we deploy to\npursue our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability. In this\nreview, we expect to benefit from the insights and perspectives that are presented today,\nas well as those offered at other conferences devoted to this topic, as we assess possible\npractical ways in which we might refine our existing monetary policy framework to\nbetter achieve our dual-mandate goals on a sustained basis.\nMy talk today will not, however, be devoted to a broad review of the Fed’s\nmonetary policy framework—that process is ongoing, and I would not want to prejudge\nthe outcome—but it will instead focus on some of the important ways in which economic\nmodels and financial market signals help me think about conducting monetary policy in\npractice after a career of thinking about it in theory.1\nThe Role of Monetary Policy\nLet me set the scene with a very brief—and certainly selective—review of the\nevolution over the past several decades of professional thinking about monetary policy. I\nwill begin with Milton Friedman’s landmark 1967 American Economic Association\npresidential address, “The Role of Monetary Policy.”2 This article is, of course, most\nfamous for its message that there is no long-run, exploitable tradeoff between inflation\n1 The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of other Federal Reserve Board members or\nFederal Open Market Committee participants. I would like to thank Ed Nelson and Bob Tetlow for their\nassistance in preparing this speech.\n2 See Friedman (1968). Recent retrospectives on Friedman’s (1968) American Economic Association\naddress that consider its implications for monetary policy analysis include Hall and Sargent (2018), Laidler\n(2018), Mankiw and Reis (2018), and Nelson (2018).\n\n- 2 -\nand unemployment. And in this paper, Friedman introduced the concept of the “natural\nrate of unemployment,” which today we call u*.3 What is less widely appreciated is that\nFriedman’s article also contains a concise but insightful discussion of Wicksell’s “natural\nrate of interest”—r* in today’s terminology—the real interest rate consistent with price\nstability. But while u* and r* provide key reference points in Friedman’s framework for\nassessing how far an economy may be from its long-run equilibrium in labor and\nfinancial markets, they play absolutely no role in the monetary policy rule he advocates:\nhis well-known k-percent rule that central banks should aim for and deliver a constant\nrate of growth of a monetary aggregate. This simple rule, he believed, could deliver\nlong-run price stability without requiring the central bank to take a stand on, model, or\nestimate either r* or u*. Although he acknowledged that shocks would push u away\nfrom u* (and, implicitly, r away from r*), Friedman felt the role of monetary policy was\nto operate with a simple quantity rule that did not itself introduce potential instability into\nthe process by which an economy on its own would converge to u* and r*.4 In\nFriedman’s policy framework, u* and r* are economic destinations, not policy rule\ninputs.\nOf course, I do not need to elaborate for this audience that the history of k-percent\nrules is that they were rarely tried, and when they were tried in the 1970s and the 1980s,\nthey were found to work much better in theory than in practice.5 Velocity relationships\n3 See Friedman (1968, pp. 8–11). At roughly the same time, Phelps (1967) derived similar results using a\nformal economic model.\n4 Another consideration motivating Friedman’s choice of rule was his concern that a more active monetary\npolicy strategy might be difficult to formulate because of the “long and variable lags” in the effect of\nmonetary policy (a term he had coined in Friedman (1948, p. 254)).\n5 See Clarida, Galí, and Gertler (1999, Result 10, p. 1687). Monetary targeting was adopted to a limited\ndegree by the Federal Reserve and other central banks in the 1970s and 1980s, but it did not endure. Even\nduring the period from 1979 to 1982, when the Federal Open Market Committee was most focused on\nmonetary aggregates, policymakers were still concerned with interest rates in the setting of policy, and\n\n- 3 -\nproved to be empirically unstable, and there was often only a very loose connection\nbetween the growth rate of the monetary base—which the central bank could control—\nand the growth rate of the broader monetary aggregates, which are more tightly linked to\neconomic activity. Moreover, the macroeconomic priority in the 1980s in the United\nStates, the United Kingdom, and other major countries was to do “whatever it takes” to\nbreak the back of inflation and to restore the credibility squandered by central banks that\nhad been unable or unwilling to provide a nominal anchor after the collapse of the\nBretton Woods system.\nBy the early 1990s, the back of inflation had been broken (thank you, Paul\nVolcker), conditions for price stability had been achieved (thank you, Alan Greenspan),\nand the time was right for something to fill the vacuum in central bank practice left by the\nrealization that monetary aggregate targeting was not, in practice, a workable monetary\npolicy framework. Although it was mostly unspoken, there was a growing sense at the\ntime that a simple, systematic framework for central bank practice was needed to ensure\nthat the hard-won gains from breaking the back of inflation were not given away by\nshort-sighted, discretionary monetary experiments that were poorly executed, such as had\nbeen the case in the 1970s.\nPolicy Rate Rules\nThat vacuum, of course, was filled by John Taylor in his classic 1993 paper,\n“Discretion vs. Policy Rules in Practice.” Again, for this audience, I will not need to\nremind you of the enormous impact this single paper had not only on the field of\nultimate objectives for the output gap and inflation figured as criteria for policy decisions. See, for\nexample, Taylor (1995, 1999), Clarida (1999), and Clarida, Galí, and Gertler (2000). In addition, Poole\n(1970) and Woodford (2003) are key references on the theoretical criticisms of monetary targeting.\n\n- 4 -\nmonetary economics, but also—and more importantly—on the practice of monetary\npolicy. For our purposes today, I will note that the crucial insight of John’s paper was\nthat, whereas a central bank could pick the “k” in a “k-percent” rule on its own, without\nany reference to the underlying parameters of the economy (including r* and u*), a well-\ndesigned rule for setting a short-term interest rate as a policy instrument should, John\nargued, respect several requirements.6 First, the rule should anchor the nominal policy\nrate at a level equal to the sum of its estimate of the neutral real interest rate (r*) and the\ninflation target. Second, to achieve this nominal anchor, the central bank should be\nprepared to raise the nominal policy rate by more than one-for-one when inflation\nexceeds target (the Taylor principle). And, third, the central bank should lean against the\nwind when output—or, via an Okun’s law relationship, the unemployment rate—deviates\nfrom its estimate of potential (u*).\nIn other words, whereas in Friedman’s k-percent policy rule u* and r* are\ndestinations irrelevant to the choice of k, in the Taylor rule—and most subsequent\nTaylor-type rules—u* and r* are necessary inputs. As Woodford (2003) demonstrates\ntheoretically, the first two requirements for a Taylor-type rule are necessary for it to be\nconsistent with the objective of price stability. The third requirement—that monetary\npolicy lean against the wind in response to an output or unemployment gap—not only\ncontributes to the objective of price stability, but is also obviously desirable from the\nperspective of a central bank like the Fed that has a dual mandate. The Taylor approach\n6 On the specification and properties of the Taylor rule, see especially Taylor (1993, 1999) as well as\nClarida, Galí, and Gertler (1999, 2000) and Woodford (2003). Another key study of simple interest rate\nrules was Henderson and McKibbin (1993). It should be noted that a Taylor type rule is an instrument rule\nfor achieving the inflation objective that enters the rule. In practice, it is one way to implement a flexible\ninflation targeting regime. See Bernanke and others (1999) and Svensson (1997, 1999) for important\ncontributions on the considerations involved in specifying an inflation-targeting monetary policy strategy.\n\n- 5 -\nto instrument-rule specification has been found to produce good macroeconomic\noutcomes across a wide range of macroeconomic models. Moreover, in a broad class of\nboth closed and open economy dynamic stochastic general equilibrium, or DSGE,\nmodels, Taylor-type rules can be shown to be optimal given the underlying micro\nfoundations of these models.\nIn original formulations of Taylor-type rules, r* was treated as constant and set\nequal to 2 percent, and potential output was set equal to the Congressional Budget Office\n(CBO) estimates of potential output, or, in specifications using the unemployment rate as\nthe activity variable, u* was set equal to the CBO’s estimate of the natural unemployment\nrate. These assumptions were reasonable at the time, and I myself wrote a number of\npapers with coauthors in the years before the Global Financial Crisis that incorporated\nthem.7\nA Dive into Data Dependence\nFast-forward to today. At each Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)\nmeeting, my colleagues and I consult potential policy rate paths implied by a number of\npolicy rules, as we assess what adjustments, if any, may be required for the stance of\nmonetary policy to achieve and maintain our dual-mandate objectives.8 A presentation\nand discussion of several of these rules has been included in the semiannual Monetary\nPolicy Report to the Congress since July 2017.9 One thing I have come to appreciate is\n7 See, for example, Clarida, Galí, and Gertler (1999, 2000).\n8 For the FOMC’s description of its mandate, see the FOMC’s (2019) Statement on Longer-Run Goals and\nMonetary Policy Strategy. The FOMC first adopted this statement in January 2012 and has reaffirmed the\nstatement at the start of each subsequent year (including this year, when all 17 FOMC participants\nsupported it).\n9 The box “Monetary Policy Rules and Systematic Monetary Policy” in the Board’s February 2019\nMonetary Policy Report (MPR) describes how simple policy rules are used in theory and in practical\npolicymaking. See Board of Governors (2019). The box “Complexities of Monetary Policy Rules” in the\nJuly 2018 MPR discusses how shifts in r* complicate monetary policy decision making. See Board of\n\n- 6 -\nthat, as I assess the benefits and costs of alternative policy scenarios based on a set of\npolicy rules and economic projections, it is important to recognize up front that key\ninputs to this assessment, including u* and r*, are unobservable and must be inferred\nfrom data via models.10 I would now like to discuss how I incorporate such\nconsiderations into thinking about how to choose among monetary policy alternatives.\nA monetary policy strategy must find a way to combine incoming data and a\nmodel of the economy with a healthy dose of judgment—and humility!—to formulate,\nand then communicate, a path for the policy rate most consistent with the central bank’s\nobjectives. There are two distinct ways in which I think that the path for the federal\nfunds rate should be data dependent.11 Monetary policy should be data dependent in the\nsense that incoming data reveal at any point in time where the economy is relative to the\nultimate objectives of price stability and maximum employment. This information on\nwhere the economy is relative to the goals of monetary policy is an important input into\ninterest rate feedback rules—after all, they have to feed back on something. Data\ndependence in this sense is well understood, as it is of the type implied by a large family\nof policy rules, including Taylor-type rules discussed earlier, in which the parameters of\nthe economy needed to formulate such rules are taken as known.\nBut, of course, key parameters needed to formulate such rules, including u* and\nr*, are unknown. As a result, in the real world, monetary policy should be—and in the\nUnited States, I believe, is—data dependent in a second sense: Policymakers should and\nGovernors (2018). A note, titled “Policy Rules and How Policymakers Use Them,” on the Board’s website\ncovers similar ground and is available at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/policy-rules-and-\nhow-policymakers-use-them.htm.\n10 As Friedman once put it, “I don’t know what the natural rate is, neither do you, and neither does anyone\nelse” (quoted in Bennett (1995)).\n11 See Clarida (2018a, 2018b).\n\n- 7 -\ndo study incoming data and use models to extract signals that enable them to update and\nimprove estimates of r* and u*. As indicated in the Summary of Economic Projections,\nFOMC participants have, over the past seven years, repeatedly revised down their\nestimates of both u* and r* as unemployment fell and real interest rates remained well\nbelow prior estimates of neutral without the rise in inflation those earlier estimates would\nhave predicted (figures 1 and 2). And these revisions to u* and r* appeared to have had\nan important influence on the path for the policy rate actually implemented in recent\nyears. One could interpret any changes in the conduct of policy as a shift in the central\nbank’s reaction function. But in my view, when such changes result from revised\nestimates of u* or r*, they merely reflect an updating of an existing reaction function.\nIn addition to u* and r*, another important input into any monetary policy\nassessment is the state of inflation expectations. Since the late 1990s, inflation\nexpectations appear to have been stable and are often said to be “well anchored.”\nHowever, inflation expectations are not directly observable; they must be inferred from\nmodels, other macroeconomic information, market prices, and surveys. Longer-term\ninflation expectations that are anchored materially above or below the 2 percent inflation\nobjective present a risk to price stability. For this reason, policymakers should and do\nstudy incoming data to extract signals that can be used to update and improve estimates\nof expected inflation. In many theoretical rational expectations models, expected\ninflation is anchored at the target level by assumption. From a risk-management\nperspective, it makes sense, I believe, to regularly test this assumption against empirical\nevidence.\n\n- 8 -\nFinancial Markets and Monetary Policy—Extracting Signal from Noise\nBecause the true model of the economy is unknown, either because the structure\nis unknown or because the parameters of a known structure are evolving, I believe\npolicymakers should consult a number and variety of sources of information about\nneutral real interest rates and expected inflation, to name just two key macroeconomic\nvariables. Because macroeconomic models of r* and long-term inflation expectations are\npotentially misspecified, seeking out other sources of information that are not derived\nfrom the same models can be especially useful. To be sure, financial market signals are\ninevitably noisy, and day-to-day movements in asset prices are unlikely to tell us much\nabout the cyclical or structural position of the economy.12 However, persistent shifts in\nfinancial market conditions can be informative, and signals derived from financial market\ndata—along with surveys of households, firms, and market participants, data, as well as\noutside forecasts—can be an important complement to estimates obtained from\nhistorically estimated and calibrated macroeconomic models.13\n12 Uncertainty regarding r*, u*, and long-term inflation expectations is not the only source of uncertainty\nthat has implications for monetary policy. Edge, Laubach, and Williams (2005) show how the duration of a\nproductivity shock can affect even the direction of the best monetary policy response. Erceg and others\n(2018) find that even in conditions of substantial output gap uncertainty and uncertainty about the slope of\nthe Phillips curve, a notable response to the estimated output gap in a Taylor-type rule is generally\nbeneficial. And Eusepi and Preston (2018) show that replacing model-consistent expectations with forms\nof adaptive learning means that some, but not all, of the key results regarding best conduct in monetary\npolicy under full information carry through.\n13 Like many others, I believe that monetary policy should respond to financial market fluctuations when\nthey have material implications for our outlook for employment and inflation, but monetary policy should\nnot generally target asset prices themselves.\nThe Federal Reserve uses survey data and conducts surveys of its own on a range of macroeconomic and\nfinancial conditions. Among the surveys the Fed conducts are the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on\nBank Lending Practices and the Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms. In\naddition, the staff at the Federal Reserve Board uses disaggregated and high-frequency data to estimate the\nstate of the economy in real time. Such data include disaggregated labor market data from ADP and data\non expenditures from credit card transactions.\n\n- 9 -\nInterest rate futures and interest rate swaps markets provide one source of high-\nfrequency information about the path and destination for the federal funds rate expected\nby market participants (figure 3). Interest rate option markets, under certain assumptions,\ncan offer insights about the entire ex ante probability distribution of policy rate outcomes\nfor calendar dates near or far into the future (figure 4). And, indeed, when one reads that\na future policy decision by the Fed or any central bank is “fully priced in,” this is usually\nbased on a “straight read” of futures and options prices. But these signals from interest\nrate derivatives markets are only a pure measure of the expected policy rate path under\nthe assumption of a zero risk premium. For this reason, it is useful to compare policy rate\npaths derived from market prices with the path obtained from surveys of market\nparticipants, which, while subject to measurement error, should not be contaminated with\na term premium. Market- and survey-based estimates of the policy rate path are often\nhighly correlated. But when there is a divergence between the path or destination for the\npolicy rate implied by the surveys and a straight read of interest rate derivatives prices, I\nplace at least as much weight on the survey evidence (for example, derived from the\nsurveys of primary dealers and market participants conducted by the Federal Reserve\nBank of New York) as I do on the estimates obtained from market prices (figure 3).\nThe Treasury yield curve can provide another source of information about the\nexpected path and ultimate longer-run destination of the policy rate. But, again, the yield\ncurve, like the interest rate futures strip, reflects not only expectations of the path of\nshort-term interest rates, but also liquidity and term premium factors Thus, to extract\nsignal about policy from noise in the yield curve, a term structure model is required. But\ndifferent term structure models can and do produce different estimates of the expected\n\n- 10 -\npath for policy and thus the term premium. Moreover, fluctuations in the term premium\non U.S. Treasury yields are driven in part by a significant “global” factor, which\ncomplicates efforts to treat the slope of the yield curve as a sufficient statistic for the\nexpected path of U.S. monetary policy (Clarida, 2018c). Again, here, surveys of market\nparticipants can provide useful information—for example, about “the expected average\nfederal funds rate over the next 10 years,” which provides an alternative way to identify\nthe term premium component in the U.S. Treasury curve.\nQuotes from the Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) market can\nprovide valuable information about two key inputs to monetary policy analysis: long-run\nr* and expected inflation.14 Direct reads of TIPS spot rates and forward rates are signals\nof the levels of real interest rates that investors expect at various horizons, and they can\nbe used to complement model-based estimates of r*. In addition, TIPS market data,\ntogether with nominal Treasury yields, can be used to construct measures of “breakeven\ninflation” or inflation compensation that provide a noisy signal of market expectations of\nfuture inflation. But, again, a straight read of breakeven inflation needs to be augmented\nwith a model to filter out the liquidity and risk premium components that place a wedge\nbetween inflation compensation and expected inflation.\nAs is the case with the yield curve and interest rate futures, it is useful to compare\nestimates of expected inflation derived from breakeven inflation data with estimates of\nexpected inflation obtained from surveys—for example, the expected inflation over the\n14 Well before the launch of the TIPS market, Friedman (1984) stressed the benefits to monetary policy\nanalysis that would arise from the availability of market-based estimates of longer-term inflation\nexpectations, and he contrasted that situation with the one then prevailing, in which it was difficult to\nascertain the real yields implied by the market’s longer-term nominal yields. In a similar vein, Campbell\nand Clarida (1987, p. 105) observed—also in the pre-TIPS era—that “it is hard to measure expected long-\nterm inflation rates.”\n\n- 11 -\nnext 5 to 10 years from the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers (figure 5).\nMarket- and survey-based estimates of expected inflation are correlated, but, again, when\nthere is a divergence between the two, I place at least as much weight on the survey\nevidence as on the market-derived estimates.\nThe examples I have mentioned illustrate the important point that, in practice,\nthere is not typically a clean distinction between “model-based” and “market-based”\ninference of key economic variables such as r* and expected inflation. The reason is that\nmarket prices reflect not only market expectations, but also risk and liquidity premiums\nthat need to be filtered out to recover the object of interest—for example, expected\ninflation or long-run r*. This filtering almost always requires a model of some sort, so\neven market-based estimates of key inputs to monetary policy are, to some extent, model\ndependent.\nImplications for Monetary Policy\nLet me now draw together some implications of the approach to models, markets,\nand monetary policy I have laid out in these remarks. Macroeconomic models are, of\ncourse, an essential tool for monetary policy analysis, but the structure of the economy\nevolves, and the policy framework must be—and I believe, at the Federal Reserve, is—\nnimble enough to respect this evolution. While financial market signals can and\nsometimes do provide a reality check on the predictions of “a model gone astray,” market\nprices are, at best, noisy signals of the macroeconomic variables of interest, and the\nprocess of filtering out the noise itself requires a model—and good judgment. Survey\nestimates of the long-run destination for key monetary policy inputs can—and, at the Fed,\n\n- 12 -\ndo—complement the predictions from macro models and market prices (figure 6).15 Yes,\nthe Fed’s job would be (much) easier if the real world of 2019 satisfied the requirements\nto run Friedman’s k-percent policy rule, but it does not and has not for at least 50 years,\nand our policy framework must and does reflect this reality.\nThis reality includes the fact that the U.S. economy is in a very good place. The\nunemployment rate is at a 50-year low, real wages are rising in line with productivity,\ninflationary pressures are muted, and expected inflation is stable. Moreover, the federal\nfunds rate is now in the range of estimates of its longer-run neutral level, and the\nunemployment rate is not far below many estimates of u*. Plugging these estimates into\na 1993 Taylor rule produces a federal funds rate very close to our current target range for\nthe policy rate.16 So with the economy operating at or very close to the Fed’s dual-\nmandate objectives and with the policy rate in the range of FOMC participants’ estimates\nof neutral, we can, I believe, afford to be data dependent—in both senses of the term as I\nhave discussed—as we assess what, if any, further adjustments in our policy stance might\nbe required to maintain our dual-mandate objectives of maximum employment and price\nstability.\n15 It is important to note that the range of model estimates that is shown in the shaded portion of figure 6 is\nnot a confidence interval. If parameter uncertainty in the estimates was allowed for, the range would be\nwider still. Yield curve data can also be used to compute estimates of the neutral rate of interest, as in\nBauer and Rudebusch (2019).\n16 Figure 7 summarizes the overall pattern displayed over time of various model-based estimates of r*.\nRecent r* estimates from the models considered, as well as their confidence intervals, are shown in figure\n8.

Clarida\nVice Chair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nPeterson Institute for International Economics\nWashington, D.C.\n(via webcast)\nAugust 31, 2020\n\nLast week, the Federal Reserve reached an important milestone in its ongoing\nreview of its monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices with the\nunanimous approval and release of a new Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary\nPolicy Strategy.1 In my remarks today, I will discuss our new framework and highlight\nsome important policy implications that flow from the revised statement and our new\nstrategy.2 I believe that this new statement and strategy represent a critical and robust\nevolution of our framework that will best equip the Federal Reserve to achieve our dual-\nmandate objectives on a sustained basis in the world in which we conduct policy today\nand for the foreseeable future.\nI will divide my remarks into four parts. First, I will discuss the factors that\nmotivated the Federal Reserve in November 2018 to announce it would undertake in\n2019 the first-ever public review of its monetary policy strategy, tools, and\ncommunication practices. Second, I will discuss the review process itself, with particular\nfocus on the economic analysis and public input the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC) drew on as it contemplated, over the past 18 months, potential changes to its\npolicy framework. Third, I will briefly summarize the flexible inflation-targeting\nstrategy that has been guiding U.S. monetary policy since 2012 in the context of some\nimportant changes in the economic landscape that have become evident since 2012.\n1 The revised statement is available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals.pdf. Last week, Chair\nPowell made the review and the revised statement the focus of his speech at “Navigating the Decade\nAhead: Implications for Monetary Policy,” a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of\nKansas City and held in Jackson Hole, Wyoming; see Powell (2020).\n2 The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of other Federal Reserve Board members or\nFederal Open Market Committee participants. I would like to thank Etienne Gagnon, Ellen Meade, Jon\nFaust, and Trevor Reeve for their assistance in preparing these remarks, and Thomas Laubach for sharing\nwith me throughout the review process his many keen insights on monetary policy strategy and\ncommunication.\n\n- 2 -\nFourth, I will discuss the major findings of the review as codified in our new Statement\non Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy and highlight some important policy\nimplications that flow from them. Finally, I will offer some brief concluding remarks\nbefore joining in conversation with my good friend Adam Posen, which, as always, I very\nmuch look forward to.\nMotivation for the Review\nAs my FOMC colleagues and I indicated from the outset, the fact that the Federal\nReserve System chose to conduct this review does not indicate that we believed we have\nbeen poorly served by the framework in place since 2012. Indeed, I would argue that\nover the past eight years, the framework served us well and supported the Federal\nReserve’s efforts after the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) first to achieve and then, for\nseveral years, to sustain—until cut short this spring by the COVID-19 pandemic—the\noperation of the economy at or close to both our statutorily assigned goals of maximum\nemployment and price stability in what became the longest economic expansion in U.S.\nhistory. Nonetheless, both the U.S. economy—and, equally importantly, our\nunderstanding of the economy—have clearly evolved along several crucial dimensions\nsince 2012, and we believed that in 2019 it made sense to step back and assess whether,\nand in what possible ways, we might refine and rethink our strategy, tools, and\ncommunication practices to achieve and sustain our goals as consistently and robustly as\npossible in the global economy in which we operate today and for the foreseeable future.3\nPerhaps the most significant change since 2012 in our understanding of the\neconomy is our reassessment of the neutral real interest rate, r*, that, over the longer run,\n3 For a discussion of the elements that motivated the launch of the review and of how the previous policy\nframework had served us, see Clarida (2019b). See also Powell (2019a).\n\n- 3 -\nis consistent with our maximum-employment and price-stability mandates. In January\n2012, the median FOMC participant projected a long-run r* of 2.25 percent, which, in\ntandem with the inflation goal of 2 percent, indicated a neutral setting for the federal\nfunds rate of 4.25 percent. However, in the eight years since 2012, members of the\nCommittee—as well as outside forecasters and financial market participants—have\nrepeatedly marked down their estimates of longer-run r* and, thus, the neutral nominal\npolicy rate.4 Indeed, as of the most recent Summary of Economic Projections (SEP)\nreleased in June, the median FOMC participant currently projects a longer-run r* equal to\njust 0.5 percent, which implies a neutral setting for the federal funds rate of 2.5 percent.\nMoreover, as is well appreciated, the decline in neutral policy rates since the GFC is a\nglobal phenomenon that is widely expected by forecasters and financial markets to persist\nfor years to come.5\nThe substantial decline in the neutral policy rate since 2012 has critical\nimplications for the design, implementation, and communication of Federal Reserve\nmonetary policy because it leaves the FOMC with less conventional policy space to cut\nrates to offset adverse shocks to aggregate demand. With a diminished reservoir of\nconventional policy space, it is much more likely than was appreciated in 2012 that, in\n4 See Chair Powell’s address in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, last week (Powell, 2020) for an illustration of the\nrevisions to the macroeconomic projections—including for the longer-run neutral federal funds rate—of\nFOMC participants as well as private and public forecasters. The downward revisions to r* over time have\nbeen informed, in part, by the general fall in interest rates and by econometric evidence that suggests that\nthis fall is of a permanent rather than a cyclical nature. See, among many contributors, Hamilton and others\n(2016), Johannsen and Mertens (2018), Laubach and Williams (2016), Del Negro and others (2017), and\nLópez-Salido and others (2020). For discussions of the various factors that might have contributed to this\nfall, see Fischer (2016) and Rachel and Smith (2017).\n5 For evidence on the global nature of the decline in r*, see King and Low (2014); Holston, Laubach, and\nWilliams (2017); Wynne and Zhang (2018); and Del Negro and others (2019). For a discussion of global\nconsiderations for U.S. monetary policy, see Obstfeld (2020).\n\n- 4 -\neconomic downturns, the effective lower bound (ELB) will constrain the ability of the\nFOMC to rely solely on the federal funds rate instrument to offset adverse shocks.6 This\ndevelopment, in turn, makes it more likely that recessions will impart elevated risks of\nmore persistent downward pressure on inflation and upward pressure on unemployment\nthat the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy should, in design and implementation, seek to\noffset throughout the business cycle and not just in downturns themselves.7\nTwo other, related developments that have also become more evident than they\nappeared in 2012 are that price inflation seems less responsive to resource slack, and also,\nthat estimates of resource slack based on historically estimated price Phillips curve\nrelationships are less reliable and subject to more material revision than was once\ncommonly believed.8 For example, in the face of declining unemployment rates that did\nnot result in excessive cost-push pressure to price inflation, the median of the\nCommittee’s projections of u*—the rate of unemployment consistent in the longer run\nwith the 2 percent inflation objective—has been repeatedly revised lower, from\n6 For assessments of the risk that the federal funds rate will be constrained by the ELB in the future, along\nwith policy strategies that might mitigate that risk, see Kiley and Roberts (2017); Chung and others (2019);\nHebden and López-Salido (2018); and Bernanke, Kiley, and Roberts (2019).\n7 For pre-GFC discussions of the macroeconomic consequences of policy rates being constrained by the\nELB, see Krugman (1998), Eggertsson and Woodford (2003), and Adam and Billi (2007). For the GFC\nand its aftermath, using a time-series approach, Eberly, Stock, and Wright (2020) estimate that, in the\nabsence of the ELB constraint, the labor market recovery would have proceeded at a significantly more\nrapid pace than was observed, whereas core inflation would have been only modestly higher because of\ninflation’s limited sensitivity to resource slack. Using a DSGE (dynamic stochastic general equilibrium)\napproach, the mean estimates of Gust and others (2017) suggest that a binding ELB accounted for about\n30 percent (roughly 2 percentage points) of the 6 percent contraction in gross domestic product in 2009\nrelative to the peak in 2007 and was responsible for an even larger fraction of the ensuing slow recovery.\n8 For evidence of a flattening of the slope of the Phillips curve in the United States and abroad, see, among\nothers, Simon, Matheson, and Sandri (2013); Blanchard, Cerutti, and Summers (2015); and Pfajfar and\nRoberts (2018). The difficulties in assessing shortfalls from maximum employment using measures of the\nunemployment rate has motivated researchers to explore alternative approaches. See Abraham,\nHaltiwanger, and Rendell (2020) for an approach based on the job search and matching framework. See\nalso the staff discussion of various concepts of unemployment rate benchmarks by Crump, Nekarda, and\nPetrosky-Nadeau (2020), which was prepared as background materials for this review.\n\n- 5 -\n5.5 percent in January 2012 to 4.1 percent as of the June 2020 SEP.9 Projections of u* by\nthe Congressional Budget Office and professional forecasters show a similar decline\nduring this same period and for the same reason.10 In the past several years of the\nprevious expansion, declines in the unemployment rate occurred in tandem with a notable\nand, to me, welcome increase in real wages that was accompanied by an increase in\nlabor’s share of national income, but not a surge in price inflation to a pace inconsistent\nwith our price-stability mandate and well-anchored inflation expectations. Indeed, this\npattern of mid-cycle declines in unemployment coincident with noninflationary increases\nin real wages has been evident in the U.S. data since the 1990s.11\nWith regard to inflation expectations, there is broad agreement among academics\nand policymakers that achieving price stability on a sustainable basis requires that\ninflation expectations be well anchored at the rate of inflation consistent with the price-\nstability goal. This is especially true in the world that prevails today, with flat Phillips\ncurves in which the primary determinant of actual inflation is expected inflation.12 The\n9 The large degree of uncertainty attached to estimates of r*, u*, the slope of the (short-run) Phillips curve,\nand other key economic objects adds additional risk-management considerations in the conduct of\nmonetary policy, especially in a low r* environment in which the federal funds rate is likely to be\nconstrained by the ELB. See Powell (2019b) for a discussion of the implications for monetary policy and\nmy recent remarks in Clarida (2020). See also the model-based analyses of Erceg and others (2018), Ajello\nand others (2020), and Hebden and others (2020).\n10 See Powell (2020) for an illustration. See also Caldara and others (2020) for a discussion of how\nrepeated surprises in macroeconomic forecasts affect inference about the appropriate stance of policy.\n11 See Clarida (2016, 2019c) and Heise, Karahan, and Şahin (2020) for discussions.\n12 See Yellen (2015) for a discussion of inflation dynamics and monetary policy and Erceg and others\n(2018) for a quantitative exploration of the monetary policy implications of a flat Phillips curve in an\nuncertain economic environment. Since the mid-1980s, movements in both realized inflation and measures\nof longer-term inflation expectations have been somewhat muted, complicating the task of extracting the\nprecise role of inflation expectations as a determinant of realized inflation. Faust and Wright (2013) review\nthe literature on inflation forecasting and present evidence in support of the conclusion that measures of\nlonger-run inflation expectations help predict inflation. Mavroeidis, Plagborg-Møller, and Stock (2014)\ndiscuss the challenges of identifying the precise role of expectations in determining actual inflation.\nCecchetti and others (2017) suggest that, in a low and stable inflation environment, policymakers should\npay attention to a wide array of indicators in determining the implications for monetary policy of\nmovements in realized inflation and measures of inflation expectations.\n\n- 6 -\npre-GFC academic literature derived the important result that a credible inflation-\ntargeting monetary policy strategy that is not constrained by the ELB can deliver, under\nrational expectations, inflation expectations that themselves are well anchored at the\ninflation target.13 In other words, absent a binding ELB constraint, a policy that targets\nactual inflation in these models delivers long-run inflation expectations well anchored at\nthe target “for free.” But this “copacetic coincidence” no longer holds in a world of low\nr* in which adverse aggregate demand shocks are expected to drive the economy in at\nleast some downturns to the ELB. In this case, which is obviously relevant today,\neconomic analysis indicates that flexible inflation-targeting monetary policy cannot be\nrelied on to deliver inflation expectations that are anchored at the target, but instead will\ntend to deliver inflation expectations that, in each business cycle, become anchored at a\nlevel below the target.14 This is the crucial insight in my colleague John Williams’\nresearch with Thomas Mertens. Indeed John’s research over the past 20 years on r*\nestimation and monetary policy design at the ELB have been enormously influential, not\nonly in the profession but also at Fed and certainly in my own thinking about how our\nframework should evolve. This downward bias in inflation expectations under inflation\ntargeting in an ELB world can in turn reduce already scarce policy space—because\nnominal interest rates reflect both real rates and expected inflation—and it can open up\nthe risk of the downward spiral in both actual and expected inflation that has been\nobserved in some other major economies.\n13 See Bernanke and others (1999) for a review of the considerations that led to the adoption of inflation-\ntargeting frameworks and the early international experience. See Svensson (1997), Clarida, Galí, and\nGertler (1999), and Woodford (2003) for conceptual treatments of inflation targeting, including of rational\nexpectations.\n14 See Mertens and Williams (2019) and Bianchi, Melosi, and Rottner (2019).\n\n- 7 -\nInflation expectations are, of course, not directly observed and must be\nimperfectly inferred from surveys, financial market data, and econometric models. Each\nof these sources contains noise as well as signal, and they can and sometimes do give\ncontradictory readings. But, at minimum, the failure of actual PCE (personal\nconsumption expenditures) inflation—core or headline—over the past eight years to\nreach the 2 percent goal on a sustained basis cannot have contributed favorably to\nkeeping inflation expectations anchored at 2 percent. Indeed, my reading of the evidence\nis that the various measures of inflation expectations I follow reside at the low end of a\nrange I consider consistent with our 2 percent inflation goal.15\nThe Review Process\nWith this brief overview of important changes in the economic landscape since\n2012, I would now like to discuss the review process itself. In November 2018, the\nFederal Reserve announced that in 2019 the System would undertake a wide-ranging,\npublic review of its monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices. This\ninitiative would be the first-ever public review of monetary policy strategy ever\nundertaken by the Fed. From the outset, it was conceived that the review would build on\nthree pillars: a series of livestreamed Fed Listens events hosted by each of the\n12 Reserve Banks and the Board, a flagship research conference hosted by the Federal\nReserve Bank of Chicago, and a series of 13 rigorous briefings for the Committee by\nSystem staff at a succession of five consecutive FOMC meetings commencing in July\n2019 and running through January 2020.\n15 See Clarida (2020).\n\n- 8 -\nThe Fed Listens series built on a long-standing practice at the Reserve Banks and\nthe Board of hosting outreach events that included a wide range of community groups,\nbut, by focusing on a common format in which representatives of these groups were\nencouraged to tell their stories about our policies’ effect on their communities and daily\nlives, it became a potent vehicle for us to better connect with the people our policies are\nmeant to benefit. Although many people across the System were involved in making Fed\nListens the success it was, I would be more than remiss if I did not single out Ellen\nMeade for her indefatigable contributions and attention to detail and organization that\nwere essential to pulling the whole thing off. A report on the Fed Listens series is\navailable on the Board’s web site.16\nThe second pillar of our review, a research conference hosted by the Federal\nReserve Bank of Chicago, brought together some of the world’s leading academic experts\nin monetary economics to present bespoke papers on a range of topics central to the\nreview. These papers and the robust discussion at the conference that they stimulated\nwere an important input to the review process. The proceedings of the Chicago\nconference are available as a special January 2020 issue of the International Journal of\nCentral Banking.17\nThe third important pillar of the review is a collection of 13 memos prepared by\nSystem staff and discussed by the Committee at a number of FOMC meetings over the\npast 18 months. These memos were commissioned by a System steering committee that\n16 See Board of Governors (2020).\n17 This special issue, which includes five of the seven papers presented at the research conference, is\navailable on the journal’s website at https://www.ijcb.org/journal/ijcb2002.htm. The conference program,\nconference drafts, presentations, and video recordings of the sessions can be found on the Board’s website\nat https://www.federalreserve.gov/conferences/conference-monetary-policy-strategy-tools-\ncommunications-20190605.htm.\n\n- 9 -\nincluded Jeff Fuhrer, Marc Giannoni, and David Altig, with extensive input from Trevor\nReeve. Thomas Laubach chaired the steering committee, and I must note that we simply\nwould not be here today discussing this significant evolution of our framework without\nThomas and the insights, inspiration, and good judgment that he brought to the project\nand the review process. A collection of the staff memos prepared for the review is now\navailable on the Board’s website.18\nA New Economic Landscape Compels a Framework ReThink\nAs I mentioned earlier, the Committee devoted five consecutive FOMC meetings\nbetween July 2019 and January 2020 to presentations by the staff and Committee\ndiscussions of memos touching on various aspects of the framework review, and it held a\nlengthy discussion at the July 2020 FOMC meeting about the new Statement on Longer-\nRun Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.19 While it is fair to say that these Committee\ndiscussions revealed among the 17 participants a healthy range of views about and\npriorities for refining our framework and strategy, some common themes did emerge, and\nthese provided the foundation for the revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and\nMonetary Policy Strategy that the Committee discussed in July, approved last week, and\nreleased on Thursday, August 27.\nBroadly, we agreed that the economic landscape has changed in important ways\nsince 2012 and that, as a result, the existing statement and the monetary policy strategy\n18 An overview of the System staff work in support of the review is presented in Altig and others (2020).\nFederal Reserve staff analysis on the Fed Listens initiative was presented and discussed at the December\n2019 FOMC meeting and is part of the Fed Listens report.\n19 Summaries of these discussions can be found in the minutes of these FOMC meetings, which are\naccessible on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.\n\n- 10 -\nthat flows from it need as well to evolve along several dimensions.20 For example, under\nour previous flexible inflation-targeting framework, the Federal Reserve declared that the\n2 percent inflation objective is “symmetric.” This term has been interpreted by many\nobservers to mean that the Committee’s reaction function aimed to be symmetric on\neither side of the 2 percent inflation goal, and that the FOMC set policy with the (ex ante)\naim that the 2 percent goal should represent an inflation ceiling in economic expansions\nfollowing economic downturns in which inflation falls below target. Regarding the ELB,\nthe previous statement was silent on the global decline in neutral policy rates, the\nlikelihood that the ELB will constrain monetary policy space in economic downturns, and\nthe implications of this constraint for our ability to achieve our dual-mandate goals. As\nfor inflation expectations, the previous statement did discuss expected inflation, but only\nin the context of mentioning that the announcement of a 2 percent goal helps anchor\ninflation expectations. While this is certainly true, it does beg the deeper question of how\nwell anchored inflation expectations can be if the 2 percent goal is seen by the public\nas—and turns out ex post to be—a ceiling. Regarding the maximum-employment leg of\nthe dual mandate, the previous statement’s discussion of minimizing “deviations” of\nemployment from its maximum level does not adequately reflect how the FOMC has\nactually conducted monetary policy in recent years—before the pandemic—as the actual\nunemployment rate was declining and, for several years, remained below SEP median\n20 The FOMC published the statement for the first time alongside its January 2012 postmeeting statement;\nthe document is available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20120125c.htm. This statement has\nbeen reaffirmed each year, and was updated in 2016 to include the language on symmetry. The version of\nthe statement that prevailed at the start of the review, which was affirmed in January 2019, can be found on\nthe Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20190130b.htm.\n\n- 11 -\nprojections of u* (although, to be sure, the earlier statement did acknowledge that it can\nbe difficult to estimate the maximum level of employment with precision).21\nThe New Statement and Strategy\nBefore discussing how our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy\nStrategy has evolved, let me highlight some important elements that remain unchanged.\nFirst and foremost, our policy framework and strategy remain focused exclusively on\nmeeting the dual mandate assigned to us by the Congress. Second, our statement\ncontinues to note that the maximum level of employment that we are mandated to achieve\nis not directly measurable and changes over time for reasons unrelated to monetary\npolicy. Hence, we continue not to specify a numerical goal for our employment objective\nas we do for inflation. Third, we continue to state that an inflation rate of 2 percent over\nthe longer run is most consistent with our mandate to promote both maximum\nemployment and price stability. Finally, because the effect of monetary policy on the\neconomy operates with a lag, our strategy remains forward looking. As a result, our\npolicy actions depend on the economic outlook as well as the risks to the outlook, and we\ncontinue in the new statement to highlight potential risks to the financial system that\ncould impede the attainment of our dual-mandate goals on a sustained basis.\nWith respect to the new framework itself, the statement now notes that the neutral\nlevel of the federal funds rate has declined relative to its historical average and therefore\nthat the policy rate is more likely than in the past to be constrained by its ELB, and,\nmoreover, that this binding ELB constraint is likely to impart downside risks to inflation\nand employment that the Committee needs to consider in implementing its monetary\n21 See my earlier remarks on these aspects in Clarida (2018a, 2018b, 2019a).\n\n- 12 -\npolicy strategy. In this regard, the statement now highlights that the Committee is\nprepared to use its full range of tools to achieve its dual-mandate objectives.22\nRegarding the maximum-employment mandate, the new statement now\nacknowledges that maximum employment is a “broad-based and inclusive goal” and\ncontinues to state that the FOMC considers a wide range of indicators to assess the level\nof maximum employment consistent with this broad-based goal. However, under our\nnew framework, policy decisions going forward will be based on the FOMC’s estimates\nof “shortfalls of employment from its maximum level”—not “deviations.”23 This change\nconveys our judgment that a low unemployment rate by itself, in the absence of evidence\nthat price inflation is running or is likely to run persistently above mandate-consistent\nlevels or pressing financial stability concerns, will not, under our new framework, be a\nsufficient trigger for policy action.24 This is a robust evolution in the Federal Reserve’s\npolicy framework and, to me, reflects the reality that econometric models of maximum\nemployment, while essential inputs to monetary policy, can be and have been wrong, and,\nmoreover, that a decision to tighten monetary policy based solely on a model without any\nother evidence of excessive cost-push pressure that puts the price-stability mandate at risk\nis difficult to justify, given the significant cost to the economy if the model turns out to be\n22 FOMC participants discussed the benefits, limitations, and risks associated with policy tools other than\nthe setting of the federal funds rate target at various points during the review. See, notably, the summaries\nof FOMC participants’ discussions at the July 2019 and October 2019 meetings—available on the Board’s\nwebsite at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm—which covered,\nrespectively, the performance of these tools during the GFC and its aftermath and issues pertaining to the\nuse of these tools in the future. See also the analyses of Sims and Wu (2020), Caldara and others (2020),\nCampbell and others (2020), and Carlson and others (2020), prepared for this review.\n23 Italics added for emphasis.\n24 For a discussion of financial stability considerations in the conduct of monetary policy, see Kashyap and\nSiegert (2020) and Goldberg and others (2020), prepared as part of this review.\n\n- 13 -\nwrong and given the ability of monetary policy to respond if the model were eventually\nto turn out to be right.25\nWith regard to the price-stability mandate, while the new statement maintains our\ndefinition that the longer-run goal for inflation is 2 percent, it elevates the importance—\nand the challenge—of keeping inflation expectations “well anchored at 2 percent” (and\nnot just “well anchored”) in a world of low r* and an ELB constraint that is binding in\ndownturns.26 To this end, the new statement conveys the Committee’s judgment that, in\norder to anchor expectations at 2 percent, it “seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2\npercent over time,” and—in the same sentence—that therefore “following periods when\ninflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will\nlikely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.” This is the\nsecond robust evolution of our framework, and it reflects the inherent asymmetry of\nconducting monetary policy in a low r* world with an ELB constraint that binds in\neconomic downturns. As discussed earlier, if policy seeks only to return inflation to 2\npercent following a downturn in which the ELB has constrained policy, an inflation-\ntargeting monetary policy will tend to generate inflation that averages less than 2 percent,\nwhich, in turn, will tend to put persistent downward pressure on inflation expectations\n25 As I stated in Clarida (2019a, paragraph 17), “For example, were models to predict a surge in inflation, a\ndecision for preemptive hikes before the surge is evident in actual data would need to be balanced against\nthe cost of the model being wrong.” One major cost of withdrawing policy accommodation prematurely\nduring an economic expansion is that it prevents job opportunities from reaching all communities. A clear\ntakeaway from our Fed Listens events is that the strong job market that preceded the pandemic was\nespecially beneficial to members of low- and moderate-income communities. The prolonged economic\nexpansion not only helped create job opportunities for marginalized groups and cement their attachment to\nthe labor force, but, as we heard at these events, it also more generally strengthened families, businesses,\nand communities. See Aaronson and others (2019) for a discussion of how a strong labor market helped\naddress labor market disparities in the previous economic expansion. See also Feiveson and others (2020)\nfor a discussion of distributional considerations and monetary policy.\n26 Italics added for emphasis.\n\n- 14 -\nand, potentially, on available policy space. In order to offset this downward bias, our\nnew framework recognizes that monetary policy during economic expansions needs to\n“aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.” In other words, the\naim to achieve symmetric outcomes for inflation (as would be the case under flexible\ninflation targeting in the absence of the ELB constraint) requires an asymmetric monetary\npolicy reaction function in a low r* world with binding ELB constraints in economic\ndownturns.\nIt is for this reason that while our new statement no longer refers to the 2 percent\ninflation goal as symmetric, it does now say that the Committee “seeks to achieve\ninflation that averages 2 percent over time.” To be clear, “inflation that averages\n2 percent over time” represents an ex ante aspiration, not a description of a mechanical\nreaction function—nor is it a commitment to conduct monetary policy tethered to any\nparticular formula or rule.27 Indeed, as summarized in the minutes of the September\n2019 FOMC meeting, the Committee (and, certainly, I) was skeptical about the benefit,\ncredibility, or practicality of adopting a formal numerical price level or average inflation\ntarget rule, just as it has been unwilling to implement its existing flexible inflation-\ntargeting strategy via any sort of mechanical rule.28 So in practice, what, then, is the\n27 The absence of a commitment to a specific formula or rule should not be interpreted as the absence of a\ncommitment to achieving our mandated goals. To the contrary, the revised statement has strengthened our\ncommitment to achieving these goals in several important ways. Notably, it has clarified that we seek to\nachieve 2 percent inflation, on average, over time and that, when inflation has been running persistently too\nlow, it is appropriate to aim for inflation outcomes moderately above 2 percent for some time to solidly\nanchor longer-run inflation expectations at 2 percent. The revised statement also emphasizes our resolve to\nuse our full range of tools to achieve our goals. Clarity about our goals, strategy, and tools fosters greater\ndemocratic accountability in the pursuit of our dual mandate. For a discussion of time-consistency issues in\nmonetary policy, see the staff analysis of Duarte and others (2020), prepared for this review.\n28 A summary of the September 2019 FOMC discussion is available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm. For the staff analysis presented as\nbackground to that discussion, see Arias and others (2020), Duarte and others (2020), and Hebden and\nothers (2020). See also the related staff analysis by Chung and others (2020) on the use of operational\ninflation ranges.\n\n- 15 -\npolicy implication of this stated desire “to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over\ntime”? Again, the implication of our new strategy for monetary policy is stated explicitly\nin the new statement, and, at the risk of repeating myself, let me restate it verbatim: “…\nfollowing periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent,\nappropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above\n2 percent for some time.” Full stop. As Chair Powell indicated in his remarks last week,\nwe think of this new strategy as an evolution from flexible inflation targeting to flexible\naverage inflation targeting.29\nConcluding Thoughts\nMy remarks today have been focused on our new framework and flexible average\ninflation targeting strategy. Of course, our review has also explored ways in which we\nmight add to our toolkit and refine our communication practices. With regard to our\ntoolkit, we believe that forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases have been and\ncontinue to be effective sources of support to the economy when the federal funds rate is\nat the ELB, and, of course, both were deployed promptly in our March 2020 policy\nresponse to the pandemic. With regard to other monetary policy tools, and as we have\nmade clear previously in the minutes to our October 2019 FOMC meeting, we do not see\nnegative policy rates as an attractive policy option in the U.S. context.30 As for targeting\nthe yield curve, our general view is that with credible forward guidance and asset\npurchases, the potential benefits from such an approach may be modest. At the same\n29 Svensson (2020) argues that “forecast targeting” approaches, by which policymakers set the federal\nfunds rate so as to best stabilize forecasts for inflation and employment around the FOMC’s longer-run\ngoals, outperform policy strategies that respond only to current economic conditions, past economic\nconditions, or both. In addition, he finds that average inflation targeting offers some advantages over the\nother strategies that he considers.\n30 The minutes of the FOMC’s October 2019 meeting are available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.\n\n- 16 -\ntime, the approach brings complications in terms of implementation and communications.\nHence, as noted in the minutes from our previous meeting (July 2020), most of my\ncolleagues judged that yield caps and targets were not warranted in the current\nenvironment but should remain an option that the Committee could reassess in the future\nif circumstances changed markedly.31 Regarding communication practices, our new\nconsensus statement does bring greater clarity and transparency to the way we will\nconduct policy going forward, and in that regard I note that Michelle Smith is leading our\nefforts to make immediately and readily available on the web a bounty of content that\nwill be invaluable to those who desire a more granular understanding of the review\nprocess. Finally, now that we have ratified our new statement, the Committee can assess\npossible refinements to our SEP with the aim of reaching a decision on any potential\nchanges by the end of this year.32\nIn closing, let me say that while I was not a member of the Committee in 2012,\nhad I been I would have voted enthusiastically for the January 2012 statement. It was the\nright statement, and flexible inflation targeting was the right strategy, at that time and for\nthe next eight years. The existing framework served us well by supporting the Federal\nReserve’s efforts after the GFC first to achieve and then, for several years, to sustain the\noperation of the economy at or close to both our statutorily assigned goals of maximum\nemployment and price stability. But times change, as has the economic landscape, and\n31 See the minutes of the FOMC’s June 2020 and July 2020 meetings, which can be found on the Board’s\nwebsite at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.\n32 For a discussion of the importance of clear Federal Reserve communications in an uncertain economic\nenvironment, along with possible enhancements, see the paper Cecchetti and Schoenholtz (2019) prepared\nfor the research conference at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.\n\n- 17 -\nour framework and strategy need to change as well.33 My colleagues and I believe that\nthis new framework represents a critical and robust evolution of our monetary policy\nstrategy that will best equip the Federal Reserve to achieve our dual-mandate objectives\non a sustained basis in the world in which we conduct policy today and for the\nforeseeable future. Thank you very much for your time and attention, and I look forward\nnow to my conversation with Adam.\n33 See Fuhrer and others (2018) for a discussion of the benefits of holding periodic reviews of central\nbanks’ monetary policy frameworks.\n\n- 18 -\nReferences\nAaronson, Stephanie R., Mary C.

Clarida\nVice Chair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nConference on Monetary Policy Strategy, Tools, and Communication Practices\n(A Fed Listens Event)\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\nChicago, Illinois\nJune 5, 2019\n\nGood morning, and welcome to day two of the Federal Reserve System\nConference on Monetary Policy Strategy, Tools, and Communication Practices.1 I think\nyou will have to agree that the presentations and discussion yesterday were uniformly\nthoughtful, substantive, and stimulating, and today we will have another impressive\nlineup of speakers and panelists addressing timely topics that are relevant to our review.\nAnd let me convey on behalf of Chair Powell, the Board of Governors, and the Reserve\nBank Presidents, a sincere and deep appreciation to all the participants on this program,\nespecially the authors of the seven outstanding papers, for the time, thought, and energy\nthat went into preparing their contributions.\nYesterday Professors Eberly, Stock, and Wright provided us with a thorough and\nthoughtful evaluation of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy strategy, tools, and\ncommunications since 2009. They conclude that the policy tools that the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (FOMC) relied on—“level policy” and “slope policy,” to use their\nterminology—helped restore the U.S. economy to health and bring it close to the\nstatutory goals of maximum employment and price stability assigned to us by the\nCongress.\nAs was noted several times yesterday, in recent years forecasters and\npolicymakers have been surprised by the decline in the unemployment rate and the size of\nthe sustained ongoing gains in payroll employment. FOMC participants’ estimates of the\nlonger-run normal rate of unemployment in the Summary of Economic Projections\nillustrate this point—they have drifted lower over time as labor market conditions have\n1 The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of other Federal Reserve Board members or\nFederal Open Market Committee participants. I would like to thank Ellen Meade for assistance in\npreparing these remarks.\n\n- 2 -\nimproved and inflation has remained quiescent.2 The paper by Professors Abraham and\nHaltiwanger provided us with an innovative search-and-matching model to estimate labor\nmarket slack—which complements the standard estimates based on unemployment gaps\nand Phillips curve relationships. On that same general topic, the panel discussion of\nnational and community leaders moderated by Governor Brainard provided a valuable\nperspective on the labor market that could not otherwise be gleaned from the aggregate\nstatistics we often consult.\nOf course, notwithstanding what is taught in many U.S. macroeconomics courses,\nthe United States is not a closed economy but is one of many nations engaged in global\nfinance and economic commerce. Professor Obstfeld’s paper examined the ways that\nglobal economic integration affects inflation and the neutral rate of interest—or r*—and\nthe role played by the U.S. dollar in transmitting the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy\nto other countries.\nIn our final session yesterday, Professors Cecchetti and Schoenholtz assessed the\nFederal Reserve’s communication practices. Based on interviews and conversations with\nmarket participants, academics, and former policymakers, Professors Cecchetti and\nSchoenholtz offered concrete suggestions for improving our most important\ncommunications vehicles.\nOur program today will feature papers by Lars Svensson on alternative monetary\npolicy strategies, by Eric Sims and Cynthia Wu on the policy toolkit, and by Anil\nKashyap and Caspar Siegert on the interplay between financial stability considerations\n2 In January 2009, when longer-run projections were added to the Summary of Economic Projections, the\nmidpoint of the central tendency for the longer-run normal unemployment rate was 4.9 percent. In March\n2019, the median of the longer-run normal unemployment rate was 4.3 percent.\n\n- 3 -\nand monetary policy. Our featured panel of national and community leaders moderated\nby President Rosengren will I’m sure offer valuable perspectives about how the monetary\nlevers we pull and push affect communities, credit availability, and small businesses.\nAside from being an intellectually stimulating two days, how does this week’s\nconference fit into the FOMC’s review of its monetary policy strategy, tools, and\ncommunications? Let me describe briefly how the review is structured. Over the past\nseveral months, the individual Reserve Banks have been hosting a series of Fed Listens\nevents—seven so far including this conference—with at least five more to follow in\ncoming months. Each event is organized with a format and list of participants that works\nbest for that District but with two common elements: that Fed officials do most of the\nlistening and that, when feasible, the events be live streamed. In Dallas, we heard from\nlocal leaders about the challenges facing lower-income communities. In Minneapolis, we\nlistened to researchers discuss the distributional consequences of the economic cycle and\nof monetary policy. In Boston, we heard from small businesses, labor leaders, and\ngroups that work in underserved communities about the effects of the Fed’s policymaking\non New England residents. In Camden, New Jersey, we learned about the workforce\ntraining initiatives of a local manufacturing firm. In Richmond, a panel of local business\nand community leaders discussed the ways the Fed’s monetary policy affects the regional\neconomy. In New York, panelists representing labor, local government, and community\norganizations offered their perspectives on the relative importance of the Fed’s dual\nmandate goals. As I and my Fed colleagues who have participated in these events will\nattest, they have provided us with valuable perspectives on the economy that we would\nnot otherwise be able to glean from aggregate economic statistics.\n\n- 4 -\nIn coming regularly scheduled meetings, the FOMC will undertake its assessment\nof our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices. This assessment\nwill be informed by what we’ve heard at this conference, by our listening sessions in the\nFederal Reserve Districts, and by the work of System staff. When the Committee tackles\nimportant issues, we take the time for wide-ranging and candid discussions, and so I\nexpect our deliberations will continue over several meetings for the remainder of this\nyear. We will share our findings with the public when we have completed our review,\nlikely during the first half of next year.\nThank you and let’s move directly to our first session.",

In retrospect, it seems clear that timely and targeted monetary and\nfiscal policy actions—unprecedented in both scale and scope—provided essential and\nsignificant support to the economic recovery as it got under way last year. Indeed, the\nNational Bureau of Economic Research’s Business Cycle Dating Committee determined\nin July that the recession that began in March of last year ended in April, making it not\nonly the deepest recession on record, but also the briefest.2 The recovery that\ncommenced in the summer of 2020 was quite robust, and, with one quarter to go, GDP\ngrowth in 2021 is projected by the Fed and many outside forecasters to be the fastest\nsince 1983. However, it must be noted that the course of the economy this year and\nbeyond will depend on the course of this virus. That said, under the median projection\nfor GDP growth in the September Summary of Economic projections, the level of real\nGDP will have returned to its pre pandemic trend growth trajectory by the fourth quarter\n1 The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of other Federal Reserve Board members or\nFederal Open Market Committee participants.

Not surprisingly, the projected path of above-trend GDP growth in 2021\nand 2022 translates into rapid declines in the projected path for the unemployment rate,\nwhich is projected to fall to 3.8 percent by the end of 2022 and 3.5 percent by the end of\n2023. This modal projection for the path of the unemployment rate is, according to the\nAtlanta Fed jobs calculator, consistent with a rebound in labor force participation to its\nestimated demographic trend and is also consistent with cumulative employment gains\nthis year and next that, by the end of 2022, eliminate the 4.2 million “employment gap”\nrelative to the previous cycle peak.4\nMy projections for headline and core PCE (personal consumption expenditures)\ninflation are, alas, also similar to the median SEP numbers. Under the projected SEP\npath for inflation, core PCE inflation surges to at least 3.7 percent this year before\nreverting back to 2.3 percent in 2022, 2.2 percent in 2023, and 2.1 percent in 2024. Thus,\nthe baseline outlook for inflation over the three-year projection window reflects the\njudgment, shared with many outside forecasters, that under appropriate monetary policy,\n3 The most recent SEP, released following the conclusion of the September 2021 FOMC meeting, is\navailable on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.\n4 More information on the jobs calculator can be found on the Atlanta Fed’s website at\nhttps://www.atlantafed.org/chcs/calculator.\n\n- 3 -\nmost of the inflation overshoot relative to the longer-run goal of 2 percent will, in the\nend, prove to be transitory. But as I have noted before, there is no doubt that it is taking\nmuch longer to fully reopen a $20 trillion economy than it did to shut it down. Although\nin a number of sectors of the economy the imbalances between demand and supply—\nincluding labor supply—are substantial, I do continue to judge that these imbalances are\nlikely to dissipate over time as the labor market and global supply chains eventually\nadjust and, importantly, do so without putting persistent upward pressure on price\ninflation and wage gains adjusted for productivity. But let me be clear on two points.\nFirst, realized PCE inflation so far this year represents, to me, much more than a\n“moderate” overshoot of our 2 percent longer-run inflation objective, and I would not\nconsider a repeat performance next year a policy success. Second, as always, there are\nrisks to any outlook, and I and 12 of my colleagues believe that the risks to the outlook\nfor inflation are to the upside.\nProspects for U.S. Monetary Policy\nIn September 2020, the FOMC introduced—and since then has reaffirmed—\noutcome-based, threshold guidance that specifies three conditions that the Committee\nexpects will be met before it considers increasing the target range for the federal funds\nrate, currently 0 to 25 basis points.5 This guidance in September of last year brought the\nforward guidance on the federal funds rate in the statement into alignment with the new\nflexible average inflation targeting framework adopted in August 2020.6 To quote from\n5 The FOMC statements containing the guidance (see the fourth paragraph in each statement) are available\non the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.\n6 The revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, unanimously approved on\nAugust 27, 2020, is available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review-of-monetary-policy-strategy-tools-and-\n\n- 4 -\nthe statement, these conditions are that “labor market conditions have reached levels\nconsistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employment and inflation has\nrisen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.”\nWhile we are clearly a ways away from considering raising interest rates, if the\noutlooks for inflation and unemployment I summarized a moment ago turn out to be the\nactual outcomes realized over the forecast horizon, then I believe that these three\nnecessary conditions for raising the target range for the federal funds rate will have been\nmet by year-end 2022.7 Core PCE inflation since February 2020—a calculation window\nthat smooths out any base effects resulting from “round trip” declines and rebounds in the\nprice levels of COVID-19-sensitive sectors and, coincidentally, also measures the\naverage rate of core PCE inflation since hitting the effective lower bound (ELB) in March\n2020—is running at 2.8 percent through September 2021 and is projected to remain\nmoderately above 2 percent in all three years of the projection window. Moreover, my\ninflation projections for 2023 and 2024, which forecast inflation rates similar to the SEP\nmedians, would by year-end 2022, to me, satisfy the “on track to moderately exceed 2\npercent for some time” threshold specified in the statement. Finally, while my\nassessment of maximum employment incorporates a wide range of indicators to assess\nthe state of the labor market—including indicators of labor compensation, productivity,\nand price-cost markups—the employment data I look at, such as the Kansas City Fed’s\nLabor Market Conditions Indicators, are historically highly correlated with the\ncommunications-statement-on-longer-run-goals-monetary-policy-strategy.htm. For a discussion of the\nelements that motivated the launch of the review and a summary of the key changes that were introduced,\nsee Clarida (2020, 2021) and Powell (2020).\n7 Of course, data for December 2022 employment and 2022:Q4 GDP and PCE inflation will not be released\nuntil January 2023.\n\n- 5 -\nunemployment rate.8 My expectation today is that the labor market by the end of 2022\nwill have reached my assessment of maximum employment if the unemployment rate has\ndeclined by then to the SEP median of modal projections of 3.8 percent.\nGiven this economic outlook and so long as inflation expectations remain well\nanchored at the 2 percent longer-run goal—which, based on the Fed staff’s common\ninflation expectations (CIE) index, I judge at present to be the case—a policy\nnormalization path similar to the median SEP dot plot on page 4 of our September 2021\nprojections would, under these conditions, be entirely consistent, to me, with our new\nflexible average inflation targeting framework and the policy rate reaction function I\ndiscussed in remarks here at Brookings in November 2020.9 In the context of our new\nframework, it is important to note that while the ELB can be a constraint on monetary\npolicy, the ELB is not a constraint on fiscal policy, and appropriate monetary policy\nunder our new framework, to me, must—and certainly can—incorporate this reality.\nIndeed, under present circumstances, I judge that the support to aggregate demand from\nfiscal policy—including the roughly $2 trillion in accumulated excess savings accruing\nfrom (as yet) unspent transfer payments—in tandem with appropriate monetary policy,\ncan fully offset the constraint, highlighted in our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and\nMonetary Policy Strategy, that the ELB imposes on the ability of inflation-targeting\nmonetary policy, acting on its own and in the absence of sufficient fiscal support, to\n8 The Labor Market Conditions Indicators can be found on the Kansas City Fed’s website at\nhttps://www.kansascityfed.org/data-and-trends/labor-market-conditions-indicators.\n9 The Fed staff’s CIE index—which is now updated quarterly on the Board’s website—is a relevant\nindicator that this goal is being met. See Ahn and Fulton (2020, 2021).\n\n- 6 -\nrestore, following a recession, maximum employment and price stability while keeping\ninflation expectations well anchored at the 2 percent longer-run goal.10\nBefore I conclude, let me say a few words about our Treasury and mortgage-\nbacked securities (MBS) purchase programs. In our December 2020 FOMC statement,\nwe indicated that we would maintain the pace of Treasury and MBS purchases at $80\nbillion and $40 billion per month, respectively, until “substantial further progress” has\nbeen made toward our maximum-employment and price-stability goals. Since then, the\neconomy has made progress toward these goals. At our meeting last week, the\nCommittee decided to begin reducing the monthly pace of its net asset purchases by $10\nbillion for Treasury securities and $5 billion for agency mortgage-backed securities.\nBeginning later this month, the Committee will increase its holdings of Treasury\nsecurities by at least $70 billion per month and of agency mortgage‑backed securities by\nat least $35 billion per month. Beginning in December, the Committee will increase its\nholdings of Treasury securities by at least $60 billion per month and of agency mortgage-\nbacked securities by at least $30 billion per month. The Committee judges that similar\nreductions in the pace of net asset purchases will likely be appropriate each month, but it\nis prepared to adjust the pace of purchases if warranted by changes in the economic\noutlook. The Federal Reserve’s ongoing purchases and holdings of securities will\ncontinue to foster smooth market functioning and accommodative financial conditions,\nthereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses.\n10 For a theoretical analysis of the fiscal and monetary policy mix at the ELB, see Woodford and Xie\n(2020).

Clarida\nVice Chair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“The Economy and Monetary Policy,” an event hosted by\nthe Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at the Brookings Institution\nWashington, D.C.\n(via webcast)\nNovember 16, 2020\n\nOn August 27, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) unanimously\napproved a revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy that\nrepresents a robust evolution of its monetary policy framework.1 The new framework\nhas important implications for the way the FOMC going forward will conduct monetary\npolicy in support of its efforts to achieve its dual-mandate goals in a world of low neutral\npolicy rates and persistent global disinflationary pressures. At the September 16 FOMC\nmeeting, the Committee made material changes to its forward guidance for the future\npath of the federal funds rate to bring the guidance into line with the new policy\nframework and, in so doing, provided transparent outcome-based guidance linked to the\nmacroeconomic conditions that must prevail before the Committee expects to lift off\nfrom the effective lower bound (ELB). In my remarks today, I would like to look ahead\nand offer my individual perspective on the consequences of our new framework for the\nconduct of monetary policy over the business cycle, and I also want to provide some\ncontext that connects key elements of our new framework to the literature on optimal\nmonetary policy subject to an ELB constraint that binds in economic downturns. Let me\nsay at the outset that when I am not quoting directly from the consensus statement and the\nSeptember FOMC statement, the views expressed are my own and do not necessarily\nexpress the views of other Federal Reserve Board members or FOMC participants.2\nThe plan of my talk is as follows. I will first highlight and discuss the five\nelements of the new framework that define how the Committee will seek to achieve its\nprice-stability mandate over time and how, in September, it revised its forward guidance\n1 The statement is available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review-of-monetary-policy-strategy-tools-and-\ncommunications-statement-on-longer-run-goals-monetary-policy-strategy.htm.\n2 I would like to thank Ellen Meade and Chiara Scotti for their assistance in preparing these remarks.\n\n- 2 -\non the federal funds rate to bring the FOMC’s policy communications into line with the\nnew framework. I will then provide my perspective on how these key elements of the\nnew framework and the related forward guidance connect to the literature on conducting\noptimal monetary policy at—and after lifting off from—the ELB. I will next discuss how\nthe Committee’s conception of its maximum-employment mandate, a sixth element of the\nnew framework, has evolved since 2012, what this evolution implies for the conduct of\nmonetary policy, and how I plan to factor in this information as I think about the\nappropriate path for setting the federal funds rate once the conditions for liftoff have been\nmet. I will conclude with a brief recap of my thesis before joining David Wessel, Seth\nCarpenter, and Annette Vissing-Jørgensen in what I am sure will be an engaging virtual\nconversation.\nThe New Framework and Price Stability\nIn my remarks today, I will focus on six key elements of our new framework and\nthe forward guidance provided by our September FOMC statement. Five of these\nelements define how the Committee will seek to achieve its price-stability mandate over\ntime, while the sixth pertains to the Committee’s conception of its maximum-\nemployment mandate. Of course, the Committee’s price-stability and maximum-\nemployment mandates are generally complementary, and, indeed, this complementarity is\nrecognized and respected in the forward-guidance language introduced in the September\nFOMC statement.3 However, for ease of exposition, I will begin by focusing on the five\n3 The September 2020 FOMC statement says: “The Committee decided to keep the target range for the\nfederal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until\nlabor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum\nemployment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some\ntime” (paragraph 4). The statement is available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.\n\n- 3 -\nelements of the new framework that define how the Committee will seek to achieve over\ntime its price-stability mandate, before discussing how maximum employment is defined\nin the new framework and what this definition implies for the conduct and\ncommunication of monetary policy under the new framework.\nFive features of the new framework and September FOMC statement define how\nthe Committee will seek to achieve its price-stability mandate over time:\n1. The Committee expects to delay liftoff from the ELB until PCE (personal\nconsumption expenditures) inflation has risen to 2 percent on an annual basis\nand other complementary conditions, consistent with achieving this goal on a\nsustained basis and to be discussed later, are met.4\n2. With inflation having run persistently below 2 percent, the Committee will\naim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time in the\nservice of having inflation average 2 percent over time and keeping longer-\nterm inflation expectations well anchored at the 2 percent longer-run goal.5\n3. The Committee expects that appropriate monetary policy will remain\naccommodative for some time after the conditions to commence policy\nnormalization have been met.6\n4 The Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy articulates the inflation objective:\n“The Committee reaffirms its judgment that inflation at the rate of 2 percent, as measured by the annual\nchange in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is most consistent over the longer run\nwith the Federal Reserve’s statutory mandate” (paragraph 4). The September 2020 FOMC statement\nindicates the conditions for liftoff (see note 3).\n5 The September 2020 FOMC statement reads: “With inflation running persistently below this longer-run\ngoal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that\ninflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at\n2 percent” (paragraph 4). A similar sentence appears in the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary\nPolicy Strategy.\n6 The September 2020 FOMC statement reads: “The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment\nand inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. With inflation running persistently below this\nlonger-run goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so\nthat inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at\n\n- 4 -\n4. Policy will aim over time to return inflation to its longer-run goal, which\nremains 2 percent, but not below, once the conditions to commence policy\nnormalization have been met.7\n5. Inflation that averages 2 percent over time represents an ex ante aspiration of\nthe FOMC, but not a time-inconsistent ex post commitment.8\nI believe that a useful way to summarize the framework defined by these five\nfeatures is temporary price-level targeting (TPLT, at the ELB) that reverts to flexible\ninflation targeting (once the conditions for liftoff have been reached). Just such a\nframework has been analyzed by Bernanke, Kiley, and Roberts (2019) and Bernanke\n(2020), who in turn build on earlier work by Evans (2012) and Reifschneider and\nWilliams (2000), among others.9 Each of the five elements of the new framework\nhighlighted previously is consequential. I now discuss each in turn and provide some\ncontext for how I understand them to relate to the monetary economics literature on\nTPLT.\nFirst element\nA policy that delays liftoff from the ELB until a threshold for average inflation\nhas been reached is one element of a TPLT strategy. In our September FOMC statement,\nwe communicated that, along with other complementary conditions, inflation must have\n2 percent. The Committee expects to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these\noutcomes are achieved” (paragraph 4).\n7 The Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy articulates the inflation objective (see\nnote 4).\n8 The Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy says: “In order to anchor longer-term\ninflation expectations at this level, the Committee seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over\ntime, and therefore judges that, following periods when inflation has been running persistently below\n2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for\nsome time” (paragraph 4).\n9 See also Eggertsson and Woodford (2003) and Hebden and López-Salido (2018).\n\n- 5 -\nrisen to 2 percent before we expect to lift off from the ELB. This condition refers to\ninflation on an annual basis. TPLT with such a one-year memory has been studied using\nstochastic simulations of the Fed’s FRB/US model by Bernanke, Kiley, and Roberts\n(2019).\nSecond element\nAn alternative version of TPLT would commit the central bank to delay liftoff\nuntil inflation has averaged 2 percent over a longer period—say, three years (Bernanke,\nKiley, and Roberts (2019) study the case of TPLT with a three-year memory as well as\nthe case of TPLT with a one-year memory) or perhaps an even longer period that\ncommences when the policy rate hits the ELB itself (as in Bernanke’s (2017a) original\nTPLT proposal). In these versions of TPLT, inflation would likely have to moderately\nexceed 2 percent for some time before the condition for liftoff is met. For example, if\nTPLT with a three-year memory were chosen and inflation in three consecutive years\nequaled 1.9 percent, 2 percent, and 2.1 percent, then liftoff would not occur until inflation\nhit 2.1 percent for one year. Note, however, that TPLT with a longer memory does not\ndefine ex ante the amount by which inflation must exceed 2 percent before liftoff is\nconsidered, nor does it specify for how long inflation exceeds 2 percent before liftoff is\nconsidered. For example, under TPLT with a three-year memory, if inflation instead\nequaled 1.8 percent, 2 percent, and 2.2 percent for three consecutive years, then liftoff ex\npost could not occur until inflation hit 2.2 percent for one year. But if, instead, inflation\nequaled 1.8 percent, 2.1 percent, and 2.1 percent, then inflation would exceed 2 percent\nfor two years before liftoff were contemplated. In the case of the Federal Reserve, the\nFOMC chose a one-year memory for the inflation threshold that must be met before\n\n- 6 -\nliftoff is considered, but it also indicated in September that the Committee expects to\ndelay liftoff until inflation is “on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.”\nWhat “moderately” and “for some time” mean will depend on the initial conditions at\nliftoff (just as they do under versions of TPLT with a longer memory). Crucially, the\nCommittee’s judgment on the projected duration and magnitude of the deviation from the\n2 percent inflation goal will, at the time of liftoff and every three months thereafter, be\ncommunicated in the quarterly Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) for inflation.10\nThe SEP has served this purpose before. For example, in 2018, as the FOMC factored in\nan unexpected tailwind from a mid-cycle fiscal expansion and chose to maintain a\ngradual pace of normalization to return the federal funds rate to its projected neutral\nstance, the median participant at the September 2018 FOMC meeting projected that core\nPCE inflation would moderately exceed 2 percent for three years. The FOMC statement\nitself can, in the new regime, also be used as a platform to communicate the Committee’s\ntolerance for deviations of inflation from the 2 percent longer-run goal, and, indeed, it has\nserved this purpose in the past—for example, with the threshold-based guidance linked to\ninflation outcomes introduced in the FOMC statement in December 2012.11\n10 The most recent SEP, an addendum to the minutes of the September 2020 FOMC meeting, is available\non the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.\n11 The guidance from the December 2012 FOMC statement was the following: “To support continued\nprogress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee expects that a highly\naccommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset\npurchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens. In particular, the Committee decided to\nkeep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that this\nexceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment\nrate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more\nthan a half percentage point above the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation\nexpectations continue to be well anchored” (paragraph 5). The statement is available on the Board’s\nwebsite at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.\n\n- 7 -\nThird element\nIn the TPLT framework studied by Bernanke, Kiley, and Roberts (2019), policy\nreverts to an inertial Taylor rule after liftoff, so policy remains accommodative for some\ntime, which depends in their formulation on the degree of policy inertia in the reaction\nfunction. Our September FOMC statement also calls for policy to remain\naccommodative for some time after liftoff. Once the conditions to commence policy\nnormalization have been met, the SEP “dot plot” will convey the median participant’s\nprojections over a three-year horizon not only for inflation, but also for the pace of liftoff\nas well as the ultimate destination for the policy rate. I will have more to say shortly\nabout a relevant policy rule benchmark that I believe is consistent with the new\nframework.\nFourth element\nThe new framework is asymmetric. That is, as in Bernanke, Kiley, and Roberts\n(2019), the goal of monetary policy after lifting off from the ELB is to return inflation to\nits 2 percent longer-run goal, but not to push inflation below 2 percent. In other words,\nafter liftoff from the ELB, monetary policy reverts to simple flexible inflation targeting\n(Bernanke, 2017b). In the Bernanke, Kiley, and Roberts (2019) study, flexible inflation\ntargeting post-liftoff is implemented with an inertial Taylor rule that satisfies the Taylor\nprinciple (that is, the policy responds to the difference between actual inflation and the\n2 percent target with a coefficient that exceeds unity). The policy is flexible in that the\ndesired pace of return to 2 percent can reflect considerations other than the 2 percent\nlonger-run goal for inflation that are relevant to the Committee’s mandate. In the case of\nthe Federal Reserve, we have highlighted that making sure that inflation expectations\n\n- 8 -\nremain anchored at our 2 percent objective is just such a consideration. Speaking for\nmyself, I follow closely the Fed staff’s index of common inflation expectations (CIE) as a\nrelevant indicator that this goal is being met.12 Other things being equal, if at the time of\nliftoff the CIE index is below its pre-ELB level, then my desired pace of policy\nnormalization post-liftoff to return inflation to 2 percent—as well as the projected pace of\nreturn to 2 percent inflation—would be somewhat slower than if the CIE index at the\ntime of liftoff is equal to its pre-ELB level. Another factor I will consider in calibrating\nthe pace of policy normalization post-liftoff is the average rate of PCE inflation since the\nnew framework was adopted in August 2020—a time, as it happened, that the federal\nfunds rate was constrained at the ELB. If average inflation since August 2020 turns out\nto be notably below 2 percent, then my desired pace of policy normalization post-\nliftoff—and the implied pace of return to 2 percent inflation—would, other things being\nequal, be somewhat slower than if average inflation since adoption was close to or equal\nto 2 percent. It is important to note, however, that the goal of the new framework is to\nkeep inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent, and, for this reason, I myself plan\nto focus more on indicators of inflation expectations themselves—especially survey-\nbased measures—than I will on the calculation of an average rate of inflation over any\nparticular window of time.\nFifth element\nOur framework aims ex ante for inflation to average 2 percent over time, but it\ndoes not make a (time-inconsistent) commitment to achieve ex post inflation outcomes\nthat average 2 percent under any and all circumstances and constellations of shocks. The\n12 See Ahn and Fulton (2020) for a discussion of the CIE index.\n\n- 9 -\nsame is true for the TPLT regime studied in Bernanke, Kiley, and Roberts (2019)\nfeaturing TPLT with a one-year memory. In this regime, the only way in which average\ninflation enters the policy rule is through the timing of liftoff itself. Yet in stochastic\nsimulations of the FRB/US model under TPLT with a one-year memory that reverts to\nflexible inflation targeting after liftoff, inflation does average very close to 2 percent in\nthe stochastic simulations reported in their paper. The model of Mertens and\nWilliams (2019) delivers a similar outcome: Even though the policy reaction function in\ntheir model does not incorporate an ex post makeup element, it delivers a long-run\n(unconditional) average rate of inflation equal to target by aiming for a moderate inflation\novershoot away from the ELB that is calibrated to offset the inflation shortfall caused by\nthe ELB.\nIt is important to note that, as our new consensus statement emphasizes, the\nFederal Reserve is committed to using all of our available tools—not just the federal\nfunds rate and forward guidance, but also large-scale asset purchases—to achieve our\ndual-mandate goals. Since our March 2 FOMC meeting, the federal funds rate has been\nreduced by 150 basis points to its ELB and we have increased our Treasury and\nmortgage-backed securities holdings by a total of $3.3 trillion; we continue to add to\nthese holdings at a pace of $120 billion per month.* These large-scale asset purchases are\nproviding substantial support to the economic recovery by sustaining smooth market\nfunctioning and fostering accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the\nflow of credit to households and businesses. At our November FOMC meeting, we\ndiscussed our asset purchases and the critical role they are playing in supporting the\neconomic recovery. Looking ahead, we will continue to monitor developments and\n\n- 10 -\nassess how our ongoing asset purchases can best support achieving our maximum-\nemployment and price-stability objectives. In this regard, I note that the simulation\nresults reported in Bernanke (2020) suggest that, in general, a monetary policy at the ELB\nthat combines threshold forward guidance, such as I have discussed in these remarks,\nwith large-scale asset purchases, such as we have had in place since March, is best\nequipped ex ante to achieve inflation outcomes that are consistent with price stability and\nwell-anchored inflation expectations at the 2 percent objective.\nThe New Framework and Maximum Employment\nAn important evolution in our new framework is that the Committee now defines\nmaximum employment as the highest level of employment that does not generate\nsustained pressures that put the price-stability mandate at risk.13 As a practical matter,\nthis definition means to me that, when the unemployment rate is elevated relative to my\nSEP projection of its long-run level and other indicators—such as the prime-age\nemployment-to-population and labor force participation ratios—are depressed relative to\nrecent business cycle peaks, monetary policy should, as before, continue to be calibrated\nto eliminate such employment shortfalls as long as doing so does not put the price-\nstability mandate at risk. Indeed, in our September FOMC statement, we indicated that\nwe expect it will be appropriate to keep the federal funds rate in the current 0 to 25 basis\npoint target range until inflation has reached 2 percent (on an annual basis) and labor\n13 The Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy articulates this concept with the\nfollowing: “The maximum level of employment is a broad-based and inclusive goal that is not directly\nmeasurable and changes over time owing largely to nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and\ndynamics of the labor market. Consequently, it would not be appropriate to specify a fixed goal for\nemployment; rather, the Committee's policy decisions must be informed by assessments of the shortfalls of\nemployment from its maximum level, recognizing that such assessments are necessarily uncertain and\nsubject to revision. The Committee considers a wide range of indicators in making these assessments”\n(paragraph 3).\n\n- 11 -\nmarket conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessment of\nmaximum employment. In our new framework, when in a business cycle expansion\nlabor market indicators return to a range that, in the Committee’s judgment, is broadly\nconsistent with its maximum-employment mandate, it will be data on inflation itself that\npolicy will react to, but going forward, policy will not tighten solely because the\nunemployment rate has fallen below any particular econometric estimate of its long-run\nnatural level. This guidance has an important implication for the Taylor-type policy\nreaction function I will consult. In particular, I will continue—as I have done since\njoining the Fed—to consult policy rules that respect the Taylor principle as a benchmark\nfor calibrating the pace and destination of policy rate normalization once, after the\ninflation and employment thresholds have been reached, the process of policy\nnormalization commences. Consistent with our new framework, the relevant policy rule\nbenchmark I will consult after the conditions for liftoff have been met is an inertial\nTaylor-type rule with a coefficient of zero on the unemployment gap, a coefficient of\n1.5 on the gap between core PCE inflation and the 2 percent longer-run goal, and a\nneutral real policy rate equal to my SEP projection of long-run r*. As discussed earlier,\nthe degree of inertia in the benchmark rule I consult will depend on initial conditions at\nthe time of liftoff, especially the reading of the staff’s CIE index relative to its February\n2020 level. Such a reference rule, which becomes relevant once the conditions for policy\nnormalization have been met, is similar to the forward-looking Taylor-type rule for\noptimal monetary policy derived in Clarida, Galí, and Gertler (1999). The stability\nproperties of Taylor-type rules in dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models have\nbeen studied by Bullard and Mitra (2002) and Galí (2008), among others, and they show\n\n- 12 -\nthat for the standard Taylor coefficient of 1.5 on the inflation gap and a coefficient of\nzero on the unemployment gap, the rational expectations equilibrium is unique for\nstandard parametrizations.\nOne dimension along which our new framework may appear to differ from the\nthreshold forward-guidance proposals advocated by some others is that our September\nFOMC guidance explicitly requires that, at the time of liftoff, in addition to inflation\nreaching 2 percent (on an annual basis), labor market conditions must have also reached\nlevels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employment, and I\noffered earlier the metrics on some of the labor market indicators I will follow to make\nthat assessment. However, any difference between our September FOMC guidance and\nsimilar threshold guidance policies that depend only on realized inflation is, I believe,\nmore apparent than real. The reason is that proponents of inflation-based threshold\nguidance typically acknowledge that liftoff following an ELB episode should be\nconditioned on the judgment that inflation has sustainably reached the target before liftoff\nis contemplated (Bernanke, 2017b), and such an assessment of sustainability in most\ncircumstances would, I believe, be informed by an assessment of labor market conditions\n(Reifschneider and Wilcox, 2020). The Committee confronted just this situation in the\nfirst half of 2012, when core PCE inflation reached 2 percent at a time when the\nunemployment rate remained elevated at 8.2 percent, well above the top of the range of\nFOMC estimates of its longer-run normal level. The Committee at that time wisely, in\nmy judgment, chose not to lift off in 2012, and I would hope—and, under our September\nrate guidance, expect—a future Committee would reach the same judgment under similar\ncircumstances.\n\n- 13 -\nConcluding Remarks\nIn closing, I think of our new flexible average inflation-targeting framework as a\ncombination of TPLT at the ELB with flexible inflation targeting, to which TPLT reverts\nonce the conditions to commence policy normalization articulated in our September 2020\nFOMC statement have been met. In this sense, our new framework indeed represents an\nevolution, not a revolution. The Committee is committed to using all available tools,\nincluding threshold-based forward guidance as well as large-scale asset purchases, to\nachieve the price-stability and maximum-employment goals specified in our new\nconsensus statement. Thank you very much, and I now look forward to my virtual\nconversation with Annette, David, and Seth.\n\n- 14 -\nReferences\nAhn, Hie Joo, and Chad Fulton (2020). “Index of Common Inflation Expectations,”\nFEDS Notes.

Clarida\nVice Chair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nForeign Policy Association\nNew York, New York\n(via prerecorded video)\nJune 16, 2020\n\nIt is my pleasure to meet virtually this evening with the members and invited\nguests of the Foreign Policy Association (FPA).1 I am truly honored to receive the\nForeign Policy Association Medal. Past honorees have included Sheila Bair, Anne-Marie\nSlaughter, Paul Volcker, Jean-Claude Trichet, and my Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC) colleague John Williams—and so with this award, I am indeed in select\ncompany. Although I have been very much looking forward to receiving this award in\nperson, that, of course, is not possible tonight, but I greatly look forward to attending a\nfuture dinner to convey in person my genuine appreciation to the members of the FPA for\nthis special honor. Since mid-March, I, along with my FOMC colleagues, have been\nworking from home. Indeed, just last week, we held our scheduled June meeting via\nsecure teleconference. And while I certainly miss the opportunities for face-to-face\ninteractions along the corridors of the Board’s Eccles Building, I am grateful to have the\nability to work from home and want to convey my deep gratitude to all of those on the\nfrontlines of the crisis, who are working outside the comfort of their homes in grocery\nstores, hospitals, and other businesses that provide essential services.\nCurrent Economic Situation and Outlook\nWhile the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has taken a tragic human toll\nmeasured in terms of lives lost and suffering inflicted, the pandemic has also inflicted a\nheavy toll on the levels of activity and employment in the U.S. economy, as a direct\nresult of the necessary public health policies put in place to mitigate and control the\nspread of the virus. Real gross domestic product (GDP) declined at a 5 percent annual\n1 These remarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee. I am grateful to Brian Doyle and Chiara Scotti of the\nFederal Reserve Board staff for their assistance in preparing this text.\n\n- 2 -\nrate in the first quarter of the year and will almost surely continue to contract at an\nunprecedented pace in the second quarter. The unemployment rate, which reached a 50-\nyear low of 3.5 percent as recently as February of this year, surged to 14.7 percent in\nApril, an 80-year high. In May, there was a notable rebound in employment and decline\nin unemployment, and these developments are certainly welcome. Moreover, in recent\nweeks, some other indicators suggest a stabilization or even a modest rebound in some\nsegments of the economy. But activity in many parts of the economy has yet to pick up,\nand GDP is falling deeply below its recent peak. And, of course, despite the\nimprovements seen in the May jobs report, the unemployment rate, at 13.3 percent,\nremains historically high.\nAfter the extreme turbulence witnessed in March, financial markets across many\nsectors have normalized and are again serving their essential role of intermediating flows\nof savings and investment among borrowers and lenders. Bank credit lines are providing\nliquidity to companies, and corporations with debt rated investment grade and high yield\nare able to issue, and in size, in the corporate bond market. I believe—and most outside\nobservers agree—that this easing of financial conditions since March is, at least in part,\nthe direct consequence of economic policy responses to the crisis, including the actions\nthe Federal Reserve took at our March 15 meeting and the subsequent announcement and\nsequential launch of 11 new facilities to support the flow of credit to households and\ncompanies. While this easing of financial conditions is, of course, welcome to the extent\nthat it supports the flow of credit to households and firms during this challenging period,\nit may not prove to be durable, depending on the course that the coronavirus contagion\n\n- 3 -\ntakes and the duration of the recession that it causes. At minimum, the easing of financial\nconditions is buying some time until the economy begins to recover.\nAs I speak to you today, there is extraordinary uncertainty about both the depth\nand the duration of the economic downturn. Because the course of the economy will\ndepend on the course of the virus and the public health policies put in place to mitigate\nand contain it, there is an unusually wide range of scenarios for the evolution of the\neconomy that could plausibly play out over the next several years. In my baseline view,\nwhile I do believe it will likely take some time for economic activity and the labor market\nto fully recover from the pandemic shock, I do project right now that the economy will\nresume growth starting in the third quarter. In terms of inflation, my projection is for the\nCOVID-19 contagion shock to be disinflationary, not inflationary, and the data we are\nseeing so far are consistent with this projection. For example, core CPI (consumer price\ninflation) prices fell 0.4 percent in April, the largest monthly decrease since the beginning\nof the series in 1957. Although the decline in core CPI was smaller in May, on a year-\nover-year basis, core CPI is running at 1.2 percent, the slowest pace in nine years. While\nthe COVID-19 shock is disrupting both aggregate demand and supply, the net effect, I\nbelieve, will be for aggregate demand to decline relative to aggregate supply, both in the\nnear term and over the medium term. If so, downward pressure on PCE (personal\nconsumption expenditures) inflation, which was already running somewhat below our 2\npercent objective when the downturn began in March, will continue. Moreover, I judge\nthat measures of longer-term inflation expectations were, when the downturn began, at\nthe low end of a range that I consider consistent with our 2 percent inflation objective\nand, given the likely depth of this downturn, are at risk of falling below that range. The\n\n- 4 -\nFederal Reserve has a dual mandate from the Congress to pursue policies that aim to\nachieve and sustain maximum employment and price stability. To me, price stability\nrequires that inflation expectations remain well anchored at our 2 percent objective, and I\nwill place a high priority on advocating policies that will be directed at achieving not\nonly maximum employment, but also well-anchored inflation expectations consistent\nwith our 2 percent objective.\nThe Policy Response\nAt the Federal Reserve, we take our dual-mandate obligations of maximum\nemployment and price stability very seriously, and, since March 3, we have deployed our\nentire toolkit to provide critical support to the economy during this challenging time. In\ntwo unscheduled meetings, we voted on March 3 and March 15 to cut the target range for\nthe federal funds rate by a total of 150 basis points to its current range of 0 to 25 basis\npoints.2 In our FOMC statements, we have indicated we expect to maintain the target\nrange at this level until we are confident that the economy has weathered recent events\nand is on track to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.\nOn March 16, we launched a program to purchase Treasury securities and agency\nmortgage-backed securities in whatever amounts needed to support smooth market\nfunctioning, thereby fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader\nfinancial conditions. To date, these purchases have totaled more than $2.3 trillion, and,\nas we indicated at our June meeting, they will continue in coming months at least at the\n2 See the FOMC statements issued after the March 3 and March 15 FOMC meetings, which are available\n(along with other postmeeting statements) on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.\n\n- 5 -\ncurrent pace, which should sustain smooth market functioning, thereby fostering effective\ntransmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions.\nSince March 17, the Board has announced the establishment of no fewer than 11\nnew facilities to support the flow of credit to households and businesses. These programs\nare authorized under emergency lending powers granted to the Fed under section 13(3) of\nthe Federal Reserve Act and are available only in “unusual and exigent” circumstances\nand with the consent of the Secretary of Treasury.3 These facilities are supported with\nmoney invested by the Department of the Treasury, drawing on appropriations of more\nthan $450 billion authorized by the Congress in the CARES Act (Coronavirus Aid,\nRelief, and Economic Security Act) for the specific purpose of investing in Fed programs\nto sustain the flow of credit to households, firms, and communities during the\ncoronavirus pandemic. With these facilities, we are providing a bridge by stepping in and\nsupporting lending throughout the economy until the recovery takes hold. These\nprograms are designed to offer backstop sources of funding to the private sector, and just\nthe announcement that these backstop facilities would soon be launched appears to have\nbolstered confidence in capital markets, allowing many companies to finance themselves\nprivately even before the facilities were up and running. But importantly, these are, after\nall, emergency facilities, and someday—hopefully soon—the emergency will pass.\nWhen that day comes and we are confident the economy is solidly on the road to\nrecovery, we will wind down these lending facilities at such time as we determine the\ncircumstances we confront are no longer unusual or exigent.\n3 See Federal Reserve Act, 12 U.S.C. § 343 (1932), quoted text in paragraph 3.A,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/section13.htm.\n\n- 6 -\nThe Federal Reserve has played a leading role in the global economic policy\nresponse to the coronavirus pandemic. Foreign financial institutions borrow and lend in\nU.S. dollars, and these dollar funding markets seized up when COVID-19 emerged. In\nglobally integrated financial markets such as ours, these strains in dollar funding markets\noutside the United States affect the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. As\nsuch, during the week of March 15, the Federal Reserve coordinated with five foreign\ncentral banks to enhance its standing dollar liquidity swap lines.4 In addition, temporary\nswap lines were reestablished with the nine central banks that had temporary agreements\nduring the Global Financial Crisis.5 Moreover, to support dollar liquidity to a broad\nrange of countries, the Federal Reserve announced a new program on March 31, the\ntemporary FIMA (Foreign and International Monetary Authorities) Repo Facility. Under\nthis facility, FIMA account holders at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (which\ninclude central banks and other monetary authorities) can enter into overnight repos\n(repurchase agreements) with the Federal Reserve, temporarily exchanging U.S. Treasury\nsecurities in their accounts for U.S. dollars, which can then be provided to institutions in\ntheir respective jurisdictions. All of these facilities have had a very constructive effect in\n4 The swap fee was reduced from 50 basis points to 25 basis points over the U.S. dollar overnight index\nswap rate. To better target stresses in funding markets for longer-term dollar borrowing, swap operations\nwith a maturity of 84 days were added to the usual 7-day operations by the four central banks that\ntraditionally hold regular auctions—the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank,\nand the Swiss National Bank. Finally, these four central banks announced that they would begin daily\nauctions. See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2020), “Coordinated Central Bank\nAction to Enhance the Provision of U.S. Dollar Liquidity,” press release, March 15,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200315c.htm; and Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System (2020), “Coordinated Central Bank Action to Further Enhance\nthe Provision of U.S. Dollar Liquidity,” press release, March 20,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200320a.htm.\n5 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2020), “Federal Reserve Announces the\nEstablishment of Temporary U.S. Dollar Liquidity Arrangements with Other Central Banks,” press release,\nMarch 19, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200319b.htm.\n\n- 7 -\ncalming down dollar funding markets and supporting a return to more normal conditions\nin global financial markets more generally.\nOf course, as members of the FPA, you are well aware that developments in the\nU.S. economy do not happen in isolation from the rest of the world. We live in a globally\nintegrated economy. With COVID-19, all countries have been hit by a global common\nshock, not only directly by the virus and the measures necessary to combat it, but also by\nthe economic spillovers from those actions around the world. As in the United States,\nmany foreign authorities have taken swift and forceful actions in response. My\ncolleagues and I have worked closely with others—bilaterally and in international forums\nlike the Group of Seven, Group of Twenty, Bank for International Settlements, and\nOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development—to monitor and address the\neffects of the pandemic. The forcefulness and synchronized timing of actions by fiscal\nauthorities, central banks, and regulators have helped support the incomes of households\nand firms and reduce market stresses that could have amplified the shock.\nNot only is the Federal Reserve using its full range of tools to support the\neconomy through this challenging time, but our policies will also help ensure that the\nrebound in activity when it commences will be as robust as possible. That said, it is\nimportant to note that the Fed’s statutory authority grants us lending powers, not\nspending powers. The Fed is not authorized to grant money to particular beneficiaries, to\nmeet the payroll expenses of small businesses, or to underwrite the unemployment\nbenefits of displaced workers. Programs to support such worthy goals reside squarely in\nthe domain of fiscal policy. The Fed can only make loans to solvent entities with the\nexpectation the loans will be paid back. Direct fiscal support for the economy is thus also\n\n- 8 -\nessential to sustain economic activity and complement what monetary policy cannot\naccomplish on its own. Direct fiscal support can make a critical difference, not just in\nhelping families and businesses stay afloat in a time of need, but also in sustaining the\nproductive capacity of the economy after we emerge from this downturn.\nFortunately, the fiscal policy response in the United States to the coronavirus\nshock has been both robust and timely. In four pieces of legislation passed in just over\ntwo months, the Congress voted $2.9 trillion in coronavirus relief, about 14 percent of\nGDP. Depending on the course of the virus and the course of the economy, more support\nfrom both fiscal and monetary policy may be called for.\nConcluding Remarks\nThe coronavirus pandemic poses the most serious threat to maximum employment\nand, potentially, to price stability that the United States has faced in our lifetimes. There\nis much that policymakers—and epidemiologists—simply do not know right now about\nthe potential course that the virus, and thus the economy, will take. But there is one thing\nthat I am certain about: The Federal Reserve will continue to act forcefully, proactively,\nand aggressively as we deploy our toolkit—including our balance sheet, forward\nguidance, and lending facilities—to provide critical support to the economy during this\nchallenging time and to do all we can to make sure that the recovery from this downturn,\nonce it commences, is as robust as possible.",

Clarida\nVice Chair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“A Hot Economy: Sustainability and Trade-Offs,” a Fed Listens event sponsored by\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nSan Francisco, California\nSeptember 26, 2019\n\nI am delighted to be in San Francisco today to participate in this Fed Listens\nconference, “A Hot Economy: Sustainability and Trade-Offs,” which is one of a series of\nevents associated with the Federal Reserve’s 2019 review of our monetary policy\nstrategy, tools, and communication practices.1\nMotivation for the Review\nAlthough I will have more to say about the review in a moment, let me state at the\noutset that we believe our existing framework, which has been in place since 2012, has\nserved us well and has enabled us to achieve and sustain our statutorily assigned goals of\nmaximum employment and price stability. However, we also believe now is a good time\nto step back and assess whether, and in what possible ways, we can refine our strategy,\ntools, and communication practices to achieve and maintain our goals as consistently and\nrobustly as possible.2\nWith the U.S. economy operating at or close to maximum employment and price\nstability, now is an especially opportune time to conduct this review. The unemployment\nrate is near a 50-year low, and inflation is running close to our 2 percent objective. With\nthis review, we hope to ensure that we are well positioned to continue to meet our\nstatutory goals in coming years.\nThe U.S. and foreign economies have changed in some important ways since the\nGlobal Financial Crisis. Perhaps most significantly, neutral interest rates appear to have\n1 These remarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 Fuhrer and others (2018) explore the desirability of comprehensive reviews of the monetary policy\nframework. They argue that such reviews may help the Fed more effectively identify and implement\nneeded changes to its framework.\n\n- 2 -\nfallen in the United States.3 A fall in neutral rates increases the likelihood that a central\nbank’s policy rate will hit its effective lower bound (ELB) in future economic downturns.\nThat development, in turn, could make it more difficult during downturns for monetary\npolicy to support spending and employment and to keep inflation from falling too far\nbelow the 2 percent objective.4\nAnother key development in recent decades is that price inflation appears less\nresponsive to resource slack. That is, the short-run price Phillips curve—if not the wage\nPhillips curve—appears to have flattened, implying a change in the dynamic relationship\nbetween inflation and employment.5 A flatter Phillips curve permits the Federal Reserve\nto support employment more aggressively during downturns—as was the case during and\nafter the Great Recession—because a sustained inflation breakout is less likely when the\nPhillips curve is flatter.6 However, a flatter Phillips curve also increases the cost, in\nterms of lost economic output, of reversing unwelcome increases in longer-run inflation\nexpectations. Thus, a flatter Phillips curve makes it all the more important that inflation\nexpectations remain anchored at levels consistent with our 2 percent inflation objective.7\n3 For evidence of a fall in neutral rates of interest in the United States and abroad, see, among several\ncontributions, King and Low (2014); Holston, Laubach, and Williams (2017); Rachel and Smith (2017);\nand Brand, Bielecki, and Penalver (2018).\n4 For assessments of the risks that U.S. monetary policy will be constrained by the ELB and its implications\nfor economic activity and inflation, see Kiley and Roberts (2017), Erceg and others (2018),\nSwanson (2018), and Chung and others (2019).\n5 For evidence of a flattening of the slope of the Phillips curve in the United States and abroad, see, among\nothers, Simon, Matheson, and Sandri (2013); Blanchard, Cerutti, and Summers (2015); and Bank for\nInternational Settlements (2017).\n6 One potential contributor to the flattening of the Phillips curve is a change in the conduct of monetary\npolicy since the 1980s toward greater stabilization of inflation and economic activity; for evidence of such\na change, see Clarida, Galí, and Gertler (2000); Boivin and Giannoni (2006); and Boivin, Kiley, and\nMishkin (2010). As discussed in Roberts (2006) and Bullard (2018), greater stabilization on the part of a\ncentral bank can lead to the estimation of flatter Phillips curves in reduced-form regressions. Similarly, the\nadoption of an explicit inflation objective, along with greater certainty regarding the conduct of monetary\npolicy, can help anchor longer-term inflation expectations and stabilize actual inflation in response to\nshocks.\n7 See Yellen (2015) for a discussion of inflation dynamics and monetary policy; see Erceg and others\n(2018) for a quantitative exploration of the monetary policy implications of a flat Phillips curve in an\n\n- 3 -\nAnd let me emphasize that, based on the evidence I have reviewed, I judge that U.S.\ninflation expectations today do reside in a range I consider consistent with our\nprice-stability mandate.\nA Robust U.S. Labor Market\nFor some time now, price stability in the United States has coincided with a\nhistorically low unemployment rate. This low unemployment rate, 3.7 percent in August,\nhas been interpreted by many as suggesting that the labor market is currently operating\nbeyond full employment. However, we cannot directly observe the level of the\nunemployment rate that is consistent with full employment and price stability, u*, but\nmust infer it from data via models. I myself believe that the range of plausible estimates\nof u* extends to 4 percent and below and includes the current unemployment rate of\n3.7 percent. As the unemployment rate has declined in recent years, labor force\nparticipation for people in their prime working years has increased significantly, with the\nAugust participation rate at a cycle high of 82.6 percent.8 Increased prime-age\nparticipation has provided employers with additional labor resources and has been one\nfactor, along with a pickup in labor productivity, restraining inflationary pressures.\nWhether participation will continue to increase in a tight labor market remains to be seen.\nuncertain economic environment. Since the mid-1980s, movements in both realized inflation and measures\nof longer-term inflation expectations have been somewhat muted, complicating the task of extracting the\nprecise role of inflation expectations as a determinant of realized inflation. Faust and Wright (2013) review\nthe literature on inflation forecasting and present evidence in support of the conclusion that measures of\ninflation expectations help predict the trend in inflation. Cecchetti and others (2017) showed that while the\nlevel of realized inflation and four-quarter-ahead inflation expectations are positively correlated, changes in\nthese variables have been largely uncorrelated since the mid-1980s. These authors suggest that, in a low\nand stable inflation environment, policymakers should pay attention to a wide array of other indicators in\ndetermining the implications of movements in realized inflation and measures of inflation expectations.\n8 The box “The Labor Force Participation Rate for Prime-Age Individuals” in the Board’s July 2018\nMonetary Policy Report contains a discussion of recent developments in labor force participation rates for\nprime-age individuals; see Board of Governors (2018b, pp. 8–10).\n\n- 4 -\nBut I note that prime-age participation still remains below levels seen in previous\nbusiness cycle expansions.\nAlso, although the labor market is robust, there is no evidence that rising wages\nare putting upward pressure on price inflation. Wages today are increasing broadly in\nline with productivity growth and underlying inflation. Also of note, and receiving less\nattention than it deserves, is the material increase in labor’s share of national income that\nhas occurred in recent years as the labor market has tightened. As I have written before,\nthere is a cyclical regularity in U.S. data that labor’s share tends to rise as expansions\nendure and the labor market tightens.9 In recent cycles—and thus far in this cycle—this\nrise in labor’s share has not put upward pressure on price inflation.\nThe strong job gains of recent years also have delivered benefits to groups that\nhave historically been disadvantaged in the labor market. For example, African\nAmericans and Hispanics have experienced persistently higher unemployment rates than\nwhites for many decades.10 However, those unemployment rate gaps have narrowed as\nthe labor market has strengthened, and, as President Daly’s research shows, there is some\nindication these groups especially benefit when the unemployment rate remains very\nlow.11 Likewise, the gaps between unemployment rates for less-educated workers and\ntheir more-educated counterparts appear to narrow as the labor market strengthens.12\n9 See Clarida (2016).\n10 See Cajner and others (2017) for a careful examination of how labor market differentials by race and\nethnicity have evolved over time.\n11 See Aaronson and others (2019) for evidence on the relative behavior of unemployment rates by race and\nethnicity in a strong labor market. The authors find similar patterns for labor force participation rates and\nfor employment-to-population ratios.\n12 Disparities in labor market outcomes are also evident between urban and rural areas of the United States.\nHowever, these gaps have not narrowed as the labor market has strengthened. The box “Employment\nDisparities between Rural and Urban Areas” in the Board’s February 2019 Monetary Policy Report\nexamines these disparities in more detail; see Board of Governors (2019, pp. 10–12). See also Weingarden\n(2017).\n\n- 5 -\nWage increases in the past couple of years have been strongest for less-educated workers\nand for those at the lower end of the wage distribution.13\nScope of the Review\nThe Federal Reserve Act assigns to the Fed the responsibility to conduct monetary\npolicy “so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices,\nand moderate long-term interest rates.”14 Our review this year takes this statutory\nmandate as given and also takes as given that inflation at a rate of 2 percent is most\nconsistent over the longer run with the congressional mandate.\nOur existing monetary policy strategy is laid out in the Committee’s Statement on\nLonger-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.15 First adopted in January 2012, the\nstatement indicates that the Committee seeks to mitigate deviations of inflation from\n2 percent and deviations of employment from assessments of its maximum level. In\ndoing so, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) recognizes that these\nassessments of maximum employment are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision.\nAs a practical matter, our current strategy shares many elements with the policy\nframework known as “flexible inflation targeting.”16 However, the Fed’s mandate is\nmuch more explicit about the role of employment than that of most flexible inflation-\n13 Wage gains for workers with different wage levels and with different levels of education can be\ncalculated using data from the Current Population Survey from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The\nEconomic Policy Institute (2019) provides convenient tabulations of these data.\n14 Even though the act lists three distinct goals, the Federal Reserve’s mandate for monetary policy is\ncommonly known as the “dual mandate.” The reason is that an economy in which people who want to\nwork either have a job or are likely to find one fairly quickly and in which the price level (meaning a broad\nmeasure of the price of goods and services purchased by consumers) is stable creates the conditions needed\nfor interest rates to settle at moderate levels. For a discussion, see Mishkin (2007). Quoted text from the\nFederal Reserve Act is in 12 U.S.C. § 225a (2000),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/section2a.htm.\n15 The statement is available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals.pdf.\n16 For a discussion of this terminology and references, see English, López-Salido, and Tetlow (2015) and\nClinton and others (2015).\n\n- 6 -\ntargeting central banks, and our statement reflects this by stating that when the two sides\nof the mandate are in conflict, neither one takes precedence over the other.\nThe review of our current framework is wide ranging, and we are not prejudging\nwhere it will take us, but events of the past decade highlight three broad questions that we\nwill seek to answer with our review.\nThree Questions\nThe first question is, “Can the Federal Reserve best meet its statutory objectives\nwith its existing monetary policy strategy, or should it consider strategies that aim to\nreverse past misses of the inflation objective?”\nUnder our current approach as well as the approaches of many central banks\naround the world, persistent inflation shortfalls of the target are treated as “bygones.”\nCentral banks are generally believed to have effective tools for preventing persistent\ninflation overshoots, but the ELB on interest rates makes persistent undershoots more of a\nchallenge. Persistent inflation shortfalls carry the risk that longer-term inflation\nexpectations become anchored below the stated inflation goal.17\nIn part because of that concern, some economists have advocated “makeup”\nstrategies under which policymakers seek to undo past inflation deviations from target.\nThese strategies include targeting average inflation and price-level targeting, in which\npolicymakers seek to stabilize the price level around a constant growth path.18 Other\n17 These risks could be exacerbated if households and businesses expect monetary policy to be\ninsufficiently accommodative because of proximity to the ELB. For related discussions, see Reifschneider\nand Williams (2000); Adam and Billi (2007); Nakov (2008); and Hills, Nakata, and Schmidt (2016).\n18 Eggertsson and Woodford (2003) provide an early discussion of how optimal monetary policy at the ELB\nentails a commitment to reflate the price level during the subsequent economic expansion. Nessén and\nVestin (2005) discuss the relationship between average inflation targeting and price-level targeting. There\nis a dearth of empirical evidence on strategies seeking to make up for inflation deviations. Central banks\nthat pursue an inflation goal generally seek to achieve a specific rate of inflation by some time horizon—\n\n- 7 -\nmakeup strategies seek to reverse shortfalls in policy accommodation at the ELB by\nkeeping the policy rate lower for longer than otherwise would be the case.19 In many\nmodels that incorporate the ELB, these makeup strategies lead to better average\nperformance on both legs of the dual mandate.20\nThe success of makeup strategies relies on households and firms believing in\nadvance that the makeup will, in fact, be delivered when the time comes—for example,\nthat a persistent inflation shortfall will be met by future inflation above 2 percent. As is\nwell known from the research literature, makeup strategies, in general, are not time\nconsistent because when the time comes to push inflation above 2 percent, conditions at\nthat time will not justify that action. Thus, one of the most important questions we will\nseek to answer in our review is whether the Fed could, in practice, attain the benefits of\nmakeup strategies that are possible in theoretical models.\nThe next question the review will consider is, “Are existing monetary policy tools\nadequate to achieve and maintain maximum employment and price stability, or should\ntypically a couple of years ahead or over the “medium run”—without regard to past inflation deviations.\nOne exception is the Reserve Bank of Australia, whose inflation goal is specified as a range of\n“2–3 per cent, on average, over the medium term” and thus might embed some notion of history\ndependence. However, Ruge-Murcia (2014) argues that the drift in the price level in Australia is\ncomparable with the drifts observed in economies with purely forward-looking specification of the inflation\ngoal. The only known historical example of price-level targeting occurred in Sweden from 1931 to 1933\nwhen the country abandoned the gold standard and attempted instead to maintain its price level. The\ntemporary adoption of price-level targeting is credited with helping Sweden avoid deflation, an outcome\nthat contrasted with that in countries that stayed on the gold standard. See Berg and Jonung (1999).\nSee Bernanke (2017) for a discussion of a temporary price-level targeting strategy. See Hebden and\nLópez-Salido (2018) for a quantitative assessment of that and other strategies. See also Kiley and Roberts\n(2017) for a strategy in which policymakers aim for inflation higher than 2 percent during economic\nexpansions to compensate for below-target realizations of inflation during economic downturns.\n19 See Reifschneider and Williams (2000) for a strategy in which a central bank following a Taylor rule\nmakes up for shortfalls in policy accommodation during ELB episodes by subsequently keeping the policy\nrate lower than otherwise. The box “Complexities of Monetary Policy Rules” in the Board’s July 2018\nMonetary Policy Report contains an application of such a modified rule; see Board of Governors (2018b,\npp. 37–41).\n20 See English, López-Salido, and Tetlow (2015) for applications of flexible price-level targeting and\nnominal income-targeting strategies to a quantitative model of the U.S. economy.\n\n- 8 -\nthe toolkit be expanded? And, if so, how?” The FOMC’s primary monetary policy tool\nis its target range for the federal funds rate. In December 2008, the FOMC cut that target\nto just above zero in response to financial turmoil and deteriorating economic conditions.\nBecause the U.S. economy required additional support after the ELB was reached, the\nFOMC deployed two additional tools in the years following the crisis: balance sheet\npolicies and forward guidance about the likely path of the federal funds rate.21\nIn addition to assessing the efficacy of these existing tools, the review will\nexamine additional tools for easing policy when the ELB is binding. During the crisis\nand its aftermath, the Federal Reserve considered but ultimately found some of the tools\ndeployed by other central banks wanting in the U.S. context. But the review will reassess\nthe case for these and other tools in light of more recent experience with using these tools\nin other countries.\nThe third question the review will consider is, “How can the FOMC’s\ncommunication of its policy framework and implementation be improved?” Our\ncommunication practices have evolved considerably since 1994, when the Federal\nReserve released the first statement after an FOMC meeting. Over the past decade or so,\nthe FOMC has enhanced its communication both to promote public understanding of its\npolicy goals, strategy, and actions and to foster democratic accountability. These\nenhancements include the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy\nStrategy; postmeeting press conferences; various statements about the principles and\n21 As an illustration of the shortfall in policy support created by a binding ELB during the Global Financial\nCrisis, the simple policy rules considered in a January 2017 speech by then-Chair Janet Yellen prescribed\nsetting the federal funds rate between negative 1-1/2 and negative 9 percent; see Yellen (2017). In addition\nto using these two additional monetary policy tools, the Federal Reserve implemented a number of other\nmeasures to stabilize the financial system, increase household and business confidence, and more generally\nsupport the economic recovery. These supplementary measures included the setting up of several credit\nfacilities and the introduction of stress tests for systemically important financial institutions.\n\n- 9 -\nstrategy guiding the Committee’s normalization of monetary policy; and quarterly\nsummaries of individual FOMC participants’ economic projections, assessments about\nthe appropriate path of the federal funds rate, and judgments of the uncertainty and\nbalance of risks around their projections.22\nAs part of the review, we will assess the Committee’s current and past\ncommunications and additional forms of communication that could be helpful. For\nexample, there might be ways to improve communication about the coordination of\npolicy tools or the interplay between monetary policy and financial stability.\nActivities and Timeline for the Review\nLet me turn now to our review process itself.23 At our Fed Listens events, we are\nhearing from a broad range of interested individuals and groups, including business and\nlabor leaders, community development professionals, and academics. At a research\nconference at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago in early June, we heard from\nprominent academic economists as well as national and community leaders. One panel\ndiscussion provided a valuable perspective on the labor market that could not otherwise\nbe gleaned from the aggregate statistics we often consult. Another panel discussion\noffered insights into how the monetary levers we pull and push affect communities, credit\n22 Starting in 1979, the Federal Reserve published a summary of individual economic projections from\nvarious Board members, FOMC members, or FOMC participants in the semiannual Monetary Policy\nReport. With the introduction of the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) in 2007, the FOMC\nincreased the frequency of the releases of policymaker projections, expanded the set of economic variables\nincluded, and extended the forecast horizon. Because the SEP includes individual contributions of\nprojections and assessments from all FOMC participants, it captures a broader range of views than those of\nFOMC members. For a discussion and data, see Bernanke (2007) and Romer (2010).\n23 Information about the review and the events associated with it are available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review-of-monetary-policy-strategy-tools-and-\ncommunications.htm.\n\n- 10 -\navailability, and small businesses. In addition to the Chicago conference, all 12 Reserve\nBanks and the Board of Governors have hosted or will soon host Fed Listens events.\nThis summer, the FOMC began to assess what we have learned at the Fed Listens\nevents and to receive briefings from System staff on topics relevant to the review.24 At\nour July meeting, FOMC participants agreed that our current framework for monetary\npolicy has served the Committee and the U.S. economy well over the past decade.\nFOMC participants noted that the Committee’s experience with forward guidance and\nasset purchases has improved its understanding of how these tools operate. As a result,\nthe Committee could proceed more confidently in using these tools in the future if\neconomic circumstances warranted. However, overall, we judged that forward guidance\nand balance sheet tools, while helpful, did not eliminate the risk of returning to the ELB.\nIf forward guidance or balance sheet actions prove to be insufficient in future episodes,\nELB constraints could impede the attainment of the Federal Reserve’s dual-mandate\nobjectives over time. At our July meeting, we also noted that the Committee’s Statement\non Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy has been helpful in articulating and\nclarifying the Federal Reserve’s approach to monetary policy and agreed that any\nchanges we might make to our strategy would likely call for some modification of this\nconsensus statement.\nWe have much still to discuss at upcoming meetings. I expect we will consider\nvarious topics, such as alternative policy strategies, options for enhanced use of existing\nmonetary policy tools, possible additions to the policy toolkit, potential changes to\ncommunication practices, and the relationship between monetary policy and financial\n24 See Board of Governors (2019b).\n\n- 11 -\nstability. We will share our findings with the public when we have completed our\nreview, likely during the first half of next year.\nConcluding Thoughts\nThe economy is constantly evolving, bringing with it new policy challenges. So it\nmakes sense for us to remain open minded as we assess current practices and consider\nideas that could potentially enhance our ability to deliver on the goals the Congress has\nassigned us. For this reason, my colleagues and I do not want to preempt or to predict\nour ultimate findings. What I can say is that any refinements or more material changes to\nour framework that we might make will be aimed solely at enhancing our ability to\nachieve and sustain our dual-mandate objectives in the world we live in today.\nThank you very much for your time and attention. I look forward to the excellent\nprogram President Daly and her team have put together.\n\n- 12 -\nReferences\nAaronson, Stephanie R., Mary C. Daly, William Wascher, and David W.

Clarida\nVice Chair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Late Cycle Investing: Opportunity and Risk”\nFixed-Income Management 2019, a conference sponsored by\nthe CFA Institute and the CFA Society of Boston\nBoston, Massachusetts\nOctober 18, 2019\n\nThank you for the opportunity to participate in this CFA Institute conference on\nfixed-income management. Before we begin our conversation, I would like to share a\nfew thoughts about the outlook for the U.S. economy and monetary policy.1\nThe U.S. economy is in a good place, and the baseline outlook is favorable. The\nmedian expectation from Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants’ most\nrecent Summary of Economic Projections is for GDP growth to be around 2 percent in\n2019, for growth to continue near this pace next year, and for personal consumption\nexpenditures (PCE) inflation to rise gradually to our symmetric 2 percent objective.2\nThe unemployment rate, at 3.5 percent, is at a half-century low, and wages are rising\nbroadly in line with productivity growth and underlying inflation. There is no evidence\nto date that a strong labor market is putting excessive cost-push pressure on price\ninflation.\nBut despite this favorable baseline outlook, the U.S. economy confronts some\nevident risks in this the 11th year of economic expansion. Business fixed investment has\nslowed notably since last year, exports are contracting on a year-over-year basis, and\nindicators of manufacturing activity are weakening. Global growth estimates continue to\nbe marked down, and global disinflationary pressures cloud the outlook for U.S. inflation.\nU.S. inflation remains muted. Over the 12 months through August, PCE inflation\nis running at 1.4 percent, and core PCE inflation, which excludes volatile food and\nenergy prices, is running at 1.8 percent.\n1 These remarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee. I am grateful to Brian Doyle of the Federal Reserve Board\nstaff for his assistance in preparing this text.\n2 The most recent Summary of Economic Projections is an addendum to the minutes of the September 2019\nFOMC meeting. See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2019), “Minutes of the Federal\nOpen Market Committee, September 17–18, 2019,” press release, October 9,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20191009a.htm.\n\n- 2 -\nTurning now to monetary policy, at both its July and September meetings, the\nFOMC voted to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points.3 With\nthese decisions, the current target range for the federal funds rate is 1.75 to 2 percent,\nwhich compares with the range of 2.25 to 2.5 percent that prevailed between December\n2018 and July 2019. The Committee took these actions to provide a somewhat more\naccommodative policy in response to muted inflation pressures and the risks to the\noutlook I mentioned earlier.\nLooking ahead, monetary policy is not on a preset course, and the Committee will\nproceed on a meeting-by-meeting basis to assess the economic outlook as well as the\nrisks to the outlook, and it will act as appropriate to sustain growth, a strong labor market,\nand a return of inflation to our symmetric 2 percent objective.\nTurning now to the framework under which the Federal Reserve operates in\nfinancial markets, in September of this year, shocks in the repurchase agreement (repo)\nmarket put upward pressure on money market rates, and these pressures spilled over into\nthe federal funds market. In response to these developments, the Federal Reserve on\nSeptember 17 initiated a program of repurchase operations to provide liquidity sufficient\nto keep the federal funds rate within the desired target range. These operations have been\nsuccessful in achieving this goal.\nAs the FOMC announced in January 2019, the Committee seeks to operate with a\nlevel of bank reserves that is sufficiently ample to ensure that control of the federal funds\n3 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2019), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC\nStatement,” press release, July 31,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20190731a.htm; and Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System (2019), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement,” press\nrelease, September 18, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20190918a.htm.\n\n- 3 -\nrate is achieved primarily by the setting of our administered rates and is not, over the\nlonger term, reliant on frequent and large open market operations.4 In July, the FOMC\nconcluded the program of balance sheet reduction in place since October 2017 and\nindicated then that, after a time, it would commence increasing its securities holdings to\nmaintain reserves at a level consistent with an ample-reserves regime.\nThe FOMC announced on October 11 that it would seek to maintain, over time, a\nlevel of bank reserves at or somewhat above the level that prevailed in early September, a\nlevel that we believe is sufficient to operate an ample-reserves regime.5 This week, the\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York began a program of purchasing Treasury bills in the\nsecondary market. This program will continue at least into the second quarter of next\nyear and is designed to achieve—and, over time, maintain—ample reserve balances at or\nabove the level that prevailed in early September. In addition, the Federal Reserve will\ncontinue to conduct term and overnight repo operations at least through January to ensure\nthat the supply of reserves remains ample even during periods of temporary, but\npronounced, increases in our nonreserve liabilities, and to mitigate the risk that money\nmarket pressures adversely affect monetary policy implementation.\nIt is important to note that the open market operations we have announced are\ntechnical, “Central Banking 101” operations and should not be conflated with the large-\nscale asset purchase programs that the Federal Reserve deployed after the financial crisis.\nIn those programs, the Federal Reserve was seeking to ease financial conditions by\n4 See the Statement Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation and Balance Sheet Normalization, which\nis available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20190130c.htm.\n5 See the Statement Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation, which can be found on the Board’s\nwebsite at https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20191011a.htm.\n\n- 4 -\nlowering term premiums via its purchases of long-term Treasury bonds and mortgage-\nbacked securities. By contrast, the program announced on October 11 will concentrate its\npurchases in Treasury bills. The technical measures we are undertaking do not represent\na change in the stance of monetary policy, which we continue to implement by adjusting\nthe target range for the federal funds rate.\nFinally, I would like to say a few words about the monetary policy framework\nreview we are undertaking this year. This review of our monetary policy strategy, tools,\nand communications is the first of its kind for the Federal Reserve. Public engagement,\nunprecedented in scope for the Fed, is an important part of this effort. Through our Fed\nListens events, we have been hearing a diverse range of perspectives not only from\nacademic experts, but also from representatives of consumer, labor, business, community,\nand other groups. We will draw on these insights as we assess how best to achieve and\nmaintain maximum employment and price stability in the most robust fashion possible.\nIn July, we began discussing issues associated with the review at our FOMC meetings.\nWe will continue reporting on our discussions in the meeting minutes and share our\nconclusions when we finish the review during the first half of next year.6\nThank you very much for your attention.\n6 Information about the review and the events associated with it are available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review-of-monetary-policy-strategy-tools-and-\ncommunications.htm.",

Clarida\nVice Chair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\n36th Annual NABE Economic Policy Conference\nWashington, D.C.\nFebruary 25, 2020\n\nThank you for the opportunity to participate again this year in the Annual\nEconomic Policy Conference of the National Association for Business Economics. I am\nreally looking forward to this conversation. But first, I would like to share with you some\nthoughts about the outlook for the U.S. economy and monetary policy.1\nIn its 11th year of a record expansion, the U.S. economy is in a good place. The\nlabor market remains strong, economic activity is increasing at a moderate pace, and the\nFederal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) baseline outlook is for a continuation of this\nperformance in 2020.2 At present, personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, price\ninflation is running somewhat below the Committee’s 2 percent objective, but we project\nthat, under appropriate monetary policy, inflation will rise gradually to our symmetric\n2 percent objective. Although the unemployment rate is around a 50-year low, wages are\nrising broadly in line with productivity growth and underlying inflation. We are not\nseeing any evidence to date that a strong labor market is putting excessive cost-push\npressure on price inflation.\nAlthough the fundamentals supporting household consumption remain solid, over\n2019, sluggish growth abroad and global developments weighed on investment, exports,\nand manufacturing in the United States. Coming into this year, indications suggested that\nheadwinds to global growth had begun to abate, and uncertainties around trade policy had\ndiminished. However, risks to the outlook remain. In particular, we are closely\nmonitoring the emergence of the coronavirus, which is likely to have a noticeable impact\n1 These remarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee. I am grateful to Brian Doyle of the Federal Reserve Board\nstaff for his assistance in preparing this text.\n2 The most recent Summary of Economic Projections is an addendum to the minutes of the December 2019\nFOMC meeting. See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2020), “Minutes of the Federal\nOpen Market Committee, December 10–11, 2019,” press release, January 3,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200103a.htm.\n\n- 2 -\non Chinese growth, at least in the first quarter of this year. The disruption there could\nspill over to the rest of the global economy. But it is still too soon to even speculate\nabout either the size or the persistence of these effects, or whether they will lead to a\nmaterial change in the outlook. In addition, U.S. inflation remains muted. And inflation\nexpectations—those measured by surveys, market prices, and econometric models—\nreside at the low end of a range I consider consistent with our price-stability mandate.\nOver the course of 2019, the FOMC undertook a shift in the stance of monetary\npolicy to offset some significant global growth headwinds and global disinflationary\npressures. I believe this shift was well timed and has been providing support to the\neconomy and helping to keep the U.S. outlook on track. Monetary policy is in a good\nplace and should continue to support sustained growth, a strong labor market, and\ninflation returning to our symmetric 2 percent objective. As long as incoming\ninformation about the economy remains broadly consistent with this outlook, the current\nstance of monetary policy likely will remain appropriate.\nThat said, monetary policy is not on a preset course. The Committee will proceed\non a meeting-by-meeting basis and will be monitoring the effects of our recent policy\nactions along with other information bearing on the outlook as we assess the appropriate\npath of the target range for the federal funds rate. Of course, if developments emerge\nthat, in the future, trigger a material reassessment of our outlook, we will respond\naccordingly.\n\n- 3 -\nIn January 2019, my FOMC colleagues and I affirmed that we aim to operate with\nan ample level of bank reserves in the U.S. financial system.3 And in October, we\nannounced and began to implement a program to address pressures in repurchase\nagreement (repo) markets that became evident in September.4 To that end, we have been\npurchasing Treasury bills and conducting both overnight and term repurchase operations.\nThese efforts have been successful in achieving stable money market conditions,\nincluding over the year-end. As our bill purchases continue to build reserves toward\nlevels that we associate with ample conditions, we intend to gradually transition away\nfrom the active use of repo operations. And as reserves reach durably ample levels, we\nintend to slow the pace of purchases such that our balance sheet grows in line with trend\ndemand for our liabilities. Let me emphasize that we stand ready to adjust the details of\nthis program as appropriate and in line with our goal, which is to keep the federal funds\nrate in the target range desired by the FOMC, and that these operations are technical\nmeasures not intended to change the stance of monetary policy.\nFinally, allow me to offer a few words about the FOMC’s review of the monetary\npolicy strategy, tools, and communication practices that we commenced in 2019. This\nreview—with public engagement unprecedented in scope for us—is the first of its kind\nfor the Federal Reserve.

Clarida\nVice Chair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nHigh-Level Conference on Global Risk, Uncertainty, and Volatility, cosponsored by the\nBank for International Settlements,\nthe Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,\nand the Swiss National Bank\nZurich, Switzerland\nNovember 12, 2019\n\nGood morning. I am honored and delighted to participate in this second annual\nconference on global risk, uncertainty, and volatility, cosponsored by the Federal Reserve\nBoard, the Bank for International Settlements, and the Swiss National Bank.1 I would\nlike especially to thank the Swiss National Bank for hosting this event. This conference\nis part of continuing work across all of our institutions and the academic community to\nbetter quantify and assess the implications of risk and uncertainty. I am pleased that this\nyear the focus of the conference is on two of my long-standing professional interests—\nfinancial markets and monetary policy. And my remarks today will not stray far from\nthose interests. In particular, I would like to address an issue that has been much in\nfocus—the decline in long-term interest rates—highlighting the role of monetary policy\nin contributing to that decline and the implications of that decline for the conduct of\nmonetary policy.\nThe Decline in Long-Term Interest Rates and the Role of Monetary Policy\nOne of the most remarkable and fundamental changes in the global financial\nlandscape over the past three decades has been the steady and significant decline in\nglobal sovereign bond yields. From the late 1980s, when 10-year nominal Treasury\nyields in the United States and sovereign rates in many other major advanced economies\nwere around 10 percent, global bond yields in the advanced economies have trended\nlower to levels below 2 percent today (figure 1, “Bond Yields”).\nTo understand and interpret this decline, it is useful to think of the yield on a\nnominal 10-year bond as the sum of two components: investors’ expectation over the\n1 The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal\nOpen Market Committee. I would like to thank Vickie Chang, Stephanie Curcuru, Caitlin Dutta, Eric\nEngstrom, Don Kim, Jack McCoy, Andrew Meldrum, Katia Peneva, Marius Rodriguez, Beth Anne Wilson,\nand Emre Yoldas for their assistance in preparing this speech.\n\n- 2 -\nnext 10 years of the average level of short-term interest rates plus a term premium. The\nterm premium is the additional compensation—relative to investing in and rolling over\nshort-maturity bills—that bondholders require for assuming the risk of holding a long-\nduration asset with greater exposure to interest rate and inflation volatility. Importantly,\naccording to economic theory the equilibrium term premium can be negative. In this\ncase, which is relevant today in the United States and some other countries, the exposure\nto interest rate and inflation volatility embedded in a long-maturity bond is more than\noffset by the potential value of the bond in hedging other risks, such as equity risk.2 The\nexpectation of the average level of future short-term interest rates can, in turn, be\ndecomposed into the expectation of average future real interest rates and the expectation\nof average future inflation rates. Performing this standard decomposition reveals that the\ndecline in long-term rates reflects declines in all three components: expected real rates,\nexpected inflation, and the term premium (figure 2, “Yield Decomposition”). I will now\ndiscuss each of these components in turn.\nWith respect to expected real short-term interest rates, one reason investors expect\nlower future short-term interest rates is that neutral interest rates appear to have declined\nworldwide and are expected to remain low. This concept of a neutral level for short-term\nreal interest rates is referred to in the academic literature as r* and corresponds to the rate\nconsistent with a level of aggregate demand equal to and growing in pace with aggregate\nsupply at an unchanged rate of inflation. Longer-run secular trends in r* largely, or even\nentirely, reflect fundamental “real” factors that are outside the control of a central bank.\n2 Term premium estimates have been negative in the euro area and Japan for several years. See Cohen,\nHördahl, and Xia (2018) and International Monetary Fund (2018).\n\n- 3 -\nPolicymakers and academics alike, including myself, have spent considerable time\nexploring the reasons for and ramifications of the decline in r* across countries.3 For\nexample, many have pointed to slowing population growth and a moderation in the pace\nof technological change as consistent with a lower level of r*.4 Changes in risk tolerance\nand regulations have led to an increase in savings and in the demand for safe assets,\npushing down yields on sovereign bonds.5 Importantly, economic theory suggests and\nempirical research confirms that there is a significant common global component\nembedded in individual country r*s (figure 3, “Estimates of r*”).6 This common factor\ndriving individual country r*s not only reflects the influence of common global shocks\naffecting all economies in a similar way (for example, a slowdown in global productivity\nand the demographics associated with aging), but also results from international capital\nflows that respond to and, over time, tend to narrow divergences in rates of return offered\nacross different countries. Other things being equal, a decline in the common factor\ndriving individual country r*s that is evident in the data would be expected to produce a\ncomparable common decline in global bond yields.\nIn addition to the decline in r* around the world, lower long-term bond yields also\nreflect the influence of the initial downshift and ultimate anchoring of inflation\nexpectations in many countries after the mid-1990s. Unlike the decline in r*, which\n3 See, for instance, Fischer (2016a, 2016b, 2017) and Clarida (2019).\n4 Most papers—such as Carvalho, Ferrero, and Nechio (2016); Gagnon, Johannsen, and Lopez-Salido\n(2016); and Eggertsson, Mehrotra, and Robbins (2017)—estimate that demographics can explain between 1\nand 2 percentage points of the decline in r*.\n5 See Williams (2016, 2017); Caballero, Farhi, and Gourinchas (2017); Glick (2019); Chen, Karabarbounis,\nand Neiman (2017); and Dao and Maggi (2018) for a discussion of the potential drivers for the increase in\nthe supply of savings and increased demand for safe assets. Other factors cited for lower real rates include\nlow productivity growth (Rachel and Summers, 2019) and secular stagnation due to insufficient aggregate\ndemand (Summers, 2015).\n6 See Holston, Laubach, and Williams (2017); Clarida (2019); and Jorda and others (2019).\n\n- 4 -\nprimarily reflects fundamental “real” factors that are outside the control of a central bank,\nthe decline and ultimate anchoring of inflation and inflation expectations in both major\nand many emerging economies were the direct consequence of the widespread adoption\nand commitment to transparent, flexible inflation-targeting monetary policy strategies.\nFor example, in the United States, after the collapse of Bretton Woods, inflation spiraled\nupward, hitting double-digit rates in the 1970s and early 1980s. But by the mid-1980s,\nthe back of inflation had been broken (thank you, Paul Volcker), and total personal\nconsumption expenditure (PCE) inflation averaged less than 4 percent from 1985 to\n1990. Following the 1990–91 recession, inflation fell further, and, by the mid-1990s, the\nconditions for price stability in the United States had been achieved (thank you, Alan\nGreenspan). From the mid-1990s until the Great Recession, U.S. PCE inflation averaged\nabout 2 percent. And, of course, this step-down in inflation has been global, with the\nother major advanced economies experiencing a similar shift down (table 1, “Average\nInflation Rates”). Many major emerging market economies as well have seen a\nremarkable and very welcome decline in average inflation rates as a result of adopting\nand delivering on credible inflation-targeting polices. To the extent that the step-down in\ninflation is expected to persist, which appears to be the case, long-term yields have\nreflected this decline one-for-one.\nHowever, not only has the average level of inflation fallen, but inflation has also\nbecome more stable. After considerable volatility in the 1970s and 1980s, over the past\nfew decades, inflation—especially core inflation, which excludes volatile food and\nenergy prices—has, with rare exceptions, moved only within a relatively narrow range in\nmany countries despite significant swings in the prices of oil and other commodities,\n\n- 5 -\nrecessions, the Global Financial Crisis, and unprecedented monetary policy actions.\nReflecting this, inflation volatility, as measured by the standard deviation in quarterly\ninflation rates, has declined. (See table 2, “Standard Deviation of Annualized Quarterly\nHeadline Inflation Rates.”)\nWhat has been behind this global decline in inflation volatility? I would argue, as\nhave many others, that monetary policy played a key role in reducing not only the\naverage rate of inflation, but also the volatility of inflation.7 Inflation-targeting monetary\npolicy can plausibly influence the variance of inflation through several channels. For\nexample, in a textbook DSGE (dynamic stochastic general equilibrium) model (Clarida,\nGalí, and Gertler (CGG), 1999) featuring a central bank that implements policy via a\nTaylor-type rule, the equilibrium variance of inflation will be lower the more\naggressively the central bank leans against exogenous shocks that push inflation away\nfrom target. So even if the variance of inflation shocks is constant, the variance of\ninflation itself will be an endogenous function of monetary policy. Another related\nchannel through which monetary policy can influence the variance of inflation is by\nchanging the equilibrium persistence of inflation deviations from target. In the textbook\nCGG model (1999), augmented with a hybrid Phillips curve that features an inertial\nbackward-looking component, the equilibrium persistence of inflation is an endogenous\nfunction of the monetary policy rule such that the more aggressively the central bank\nleans against exogenous shocks that push inflation away from target, the less persistent\nare inflation deviations from target in equilibrium. In the simple case in which\nequilibrium inflation is a first-order autoregressive process (as it is in the CGG (1999)\n7 This view has also long been shared by fellow monetary policymakers. See, for example, Bernanke\n(2007b) and Powell (2018).\n\n- 6 -\nmodel under optimal policy), the equilibrium unconditional variance of inflation is\nmonotonic in inflation persistence for any given constant variance of inflation shocks. Of\ncourse, non-monetary factors may also have contributed to a lower variance of inflation.\nFor example, the variance of underlying exogenous shocks to aggregate supply and\ndemand may have fortuitously and coincidentally fallen in tandem with the adoption of\ninflation targeting in many countries.\nI will now turn to a third factor behind the decline in global bond yields, the\ndecline in term premiums that is estimated to have occurred in many countries over the\npast 20 years. Most studies find that term premiums have fallen substantially in major\neconomies over the past 20 years, and that in the United States term premiums may have\nbeen negative for some time. Decomposing the factors that drive equilibrium term\npremiums is an active area of academic research, and I will not attempt to summarize or\nsynthesize this vast literature.8 But I would like to emphasize what seems to me to be\nthree contributors to the decline in the term premium in the United States and perhaps in\nother countries as well.9\nFirst, the decline in inflation volatility has almost certainly been important in\ndriving the term premium on nominal bonds lower. The real ex-post payoff from holding\na nominal bond to maturity is directly exposed to price-level risk, and thus, all else being\nequal, a decline in inflation volatility makes the real purchasing power of the bond’s\npayoff less risky. Through this channel, the decline in inflation volatility should be\nreflected in a smaller inflation risk premium in nominal bond yields, which is exactly\n8 Gürkaynak and Wright (2012) provide a survey.\n9 For estimates of term premiums in other countries, see Cohen, Hördahl, and Xia (2018), and International\nMonetary Fund (2018).\n\n- 7 -\nwhat is estimated in the Kim, Walsh, and Wei (2019) yield curve model (figure 4, “Term\nPremium Decomposition”). Indeed, this yield curve model attributes around 100 basis\npoints of the decline in the U.S. 10-year nominal term premium since the early 1990s to a\ndecline in the inflation risk premium.\nA second likely contributor to the decline in the U.S. term premium over the past\ndecade is the Federal Reserve’s substantial purchases of long-duration Treasury securities\nand mortgage-backed securities in three large-scale asset purchase (LSAP) programs and\none maturity extension program between late 2008 and late 2014. These purchases,\nwhich were concentrated at the longer end of the U.S. yield curve, took duration out of\nthe market and thus lowered the equilibrium yield required by investors to hold the\nreduced supply of long-duration assets instead of holding and rolling over short-maturity\nTreasury bills. Estimates of the cumulative effect of these purchases on the U.S. term\npremium span a wide range, with some estimates above 100 basis points.10 Moreover,\nthe global market for sovereign bonds and currency-hedged duration is tightly integrated,\nand it seems likely that asset purchase programs in other major economies, such as Japan,\nthe euro area, and the United Kingdom, have contributed as well to reducing the term\npremium in Treasury securities (and, of course, LSAP programs in the United States\nlikely contributed to lower term premiums abroad).\nA third contributor to a lower U.S. term premium is much less widely appreciated\nthan lower inflation volatility and LSAPs. This reflects the value that bonds have\nprovided over the past 20 years as a hedge against equity risk. As documented by\nCampbell, Sunderam, and Viceira (CSV) (2017) and Campbell, Pflueger, and Viceira\n10 For recent reviews, see Kuttner (2018) and Gagnon (2016). Hamilton and Wu (2012) and Li and Wei\n(2013), among others, study the effects of the Fed’s asset purchases in a term structure model setting.\n\n- 8 -\n(CPV) (forthcoming), the empirical correlation between U.S. bond and stock returns\nchanged sign in the late 1990s from positive to negative (figure 5, “Bond–Stock\nCovariance in the United States”). In the 1970s and 1980s, the sign of the correlation\nwas positive, which implies that bond and stock returns tended to rise and fall together.\nIn this period, bonds provided a diversification benefit when added to an equity portfolio\n(the bond return beta to stocks averaged 0.2) but not a hedge against equity risk. Since\nthe late 1990s, the empirical correlation between bond and stock returns has typically\nbeen negative (the bond return beta to stocks has averaged negative 0.2). This means that\nsince the late 1990s, bond returns tend to be high and positive when stock returns are low\nand negative so that nominal bonds have been a valuable outright hedge against equity\nrisk. As such, we would expect the equilibrium yield on bonds to be lower than\notherwise, as investors should bid up their price to reflect their value as a hedge against\nequity risk (relative to their value when the bond beta to stocks was positive). According\nto CSV, the hedging value of nominal bonds with a negative beta to stocks could\nsubstantially lower the equilibrium term premium on bonds. Quoting from their paper\n(page 265),\n“Thus from peak to trough, the realized beta of Treasury bonds has\ndeclined by about 0.6 and has changed sign. According to the CAPM\n[capital asset pricing model], this would imply that term premia on 10-\nyear zero-coupon Treasuries should have declined by 60 percent of the\nequity premium.”11\n11 To elaborate a bit, this estimate of the implied decline in term premium may be on the larger side of\nestimates, because the term premium represents an expected average bond risk premium over the life of the\nbond and because the CAPM beta is expected to shrink as the bond’s remaining time-to-maturity shrinks.\n\n- 9 -\nAs a concrete example, consider the (ex-post) hedging value of bonds for equity risk in\nthe Global Financial Crisis. In 2008, the total return on the S&P 500 index was around\nminus 37 percent, while the total return of the on-the-run 30-year Treasury bond was\nabout 38 percent!\nThere is likely no single explanation for the change in sign of the correlation\nbetween equilibrium bond and stock returns in the United States and in other major\ncountries (figure 6, “Bond–Stock Covariances in Advanced Economies”).12 One recent\npaper that does rigorously model the changing value of bonds for hedging equity risk is\nby CPV. This paper develops and estimates a habit persistence consumption asset pricing\nmodel in which the sign of the equilibrium covariance between equity and bond returns\ndepends on the reduced-form correlation between inflation and the output gap, the\ncorrelation between the federal funds rate and the output gap, as well as the equilibrium\npersistence of inflation. CPV document in U.S. data, for a sample spanning 1979:Q3 to\n2011:Q4, that (1) the correlation between inflation and the output gap changed sign from\nnegative to positive; that (2) the correlation between the federal funds rate and the output\ngap changed sign, also from negative to positive; and that (3) the evidence of the sign\nchange becomes statistically significant beginning in the late 1990s. CPV also document\nthat the transitory component of inflation becomes much less persistent after the\nestimated break in their sample.\nThe CPV paper is agnostic as to why the reduced-form correlation between\ninflation and the output gap and that between the federal funds rate and the output gap\nboth change sign in their sample, but the authors do demonstrate that in their asset pricing\n12 See, for instance, d’Addona and Kind (2006); Bekaert, Engstrom, and Grenadier (2010); Eraker (2008);\nand Bansal and Shaliastovich (2013).\n\n- 10 -\nmodel, these reduced-form sign changes are sufficient to generate the sign change in the\ncorrelation between equity and bond returns that we observe in the data.\nI, myself, believe that the change in the U.S. monetary policy regime that began in\n1979 under Paul Volcker and that was extended by Alan Greenspan in the 1990s very\nlikely contributed to the change in the sign of the correlation between inflation and the\noutput gap as well as the change in sign of the correlation between the federal funds rate\nand the output gap that we observe in the data (Clarida, Galí, and Gertler, 2000). These\nare the sorts of patterns that a simple model of optimal monetary policy would produce\nwhen starting from an initial condition in which inflation is well above the (implicit)\ntarget, as was the case in 1979. High initial inflation triggers a policy response for the\ncentral bank to push up the real policy rate well above inflation in order to push output\nbelow potential, which, via the Phillips curve, will, over time, lower inflation toward the\ntarget. If this policy succeeds ex post, inflation expectations become anchored at the new\nlower level of inflation, and policy can, then, respond to demand shocks by adjusting real\nrates pro-cyclically, the opposite of what is required when initial inflation is too high and\ninflation expectations are not anchored.13 Inflation will also be pro-cyclical with well-\nanchored inflation expectations if demand shocks dominate and inflation expectations\nremain anchored.\nImplications for Monetary Policy: The Federal Reserve’s Framework Review\nBy lowering expected inflation, by anchoring expected inflation at a low level, by\ncontributing to a reduction in the volatility of inflation—and thus a reduction in the\ninflation risk premium—and by contributing to creating a hedging value of long-duration\n13 Hoek, Kamin, and Yoldas (2019) show that monetary policy actions that are interpreted as responses to\nrising inflation have more adverse spillovers to emerging markets than actions motivated by growth shocks.\n\n- 11 -\nsovereign bonds, inflation-targeting monetary policy has lowered equilibrium bond yields\nrelative to equilibrium short rates substantially compared with the experience of the\n1970s and early 1980s. But, as I noted earlier, during the past decade equilibrium short\nrates have themselves also fallen substantially. These two phenomena, taken together,\nhave resulted in sovereign bond yields that are substantially lower than the pre-crisis\nexperience and thus substantially closer to the effective lower bound for the policy rate\nthan they were before the crisis. But what does this mean for monetary policy? At its\nmost basic level, the answer to this question could depend on how far the nominal policy\nrate is from the effective lower bound (ELB) and the extent to which the term premium\non long-duration bonds can become even more negative than it is at present (at least in\nthe United States).14 While I do not have a precise answer to this question, I will confess\nthat I think it highly unlikely in the next downturn, whenever it is, that 10-year U.S.\nTreasury yields will fall by the roughly 390 basis points that we observed between June\n2007 and July 2016 (the bottom in Treasury yields in this cycle) or even decline by the\nroughly 360 basis points that we observed between January 2000 and June 2003.\nThe reality of low neutral rates and equilibrium bond yields has motivated us at\nthe Federal Reserve to take a hard look this year at our monetary policy strategy, tools,\nand communication practices. While we believe our existing framework, in place since\n2012, has served us well, we believe now is a good time to step back and assess whether,\nand in what possible ways, we can refine our strategy, tools, and communication\npractices to achieve and maintain our goals as consistently and robustly as possible in the\n14 For assessments of the risks that U.S. monetary policy will be constrained by the ELB and its\nimplications for economic activity and inflation, see Kiley and Roberts (2017), Erceg and others (2018),\nSwanson (2018), and Chung and others (2019).\n\n- 12 -\nworld we live in today.15 As I have noted before, the review of our current framework is\nwide ranging, and we are not prejudging where it will take us, but events of the past\ndecade highlight three broad questions that we will seek to answer with our review.\nThe first question is, “Can the Federal Reserve best meet its statutory objectives\nwith its existing monetary policy strategy, or should it consider strategies that aim to\nreverse past misses of the inflation objective?” Central banks are generally believed to\nhave effective tools for preventing persistent inflation overshoots. But persistent inflation\nshortfalls, such as those associated with the ELB, carry the risk that longer-term inflation\nexpectations become anchored below the stated inflation goal.16 At our September\nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, we discussed options for mitigating\nELB risks, including “makeup” strategies in which policymakers would promise to make\nup for past inflation shortfalls with a sustained accommodative stance of policy intended\nto generate higher future inflation.17 Such strategies provide accommodation at the ELB\nby keeping the policy rate low for an extended period. Makeup strategies may also help\nanchor inflation expectations more firmly at 2 percent than would a policy strategy that\ndoes not compensate for past inflation misses. But the benefits of makeup strategies\ndepend importantly on the private sector’s understanding of them as well as the belief\nthat future policymakers will follow through on promises to keep policy accommodative.\nAn advantage of our current framework over makeup approaches is that it has provided\nthe Committee with the flexibility to assess a broad range of factors and information in\n15 Fuhrer and others (2018) explore the desirability of comprehensive reviews of the monetary policy\nframework. They argue that such reviews may help the Fed more effectively identify and implement\nneeded changes to its framework.\n16 These risks could be exacerbated if households and businesses expect monetary policy to be\ninsufficiently accommodative because of proximity to the ELB. For related discussions, see Reifschneider\nand Williams (2000); Adam and Billi (2007); Nakov (2008); and Hills, Nakata, and Schmidt (2016).\n17 See Board of Governors (2019b).\n\n- 13 -\nchoosing its policy actions, and these actions can vary depending on economic\ncircumstances in order to best achieve our dual-mandate goals.\nWe are also considering whether our existing monetary policy tools are adequate\nto achieve and maintain maximum employment and price stability, or whether our toolkit\nshould be expanded and, if so, how. Because the U.S. economy required additional\nsupport after the ELB was reached in 2008, the FOMC deployed two additional tools\nbeyond changes to the target for the federal funds rate: balance sheet policies and\nforward guidance about the likely path of the federal funds rate.18 The review is\nexamining the efficacy of these existing tools, as well as additional tools for easing policy\nwhen the ELB is binding, in light of the more recent experiences of other economies.\nFinally, we are focusing on how the FOMC can improve the communication of its\npolicy framework and actions. Our communication practices have evolved considerably\nsince 1994, when the Federal Reserve released the first statement after an FOMC\nmeeting.19 As part of the review, we are assessing the Committee’s current and past\ncommunications and additional forms of communication that could be helpful.\n18 As an illustration of the shortfall in policy support created by a binding ELB during the Global Financial\nCrisis, the simple policy rules considered in a January 2017 speech by then-Chair Janet Yellen prescribed\nsetting the federal funds rate between negative 1-1/2 and negative 9 percent; see Yellen (2017). In addition\nto using these two additional monetary policy tools, the Federal Reserve implemented a number of other\nmeasures to stabilize the financial system, increase household and business confidence, and more generally\nsupport the economic recovery. These supplementary measures included the setting up of several credit\nfacilities and the introduction of stress tests for systemically important financial institutions.\n19 Over the past decade or so, the FOMC has enhanced its communication both to promote public\nunderstanding of its policy goals, strategy, and actions and to foster democratic accountability. These\nenhancements include the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy; post-meeting\npress conferences; various statements about the principles and strategy guiding the Committee’s\nnormalization of monetary policy; and quarterly summaries of individual FOMC participants’ economic\nprojections, assessments about the appropriate path of the federal funds rate, and judgments of the\nuncertainty and balance of risks around their projections. Starting in 1979, the Federal Reserve published a\nsummary of individual economic projections from various Board members, FOMC members, or FOMC\nparticipants in the semiannual Monetary Policy Report. With the introduction of the Summary of\nEconomic Projections (SEP) in 2007, the FOMC increased the frequency of the releases of policymaker\n\n- 14 -\nIn terms of process, we have heard from a broad range of interested individuals\nand groups in 14 Fed Listens events this year. At our July 2019 FOMC meeting, the\nCommittee began to assess what we have learned from these events and to receive\nbriefings from System staff on topics relevant to the review.20 But we still have much to\ndiscuss at upcoming meetings. We will share our findings with the public when we have\ncompleted our review, likely during the first half of 2020.\nConcluding Remarks\nThe economy is constantly evolving, bringing with it new opportunities and\nchallenges. One of these challenges is how best to conduct monetary policy in the new\nworld of low equilibrium interest rates. It makes sense for us to remain open minded as\nwe assess current practices and consider ideas that could potentially enhance our ability\nto deliver on the goals the Congress has assigned us. For this reason, my colleagues and I\ndo not want to preempt or to predict our ultimate findings. What I can say is that any\nrefinements or more material changes to our framework that we might make will be\naimed solely at enhancing our ability to achieve and sustain our dual-mandate objectives\nin the world we live in today.\nStepping back, earlier today, speakers at this conference discussed the challenges\nof making monetary policy in an uncertain and risky environment. In my remarks, I have\nlaid out an important example of the interaction of the macroeconomy, monetary policy,\nand the market response to risk. The papers you are about to discuss throughout the next\nprojections, expanded the set of economic variables included, and extended the forecast horizon. Because\nthe SEP includes individual contributions of projections and assessments from all FOMC participants, it\ncaptures a broader range of views than those of FOMC members.

Clarida\nVice Chairman\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nPeterson Institute for International Economics\nWashington, D.C.\nOctober 25, 2018\n\nI see some familiar faces in the audience, and I am delighted to be at Peterson\ntoday to offer my first public remarks since being sworn in last month as Vice Chairman\nof the Federal Reserve Board. As some of you know, I have been a student of U.S.\nmonetary policy for more than 30 years. So, for me, personally, it is a distinct honor and\nreal privilege to have the opportunity to serve with my colleagues on the Board of\nGovernors and, along with the 12 Reserve Bank presidents, on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC).\nNow, of course, I fully realize that I have participated in just one FOMC meeting\nto date, so my remarks today will not come with a patina earned from long experience as\na monetary policymaker. That said, I thought it might be of interest to share my thinking\non the current state of the U.S. economy, to explain how it informed my support for the\nFOMC’s policy decision last month, and to discuss my views on the way forward for\nU.S. monetary policy.1\nThe Economic Expansion in Year 10\nThe U.S. economic expansion, now in its 10th year, is marked by strong growth in\nthe gross domestic product (GDP) and a job market that has been surprising on the upside\nfor nearly two years. It is impossible today to know with much precision how much of\nthe pickup in growth and the decline in unemployment that we have seen over the past\ntwo years is structural and how much is cyclical. Most likely, both factors are at work.\nThat said, based on my reading of the accumulating evidence, I believe that trend growth\n1 I am grateful to Antulio Bomfim of the Federal Reserve Board staff for his assistance in preparing this\ntext. The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of other Federal Reserve Board members\nor Federal Open Market Committee participants.\n\n- 2 -\nin the economy may well be faster and the structural rate of unemployment lower than I\nwould have thought several years ago. Let me elaborate.\nFirst, let’s look at the demand side of the economy. Consider the benchmark\nrevisions to the household saving rate. Recently revised Commerce Department data\nnow show that the aggregate household saving rate is running at 6.7 percent of disposable\nincome. This revised estimate is nearly double the previous estimate. The higher level\nsuggests that, in contrast to the previous economic expansion from 2001 to 2007, when\nhouseholds were borrowing to maintain consumption while income growth slowed,\nhouseholds today, at least in the aggregate, are well positioned to maintain or even\nincrease consumption relative to gains in income. To me, at this stage in the business\ncycle, a historically high household saving rate is a tailwind for the economy, not a\nheadwind. And, of course, recent reductions in personal income tax rates are also a\ntailwind for the economy.\nProductivity and investment data provide another vantage point from which to\nassess both the demand and supply sides of the current expansion. Over the past few\nyears, we have seen some pickup in productivity growth, albeit from a very depressed\npace. By contrast, at a comparable stage in both the 2001-07 and 1982-90 economic\nexpansions, productivity growth (as measured by an eight-quarter moving average) was\nactually slowing relative to its contemporaneous peak-to-present pace.\nI should also note that this recent pickup in productivity has coincided with a\nrebound in business investment, and that this increase in capital spending has been\nevident in both the equipment and intellectual property categories; it is not just an “oil\npatch” story. Business investment is being supported by recent changes in the tax code\n\n- 3 -\nthat lower the cost of capital as well as by continued strong profitability of U.S.\ncompanies. While capital investment is one important source of productivity growth and\nrecent data on this front are encouraging, predicting future--or even identifying\npast--inflection points in productivity growth is notoriously difficult. Although it may be\ntempting simply to extrapolate a decade of disappointing productivity data into a distant\nfuture, a pickup in trend productivity growth is a possibility that deserves close\nmonitoring.2\nLet me now turn to the job market and inflation outlook. Average monthly job\ngains continue to outpace the increase needed to provide jobs for new entrants to the\nlabor force over the longer run. At 3.7 percent in September, the unemployment rate has\nnot been this low since 1969. In addition, after remaining stubbornly sluggish throughout\nmuch of the expansion, wage growth is picking up. A sustained rise in inflation-adjusted,\nor “real,” wages at or above the pace of productivity growth is typical in an economy\noperating in the vicinity of full employment, and we are starting to see some evidence of\nthis. I certainly hope it continues. Now, some might see a rise in wages as leading to\nupside inflationary pressures, but here, again, the experience of earlier cycles is\ninstructive. In the past two U.S. expansions, gains in real wages in excess of productivity\ngrowth were not accompanied by a material rise in price inflation.\nOf course, this time may be different, and as with growth, the job market could\nperform better or worse than the baseline outlook. However, for now, the increase in\nwages has been broadly consistent with the pickup in productivity growth that I have just\n2 See Erik Brynjolfsson, Daniel Rock, and Chad Syverson (forthcoming), “Artificial Intelligence and the\nModern Productivity Paradox: A Clash of Expectations and Statistics,” in Ajay K. Agrawal, Joshua Gans,\nand Avi Goldfarb, eds., The Economics of Artificial Intelligence: An Agenda (Chicago: University of\nChicago Press); an earlier version is available at www.nber.org/chapters/c14007.pdf.\n\n- 4 -\ndiscussed, and a rise in the still-low rate of labor force participation among the prime-age\npopulation provides scope for the job market to strengthen further without generating\ninflationary pressures.\nThis outlook for the labor market also reflects my view that the structural, or\nlonger-run, rate of unemployment--that is, the unemployment rate consistent with stable\ninflation over the longer run--may be somewhat lower than I would have thought several\nyears ago. What this means is that, even with today’s very low unemployment rate, the\nlabor market might not be as tight--and inflationary pressures not as strong--as I once\nwould have thought. I am certainly not alone in this thinking. Over the past several\nyears, most FOMC participants have been reducing their individual estimates of the\nlonger-run level of the unemployment rate. The median assessment of FOMC\nparticipants fell from around 5-1/2 percent five years ago to 4-1/2 percent in the\nprojections published last month. Outside estimates, such as those from the\nCongressional Budget Office and the Blue Chip Economic Indicators survey, show a\nsimilar pattern of downward revisions. This makes sense. With unemployment falling\nand wage gains thus far in line with productivity and expected inflation, the traditional\nindicators of cost-push price pressure are not flashing red right now.\nBoth total and core personal consumption expenditure inflation are now running\nclose to the FOMC’s 2 percent objective. When thinking about the inflation outlook, I\npay attention to market-based measures of inflation compensation from the TIPS\n(Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) market as well as to surveys of inflation\nexpectations. These “breakeven inflation rates” are simply the difference between yields\non traditional Treasury securities and those on TIPS with comparable maturities. While\n\n- 5 -\nthese market-based measures are not perfect and need to be adjusted for liquidity and\nterm premium factors, they can provide a useful signal about market inflation\nexpectations, which can be combined with signals from surveys of expected inflation to\nget a read on inflation expectations. Breakeven inflation rates have only recently risen to\na range that is in line--but just barely--with the expectation that inflation will remain\nclose to our 2 percent inflation goal over the medium-to-longer run. Survey-based\nmeasures of inflation expectations also appear consistent with the Fed’s inflation goal.\nIn short, the labor market today is robust, and inflation is at or close to the Fed’s\n2 percent inflation goal. Thus, the economy is as near as it has been in a decade to\nmeeting both of the Fed’s dual-mandate objectives, which suggests to me that monetary\npolicy at this stage of the economic expansion should be aimed at sustaining growth and\nemployment at levels consistent with keeping inflation at or close to the 2 percent rate\nconsistent with price stability. By contrast, until this year, the appropriate focus of policy\nhad been to return employment and inflation to levels consistent with our dual-mandate\nobjectives. With the economy now operating at or close to mandate-consistent levels for\ninflation and unemployment, the risks that monetary policy must balance are now more\nsymmetric and less skewed to the downside.\nPolicy Remains Accommodative\nI supported the FOMC’s decision last month to raise the target for the federal\nfunds rate to a range of 2 to 2-1/4 percent. With the economy growing briskly, the labor\nmarket operating in the vicinity of full employment, and inflation running close to\n2 percent, I saw our decision as another step in removing the extraordinary degree of\naccommodation put in place in the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis. However,\n\n- 6 -\neven after our September decision, I believe U.S. monetary policy remains\naccommodative. The funds rate is just now--for the first time in a decade--above the\nFed’s inflation objective, but the inflation-adjusted real funds rate remains below the\nrange of estimates for the longer-run neutral real rate, often referred to as r*, computed\nfrom the projections submitted by Board members and the Reserve Bank presidents.\nThis longer-run r*, like the natural rate of unemployment, is both unobserved and\ntime varying--and thus must be inferred as a signal extracted from noisy macro and\nfinancial data. That said, and notwithstanding the imprecision with which r* is estimated,\nit remains to me a relevant consideration as I assess the current stance and best path\nforward for policy. The reason for this is because, as Milton Friedman argued in his\nclassic American Economic Association presidential address, a central bank that seeks to\nconsistently keep real interest rates below r* will eventually face rising inflation and\ninflation expectations, while a central bank that seeks to keep real interest rates above r*\nwill eventually face falling inflation and inflation expectations.3 My own and others’\nresearch suggests that the failure of the Fed to respect this principle contributed to the\nGreat Inflation of the 1970s, while the incorporation of this principle into Fed policy in\nthe 1990s and 2000s contributed to the achievement of stable and low inflation during\nand since those years.4 So, even though estimates of r* are imprecise, I do not believe\n3 Milton Friedman (1968), “The Role of Monetary Policy,” American Economic Review, vol. 58 (March),\npp. 1-17.\n4 Richard Clarida, Jordi Galí, and Mark Gertler (2000), “Monetary Policy Rules and Macroeconomic\nStability: Evidence and Some Theory,” Quarterly Journal of Economics, vol. 115 (February), pp. 147-80;\nRichard Clarida (2015), “The Fed Is Ready to Raise Rates: Will Past Be Prologue?” International\nFinance, vol. 18 (Spring), pp. 93-107, https://doi.org/10.1111/1468-2362.12059; Timothy Cogley and\nThomas J. Sargent (2002), “Evolving Post-World War II U.S. Inflation Dynamics,” in Ben S. Bernanke and\nKenneth Rogoff, eds., NBER Macroeconomics Annual 2001, vol. 16 (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press),\npp. 331-87, https://www.nber.org/chapters/c11068.pdf; and Michael Woodford (2003), Interest and Prices:\nFoundations of a Theory of Monetary Policy (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press).\n\n- 7 -\nthey should be ignored. Instead, when thinking about monetary policy, I believe it is best\nnot to ignore entirely an admittedly imprecise estimate of r* today, but instead to update\nthat estimate as new data on inflation, inflation expectations, employment, growth, and\nproductivity arrive.\nMoreover, because monetary policy operates with a lag, and with inflation\npresently close to the 2 percent goal, it will be especially important to monitor inflation\nexpectations closely--using both surveys and financial market data--to best calibrate the\npace and destination for policy normalization. It will also be important to monitor both\nmodel-based and financial-market-based estimates of expected future inflation-indexed\nreal interest rates (for example, 5-year real rates 5 years forward)--suitably adjusted for\nterm premium and liquidity effects--as one indicator of longer-run r*. Before the\nfinancial crisis, these 5-year real rates 5 years forward averaged around 2 percent after a\nterm premium and liquidity adjustment. Since 2015, they have averaged about 0.50\npercent but recently have approached 0.75 percent, also after a term and liquidity\npremium adjustment. Given that real interest rates and economic growth tend to move\ntogether over the longer run, one possible source of these upward revisions in forward\nreal rates could be that financial market participants may have become more optimistic\nabout the growth potential of our economy. Evidence also suggests that the term\npremium that investors require to hold longer-maturity bonds has risen as well.\nThe Way Forward\nIf the data come in as I expect, I believe that some further gradual adjustment in\nthe federal funds rate will be appropriate. As I mentioned earlier, I believe monetary\npolicy today remains accommodative, and that, with the economy now operating at or\n\n- 8 -\nclose to mandate-consistent levels for inflation and unemployment, the risks that\nmonetary policy must balance are now more symmetric and less skewed to the downside.\nRaising rates too quickly could unnecessarily shorten the economic expansion while\nmoving too slowly could result in rising inflation and inflation expectations down the\nroad that could be costly to reverse.\nAs I calibrate, in the months ahead, the pace and ultimate destination for\nmonetary policy adjustments that will best allow the Fed to achieve its dual-mandate\nobjectives, it will be important to me to evaluate a wide range of economic and financial\nmarket indicators to complement the predictions yielded by model-based scenarios. As I\nlook ahead, if strong growth and robust employment gains were to continue into 2019\nand be accompanied by a material rise in actual and expected inflation, that circumstance\nwould indicate to me that additional policy normalization might well be required beyond\nwhat I currently expect. By contrast, if strong growth and employment gains were to\ncontinue and be accompanied by stable inflation, inflation expectations, and expectations\nfor Fed policy, that situation, to me, would argue against raising short-term interest rates\nby more than I currently expect.\nConclusion\nIn closing, with the economy operating as close as it has in a decade to the\nFederal Reserve’s dual-mandate objectives of price stability and maximum employment,\nI believe monetary policy at this stage of the economic expansion should be aimed at\nsustaining growth and maximum employment at levels consistent with keeping inflation\nat or close to the 2 percent objective. Even after our most recent policy decision to raise\nthe range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point, monetary policy remains\n\n- 9 -\naccommodative, and I believe some further gradual adjustment in the policy rate range\nwill likely be appropriate. That said, at this stage in the business cycle, I believe it will\nbe especially important to monitor a wide range of data to continually assess and calibrate\nthe level of the policy rate that is consistent with meeting our objectives on a sustained\nbasis.",

Clarida\nVice Chair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nCleveland, Ohio\nNovember 30, 2021\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the mitigation efforts put in place to contain it\ndelivered the most severe blow to the U.S. and global economies since the Great\nDepression.1 Gross domestic product (GDP) collapsed at a nearly 33 percent annual rate\nin the second quarter of 2020. More than 22 million jobs were lost in just the first two\nmonths of the crisis, and the unemployment rate rose from a 50-year low of 3.5 percent in\nFebruary to a postwar peak of almost 15 percent in April 2020. A precipitous decline in\naggregate demand pummeled the consumer price level. The resulting disruptions to\neconomic activity significantly tightened financial conditions and impaired the flow of\ncredit to U.S. households and businesses.\nThe fiscal and monetary policy response in the United States to the COVID crisis\nwas unprecedented in its scale, scope, and speed. Legislation passed by the Congress in\nMarch 2020, December 2020, and March 2021 provided a total of nearly $5.8 trillion in\nfiscal support to the U.S. economy—about 28 percent of U.S. GDP.2\nThe Federal Reserve acted decisively and with dispatch to deploy each and every\ntool in its conventional kit and to design, develop, and launch within weeks a series of\ninnovative facilities to support the flow of credit to households and business. The\nfacilities the Federal Reserve either relaunched or designed and developed anew in\nresponse to the COVID crisis were established under the authority of section 13(3) of the\n1 The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of other Federal Reserve Board members or\nFederal Open Market Committee participants. I would like to thank Mark Carlson, Burcu Duygan-Bump,\nEdward Nelson, Chiara Scotti, and Mark Van Der Weide for assistance in preparing these remarks.\n2 This total includes the roughly $3 trillion from the spring 2020 bills—the Coronavirus Preparedness and\nResponse Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2020; the Families First Coronavirus Response Act; the\nCoronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act; and the Paycheck Protection Program and\nHealth Care Enhancement Act—inclusive of the roughly $0.45 trillion in capitalization for the Fed lending\nfacilities in the CARES Act; $0.9 trillion in the stimulus divisions of the Consolidated Appropriations Act,\n2021, passed in late December 2020; and $1.9 trillion in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, passed in\nMarch 2021.\n\n- 2 -\nFederal Reserve Act; under section 13(3), these facilities can be established only in\n“unusual and exigent circumstances” and with approval of the Treasury Secretary.3\nThe Global Pandemic Collapse (GPC) in the spring of 2020 was the second\noccasion in the past dozen years in which the Federal Reserve invoked its emergency\nlending powers to help forestall severe financial market disruptions—the first occasion\nbeing the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2008–09. In my remarks today, I would like\nto reflect on the Federal Reserve’s response to the GPC in the context of our institution’s\nhistory and structure and to highlight not only the privileges that flow from, but also the\nresponsibilities that are required to respect, our institutional independence.\nOrigins of the Federal Reserve\nLet’s begin with some history. At the urging of Treasury Secretary Alexander\nHamilton, the First Congress of the United States established the First Bank of the United\nStates in 1791. Like similar institutions in other countries—most notably, the Bank of\nEngland—the First Bank of the United States was owned by the private sector, was\npublicly chartered, and carried out some of the operations that would be thought of today\nas those of a central bank.4 That First Bank played a key role in executing Hamilton’s\nvision to put the young federal government’s finances on a sound footing, to promote the\nstabilization of the purchasing power of the U.S. dollar, and to support economic growth.\nNevertheless, that First Bank became embroiled in politics, and the Congress failed to\nrenew its 20-year charter in 1811. In 1816, the Congress did charter a Second Bank of\n3 Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 343(3)) is available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/section13.htm (quoted text in paragraph A).\n4 Goodhart (1988) provides a comparison of the First Bank of the United States with those of other central\nbanks in the same era. Krooss (1960, p. 4) and Cowen (2000) describe the role the bank played in the U.S.\neconomy and financial system.\n\n- 3 -\nthe United States, which was designed along similar lines to its predecessor. But it, too,\ngenerated political controversy—Andrew Jackson was not a fan and was not shy in\nsaying so—and its 20-year charter expired without renewal in 1836.\nFor the next 77 years, the United States operated without a central bank. There\nwas significant financial-sector development during this time, with commercial banks,\nequity markets, and corporate bond markets all playing a growing role in financial\nintermediation in the U.S. economy. This period also witnessed several major financial\npanics that substantially disrupted economic activity.5 One of those panics—the Panic of\n1907—galvanized the Congress to establish a new central bank. The Federal Reserve\nwas charted by the Congress in 1913 and directed specifically to promote the stability of\nthe financial system. An important goal of the Federal Reserve in those early years was\nto smooth the large seasonal swings in interest rates and credit conditions associated with\nthe harvest season that, in the past, had contributed to financial panics. The principal tool\nprovided in the Federal Reserve Act to accomplish this goal was the ability of the Federal\nReserve to lend funds to commercial banks against sound collateral through its “discount\nwindow.” 6\nThrough the compromises and choices made in designing the Federal Reserve\nsystem, the Congress created an institution that received broader and more durable\npolitical support than had been the case for the First and Second Banks of the United\nStates. At the center of the Federal Reserve System was the Federal Reserve Board,\n5 For a chronology of major and nonmajor banking panics in this period, see Jalil (2015). James,\nMcAndrews, and Weiman (2013) discuss how suspensions of the payment system resulting from banking\npanics disrupted economic activity.\n6 As discussed in Hamlin (1914), by providing a reliable liquidity backstop to the commercial banking\nsystem, the discount window was critical to ensuring confidence and the Federal Reserve was able to help\nprevent panic dynamics from being set in motion.\n\n- 4 -\nwhich was composed of public officials nominated by the President and confirmed by the\nSenate. In this initial incarnation, the Board included the Secretary of the Treasury as an\nex officio member. The Federal Reserve System also included 12 Reserve Banks—\ndistributed across a dozen geographic Districts—which were designed to be responsive to\nand report on regional economic conditions.\nAlthough the Congress assigned the Federal Reserve a statutory set of goals and\ntools, policymakers from the very first days had substantial independence in how they\nused those tools to pursue the assigned goals. For example, the interest rate charged on\ndiscount window loans—rates that had an important bearing on overall financial\nconditions in the country—was set by Federal Reserve policymakers, with little\ninterference from the Congress or the executive branch. The same was true of Federal\nReserve purchases or sales of Treasury securities. These open market transactions were\nfound, over time, to be another effective tool with which to influence overall financial\nconditions.\nThe Great Depression and Changes to the Structure of the Federal Reserve\nIn response to the Great Depression and reflecting a growing recognition that the\nFederal Reserve’s original institutional design was in need of improvement, the Congress\nrestructured the Federal Reserve System in the 1930s.7 Greater authority over policy\ndecisions was placed with the Board—whose members, given their presidential\nnomination and Senate confirmation, were thought to be more clearly accountable to the\nnation as a whole. At the same time, the Congress gave the Board increased\n7 The most substantial change to the structure of the Federal Reserve System occurred with the Banking\nAct of 1935. As part of this restructuring, the Federal Reserve Board was renamed the Board of Governors\nof the Federal Reserve System.\n\n- 5 -\nindependence from the executive branch by removing the Secretary of the Treasury’s\nstatus as an ex officio member. Decisions regarding open market purchases of U.S.\ngovernment securities, which were becoming the most important monetary policy tool of\nthe Federal Reserve, were assigned to the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC),\nwhich consists of the members of the Board of Governors and a rotating subset of the\nReserve Bank presidents. In the FOMC structure set up in the mid-1930s and remaining\nin force today, only five Reserve Bank presidents are voting members of the FOMC at\nany one time, leaving the seven Board Governors typically in a majority position. This\narrangement has served the Federal Reserve well during the past 85 years, as it promotes\na diversity of views and a healthy debate regarding the policy options available. It is also\nworth noting a distinction that bears on decisionmaking powers regarding monetary\npolicy and lending policy. In contrast to monetary policy, the power to make decisions\nabout the structure of Federal Reserve lending programs, including the authority to\nlaunch emergency programs, resides solely with the Board.8\nSubsequent decades saw further changes to the governance of monetary policy. A\nnotable development occurred in 1951, when the Federal Reserve obtained its current\nlevel of independence from the Treasury Department on monetary policy, as codified in\nthe Treasury–Federal Reserve Accord. Another milestone occurred with the Federal\nReserve Reform Act of 1977, which assigned the Federal Reserve its current statutory\nmandate to achieve price stability and maximum employment.9 Monetary policy had, in\n8 The Federal Reserve Board was given authority to establish lending programs for the nonbanking\nsector—including households and nonfinancial businesses—in unusual and exigent circumstances, such as\na financial crisis.\n9 See, for example, Judd and Rudebusch (1999) and Lindsey (2003). The Federal Reserve also had\nresponsibility to seek maximum employment through the Employment Act of 1946, which also directed\n\n- 6 -\neffect, pursued these goals since the accord, and the Federal Reserve’s maximum-\nemployment and price-stability goals had been embedded in previous acts of the\nCongress. But the statutory formalization of this “dual mandate” was important in\nspecifying congressional intent and defining the Fed’s goals.\nIn the decades after the Great Depression, while systemic financial disruptions in\nthe United States were not unknown—the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980s and the\nsavings and loan crisis of the 1990s were certainly major events—systemic liquidity\ncrises were relatively uncommon. And the Federal Reserve was able to address the\ndisturbances that did occur using its traditional tools of providing discount window loans\nto banks, a tool that had been in its toolkit since 1913.\nThe Global Financial Crisis\nThis half-century of relative financial stability in the United States was shattered\nin 2008 by the GFC, a crisis that disrupted financial markets and impaired financial\nintermediation around the world. In the United States, many of the most severe\ndisruptions occurred in wholesale funding markets and involved nonbank financial\nfirms—such as broker-dealers, money market funds, nonbank mortgage lenders, and\nnonbank finance companies. These nonbank financial institutions, which had become a\nmajor source of financial intermediation in the United States in the decades leading up to\nthe GFC, were typically lightly regulated, highly leveraged, and overly reliant on\nunstable sources of short-term funding. And because they were not banks, the Federal\npolicymakers toward seeking maximum purchasing power. The 1977 legislation was, however, the first\npermanent law specifically pertaining to the Federal Reserve that explicitly assigned it the dual mandate.\nPreviously, in early 1975, the Congress had directed the Federal Reserve to pursue “the goals of maximum\nemployment [and] stable prices” in House Concurrent Resolution 133 (March 24, 1975), which was in\nforce over the 1975−77 Congress alone. See Senate (1975, p. 3). The legislated wording of the dual\nmandate in 1977 was closely based on the wording of this resolution.\n\n- 7 -\nReserve would have faced enormous challenges stemming the crisis solely by use of\ntraditional discount window lending to depository institutions.\nFunding markets during the GFC faced enormous stress. A number of major\nfinancial firms failed, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were forced into conservatorship, and\nthe flow of credit to businesses and households was severely impaired. The Federal\nReserve responded by using not only its traditional authority to lend to banks, but also,\nfor the first time, its authority to lend to nonbank institutions under section 13(3) of the\nFederal Reserve Act in unusual and exigent circumstances. The GFC emergency lending\nfacilities that were stood up under this authority were designed to support short-term\nfunding markets and to provide loans to nonbank financial firms, which in turn could\nthen continue to intermediate credit to the private sector.10 The Federal Reserve also\nmade section 13(3) loans to individual distressed nonbank firms, like Bear Stearns and\nthe American International Group, Inc., or AIG.\nThe Federal Reserve’s emergency lending programs established during the GFC\nstabilized the financial system and helped prevent another great Depression. Consistent\nwith the central bank’s statutory authority, the facilities were designed to minimize the\nFederal Reserve’s exposure to credit risk, and all of the facilities were wound down over\ntime without any loss to taxpayers.\nIn the wake of the GFC, the Congress made several changes to the Federal\nReserve’s emergency lending authority. First, the Federal Reserve would be required to\n10 Emergency lending facilities targeting short-term U.S. credit markets included the Primary Dealer Credit\nFacility, the Term Securities Lending Facility, the Commercial Paper Funding Facility, and the Asset-\nBacked Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility. The disruptions that occurred in\nthese markets and the role these facilities played in addressing those disruptions are described, among other\nplaces, in Kacperczyk and Schnabl (2010); Covitz, Liang, and Suarez (2013); Duygan-Bump and others\n(2013); Acharya and others (2017); and Carlson and Macchiavelli (2020).\n\n- 8 -\nprovide loans to nonbanks only through broad-based facilities: Bilateral loans to\nindividual nonbank firms were no longer permissible. Second, all emergency lending\nprograms would now require approval by the Secretary of the Treasury. Third, the\nFederal Reserve going forward would be required to provide enhanced and timely\ntransparency with regard to any emergency lending facilities set up under section 13(3).\nIn addition to these changes to the Federal Reserve’s authority, the GFC also spurred\nwide-ranging financial regulatory reforms—in particular, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street\nReform and Consumer Protection Act—meant to improve the stability of the financial\nsystem.\nThe Federal Reserve’s experience in the GFC reinforced a set of important\nprinciples guiding how it would respond to a future systemic financial crisis:\n• Act rapidly and decisively.\n• Act on a large scale with a variety of tools.\n• Be mindful that announcement effects can be vital for promoting confidence.\n• Design and price facilities as backstops to smooth a return to private-sector\nfinancial intermediation as quickly as possible.\nResponse to the Global Pandemic Collapse\nThe lessons learned from the Federal Reserve’s response to the GFC were\ninvaluable, as it had to assess, develop, and execute its response to the GPC in a matter of\nweeks.11 In the first two weeks of March 2020, the FOMC lowered its target range for\nthe federal funds rate by 1½ percentage points, thereby bringing the range to its effective\nlower bound of 0 to ¼ percent. The Committee also provided forward guidance on the\n11 A detailed description of the Federal Reserve’s response to the COVID crisis can be found in Clarida,\nDuygan-Bump, and Scotti (2021).\n\n- 9 -\nfederal funds rate, stating that it expected to maintain the existing target range until it was\nconfident that the economy had weathered recent events and was on track to achieve its\nmaximum-employment and price-stability goals.12 In addition, the Federal Reserve\nengaged in substantial purchases of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed\nsecurities to support market functioning and further ease financial conditions.\nReflecting the heightened uncertainty of mid-March 2020, there was a surge in\ndemand for liquidity across the global financial system. Spreads in some short-term\ncredit markets, such as that for commercial paper, surged to levels nearing those of the\n2008 financial crisis; investors ran on prime and tax-exempt money funds; and some\nfirms found it difficult to obtain the credit needed to finance critical operations. Many\nbusinesses sought to draw down on lines of credit with banks to augment the amount of\nliquidity they had readily available. To relieve these strains, the Federal Reserve\nencouraged depository institutions to turn to the discount window, lowered the rate on\ndiscount window borrowing, and made it easier for institutions to borrow from the\nFederal Reserve at longer maturities. As conditions in U.S. credit markets were severely\nstressed, the Board determined once again that circumstances were unusual and exigent\nand acted rapidly and decisively to prevent financial collapse. With approval of the\nTreasury—and, in some cases, drawing on equity capital invested by the Treasury—the\nBoard announced and stood up several section 13(3) short-term liquidity facilities similar\nto those established during the GFC.13 And because dollar funding pressures were not\nlimited to the United States, the Federal Reserve stabilized global dollar funding markets\n12 For more information, see the March 15, 2020, FOMC statement, which is available on the Board’s\nwebsite at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.\n13 In particular, these facilities were the Primary Dealer Credit Facility, the Commercial Paper Funding\nFacility, and the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility.\n\n- 10 -\nby expanding its swap line arrangements with foreign central banks and by lending\ndollars against U.S. Treasury securities to foreign central banks.\nAgainst the background of concerns about major economic disruptions stemming\nfrom the pandemic, strains also emerged in the corporate bond market, the municipal debt\nmarket, and asset-backed securities markets. Issuance of new debt in these markets\nslowed sharply, and the cost of corporate credit increased considerably. Financing\nchallenges were also faced by state and local governments as well as by small and\nmedium-sized businesses traditionally reliant on bank lending.\nIn response to the crisis, the Congress passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and\nEconomic Security Act, or CARES Act, in late March 2020. The legislation authorized\nthe Treasury to make sizable equity investments in Federal Reserve section 13(3)\nfacilities. On the basis of this legislation, the Federal Reserve established several novel\nsection 13(3) lending facilities to promote intermediation in credit markets. Among other\nmeasures, the Federal Reserve purchased corporate bonds in the secondary market under\nthe corporate credit facilities, made loans to smaller nonfinancial companies through the\nMain Street Lending Program, and made loans to state and local governments through the\nMunicipal Liquidity Facility.\nThese section 13(3) facilities promoted the flow of credit to households and\nbusinesses and helped stabilize financial and economic conditions. It is notable that they\naccomplished their goals even though credit provided by the facilities was priced in a\nmanner consistent with their status as backstops rather than as full-fledged replacements\nfor private-sector intermediation. Indeed, some facilities recorded little or no use. But\ntheir very existence as backstops appears to have contributed in substantial ways to\n\n- 11 -\ncalming markets and promoted the revival of activity in private credit markets as\nconditions normalized.\nThe public health policy response to contain the COVID-19 virus triggered an\nunprecedented disruption to the U.S. economy. The economic policy response to the\ncrisis was equally unprecedented. As I have described, because of the breadth and depth\nof the dislocations in the U.S. financial system caused by the GPC, the Federal Reserve’s\ncredit facilities had to be designed to reach counterparties well beyond those associated\nwith its traditional lending facilities. The Federal Reserve’s actions during the GPC were\ntaken to fulfill its long-standing statutory mandate to stem financial panics. The facilities\nestablished in 2020, in conjunction with the Federal Reserve’s other actions and a robust\nfiscal policy response, provided crucial support to the U.S. economy as GDP was\ncollapsing and unemployment was surging. Then, as the distress in financial markets\nabated and the economy regained its footing, the facilities were wound down and the\nemergency tools were, appropriately, put back in the toolbox with no adverse impact on\ncredit conditions. For example, the Federal Reserve completed its sales of assets from\nthe Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility on August 31. Similarly, we are\nmanaging the paydown of assets in our other CARES Act facilities as they wind down\nover time (see the Table).\nConcluding Remarks\nIn conclusion, in central banking, as in other endeavors, with privilege comes\nresponsibility. The Federal Reserve recognizes and has acted according to the principle\nthat its section 13(3) authorities are to be deployed only in unusual and exigent\ncircumstances, and, in both the GFC and GPC, it took its responsibilities seriously and\n\n- 12 -\ndid so in a timely way. Outside of such circumstances, the Federal Reserve has been\ngranted instrument independence by the Congress to set short-term interest rates and to\npurchase and sell U.S. government securities to achieve its statutorily assigned goals of\nmaximum employment and price stability. Thank you for your time and attention, and I\nlook forward to my conversation with President Mester.\n\n- 13 -\nReferences\nAcharya, Viral V., Michael J. Fleming, Warren B.

Clarida\nVice Chair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\n2021 Institute of International Finance Annual Membership Meeting:\nSustainable Economic Growth and Financial Stability in a\nDiverging, Decarbonizing, Digitizing, Indebted World\nWashington, D.C.\n(via webcast)\nOctober 12, 2021\n\nIt is my pleasure to meet virtually with you today at the 2021 Institute of\nInternational Finance Annual Membership Meeting.1 I regret that we are not meeting in\nperson, but I look forward, as always, to a conversation with my good friend and one-\ntime colleague Tim Adams. But first, please allow me to offer a few remarks on the\neconomic outlook and Federal Reserve monetary policy.\nCurrent Economic Situation and Outlook\nIndicators of economic activity and employment reveal that the economy\ncontinues to strengthen. Real gross domestic product (GDP) rose at a strong 6.4 percent\npace in the first half of the year, and growth is widely expected to continue at a robust, if\nperhaps somewhat slower, pace in the second half of the year. If so, GDP growth this\ncalendar year could be the fastest since 1983. That said, the data also indicate that a\nsurge in COVID-19 cases in the summer and supply-chain bottlenecks held back\neconomic activity in the third quarter.\nAs with overall economic activity, conditions in the labor market have continued\nto improve. Job gains as measured by the payroll survey have averaged 550,000 per\nmonth over the past three months. Labor market progress this year, as measured by the\nKansas City Fed’s Labor Market Conditions Indicators, has been notable, with this index\nof 24 labor market indicators since December 2020 closing two-thirds of its shortfall\nrelative to its pre-pandemic level.2 Nonetheless, factors related to the pandemic, such as\ncaregiving obligations and ongoing fears of the virus, continue to weigh on employment\n1 The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of other Federal Reserve Board members or\nFederal Open Market Committee participants. I would like to thank Chiara Scotti for assistance in\npreparing these remarks.\n2 The Labor Market Conditions Indicators can be found on the Kansas City Fed’s website at\nhttps://www.kansascityfed.org/data-and-trends/labor-market-conditions-indicators.\n\n- 2 -\nand participation. Thus, the course of the labor market, and indeed that of the economy,\ncontinues to depend on the course of the virus.\nSince February 2020, core PCE (personal consumption expenditures) price\ninflation is running at a 2.9 percent annual pace that is well above what I would consider\nto be a moderate overshoot of our 2 percent longer-run goal for inflation. Fully\nreopening the $20 trillion economy this year is taking longer and costing more than it did\nto shut it down last year. In particular, the reopening has been characterized by\nsignificant sectoral shifts in both aggregate demand and supply, and these shifts are\ncausing widespread bottlenecks and triggering substantial changes in the relative price\nand wage structure of the economy. A similar reopening dynamic is playing out in other\nadvanced economies, such as Canada and the United Kingdom. As these relative price\nadjustments work their way through the economy, measured inflation rises. But I\ncontinue to believe that the underlying rate inflation in the U.S. economy is hovering\nclose to our 2 percent longer-run objective and, thus, that the unwelcome surge in\ninflation this year, once these relative price adjustments are complete and bottlenecks\nhave unclogged, will in the end prove to be largely transitory. And this is a forecast that\nis shared by the vast majority of economists in the private sector, such as those surveyed\nby Bloomberg and Blue Chip. That said, I believe, as do most of my colleagues, that the\nrisks to inflation are to the upside, and I continue to be attuned and attentive to\nunderlying inflation trends, in particular measures of inflation expectations, including the\nBoard staff’s index of common inflation expectations.3 As Chair Powell has indicated, if\nwe did see indicators of inflation expectations moving up and running persistently above\n3 The Fed staff’s index of common inflation expectations—which is now updated quarterly on the Board’s\nwebsite—is a relevant indicator that this goal is being met. See Ahn and Fulton (2020, 2021).\n\n- 3 -\nlevels consistent with our price stability mandate, monetary policy would react to that.\nBut that is not the case at present.\nThe September Decision and the Forward Guidance in Our FOMC Statement\nLet me now say a few words about the decisions reached at our September FOMC\nmeeting. Since our December 2020 meeting, the Committee has indicated that it will\ncontinue to maintain the pace of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities purchases at\n$80 billion and $40 billion per month, respectively, until “substantial further progress”\nhas been made toward our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.4 At our\nSeptember meeting, the Committee continued to discuss the progress made toward these\ngoals, and I myself believe that the “substantial further progress” standard has more than\nbeen met with regard to our price-stability mandate and has all but been met with regard\nto our employment mandate. If progress continues broadly as expected, the Committee\nin September judged that a moderation in the pace of asset purchases may soon be\nwarranted. At our meeting, we also discussed the appropriate pace of tapering asset\npurchases once economic conditions satisfy the criterion laid out in the Committee’s\nguidance. While no decisions were made, participants generally view that, so long as the\nrecovery remains on track, a gradual tapering of our asset purchases that concludes\naround the middle of next year may soon be warranted.\nIt is important to note that any future decision the Committee might make with\nregard to the pace of asset purchases will not be intended to carry a signal about the\ntiming of a future decision to raise the target range for the federal funds rate, a policy\ndecision for which we have articulated a different and substantially more stringent test.\n4 FOMC statements, including those issued since the December 2020 meeting, are available on the Board’s\nwebsite at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.\n\n- 4 -\nAs we reaffirmed in September, we continue to expect that it will be appropriate to\nmaintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor\nmarket conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessment of\nmaximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately\nexceed 2 percent for some time. At least half of the 18 FOMC participants in their\nSummary of Economic Projections (SEP) submissions projected that these necessary\nthreshold conditions for liftoff will be met by December 2022, and all participants but 1\nproject that these conditions will be met by December 2023.5 These projections are\nentirely consistent with the new monetary policy framework adopted unanimously by the\nCommittee in August 2020.6 In the context of our new framework, as I have noted\nbefore, while the effective lower bound (ELB) can be a constraint on monetary policy,\nthe ELB is not a constraint on fiscal policy, and appropriate monetary policy under our\nnew framework, to me, must—and certainly can—incorporate this reality. Indeed, under\npresent circumstances, I judge that the support to aggregate demand from fiscal policy—\nincluding the nearly $2 trillion in accumulated excess savings accruing from (as yet)\nunspent transfer payments—in tandem with appropriate monetary policy, can fully offset\nthe constraint, highlighted in our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy\nStrategy, that the ELB imposes on the ability of an inflation-targeting monetary policy,\nacting on its own and in the absence of sufficient fiscal support, to restore, following a\n5 The most recent SEP, released following the conclusion of the September 2021 FOMC meeting, is\navailable on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.\n6 The revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, unanimously approved on\nAugust 27, 2020, is available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review-of-monetary-policy-strategy-tools-and-\ncommunications-statement-on-longer-run-goals-monetary-policy-strategy.htm.

Clarida\nVice Chair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\n2020 U.S. Monetary Policy Forum, sponsored by\nthe Initiative on Global Markets at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business\nNew York, New York\nFebruary 21, 2020\n\nThank you to the conference organizers for inviting me here to discuss what\nformer Chair Bernanke has famously referred to as a “hall of mirrors” problem: a\nsituation in which a central bank’s reaction function and financial market prices interact\nin economically suboptimal and potentially destabilizing ways.1 In my remarks today, I\nwill lay out the way I think about the interplay between financial markets and monetary\npolicy, with a focus on how I myself seek to integrate noisy but often correlated signals\nabout the economy that I glean from models, surveys, and financial markets.2\nThree Observations\nI begin with three unobjectionable observations. First, because of Friedman’s\nlong and variable lags, monetary policy should be—and, at the Fed, is—forward looking.\nPolicy decisions made today will have no effect on today’s inflation or unemployment\nrates, so good policy needs to assess where the economic fundamentals are going\ntomorrow to calibrate appropriate policy today. Of course, financial markets are also\nforward looking. An asset’s value today depends upon its expected future cash flows\ndiscounted by a rate that reflects the expected path of the policy rate plus an appropriate\nrisk premium. Thus, central banks and financial markets are looking at the same data on\nmacro fundamentals to make inferences about the future path of the economy, and, of\ncourse, any decisions on the policy path made by the central bank will influence asset\nprices through the discount factor. So optimal monetary policy will (almost) always be\n1 See Ben S. Bernanke (2004), “What Policymakers Can Learn from Asset Prices,” speech delivered at the\nInvestment Analysts Society of Chicago, Chicago, April 15,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2004/20040415/default.htm.\n2 The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of other Federal Reserve Board members or\nFederal Open Market Committee participants. I thank Dan Covitz and Eric Engstrom for their assistance in\npreparing these remarks.\n\n- 2 -\ncorrelated with asset prices. Correlation is not evidence of causation, and the hall of\nmirrors problem at its essence is about inferring causation from correlation.\nSecond, because key variables that are crucial inputs for conducting monetary\npolicy—such as r*, u*, and expected inflation, to name just three—are both unobserved\nand time varying, responsible monetary policy requires informed views about how these\nvariables evolve over time as well as a humility and an appreciation for the uncertainties\nsurrounding baseline views, however well informed they might be.\nThird, when trying to make an inference about unobserved variables like r* or\nexpected inflation, it is generally a good idea to seek data from multiple signals\ncorrelated with the variable of interest, so long as the signals themselves are not perfectly\ncorrelated with one another. Think of this third unobjectionable observation as a sort of\n“model averaging” or “triangulation” principle of robust inference in a noisy and\ncomplex environment.3\nData Dependence\nAs I have written before, monetary policy needs to be—and, at the Fed, is— “data\ndependent” in two distinct ways.4 Policy should be data dependent in the sense that\nincoming data indicate the position of the economy relative to the ultimate objectives of\nprice stability and maximum employment. This information on where the economy is\nrelative to the goals of monetary policy is an important input into standard interest rate\n3 See Bruce Hansen (2007), “Least Squares Model Averaging,” Econometrica, vol. 75 (July), pp. 1175–89.\nOn triangulation, see Robert Bogdan and Sari Knopp Biklen (2006), Qualitative Research in Education:\nAn Introduction to Theory and Methods, 5th ed. (Boston: Pearson Allyn & Bacon).\n4 See Richard H. Clarida (2018), “Data Dependence and U.S. Monetary Policy,” speech delivered at the\nClearing House and the Bank Policy Institute Annual Conference, New York, November 27,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/clarida20181127a.htm.\n\n- 3 -\nfeedback rules, such as those introduced by John Taylor in 1993 and ones that continue\ntoday to inform monetary policy decisions at the Fed and at other central banks.5\nMonetary policy, however, also needs to be data dependent in the second sense—\nthat incoming data contain signals—that can enable the central bank to update its\nestimates of r* and u* in order to obtain its best estimate of the destination to which the\neconomy is heading. As I mentioned a moment ago, a challenge for policymakers is that\nkey variables that are essential inputs to monetary policy—such as u*, r*, and expected\ninflation—cannot be observed directly and must be inferred from observed data. And as\nis indicated in the Summary of Economic Projections, Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC) participants have, over the past seven years, repeatedly revised down their\nestimates of both u* and r* as unemployment fell and as real interest rates remained well\nbelow previous estimates of neutral without the rise in inflation those earlier estimates\nwould have predicted. I would argue that these revisions to u* and r* indicate that the\nFOMC has been data dependent in this second sense and that these updated assessments\nof u* and r* have had an important influence on the path for the policy rate actually\nimplemented in recent years. Indeed, had the Fed not been data dependent in this second\nsense and remained closed to the possibility that the economy had changed and historical\nestimates of r* and u* needed to be revised, that stubbornness would have represented a\nmaterial policy mistake.\nIn addition to u* and r*, an important input into any monetary policy assessment\nis the state of inflation expectations. One of the robust messages from the DSGE\n(dynamic stochastic general equilibrium) literature on optimal monetary policy is that,\n5 See John B. Taylor (1993), “Discretion versus Policy Rules in Practice,” Carnegie-Rochester Conference\nSeries on Public Policy, vol. 39 (December), pp. 195–214.\n\n- 4 -\naway from the effective lower bound, optimal monetary policy will not eliminate all\ninflation volatility—there are always shocks—but will, under rational expectations (RE),\ndeliver average, and under RE, expected, inflation equal to the target. Since the late\n1990s, inflation expectations appear to have been stable and well anchored in the\nneighborhood of our 2 percent goal. However, like r* and u*, inflation expectations are\nnot directly observable and so must be inferred from data. But which data?\nFinancial Data and Monetary Policy\nLet me now discuss in more detail how I use a form of model averaging to\ncombine financial market data with data from surveys and econometric models to inform\nmy thinking about the evolution of two key inputs to monetary policy: r* and long-run\nexpected inflation. To be sure, financial market signals are noisy, and day-to-day\nmovements in asset prices are unlikely to tell us much about the cyclical or structural\nposition of the economy, let alone r* and expected inflation. However, persistent shifts\nin financial market conditions can be informative. Signals derived from financial market\ndata, when combined with signals revealed from surveys of households and firms along\nwith the filtered estimates from econometric models, can together provide valuable and\nreasonably robust foundations for real-time inference about the direction of travel in r*\nand expected inflation.\nFor example, a “straight read” of interest rate futures prices provides one source\nof high-frequency information about the destination for the federal funds rate expected by\nmarket participants. The destination for the federal funds rate implied by a straight read\nof futures prices is in turn the sum of the market-implied r* plus market-implied expected\ninflation. But these signals from interest rate futures are only a pure measure of the\n\n- 5 -\nexpected policy rate path under the assumption of a zero risk premium. For this reason, it\nis useful to compare policy rate paths derived from market prices with the path obtained\nfrom surveys of market participants, which, while subject to measurement error, should\nnot be contaminated with a term premium. Market- and survey-based estimates of the\npolicy rate path are often highly correlated. But when there is a divergence between the\npath or destination for the policy rate implied by the surveys and a straight read of\ninterest rate derivatives prices, I place at least as much weight on the survey evidence—\nfor example, derived from the surveys of primary dealers and market participants\nconducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York—as I do on the estimates obtained\nfrom market prices. Finally, as another reality check, I, of course, always consult the\nlatest estimate of r* produced by the Laubach and Williams (2003) unobservable\ncomponents state-space model, which, I should point out, includes no information on\nasset prices other than the short-term nominal interest rate itself.6\nQuotes from the Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) market can\nprovide valuable information about both r* and expected inflation. TIPS market data,\ntogether with nominal Treasury yields, can be used to construct measures of “breakeven\ninflation” or inflation compensation that provide a noisy signal of market expectations of\nfuture inflation. But, again, a straight read of breakeven inflation based on TIPS curve\nforward real rates needs to be augmented with a model to filter out the liquidity and risk\npremium components that place a wedge between inflation compensation and expected\ninflation.\n6 See Thomas Laubach and John Williams (2003), “Measuring the Natural Rate of Interest,” Review of\nEconomics and Statistics, vol. 85 (November), pp. 1063–70.\n\n- 6 -\nIt is again useful to compare estimates of expected inflation derived from\nbreakeven inflation data with estimates of expected inflation obtained from surveys—for\nexample, the expected inflation over the next 5 to 10 years from the University of\nMichigan Surveys of Consumers. Market- and survey-based estimates of expected\ninflation are correlated, but, again, when there is a divergence between the two, I place at\nleast as much weight on the survey evidence as on the market-derived estimates. Again,\nhere I also consult time-series models of underlying inflation, such as Stock and Watson\n(2007) and Cecchetti and others (2017), presented at the U.S. Monetary Policy Forum in\n2017.7 At the Fed, the staff have estimated a state-space model decomposition of the\ncommon factor that drives a number of different measures of inflation expectations.\nState-space econometrics is one formal way to do model averaging. As I look at all of\nthis evidence from market signals, surveys, and econometric models, I judge that\ninflation expectations reside at the low end of the range I consider consistent with our\nprice-stability goal of 2 percent personal consumption expenditure inflation in the long\nrun.\nIn both of the examples I have just discussed, the medium-frequency evolution of\nmarket-based, survey-based, and model-based estimates of r* and expected inflation\nhave, over time, tended to move broadly together. When high-frequency market signals\ndiverge from the survey- and model-based estimates, the potential benefit from increasing\nthe weight on a signal derived from a forward-looking asset price versus backward\n7 See James H. Stock and and Mark W. Watson (2007), “Why Has U.S. Inflation Become Harder to\nForecast?” Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, vol. 39 (s1, February), pp. 3–33; and\nStephen G. Cecchetti, Michael E. Feroli, Peter Hooper, Anil K Kashyap, and Kermit L. Schoenholtz\n(2017), Deflating Inflation Expectations: The Implications of Inflation’s Simple Dynamics, report prepared\nfor the 2017 U.S. Monetary Policy Forum, sponsored by the Initiative on Global Markets at the University\nof Chicago Booth School of Business, held in New York, March 3,\nhttps://research.chicagobooth.edu/%7E/media/806fc2ded9644b5da99518d2b07cc637.pdf.\n\n- 7 -\nestimates from models and slowly evolving surveys must be balanced against the cost of\ntreating the noise in the asset price as a signal. There is no unique way to do this, and\njudgment is required.\nIn conclusion, while my colleagues and I are attuned to the potential for a hall of\nmirrors problem, in my experience this affliction is one the Federal Reserve guards\nagainst and does not suffer from. My colleagues and I do look at developments in asset\nmarkets, but never in isolation and always in the context of balancing asset market\nsignals with complementary signals from surveys and econometric models. It is fair to\nsay that when signals from all three sources line up in the same direction—as, for\nexample, has been the case with market-, survey-, and model-based estimates of r*—the\neffect of those combined signals, at least on my thinking about the policy path, is more\nmaterial than when the signals provide conflicting interpretations.\nThank you for your attention. I look forward to hearing from the other panelists\nand to our discussion.",

Clarida\nVice Chair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Macroeconomic Policy and Global Economic Recovery”\n2021 Asia Economic Policy Conference, sponsored by\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco Center for Pacific Basin Studies\nSan Francisco, California\n(via webcast)\nNovember 19, 2021\n\nIn my remarks today, I would like to offer some perspectives on global monetary\npolicy correlation and what it can—and cannot—reveal about the prevalence and value of\nglobal monetary policy coordination or, in the limit, binding global monetary\ncooperation.1 In both the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and the Global Pandemic\nCollapse (GPC), major central banks around the world responded by cutting policy rates\nto, and then keeping them at, their effective lower bounds (ELBs); by increasing their\nbalance sheets through ambitious and expansive large-scale asset purchase and lending\nprograms; and by offering forward guidance—both Delphic and Odyssean—on the stance\nof their future monetary policies.2\nAs these examples make clear, we certainly do observe that national monetary\npolicies are often correlated, and such examples are not confined to recent experience.\nIndeed, the international monetary economics literature abounds with historical and\nempirical studies of correlated global monetary policy cycles, not to mention the evident\nsecular downtrend in global monetary policy rates observed in recent decades. Moreover,\nglobal monetary policies often also do appear at least sometimes to be coordinated.\nThere are certainly enough meetings of Group of Seven (G-7), Group of Twenty, and\nBank for International Settlements (BIS) central bank governors—virtual and in person—\nthat provide such opportunities. By contrast with evidence of central bank correlation\nand coordination, the historical record suggests that, since the collapse of the Bretton\nWoods system 50 years ago, rarely, if ever, do major sovereign central banks actually\n1 The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of other Federal Reserve Board members or\nFederal Open Market Committee participants. I would like to thank Burcu Duygan-Bump, Chiara Scotti,\nand Paul Wood for assistance in preparing these remarks.\n2 The terms “Delphic” and “Odyssean” are used to describe different types of forward guidance. Delphic\nforward guidance forecasts macroeconomic performance and likely monetary policy actions under that\nforecast, whereas Odyssean forward guidance publicly commits the FOMC to a future action. For more\ndetails, see Campbell and others (2012).\n\nenter into, at least publicly—let alone respect—binding commitments to pursue formal\ncooperative policies.3 Here and throughout the lecture, I shall reserve the meaning of the\nadjective cooperative, as in “cooperative” central bank policies, to define policies that\ncan, at least conceptually, be thought of as policies pursued by sovereign central banks\nthat fully incorporate any spillovers from one central bank’s policies to the other central\nbank’s mandates. Cooperative policies defined this way will, in general, differ from\nnoncooperative policies—in the sense of the Nash equilibrium concept—designed to\nachieve domestic mandates assigned by sovereign institutions while taking other central\nbank policies as given. In these remarks, I will draw on perspectives informed not only\nby economic analysis—including my own academic research on the theory and empirics\nof central banks’ policymaking—but also by my observations and experiences serving as\nVice Chair of the Federal Reserve Board during what has certainly been an eventful three\nyears.\nTo begin with the theory, it has long been appreciated that in the sorts of\neconomic models used by central banks around the world, the calibrated gains to\ninternational monetary policy cooperation are found to be rather modest relative to a\nstatus quo ante in which each country runs a sensible policy, taking as given the sensible\npolicies of the other countries. Today I will make a somewhat different, and less often\ndiscussed, case questioning formal global monetary policy cooperation—that, in practice,\nadopting it could plausibly erode central bank credibility and public support for central\nbank instrument independence.\n3 While adopting the euro—and, more broadly, joining a currency union—is the ultimate binding\ncommitment to cooperative monetary policy, the focus of my remarks today is on countries that are not\nmembers of a currency union.\n\nInternational monetary policy coordination, which I think of as including the\nsharing of information and analysis among central banks regarding the evolution of their\nindividual economies as well as the considerations that govern the setting of their policy\ninstruments—in other words, information about their policy reaction functions—can, and\nin my observation certainly does, enhance the design and effectiveness of monetary\npolicy execution for each country. I shall give some examples later.\nBut while international monetary policy coordination may enhance the efficiency\nof monetary policy execution, I am skeptical that in practice there are additional material,\nreliable, and robust gains that would flow from a formal regime of binding monetary\npolicy cooperation, at least among major G-7 economies with flexible exchange rates,\nopen capital accounts, and central bank mandates that include price stability. Or, more\nprecisely, it seems that whatever gains might exist in theory, they likely do not exceed the\nfull cost of committing to such an arrangement in practice. In such a regime, national\nmonetary policies in each country would be constrained to be set in such a way so as to\njointly maximize some metric for global price stability and perhaps also other objectives.\nThe reason is that there can be global externalities to monetary policy that create such\ntheoretical gains to cooperation. However, as Clarida, Galí, and Gertler (2002), among\nothers, have shown in the context of central banks with domestic price-stability mandates,\nto achieve the theoretical gains to international monetary policy cooperation, policy in\neach country must be set with reference to an index of inflation in all countries party to\nthe cooperative agreement.\nThis is a policy that no central bank would choose were it not bound to the\nagreement to achieve domestic price stability while taking other central banks’ policies as\n\ngiven, which, of course, raises the question of how such an agreement might be enforced.\nIn theory, if central banks were bound to set policy based solely on a policy rule that is a\nfunction of observed macroeconomic data, enforcement would be simple. But in\npractice, no sovereign central bank outsources its policy to an Excel spreadsheet, and,\nmoreover, best-practice policy rules incorporate inputs—such as the neutral rate of\ninterest or expected inflation—that are unobserved and time varying and thus difficult to\nmonitor. Finally, central bank mandates vary across sovereign jurisdictions. For\nexample, the Federal Reserve is mandated to pursue policies that achieve “maximum\nemployment and price stability.” The European Central Bank (ECB) is mandated by\ntreaty to pursue price stability but also has a secondary mandate to contribute to\nachieving the objectives of the European Union, which include balanced economic\ngrowth and full employment. Similarly, the Bank of England’s primary objective is to\nachieve the U.K. government’s target of 2 percent inflation, but its secondary objective is\nto support the government’s policy aims, including those for employment, growth, and—\nmore recently—environmental sustainability. So even though all major central banks are\nmandated to achieve “price stability” in some form or fashion, their mandates typically\ninclude other obligations that vary across jurisdictions. Because these obligations can,\nand sometimes do, require central banks to make a tradeoff—for example, in the United\nStates, between inflation and employment in the presence of supply shocks—defining the\nobjective that a cooperative agreement would choose to maximize would be a\nformidable task.\nI believe that, in practice, beyond the issue of enforcement and agreement on\nterms, there could well be another challenge with policy cooperation that is absent from\n\nmost theoretical discussions. Simply stated and in the context of a price-stability\nmandate for each central bank, the problem—as I see it—is the threat to the credibility of\nthe central bank, the challenges to central bank communication, and the resulting\npotential loss of support for its policy actions from the public when the policy choices\nthat would be required by binding monetary policy cooperation react not only to home\ninflation deviations from target, but also to deviations of foreign inflation from target. In\ntheoretical models, the commitment to the inflation target is just assumed to be perfect\nand credible, but in practice, credibility appears to be a function of central bank\ncommunication and of the policies actually implemented pushing inflation toward—and,\nin the absence of shocks, keeping inflation at—target. I suspect that, in practice, central\nbanks would have a hard time maintaining credibility and independence as well as\ncommunicating a policy that raised home interest rates aggressively not because home\ninflation is too high but because foreign inflation is!\nWhile, perhaps for these reasons, we do not have many confirmed sightings of\ngenuine binding monetary policy cooperation, we do observe many examples of\nmonetary policy correlation (see figure 1). Monetary policies will obviously be\ncorrelated if countries are subject to common shocks—such as in the GFC and the\nGPC—but can also be correlated as a consequence of integrated global capital markets.\nThe Clarida, Galí, and Gertler (2002) model provides a simple illustration of how this\ncorrelation can come about. In the “home” country, the optimal inflation-targeting\nmonetary policy can be written as a Taylor-type rule:\n,\n𝜆𝜆\n𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 = 𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡 +(1+ 𝛼𝛼)𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡\n\nwhere r is the “neutral” interest rate in the home country consistent with price stability\nt\nand trend growth and π is inflation in the home country. The ratio λ/α captures the extent\nt\nto which the home central bank trades off its inflation and gross domestic product (GDP)\nobjectives when they are in conflict. The parameter α indexes the priority the central\nbank places on stabilizing GDP growth relative to its trend path. When α is large, the\ncentral bank leans against high inflation less aggressively than it would were α small.\nWith an integrated global capital market, the neutral policy rate at home is a function of\ntrend GDP growth at home as well as expected foreign GDP growth:\n.\n∗\n𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡 = 2𝐸𝐸𝑡𝑡{Δ𝑦𝑦� 𝑡𝑡+1}+ 𝐸𝐸𝑡𝑡{Δ𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡+1}\nNow, to the extent the foreign central bank has a comparative advantage in tracking or\nforecasting foreign output growth—which, of course, it should, since such growth will\ndepend on the foreign central bank’s monetary policy—sharing this information with the\nhome central bank can improve that institution’s estimate of the home equilibrium real\ninterest rate and thus the effectiveness of its policy rule in meeting its domestic\nobjectives.\nThe foreign central bank sets its policy rate in an analogous fashion:\n∗ ∗ 𝜆𝜆 ∗\n𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 = 𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡 +�1+ ∗�𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡.\n𝑎𝑎\nThe ratio λ/α* captures the extent to which the foreign central bank trades off its inflation\nand GDP objectives when they are in conflict, and note that this tradeoff may be different\nthan that of the home central bank. With an integrated global capital market, the neutral\npolicy rate abroad is given by\n∗ ∗\n𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡 = 2𝐸𝐸𝑡𝑡{Δ𝑦𝑦� 𝑡𝑡+1}+ 𝐸𝐸𝑡𝑡{∆y𝑡𝑡+1}.\n\nThis simple example illustrates one channel through which globally integrated\ncapital markets can introduce policy correlation even in the absence of policy\ncoordination or cooperation. For example, even if home and foreign inflation rates and\ntrend growth rates are uncorrelated across countries, sensible monetary policies can be\ncorrelated across countries if neutral policy rates are correlated, as they appear to be in\nthe data (see figure 2, which is based on Holston, Laubach, and Williams, 2017).\nA recent working paper, Ferreira and Shousha (2021), models the determinants of\nthe neutral policy rate in the United States and includes in the empirical specification an\nindex of global productivity growth and demographic trends. Their empirical estimates\nattribute 85 basis points of the decline in U.S. neutral real interest rates since 2000 to\nglobal spillovers from the slowdown in global trend growth and demographic trends. So\npolicy correlation can be an outcome of noncooperative monetary policy operating in an\nintegrated global capital market and not evidence, in and of itself, of policy coordination,\nlet alone cooperation. Before continuing, I consider briefly how monetary policy would\ndiffer under binding cooperation in the simple example sketched out earlier. Under\ninternational monetary policy cooperation, the policy rate is set according to\n𝜆𝜆 1 𝜆𝜆 ∗\n𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 = 𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡 +�1+ �𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 + �1+ �𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡.\n𝛼𝛼 3 𝛼𝛼\nSo, intuitively, while policy in the home country does place more weight on home\ninflation when setting the interest rate, it also reacts to foreign inflation as well, as I\ndiscussed earlier.\nConsider the case with home inflation high and foreign inflation low. As can be\nseen from the preceding equation, the optimal policy under cooperation calls for the\nhome interest rate to be lower—more accommodative—than it would be in the absence\n\nof cooperation. In practice, the home central bank’s credibility as an inflation targeter to\nsatisfy its domestic price-stability mandate might well suffer if it failed to respond\naggressively to high domestic inflation because of, say, serious deflation abroad.\nMonetary Policy Spillovers Flow in Both Directions\nThere is a vast literature that documents the existence of international spillovers\nfrom U.S. monetary policy, especially to emerging markets (EMs). Recent research—\nHoek, Kamin, and Yoldas (2020)—suggests that the extent and consequences of such\nspillovers depend importantly on the source of a shift in U.S. monetary policy. Their key\nfinding, illustrated in figure 3, is that Federal Reserve policy rate surprises attributed to\nstronger U.S. growth generally have only moderate spillovers to EM financial conditions,\nwhereas U.S. policy rate changes attributed to U.S. inflationary pressures trigger more\nsubstantial spillovers to EM financial conditions. The authors also find compelling\nevidence that the magnitude of the cross-border spillovers attributed to U.S. monetary\npolicy shifts depends on a country’s macroeconomic vulnerability—as measured by\ninflation, current account deficit, international reserves, government debt, external debt,\nand private-sector credit growth, with more vulnerable EM countries experiencing larger\nspillovers from U.S. monetary policy.\nA recent paper—Curcuru, De Pooter, and Eckerd (2018)—examines and\ncompares the consequences of ECB policy actions for U.S. financial conditions and the\nconsequences of Federal Reserve policy actions for euro-area financial conditions. Their\nmain findings are summarized in the two panels in figure 4. The left panel presents\nevidence of statistically significant spillovers from Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC) policy announcements to euro-area bond markets. But, as shown in the right\n\npanel, the authors find that the spillovers from ECB policy announcements to U.S. yields\nare roughly as large as those from FOMC announcements to bund yields.\nWhile I will certainly acknowledge that both fundamental and financial shocks\noriginating in the United States, including shifts in the direction of U.S. monetary policy,\ncan and do propagate globally (see, for example, Miranda-Agrippino and Rey,\nforthcoming), the evidence suggests that causality can and does run in both directions. It\nis not difficult to recall external events that have triggered spillovers from foreign\nsovereign markets to the U.S. economy that have had observable implications for U.S.\nmonetary policy.\nThe Mexican peso crisis of 1994–95 and the Asian financial crisis of 1997–98\nresulted in substantial declines in economic activity in emerging markets but had only a\nmodest effect on the U.S. economy. One reason for this outcome was “safe haven” flows\ninto the dollar assets that pushed down U.S. bond yields. But the Russian default of\nAugust 1998, followed by the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management, had more\nsubstantial effects on global markets and posed greater risk to the U.S. economy, and\nthese events triggered a policy response by the Federal Reserve that cut the federal funds\nrate 75 basis points between September and November of that year. When in the next\nyear the global financial system stabilized, the Federal Reserve reversed those actions\nand returned the federal funds rate to the level prevailing before those events.\nIn more recent times, global shocks have also been consequential for U.S.\neconomic prospects and monetary policy. Examples include the 2011–13 euro-zone\ncrisis and the China devaluation and capital flight episode of 2015–16, when worries\nabout a hard landing and renminbi depreciation, respectively, roiled world markets. Both\n\nof these shocks originated in economies with large footprints in the global economy and\nfinancial system, and, as a result, they induced substantial disruptions in global financial\nmarkets. During both episodes, U.S. stock markets fell and the dollar appreciated,\nespecially during 2015 and 2016. As ever, these adverse global shocks triggered safe-\nhaven flows that pushed U.S. Treasury yields down. But despite the drop in Treasury\nyields, overall financial conditions in the United States tightened, weighing on aggregate\ndemand.\nU.S. monetary policy responded to these global “headwinds,” helping stave off\nactual contractions of U.S. activity. During the 2011–13 euro-zone crisis, the Federal\nReserve was already pursuing very accommodative policies in the wake of the GFC, but\nthe introduction of the maturity extension program in September 2011 and the\nannouncement in September 2012 of the third installment of quantitative easing were in\npart aimed at offsetting the effect of these global headwinds on U.S. aggregate demand.\nRegarding the aforementioned China devaluation episode of 2015–16, Federal Reserve\nstatements and transcripts from that time indicate that concerns about these developments\nand their effect on the U.S. economy were a factor that contributed to the delay in\nimplementing previously signaled policy rate increases.4 Again, as in the 1997–98\nepisode discussed earlier, once the “storm had passed,” the previously signaled policy\nnormalization process commenced in 2017.\nThe Federal Reserve and ECB Framework Reviews\nThe monetary policy framework reviews conducted by the Federal Reserve and\nthe ECB provide another example of monetary policy correlation. In February 2019, the\n4 The minutes and transcripts of these FOMC meetings are accessible on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.\n\nFederal Reserve System launched a review of its monetary policy strategy, tools, and\ncommunication practices. A key motivation for the Fed’s review as well as the ECB’s\nreview was the substantial decline in estimates of the neutral real interest rate, r*, that,\nover the longer run, is consistent with price stability. This decline has critical\nimplications for monetary policy because it leaves central banks with less conventional\npolicy space to offset adverse shocks to aggregate demand.5\nAs discussed in Clarida (2020), the Fed’s review, from the outset, built on three\npillars: a series of Fed Listens events, a flagship research conference, and a series of\nrigorous briefings for the Committee commencing in July 2019 and running through\nJanuary 2020.6 While our plans to conclude the review earlier in 2020 were, like so\nmany things, delayed by the arrival of the pandemic, in August 2020, the Federal Reserve\ndid announce, with unanimous support, an evolution of its monetary policy strategy to\nflexible average inflation targeting.7\nSimilar to the Federal Reserve, the ECB launched a review of its monetary policy\nstrategy in January 2020.8 Since the time of its previous strategy review in 2003, like the\nFed, the ECB observed profound structural changes in the global and euro-area\neconomies that have driven down neutral interest rates and increased the incidence and\nduration of episodes in which nominal policy interest rates are close to the ELB. So the\nECB’s review sought to adapt its monetary policy to the current economic environment\n5 For a detailed discussion of the elements that motivated the launch of the review, see Clarida (2020, 2021)\nand Powell (2020).\n6 Summaries of these discussions can be found in the minutes of these FOMC meetings, which are\naccessible on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.\n7 The Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy is available on the Board's website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review-of-monetary-policy-strategy-tools-and-\ncommunications-statement-on-longer-run-goals-monetary-policy-strategy.htm.\n8 See European Central Bank (2020).\n\nand to ensure that its policy could remain effective at the ELB. In its review, the ECB\nheard from a wide variety of European organizations and citizens, including through a\nseries of ECB Listens events.9 The ECB’s Governing Council engaged in a series of\ndeliberations, also informed by extensive staff background analysis on a range of topics.\nIn July 2021, with unanimous support from its Governing Council, the ECB announced\nits new strategy.10 Key elements of that strategy are a symmetric 2 percent inflation\ntarget, a view that the ELB requires especially forceful or persistent monetary policy\nmeasures to keep inflation expectations from drifting lower, and the affirmation that the\nfull range of measures it has used in recent years will remain in its toolkit.\nThe similarities in the two framework evolutions are due to the fact that powerful\ncommon global forces are driving down neutral policy rates and limiting the effectiveness\nof monetary policy in downturns to offset declines in aggregate demand. This asymmetry\nof policy effectiveness caused by the ELB imparts a secular downward bias to inflation\nthat, if not offset, could de-anchor inflation expectations below the central bank’s price-\nstability objectives. In addition, the similarities in the processes according to which these\ntwo framework reviews were conducted reflected also a convergence in thinking about\nbest practices for such reviews that was facilitated by a working group on central bank\nframeworks set up by the BIS.\nConclusion\nIn this speech, I have offered some perspectives on global monetary policy\ncorrelation and what it can—and cannot—reveal about the prevalence and value of global\nmonetary policy coordination or, in the limit, binding global monetary cooperation. I\n9 See European Central Bank (2021a).\n10 See European Central Bank (2021b).\n\nhave argued that, while there are several recent and historical examples where we\ncertainly do observe that national monetary policies are often correlated, adopting formal\nglobal monetary policy cooperation could plausibly erode central bank credibility and\npublic support for central bank independence. But I also observe that international\nmonetary policy coordination, defined as including the sharing of information and\nanalysis among central banks regarding the evolution of their individual economies and\ninformation about their policy reaction functions, can enhance the design and\neffectiveness of monetary policy execution for each country.\nThank you very much for your time and attention.

Clarida\nVice Chair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Promoting Global Growth and Domestic Economic Security”\n35th Annual NABE Economic Policy Conference\nWashington, D.C.\nFebruary 28, 2019\n\nThank you for the opportunity to participate in the 35th Annual Economic Policy\nConference of the National Association for Business Economics. Before we begin our\nconversation, I want to share a few thoughts about the outlook for the economy and\nmonetary policy.1\nCurrent Economic Situation and Outlook\nThe U.S. economy expanded at a robust pace in 2018, and my baseline outlook\nfor 2019 foresees somewhat slower but still-solid growth in the year ahead. In July, just\nabout four months from now, the current economic expansion will become the longest on\nrecord. The Federal Reserve is charged by the Congress with achieving and sustaining a\ndual mandate of maximum employment and price stability, and the economy is as close\nas it has been in many years to meeting these goals.\nThe unemployment rate is near the lowest level recorded in 50 years, and average\nmonthly job gains have continued to well outpace the increases needed over the longer\nrun to provide jobs for new entrants to the labor force. Most measures of nominal wage\ngrowth are running at or somewhat above the 3 percent pace, and recent wage gains have\nbeen strongest for lower-skilled workers.\nMoreover, the strength of the labor market appears to have encouraged people to\njoin the labor force and others, who might have left it, to continue working. The labor\nforce participation rate--the share of people who are either working or looking for work--\nhas moved up 1/2 percentage point over the past year, and the participation rate of prime-\n1 The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of other Federal Reserve Board members or\nFederal Open Market Committee participants. I am grateful to Brian Doyle of the Federal Reserve Board\nstaff for his assistance in preparing this text.\n\n- 2 -\nage workers (those 25 to 54 years old) has risen about 1-1/2 percentage points over the\npast few years.\nInflation, as measured by the 12-month change in the price index for personal\nconsumption expenditures (PCE), is estimated to have been a little bit below 2 percent of\nlate, largely because of recent declines in energy prices. However, core PCE inflation,\nwhich excludes food and energy prices and tends to be a better indicator of future\ninflation, is estimated to have been about 2 percent. Market-based measures of inflation\ncompensation have moved lower, on net, since last summer, though they have increased\nsome recently, and some survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are\nlittle changed. That said, taken together, the evidence suggests that measures of expected\ninflation are at the lower end of a range that I consider to be consistent with our price-\nstability goal of 2 percent PCE inflation.\nWhile my baseline outlook for growth, employment, and inflation is a positive\none, a number of crosscurrents that are buffeting the economy bear careful scrutiny.\nGlobal growth is slowing, particularly in China and Europe. Global policy uncertainty\nremains elevated. And financial conditions have been volatile, making efforts to extract\nsignal from noise more challenging.\nMonetary Policy\nAs I have indicated in recent speeches, monetary policy at this juncture needs to\nbe especially data dependent, with the federal funds rate now in the range of Federal\nOpen Market Committee (FOMC) participants’ estimates of its longer-run neutral level.\nMoreover, with employment and inflation now at or close to our dual-mandate objectives,\nthe FOMC in its January statement indicated it can afford to be patient as we assess the\n\n- 3 -\nneed for further adjustments in our policy stance.2 Going forward, we need, I believe, to\nbe cognizant of the balance we must strike between (1) being forward looking and\n(2) maximizing the odds of being right given the reality that the models that we consult\nare not infallible. For example, were a model to predict a surge in inflation, a decision\nfor preemptive hikes before the surge is evident in actual data would need to be balanced\nagainst the considerable cost of the model being wrong. Given muted inflation and stable\ninflation expectations, I believe we can be patient and allow the data to flow in as we\ndetermine what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be\nappropriate to strike this balance.\nWe also decided at our January meeting to maintain our current operating\nregime--a “floor” system--for implementing monetary policy.3 The FOMC will continue\nto set the stance of policy by establishing the target range for the federal funds rate. The\ninterest on excess reserves rate will be our primary tool to keep the federal funds rate in\nthe target range. In this regime, we will provide an ample supply of reserves in the\nbanking system to ensure that we remain on the flat portion of the reserve demand curve\nand that the federal funds rate is insulated from shocks to reserve demand and supply.\nWith this decision on our operating regime made, the Committee can now decide on the\nappropriate timing and pace for concluding our balance sheet drawdown. In the longer\nrun, the ultimate size of the balance sheet will be determined by the demand for Federal\nReserve liabilities such as currency and reserve balances.\n2 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2019), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC\nStatement,” press release, January 30,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20190130a.htm.\n3 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2019), “Statement Regarding Monetary Policy\nImplementation and Balance Sheet Normalization,” press release, January 30,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20190130c.htm.\n\n- 4 -\nFinally, in November, we announced a review of the Federal Reserve’s monetary\npolicy strategy, tools, and communications practices. In this review, we will listen\ncarefully to a broad range of stakeholders offering a full range of perspectives from\nacross the country, and we will draw on these insights as we assess how best to achieve\nand maintain maximum employment and price stability in the most robust fashion\npossible. Taking these viewpoints on board, the FOMC will begin its own discussions\nthis summer on how we might refine our framework and will provide a public assessment\nafter the review is completed.4\nThank you for your attention, and I look forward to our conversation.\n4 Information about the review and the events associated with it are available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review-of-monetary-policy-strategy-tools-and-\ncommunications.htm.",

Clarida\nVice Chair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Fed Listens: Distributional Consequences of the Cycle and Monetary Policy”\nConference hosted by the Opportunity and Inclusive Growth Institute\nFederal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis\nMinneapolis, Minnesota\nApril 9, 2019\n\nI am pleased to attend this Fed Listens event on the distributional consequences of\nthe business cycle and monetary policy. The Opportunity and Inclusive Growth Institute\nat the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis is a natural venue for discussing this topic in\nthe context of the broad review of our monetary policy framework that we are\nundertaking this year.1 In our review, we are examining the policy strategy, tools, and\ncommunication practices that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) uses to\npursue the Fed’s dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability. I will\nspeak this evening about the motivation for and scope of our review. We are bringing\nopen minds to it and are seeking perspectives from a broad range of interested individuals\nand groups, such as the panel of researchers we heard from this afternoon and the\ncommunity leaders we will hear from tomorrow. To us, it simply seems like good\ninstitutional practice to engage broadly with the public in this review as part of a\ncomprehensive approach to enhanced transparency and accountability.2\nMotivation for the Review\nThe Federal Reserve has been charged by the Congress with a dual mandate to\nachieve maximum employment and price stability, and this review will take this mandate\nas given. Moreover, the review will take as given that a 2 percent rate of inflation in the\nprice index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) is the operational goal most\nconsistent with our price stability mandate. While we believe that our existing\nframework for conducting monetary policy has served the public well, the purpose of this\n1 Additional information about Fed Listens, including background information on the initiative and a listing\nof events around the country, is available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review-of-monetary-policy-strategy-tools-and-\ncommunications-fed-listens-events.htm.\n2 Fuhrer and others (2018) explore the desirability of comprehensive reviews of the monetary policy\nframework. They argue that such reviews may help the Fed more effectively identify and implement\nneeded changes to its framework.\n\n- 2 -\nreview is to evaluate and assess ways in which our existing framework might be\nimproved so that we can best achieve our dual mandate objectives on a sustained basis.\nThat said, based on the experience of other central banks that have undertaken similar\nreviews, our review is more likely to produce evolution, not a revolution, in the way that\nwe conduct monetary policy.\nWith the U.S. economy operating at or close to our maximum-employment and\nprice-stability goals, now is an especially opportune time to conduct this review. The\nunemployment rate is at a 50-year low, and inflation is running close to our 2 percent\nobjective. We want to ensure that we are well positioned to continue to meet our\nstatutory goals in coming years. In addition, the Federal Reserve used new policy tools\nand enhanced its communication practices in response to the Global Financial Crisis and\nthe Great Recession, and the review will evaluate these changes. Furthermore, the U.S.\nand foreign economies have evolved significantly since the experience that informed\nmuch of the pre-crisis approach.\nPerhaps most significantly, neutral interest rates appear to have fallen in the\nUnited States and abroad.3 Moreover, this global decline in r* is widely expected to\npersist for years. The decline in neutral policy rates likely reflects several factors,\nincluding aging populations, changes in risk-taking behavior, and a slowdown in\ntechnology growth. These factors’ contributions are highly uncertain, but, irrespective of\ntheir precise role, the policy implications of the decline in neutral rates are important. All\nelse being equal, a fall in neutral rates increases the likelihood that a central bank’s policy\n3 For evidence of a fall in neutral rates of interest in the United States and abroad, see, among several\ncontributions, King and Low (2014); Holston, Laubach, and Williams (2017); Rachel and Smith (2017);\nand Brand, Bielecki, and Penalver (2018).\n\n- 3 -\nrate will reach its effective lower bound (ELB) in future economic downturns. That\ndevelopment, in turn, could make it more difficult during downturns for monetary policy\nto support household spending, business investment, and employment, and keep inflation\nfrom falling too low.4\nAnother key development in recent decades is that inflation appears less\nresponsive to resource slack. That is, the short-run Phillips curve appears to have\nflattened, implying a change in the dynamic relationship between inflation and\nemployment.5 A flatter Phillips curve is, in a sense, a proverbial double-edged sword. It\npermits the Federal Reserve to support employment more aggressively during\ndownturns--as was the case during and after the Great Recession--because a sustained\ninflation breakout is less likely when the Phillips curve is flatter.6 However, a flatter\nPhillips curve also increases the cost, in terms of economic output, of reversing\nunwelcome increases in longer-run inflation expectations. Thus, a flatter Phillips curve\nmakes it all the more important that longer-run inflation expectations remain anchored at\nlevels consistent with our 2 percent inflation objective.7\n4 For assessments of the risks that U.S. monetary policy will be constrained by the ELB and its implications\nfor economic activity and inflation, see Kiley and Roberts (2017), Erceg and others (2018),\nSwanson (2018), and Chung and others (2019).\n5 For evidence of a flattening of the slope of the Phillips curve in the United States and abroad, see, among\nothers, Simon, Matheson, and Sandri (2013); Blanchard, Cerutti, and Summers (2015); and Bank for\nInternational Settlements (2017).\n6 One potential contributor to the flattening of the Phillips curve is a change in the conduct of monetary\npolicy since the 1980s toward greater stabilization of inflation and economic activity; for evidence of such\na change, see Clarida, Galí, and Gertler (2000); Boivin and Giannoni (2006); and Boivin, Kiley, and\nMishkin (2010). As discussed in Roberts (2006) and Bullard (2018), greater stabilization on the part of a\ncentral bank can lead to the estimation of flatter Phillips curves in reduced-form regressions. Similarly, the\nadoption of an explicit inflation objective, along with greater certainty regarding the conduct of monetary\npolicy, can help anchor longer-term inflation expectations and stabilize actual inflation in response to\nshocks.\n7 See Yellen (2015) for a discussion of inflation dynamics and monetary policy; see Erceg and others\n(2018) for a quantitative exploration of the monetary policy implications of a flat Phillips curve in an\nuncertain economic environment. Since the mid-1980s, movements in both realized inflation and measures\nof longer-term inflation expectations have been somewhat muted, complicating the task of extracting the\nprecise role of inflation expectations as a determinant of realized inflation. Faust and Wright (2013) review\n\n- 4 -\nFinally, the strengthening of the labor market in recent years has highlighted the\nchallenges of assessing the proximity of the labor market to the full employment leg of\nthe Federal Reserve’s dual mandate. The unemployment rate, which stood at 3.8 percent\nin March, has been interpreted by many observers as suggesting that the labor market is\ncurrently operating beyond full employment. However, the level of the unemployment\nrate that is consistent with full employment is not directly observable and thus must be\nestimated. The range of plausible estimates likely extends at least as low as the current\nlevel of the unemployment rate. For example, in the February Blue Chip economic\noutlook survey, the average estimate of the natural rate of unemployment for the bottom\n10 respondents was 3.9 percent, as compared with 4.7 percent for the highest 10\nrespondents.8\nThe decline in the unemployment rate in recent years has been accompanied by an\nincrease in labor force participation, with especially pronounced gains for individuals in\ntheir prime working years.9 These increases in participation have provided employers\nwith a significant source of additional labor input and may be one factor restraining\ninflationary pressures. As with the unemployment rate, whether participation will\ncontinue to increase in a tight labor market remains uncertain.\nthe literature on inflation forecasting and present evidence in support of the conclusion that measures of\ninflation expectations help predict the trend in inflation. Cecchetti and others (2017) showed that while the\nlevel of realized inflation and four-quarter-ahead inflation expectations are positively correlated, changes in\nthese variables have been largely uncorrelated since the mid-1980s. These authors suggest that, in a low\nand stable inflation environment, policymakers should pay attention to a wide array of other indicators in\ndetermining the implications of movements in realized inflation and measures of inflation expectations.\n8 The average estimate from the Blue Chip respondents was 4.3 percent. The box “How Tight Is the Labor\nMarket?” in the Board’s February 2018 Monetary Policy Report contains a discussion of some indicators\nthat can be used to assess labor market tightness; see Board of Governors (2018a, pp. 8-9).\n9 The box “The Labor Force Participation Rate for Prime-Age Individuals” in the Board’s July 2018\nMonetary Policy Report contains a discussion of recent developments in labor force participation rates for\nprime-age individuals; see Board of Governors (2018b, pp. 8-10).\n\n- 5 -\nThe strong job gains of recent years also has delivered benefits to groups that\nhave historically been disadvantaged in the labor market. For example, African\nAmericans and Hispanics have experienced persistently higher unemployment rates than\nwhites for many decades.10 However, those unemployment rate gaps have narrowed as\nthe labor market has strengthened, and there is some indication of an extra benefit to\nthese groups as the unemployment rate moves into very low territory.11 Likewise,\nalthough unemployment rates for less-educated workers are persistently higher than they\nare for their more-educated counterparts, such gaps appear to narrow as the labor market\nstrengthens.12 And wage increases in the past couple of years have been strongest for\nless-educated workers and for those at the lower end of the wage distribution.13\nScope of the Review\nOur existing monetary policy strategy is laid out in the Committee’s Statement on\nLonger-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.14 First adopted in January 2012, the\nstatement has been reaffirmed at the start of each subsequent year, including earlier this\nyear with unanimous support from all 17 FOMC participants. The statement indicates\nthat the Committee seeks to mitigate deviations of inflation from 2 percent and deviations\n10 See Cajner and others (2017) for a careful examination of how labor market differentials by race and\nethnicity have evolved over time.\n11 See Aaronson and others (2019) for evidence on the relative behavior of unemployment rates by race and\nethnicity in a strong labor market. The authors find similar patterns for labor force participation rates and\nfor employment-to-population ratios.\n12 Disparities in labor market outcomes are also evident between urban and rural areas of the United States.\nHowever, these gaps have not narrowed as the labor market has strengthened. The box “Employment\nDisparities between Rural and Urban Areas” in the Board’s February 2019 Monetary Policy Report\nexamines these disparities in more detail; see Board of Governors (2019, pp. 10-12). See also Weingarden\n(2017).\n13 Wage gains for workers with different wage levels and with different levels of education can be\ncalculated using data from the Current Population Survey from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The\nEconomic Policy Institute (2019) provides convenient tabulations of these data.\n14 The statement is available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals.pdf.\n\n- 6 -\nof employment from assessments of its maximum level. In doing so, the FOMC\nrecognizes that these assessments of maximum employment are necessarily uncertain and\nsubject to revision. According to the Federal Reserve Act, the employment objective is\non an equal footing with the inflation objective.\nAs a practical matter, our current strategy shares many elements with the policy\nframework known in the research literature as “flexible inflation targeting.”15 However,\nthe Fed’s mandate is much more explicit about the role of employment than those of most\nflexible inflation-targeting central banks, and our statement reflects this by stating that\nwhen the two sides of the mandate are in conflict, neither one takes precedent over the\nother. We believe this transparency about the balanced approach the FOMC takes has\nserved us well over the past decade when high unemployment called for extraordinary\npolicies that entailed some risk of inflation.\nThe review of our current framework will be wide ranging, and we will not\nprejudge where it will take us, but events of the past decade highlight three broad\nquestions.\nThree Questions\nThe first question is, “Can the Federal Reserve best meet its statutory objectives\nwith its existing monetary policy strategy, or should it consider strategies that aim to\nreverse past misses of the inflation objective?”\nUnder our current approach as well as that of many central banks around the\nworld, the persistent shortfalls of inflation from 2 percent that many advanced economies\nhave experienced over most of the past decade are treated as “bygones.” This means that\n15 For a discussion of this terminology and references, see English, López-Salido, and Tetlow (2015) and\nClinton and others (2015).\n\n- 7 -\npolicy today is not adjusted to offset past inflation shortfalls with future overshoots of the\ninflation target (nor do persistent overshoots of inflation trigger policies that aim to\nundershoot the inflation target). Central banks are generally believed to have effective\ntools for preventing persistent inflation overshoots, but the effective lower bound on\ninterest rates makes persistent undershoots more likely. Persistent inflation shortfalls\ncarry the risk that longer-term inflation expectations become poorly anchored or become\nanchored below the stated inflation goal.16\nIn part because of that concern, some economists have advocated “makeup”\nstrategies under which policymakers seek to undo, in part or in whole, past inflation\ndeviations from target. Such strategies include targeting average inflation over a\nmultiyear period and price-level targeting, in which policymakers seek to stabilize the\nprice level around a constant growth path.17 These strategies could be implemented\neither permanently or as a temporary response to extraordinary circumstances. For\nexample, the central bank could commit, at the time when the policy rate reaches the\nELB, to maintain the policy rate at this level until inflation over the ELB period has, on\n16 These risks could be exacerbated if households and businesses expect monetary policy to be\ninsufficiently accommodative because of proximity to the ELB. For related discussions, see Reifschneider\nand Williams (2000); Adam and Billi (2007); Nakov (2008); and Hills, Nakata, and Schmidt (2016).\n17 Eggertsson and Woodford (2003) provide an early discussion of how optimal monetary policy at the ELB\nentails a commitment to reflate the price level during the subsequent economic expansion. Nessén and\nVestin (2005) discuss the relationship between average inflation targeting and price-level targeting. There\nis a dearth of empirical evidence on strategies seeking to make up for inflation deviations. Central banks\nthat pursue an inflation goal generally seek to achieve a specific rate of inflation by some time horizon--\ntypically a couple years ahead or over the “medium run”--without regard to past inflation deviations. One\nexception is the Reserve Bank of Australia, whose inflation goal is specified as a range of “2-3 per cent, on\naverage, over the medium term” and thus might embed some notion of history dependence. However,\nRuge-Murcia (2014) argues that the drift in the price level in Australia is comparable with the drifts\nobserved in economies with purely forward-looking specification of the inflation goal. The only known\nhistorical example of price-level targeting occurred in Sweden from 1931 to 1933 when the country\nabandoned the gold standard and attempted instead to maintain its price level. The temporary adoption of\nprice-level targeting is credited with helping Sweden avoid deflation, an outcome that contrasted with that\nin countries that stayed on the gold standard. See Berg and Jonung (1999).\n\n- 8 -\naverage, run at the target rate.18 Other makeup strategies seek to reverse shortfalls in\npolicy accommodation at the ELB by keeping the policy rate lower for longer than\notherwise would be the case.19 In many models that incorporate the ELB, these makeup\nstrategies lead to better average performance on both legs of the dual mandate and\nthereby, viewed over time, provide no conflict between the dual-mandate goals.20\nThe benefits of the makeup strategies rest heavily on households and firms\nbelieving in advance that the makeup will, in fact, be delivered when the time comes--for\nexample, that a persistent inflation shortfall will be met by future inflation above\n2 percent. As is well known from the research literature, makeup strategies, in general,\nare not time consistent because when the time comes to push inflation above 2 percent,\nconditions at that time will not warrant doing so. Because of this time inconsistency, the\npublic would have to see a makeup strategy as a credible commitment for it to be\nsuccessful. That important real-world consideration is often neglected in the academic\nliterature, in which central bank “commitment devices” are simply assumed to exist and\nbe instantly credible on decree. Thus, one of the most challenging questions is whether\ncentral banks could, in practice, attain the benefits of makeup strategies that are possible\nin models.\n18 See Bernanke (2017) for a discussion of such a strategy. See Hebden and López-Salido (2018) for a\nquantitative assessment of that and other strategies. See also Kiley and Roberts (2017) for a strategy in\nwhich policymakers aim for inflation higher than 2 percent during economic expansions to compensate for\nbelow-target realizations of inflation during economic downturns.\n19 See Reifschneider and Williams (2000) for a strategy in which a central bank following a Taylor rule\nmakes up for shortfalls in policy accommodation during ELB episodes by subsequently keeping the policy\nrate lower than otherwise. The box “Complexities of Monetary Policy Rules” in the Board’s July 2018\nMonetary Policy Report contains an application of such a modified rule; see Board of Governors (2018b,\npp. 37-41).\n20 See English, López-Salido, and Tetlow (2015) for applications of flexible price-level targeting and\nnominal income-targeting strategies to a quantitative model of the U.S. economy.\n\n- 9 -\nThe next question the review will consider is, “Are the existing monetary policy\ntools adequate to achieve and maintain maximum employment and price stability, or\nshould the toolkit be expanded? And, if so, how?” The FOMC’s primary means of\nchanging the stance of monetary policy is by adjusting its target range for the federal\nfunds rate. In the fall of 2008, the FOMC cut that target to just above zero in response to\nfinancial turmoil and deteriorating economic conditions. Because the U.S. economy\nrequired additional policy accommodation after the ELB was reached, the FOMC\ndeployed two additional tools in the years following the crisis: balance sheet policies and\nforward guidance about the likely path of the federal funds rate.21\nThe FOMC altered the size and composition of the Fed’s balance sheet through a\nsequence of three large-scale securities purchase programs, via a maturity extension\nprogram, and by adjusting the reinvestment of principal payments on maturing securities.\nWith regard to forward guidance, the FOMC initially made “calendar based” statements,\nand, later on, it issued “outcome based” guidance. Overall, the empirical evidence\nsuggests that these added tools helped stem the crisis and support economic recovery by\nstrengthening the labor market and lifting inflation back toward 2 percent. That said,\nestimates of the effects of these unconventional policies range widely.22\n21 As an illustration of the shortfall in policy support created by a binding ELB during the Global Financial\nCrisis, the simple policy rules considered in a January 2017 speech by then-Chair Janet Yellen prescribed\nsetting the federal funds rate between negative 1-1/2 and negative 9 percent; see Yellen (2017). In addition\nto using these two additional monetary policy tools, the Federal Reserve implemented a number of other\nmeasures to stabilize the financial system, increase households and business confidence, and more\ngenerally support the economic recovery. These supplementary measures included the setting up of several\ncredit facilities and the introduction of stress tests for systemically important financial institutions.\n22 On the transmission channels of balance sheet policies, see D’Amico and others (2012), Joyce and others\n(2012), Clarida (2012), Woodford (2012), and Bauer and Rudebusch (2014). On the financial market\neffects of balance sheet policies, see Gagnon and others (2011), Joyce and others (2011), Hamilton and Wu\n(2012), D’Amico and King (2013), and Swanson (2017). For discussions of the macroeconomic effects of\nthese policy actions, see Chen, Cúrdia, and Ferrero (2012); Baumeister and Benati (2013); Engen, Laubach,\nand Reifschneider (2015); Chung and others (2019), and the references therein. For related assessments of\n\n- 10 -\nIn addition to assessing the efficacy of these existing tools, we will examine\nadditional tools to ease policy when the ELB is binding. During the crisis and its\naftermath, the Federal Reserve considered but ultimately found some of the tools\ndeployed by foreign central banks wanting relative to the alternatives it did pursue. But\nthe review will reassess our earlier findings in light of more recent experience in other\ncountries.\nThe third question the review will consider is, “How can the FOMC’s\ncommunication of its policy framework and implementation be improved?” Our\ncommunication practices have evolved considerably since 1994, when the Federal\nReserve released the first statement after an FOMC meeting. Over the past decade or so,\nthe FOMC has enhanced its communication practices to promote public understanding of\nits policy goals, strategy, and actions, as well as to foster democratic accountability.\nThese enhancements include the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy\nStrategy; postmeeting press conferences; various statements about principles and strategy\nguiding the Committee’s normalization of monetary policy; and quarterly summaries of\nindividual FOMC participants’ economic projections, assessments about the appropriate\npath of the federal funds rate, and judgments of the uncertainty and balance of risks\naround their projections.23\nforward guidance, see Campbell and others (2012); Engen, Laubach, and Reifschneider (2015); Campbell\nand others (2017); and Swanson (2017).\n23 Starting in 1979, the Federal Reserve published a summary of individual economic projections from\nvarious Board members, FOMC members, or FOMC participants in the semiannual Monetary Policy\nReport. With the introduction of the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) in 2007, the FOMC\nincreased the frequency of the releases of policymaker projections, expanded the set of economic variables\nincluded, and extended the forecast horizon. Because the SEP includes individual contributions of\nprojections and assessments from all FOMC participants, it captures a broader range of views than those of\nFOMC members. For a discussion and data, see Bernanke (2007) and Romer (2010).\n\n- 11 -\nAs part of the review, we will assess the Committee’s current and past\ncommunications and additional forms of communication that could be helpful. For\nexample, there might be ways to improve communication about the coordination of\npolicy tools or the interplay between monetary policy and financial stability.\nActivities and Timeline for the Review\nThe review will have several components.24 The Board and the Reserve Banks\nare currently conducting town hall-style Fed Listens events, in which we are hearing from\na broad range of interested individuals and groups, including business and labor leaders,\ncommunity development advocates, and academics. The conference here at the\nMinneapolis Fed is one of these events, as was the “Community Listening Session”\nhosted by the Dallas Fed in February. Several more Fed Listens events will follow in\nMay.\nIn addition, we are holding a System research conference on June 4-5, 2019, at\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, with speakers and panelists from outside the Fed.\nThe program includes overviews by academic experts of themes that are central to the\nreview: the FOMC’s monetary policy since the financial crisis, assessments of the\nmaximum sustainable level of employment, alternative policy frameworks and strategies\nto achieve the dual mandate, policy tools, global considerations, financial stability\nconsiderations, and central bank communications. Two sessions will feature panels of\ncommunity leaders who will share their perspectives on the labor market and the effects\nof interest rates on their constituencies.\n24 Information about the review and the events associated with it are available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review-of-monetary-policy-strategy-tools-and-\ncommunications.htm.\n\n- 12 -\nWe expect to release summaries of the Fed Listens events and to livestream the\nChicago conference. Building on the perspectives we hear and on staff analysis, the\nFOMC will conduct its own assessment of its monetary policy framework, beginning\naround the middle of the year. We will share our conclusions with the public in the first\nhalf 2020.\nConcluding Thoughts\nThe economy is constantly evolving, bringing with it new policy challenges. So it\nmakes sense for us to remain open minded as we assess current practices and consider\nideas that could potentially enhance our ability to deliver on the goals the Congress has\nassigned us. For this reason, my colleagues and I do not want to preempt or to predict\nour ultimate finding. What I can say is that any refinements or more material changes to\nour framework that we might make will be aimed solely at enhancing our ability to\nachieve and sustain our dual-mandate objectives in the world we live in today.\n\n- 13 -\nReferences\nAaronson, Stephanie R., Mary C.

Clarida\nVice Chair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Nontraditional Data, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing\nin Macroeconomics,” a research conference sponsored by\nthe Federal Reserve Board\nWashington, D.C.\nOctober 1, 2019\n\nGood morning, and welcome to the Federal Reserve Board’s research conference\n“Nontraditional Data, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing in\nMacroeconomics.” Here at the Fed, we are continually assessing the current state of the\neconomy, updating our outlook for economic activity, and estimating the risks around\nthat outlook. In this environment, we assess a broad array of government and private-\nsector data to determine what they imply for the achievement of the Fed’s statutory goals\nof maximum employment and price stability. As a result, this conference and the range\nof topics on your agenda for today and tomorrow are highly relevant for us. More timely\nand accurate information sourced from nontraditional data and the use of new techniques\nshould permit Board staff economists to make better estimates of the evolving news and\nwhat it implies for the economic outlook and allow policymakers to make better-\ninformed decisions.\nOver these next two days, you will hear about the use of new tools and\nnontraditional data sources and what they say for the assessment of inflation and the labor\nmarket; about the use of new methods for forecasting; and about extracting information\nfrom text and using textual analysis to evaluate regulatory complexity and understand\ncentral bank communications. You no doubt will have many conversations in this room\nand during breaks about the usefulness of big data and new techniques for\nmacroeconomic analysis. I am pleased to see some former colleagues and important\ncontributors to macroeconomics and measurement on your conference program, such as\nErica Groshen; Ron Jarmin; Matthew Shapiro; Hal Varian; and David Wilcox, who\nrecently left the Fed for other pastures.\n\n- 2 -\nI would also like to acknowledge the diversity this conference offers. This\nconference is interdisciplinary, bringing together people from many different fields of\nstudy—economists, computer scientists, and statisticians—as well as people from many\ndifferent types of institutions, including universities, central bank research departments,\nstatistical agencies, and the private sector. We all stand to benefit from work across\ndisciplines, and the connections forged at conferences such as this one can be highly\nfruitful.\nTo a large extent, the use of nontraditional data, machine learning, and natural\nlanguage processing in macroeconomics and for policy is only just in its infancy. In\nmany cases, we are unsure of the efficacy or benefits of these approaches. Coordination\nbetween statistical agencies and policymaking institutions will help us achieve our shared\ngoal—a better understanding of the economy. To this end, the discussions on the use of\nbig data and new techniques for central banking and on the possibilities for cooperation\nbetween private companies and government agencies should be particularly helpful.\nMoreover, I strongly encourage you to continue your discussions after the conference\nends and to seek opportunities for joint work so that we can further develop our\nunderstanding of big data and textual analysis.\nNow I would like to invite the participants in the session on alternative data on\ninflation and the labor market to come to the podium. Welcome to the Federal Reserve,\nand I wish you a successful two days.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n1:00 p.m. EDT\nNovember 1, 2019\nThe United States, Japan, and the Global Economy\nRemarks by\nRichard H. Clarida\nVice Chair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nJapan Society\nNew York, New York\nNovember 1, 2019\n\nI appreciate this opportunity to speak today at the Japan Society, a respected\ninstitution dedicated to studying, advocating, and expanding interactions between the\nUnited States and Japan.1 While the society’s remit is broad and includes arts, culture,\nand education, I will, perhaps not surprisingly, focus my remarks on our two economies.\nJapan is an important economic partner of the United States, and our economies are\nlinked through trade in goods and services as well as capital flows that affect interest\nrates and other aspects of financial markets. Through these channels, developments in\nJapan can affect economic conditions in the United States, and vice versa.\nMore broadly, beyond bilateral linkages, economic conditions in United States\nand Japan are tightly linked to global economic developments, and today I will discuss\nseveral of the global factors that are relevant to the outlook for both economies. First, I\nwill review the current U.S. outlook and some key global risks to that outlook that we are\nmonitoring at the Federal Reserve. I will next elaborate on the channels through which\nglobal factors affect domestic economic conditions in the United States and, in some\ncases, also Japan. I will conclude with some remarks about the monetary policy decision\nwe announced on Wednesday.\nU.S. Outlook\nBy many metrics, the U.S. economy is in a good place. The current economic\nexpansion, now in its 11th year, is the longest on record, and the economy continues to\nadvance at a moderate pace, with real gross domestic product (GDP) growth running at\n2 percent over the past year and 1.9 percent in the most recent quarter. Growth has been\n1 These remarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee. I would like to thank Joseph Gruber for his assistance in\npreparing this speech.\n\n- 2 -\nsupported by the continued strength of household consumption, underpinned, in turn, by\na thriving labor market. The unemployment rate is near a half-century low, real wages\nare rising, and workers who had earlier left the labor force are returning to find jobs.\nThere is no sign that cost-push pressures are putting excessive upward force on price\ninflation, and to me, plausible estimates of the natural rate of unemployment extend from\njust above 4 percent to the current level. Core personal consumption expenditures (PCE)\ninflation over the 12 months ending in September, at 1.7 percent, remains muted, and\nheadline inflation, currently running at 1.3 percent, is likely this year to fall somewhat\nbelow our 2 percent objective. Price stability, as I see it, requires that inflation\nexpectations as well as actual inflation be stable and consistent with our 2 percent\ninflation target. We do not directly observe inflation expectations, and I myself consult a\nwide range of survey and market estimates. Based on these estimates, I judge that\nmeasures of inflation expectations reside at the low end of a range I consider consistent\nwith price stability.\nAlthough the baseline expectation for the U.S. economy is favorable, there are\nsome evident downside risks to this outlook. Global growth has been sluggish since the\nmiddle of 2018. This slowdown in global growth as well as increased uncertainty about\nthe outlook for global trade policy appear to be headwinds for manufacturing activity and\ninvestment spending in the United States and abroad.2 Also another source of uncertainty\nin the global economy has been and continues to be Brexit. The global growth outlook\n2 Caldara and others find that increased trade policy uncertainty, independent of the actual effect of higher\ntariffs, can exert a significant negative drag on U.S. and global GDP. See Dario Caldara, Matteo\nIacoviello, Patrick Molligo, Andrea Prestipino, and Andrea Raffo (2019), “The Economic Effects of Trade\nPolicy Uncertainty,” International Finance Discussion Papers 1256 (Washington: Board of Governors of\nthe Federal Reserve System, September), https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/ifdp/files/ifdp1256.pdf.\n\n- 3 -\nalso depends importantly on the strength and sustainability of continued economic\nexpansion in China. China is balancing its desire to curtail credit growth and promote\ndeleveraging against its understandable aspiration to maintain a rapid pace of economic\ngrowth in a country of 1.4 billion people. Finally, global disinflationary forces remain\nand present ongoing challenges to many central banks in their efforts to achieve and\nmaintain price stability.\nIn sum, global conditions present headwinds for the U.S. outlook, and, as my\ncolleagues and I at the Federal Reserve have emphasized, these headwinds have been a\nprominent consideration in our recent monetary policy assessments. I would now like to\nelaborate on some of the channels through which foreign developments more generally\nmight be expected to affect the outlook for the U.S. economy.3\nChannels and Linkages\nPerhaps the most direct link between economic conditions abroad and in the\nUnited States is foreign demand for U.S. exports. To be sure, exports account for a\nsmaller share of the U.S. economy—about 12 percent—than the global average of about\n30 percent. Even so, when foreign demand for U.S. exports falls, the effect on U.S.\nproduction is evident. The pace of economic expansion abroad is a key determinant of the\ndemand for U.S. exports. Most recently, the International Monetary Fund projects\nforeign GDP growth in 2019 to have slowed to its weakest pace since the financial crisis.\nLargely as a result, real U.S. exports been about flat over the past year, an unusual\ndevelopment outside of recession. U.S. exports also have slowed as a result of a decline\n3 For further discussion, see Richard H. Clarida (2019), “Global Shocks and the U.S. Economy,” speech\ndelivered at the BDF Symposium and 34th SUERF Colloquium, sponsored by Banque de France and the\nEuropean Money and Finance Forum, Paris, March 28,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/clarida20190328a.htm.\n\n- 4 -\nin exports to China following the imposition of tariffs on U.S. goods and also more\nrecently because of production-related disruptions in aircraft deliveries.\nThe pace of economic growth in our major trading partners affects the demand\nfor U.S. exports not only directly, but also indirectly by influencing the value of the\ndollar. When foreign growth weakens and central banks abroad ease monetary policy to\nsupport their domestic economies, returns on dollar assets appear relatively more\nattractive, capital flows into U.S. markets, and these flows will tend to boost the foreign\nexchange value of the dollar. In addition, elevated uncertainties about the global outlook\nand/or other evidence of financial stress abroad can also drive up the value of the dollar,\nas investors flow into the safe haven traditionally provided by U.S. assets. A stronger\ndollar, for either reason, makes U.S. exports more expensive for foreign buyers, makes\nU.S. imports from abroad more attractive to U.S. purchasers, and thereby tends to lower\ndemand for U.S. goods and services. That being said, I would note that the value of the\ndollar does not appear to play much of a role in explaining the decline in U.S. exports\nover the past year. The current level of the trade-weighted dollar is about where it has\nbeen, on average, over the past few years. However, looking back several years, the 25\npercent appreciation of the dollar that occurred in 2014 was an important contributing\nfactor to the previous noticeable decline in U.S. exports that took place in 2015 and 2016.\nGlobal financial markets also link the United States to the global economy, and\ndevelopments abroad can spill over into domestic financial conditions, with material\neffects on domestic activity. This is particularly evident during episodes of global\nfinancial stress, in which “risk-off” shifts in sentiment can depress U.S. equity prices and\nwiden domestic credit spreads even as flight-to-safety flows push down U.S. Treasury\n\n- 5 -\nyields. These global financial spillovers to the U.S. economy were notably pronounced\nduring the 1998 Russian crisis, the euro-area debt crisis earlier this decade, and the China\ndevaluation episode of 2015–16. Recently, global financial spillovers have contributed to\nthe significant decline in U.S. Treasury yields that we have seen since the spring. Since\nthe market for debt is global, low—and, in many cases, negative—yields abroad\nencourage capital inflows that put downward pressure on U.S. yields. Equity prices have\nalso reacted to global developments and recently appear particularly sensitive to news\nabout the outlook for U.S. international trade. Global factors have likely also contributed\nto the estimated decline in the neutral rate of interest, or r*, that we have observed in the\nUnited States and many other countries. Slow productivity growth and population aging\nhave lowered potential growth rates in major foreign economies, decreasing demand for\ninvestment and increasing desired saving, both of which have contributed to lower\nequilibrium interest rates abroad, with spillovers to the rest of the world, including in the\nUnited States.4\nGlobal developments influence not only U.S. economic activity and financial\nmarkets, but also U.S. inflation. Global factors—through their influences on U.S.\naggregate demand and supply that I just described—can alter U.S. inflation dynamics.\nForeign factors can also directly affect the prices paid by U.S. firms and consumers,\nparticularly, but not exclusively, for imported goods. An appreciation of the dollar can\n4 See Richard Clarida (2019), “The Global Factor in Neutral Policy Rates: Some Implications for\nExchange Rates, Monetary Policy, and Policy Coordination,” International Finance Discussion Papers 1244\n(Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, April),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/ifdp/files/ifdp1244.pdf. For one example highlighting\ndemographics, see Etienne Gagnon, Benjamin K. Johannsen, and David Lopez-Salido (2016),\n“Understanding the New Normal: The Role of Demographics,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series\n2016-080 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, October),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/feds/2016/files/2016080pap.pdf.\n\n- 6 -\nlower the dollar price of U.S. imports, although empirically, this effect is less than one-\nfor-one, as foreign exporters tend to keep the dollar prices of their goods comparatively\nstable relative to observed exchange rate fluctuations.5 In addition, swings in global\ncommodity prices influence U.S. inflation. Over the past year, the rise in the dollar and\nfalling oil prices have been important contributors to the subdued pace of U.S. inflation.\nJapan in the Global Economy\nUp to now, I have focused on the U.S. economy. However, despite some\nimportant differences that I will note, the Japanese economy exhibits some notable\nsimilarities to the United States, both in terms of its overall performance and its exposure\nto the global economy. To begin with, Japanese growth, while slower than in the United\nStates, has been running above the pace needed to absorb new entrants to the labor force,\nand its strong labor market is operating with an unemployment rate near multidecade\nlows at 2.2 percent. Also, as in the United States, weak exports have recently been a drag\non Japanese growth. But, like the United States, Japan has been less exposed to the\nglobal slowdown than many other economies. Exports represent only 17 percent of\nJapanese GDP, higher than in the United States but well below the 30 percent global\naverage I mentioned earlier.\nIn some respects, however, Japan is more strongly linked to the global economy\nthan is the United States. One example is the relationship between episodes of global\nfinancial stress and the exchange rate. In times of stress, the dollar tends to appreciate as\ninvestors seek the safety of U.S. markets. The same is even more true for Japan, with the\n5 See José Manuel Campa and Linda S. Goldberg (2005), “Exchange Rate Pass-Through into Import\nPrices,” Review of Economics and Statistics, vol. 87 (November), pp. 679–90; and Christopher Gust,\nSylvain Leduc, and Robert Vigfusson (2010), “Trade Integration, Competition, and the Decline in\nExchange-Rate Pass-Through,” Journal of Monetary Economics, vol. 57 (April), pp. 309–24.\n\n- 7 -\nyen often recording even stronger appreciation than the dollar in times of increased risk\naversion.\nOther channels operate differently because of structural differences between the\nUnited States and Japan. One difference is in the currency used to invoice trade. In the\nUnited States, almost all trade, both imports and exports, is invoiced in dollars. One\naspect of this, as mentioned earlier, is that changes in the value of the dollar tend to have\na relatively limited effect on U.S. import prices and import demand. Despite the\nimportance of the yen in global financial markets, a significant portion of Japan’s trade is\nalso invoiced in dollars rather than yen, including not only Japan’s exports to the United\nStates, but also its exports to other countries in Asia.6 Some scholars have proposed that\nthe importance of the dollar in Japan’s trade lessens the responsiveness of Japan’s exports\nto movements in the yen while making exports more sensitive to changes in the value of\nthe dollar and, therefore, U.S. monetary conditions.7\nRegarding inflation, through the considerable efforts of the Bank of Japan’s\nquantitative and qualitative monetary easing program launched in early 2013, Japan has\nemerged from almost 15 years of modest deflation and is now operating with a positive\ninflation rate. While the inflation remains below the Bank of Japan’s long-run objective\nof 2 percent, it represents a notable accomplishment given the difficulty of changing\npublic inflation expectations after a long period of modest deflation in consumer prices.\n6 See Takatoshi Ito, Satoshi Koibuchi, Kiyotaka Sato, and Junko Shimizu (2019), “Growing Use of Local\nCurrencies in Japanese Trade with Asian Countries: A New Puzzle of Invoicing Currency Choice,” Vox,\nJune 10, https://voxeu.org/article/growing-use-local-currencies-japanese-trade-within-asia.\n7 See Gita Gopinath, Emine Boz, Camila Casas, Federico J. Diez, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, and Mikkel\nPlagborg-Møller (2019), “Dominant Currency Paradigm,” NBER Working Paper Series 22943\n(Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic Research, March).\n\n- 8 -\nConclusion\nReturning to the United States, I would like to wrap up with a brief discussion of\nour monetary policy decision this week. At our meeting earlier this week, the Federal\nOpen Market Committee (FOMC) lowered the target range for the federal funds rate by\n1/4 percentage point, bringing the range to 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent—the third such\nreduction this year.8 As Chair Powell noted in his press conference, the Committee took\nthese actions to help keep the U.S. economy strong in the face of global developments\nand to provide some insurance against ongoing risks. The policy adjustments we have\nmade since last year are providing—and will continue to provide—meaningful support to\nthe economy. The economy is in a good place, and monetary policy is in a good place.\nThe policy adjustments we have made to date will continue to provide significant\nsupport for the economy. Since monetary policy operates with a lag, the full effects of\nthese adjustments on economic growth, the job market, and inflation will be realized over\ntime. We see the current stance of monetary policy as likely to remain appropriate as\nlong as incoming information about the economy remains broadly consistent with our\noutlook of moderate economic growth, a strong labor market, and inflation near our\nsymmetric 2 percent objective. Of course, if developments emerge that cause a material\nreassessment of our outlook, we would respond accordingly. Policy is not on a preset\ncourse, and we will be monitoring the effects of our policy actions, along with other\ninformation bearing on the outlook, as we assess, at each future meeting, the appropriate\npath of the target range for the federal funds rate.\n8 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2019), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC\nStatement,” press release, October 30,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20191030a.htm\n\n- 9 -\nThank you very much for your time and attention and for the invitation to speak at\nthe Japan Society this afternoon.",

Clarida\nVice Chair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Fed Policy: A Shadow Review”\nCato Institute’s 37th Annual Monetary Conference\nWashington, D.C.\nNovember 14, 2019\n\nI am delighted to be at the Cato Institute today to participate in your annual\nmonetary conference. The last time I had the privilege of speaking at this conference was\nin 2004. This year’s conference, “Fed Policy: A Shadow Review,” takes up the Federal\nReserve’s 2019 review of our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication\npractices. This topic is, of course, timely and one to which I and others have devoted\nmuch thought over the past year.1\nMotivation for the Review\nAlthough I will have more to say about the review in a moment, let me state at the\noutset that we believe our existing framework, which has been in place since 2012, has\nserved us well and has enabled us to achieve and sustain our statutorily assigned goals of\nmaximum employment and price stability. However, we also believe now is a good time\nto step back and assess whether, and in what possible ways, we can refine our strategy,\ntools, and communication practices to achieve and maintain our goals as consistently and\nrobustly as possible.2\nWith the U.S. economy operating at or close to maximum employment and price\nstability, now is an especially opportune time to conduct this review. The unemployment\nrate is near a 50-year low, and inflation is running close to our 2 percent objective. With\nthis review, we hope to ensure that we are well positioned to continue to meet our\nstatutory goals in coming years.\n1 These remarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 Fuhrer and others (2018) explore the desirability of comprehensive reviews of the monetary policy\nframework. They argue that such reviews may help the Fed more effectively identify and implement\nneeded changes to its framework.\n\n- 2 -\nThe U.S. and foreign economies have changed in some important ways since the\nGlobal Financial Crisis. Perhaps most significantly, neutral interest rates appear to have\nfallen in the United States.3 A fall in neutral rates increases the likelihood that a central\nbank’s policy rate will hit its effective lower bound (ELB) in future economic downturns.\nThat development, in turn, could make it more difficult during downturns for monetary\npolicy to support spending and employment and to keep inflation from falling too far\nbelow the central bank’s objective—2 percent in the case of the Federal Reserve.4\nAnother key development in recent decades is that price inflation appears less\nresponsive to resource slack. That is, the short-run price Phillips curve—if not the wage\nPhillips curve—appears to have flattened, implying a change in the dynamic relationship\nbetween inflation and employment.5 A flatter Phillips curve permits the Federal Reserve\nto support employment more aggressively during downturns—as was the case during and\nafter the Great Recession—because a sustained inflation breakout is less likely when the\nPhillips curve is flatter.6 However, a flatter Phillips curve also increases the cost, in\nterms of lost economic output, of reversing unwelcome increases in longer-run inflation\n3 For evidence of a fall in neutral rates of interest in the United States and abroad, see, among several\ncontributions, King and Low (2014); Holston, Laubach, and Williams (2017); Rachel and Smith (2017);\nand Brand, Bielecki, and Penalver (2018).\n4 For assessments of the risks that U.S. monetary policy will be constrained by the ELB and its implications\nfor economic activity and inflation, see Kiley and Roberts (2017), Erceg and others (2018),\nSwanson (2018), and Chung and others (2019).\n5 For evidence of a flattening of the slope of the Phillips curve in the United States and abroad, see, among\nothers, Simon, Matheson, and Sandri (2013); Blanchard, Cerutti, and Summers (2015); and Bank for\nInternational Settlements (2017).\n6 One potential contributor to the flattening of the Phillips curve is a change in the conduct of monetary\npolicy since the 1980s toward greater stabilization of inflation and economic activity; for evidence of such\na change, see Clarida, Galí, and Gertler (2000); Boivin and Giannoni (2006); and Boivin, Kiley, and\nMishkin (2010). As discussed in Roberts (2006) and Bullard (2018), greater stabilization on the part of a\ncentral bank can lead to the estimation of flatter Phillips curves in reduced-form regressions. Similarly, the\nadoption of an explicit inflation objective, along with greater certainty regarding the conduct of monetary\npolicy, can help anchor longer-term inflation expectations and stabilize actual inflation in response to\nshocks.\n\n- 3 -\nexpectations. Thus, a flatter Phillips curve makes it all the more important that inflation\nexpectations remain anchored at levels consistent with our 2 percent inflation objective.7\nBased on the evidence I have reviewed, I judge that U.S. inflation expectations today do\nreside at the low end of a range I consider consistent with our price-stability mandate.\nA Robust U.S. Labor Market\nFor some time now, price stability in the United States has coincided with a\nhistorically low unemployment rate. This low unemployment rate, 3.6 percent in\nOctober, has been interpreted by many as suggesting that the labor market is currently\noperating beyond full employment. However, we cannot directly observe the level of the\nunemployment rate that is consistent with full employment and price stability, u*, but\nmust infer it from data via models. I myself believe that the range of plausible estimates\nof u* extends to 4 percent and below and includes the current unemployment rate of\n3.6 percent. As the unemployment rate has declined in recent years, labor force\nparticipation for people in their prime working years has increased significantly, with the\nOctober participation rate at a cycle high of 82.8 percent.8 Increased prime-age\nparticipation has provided employers with additional labor resources and has been one\nfactor, along with a pickup in labor productivity, restraining inflationary pressures.\n7 See Yellen (2015) for a discussion of inflation dynamics and monetary policy; see Erceg and others\n(2018) for a quantitative exploration of the monetary policy implications of a flat Phillips curve in an\nuncertain economic environment. Since the mid-1980s, movements in both realized inflation and measures\nof longer-term inflation expectations have been somewhat muted, complicating the task of extracting the\nprecise role of inflation expectations as a determinant of realized inflation. Faust and Wright (2013) review\nthe literature on inflation forecasting and present evidence in support of the conclusion that measures of\ninflation expectations help predict the trend in inflation. Cecchetti and others (2017) showed that while the\nlevel of realized inflation and four-quarter-ahead inflation expectations are positively correlated, changes in\nthese variables have been largely uncorrelated since the mid-1980s. These authors suggest that, in a low\nand stable inflation environment, policymakers should pay attention to a wide array of other indicators in\ndetermining the implications of movements in realized inflation and measures of inflation expectations.\n8 The box “The Labor Force Participation Rate for Prime-Age Individuals” in the Board’s July 2018\nMonetary Policy Report contains a discussion of recent developments in labor force participation rates for\nprime-age individuals; see Board of Governors (2018, pp. 8–10).\n\n- 4 -\nWhether participation will continue to increase in a tight labor market remains to be seen.\nBut I note that male prime-age participation still remains below levels seen in previous\nbusiness cycle expansions.\nAlso, although the labor market is robust, there is no evidence that rising wages\nare putting excessive upward pressure on price inflation. Wages today are increasing\nbroadly in line with productivity growth and underlying inflation. Also of note, and\nreceiving less attention than it deserves, is the material increase in labor’s share of\nnational income that has occurred in recent years as the labor market has tightened. As I\nhave written before, labor’s share tends to rise as expansions endure and the labor market\ntightens.9 In recent cycles—and thus far in this cycle—this rise in labor’s share has not\nput excessive upward pressure on price inflation.\nScope of the Review\nThe Federal Reserve Act instructs the Fed to conduct monetary policy “so as to\npromote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate\nlong-term interest rates.”10 Our review this year takes this statutory mandate as given\nand also takes as given that inflation at a rate of 2 percent is most consistent over the\nlonger run with the congressional mandate.\n9 See Clarida (2016).\n10 Even though the act lists three distinct goals, the Federal Reserve’s mandate for monetary policy is\ncommonly known as the “dual mandate.” The reason is that an economy in which people who want to\nwork either have a job or are likely to find one fairly quickly and in which the price level (meaning a broad\nmeasure of the price of goods and services purchased by consumers) is stable creates the conditions needed\nfor interest rates to settle at moderate levels. For a discussion, see Mishkin (2007). Quoted text from the\nFederal Reserve Act is in 12 U.S.C. § 225a (2000),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/section2a.htm.\n\n- 5 -\nOur existing monetary policy strategy is laid out in the Committee’s Statement on\nLonger-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.11 First adopted in January 2012, the\nstatement indicates that the Committee seeks to mitigate deviations of inflation from\n2 percent and deviations of employment from assessments of its maximum level. In\ndoing so, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) recognizes that these\nassessments of maximum employment are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision.\nAs a practical matter, our current strategy shares many elements with the policy\nframework known as “flexible inflation targeting.”12 However, the Fed’s mandate is\nmuch more explicit about the role of employment than that of most flexible inflation-\ntargeting central banks, and our statement reflects this by stating that when the two sides\nof the mandate are in conflict, neither one takes precedence over the other.\nThe review of our current framework is wide ranging, and we are not prejudging\nwhere it will take us, but events of the past decade highlight three broad questions that we\nwill seek to answer with our review.\nThree Questions\nThe first question is, “Can the Federal Reserve best meet its statutory objectives\nwith its existing monetary policy strategy, or should it consider strategies that aim to\nreverse past misses of the inflation objective?”\nUnder our current approach as well as the approaches of many central banks\naround the world, persistent inflation shortfalls of the target are treated as “bygones.”\nCentral banks are generally believed to have effective tools for preventing persistent\n11 The statement is available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals.pdf.\n12 For a discussion of this terminology and references, see English, López-Salido, and Tetlow (2015) and\nClinton and others (2015).\n\n- 6 -\ninflation overshoots, but the ELB on interest rates makes persistent undershoots more of a\nchallenge. Persistent inflation shortfalls carry the risk that longer-term inflation\nexpectations become anchored below the stated inflation goal.13\nIn part because of that concern, some economists have advocated “makeup”\nstrategies under which policymakers seek to undo past inflation deviations from target.\nThese strategies include targeting average inflation and price-level targeting, in which\npolicymakers seek to stabilize the price level around a constant growth path.14 Other\nmakeup strategies seek to reverse shortfalls in policy accommodation at the ELB by\nkeeping the policy rate lower for longer than otherwise would be the case.15 In many\nmodels that incorporate the ELB, these makeup strategies lead to better average\nperformance on both legs of the dual mandate.16\n13 These risks could be exacerbated if households and businesses expect monetary policy to be\ninsufficiently accommodative because of proximity to the ELB. For related discussions, see Reifschneider\nand Williams (2000); Adam and Billi (2007); Nakov (2008); and Hills, Nakata, and Schmidt (2016).\n14 Eggertsson and Woodford (2003) provide an early discussion of how optimal monetary policy at the ELB\nentails a commitment to reflate the price level during the subsequent economic expansion. Nessén and\nVestin (2005) discuss the relationship between average inflation targeting and price-level targeting. There\nis a dearth of empirical evidence on strategies seeking to make up for inflation deviations. Central banks\nthat pursue an inflation goal generally seek to achieve a specific rate of inflation by some time horizon—\ntypically a couple of years ahead or over the “medium run”—without regard to past inflation deviations.\nOne exception is the Reserve Bank of Australia, whose inflation goal is specified as a range of\n“2–3 per cent, on average, over the medium term” and thus might embed some notion of history\ndependence. However, Ruge-Murcia (2014) argues that the drift in the price level in Australia is\ncomparable with the drifts observed in economies with purely forward-looking specification of the inflation\ngoal. The only known historical example of price-level targeting occurred in Sweden from 1931 to 1933\nwhen the country abandoned the gold standard and attempted instead to maintain its price level. The\ntemporary adoption of price-level targeting is credited with helping Sweden avoid deflation, an outcome\nthat contrasted with that in countries that stayed on the gold standard. See Berg and Jonung (1999).\nSee Bernanke (2017) for a discussion of a temporary price-level targeting strategy. See Hebden and\nLópez-Salido (2018) for a quantitative assessment of that and other strategies. See also Kiley and Roberts\n(2017) for a strategy in which policymakers aim for inflation higher than 2 percent during economic\nexpansions to compensate for below-target realizations of inflation during economic downturns.\n15 See Reifschneider and Williams (2000) for a strategy in which a central bank following a Taylor rule\nmakes up for shortfalls in policy accommodation during ELB episodes by subsequently keeping the policy\nrate lower than otherwise. The box “Complexities of Monetary Policy Rules” in the Board’s July 2018\nMonetary Policy Report contains an application of such a modified rule; see Board of Governors (2018,\npp. 37–41).\n16 See English, López-Salido, and Tetlow (2015) for applications of flexible price-level targeting and\nnominal income-targeting strategies to a quantitative model of the U.S. economy.\n\n- 7 -\nThe success of makeup strategies relies on households and firms believing in\nadvance that the makeup will, in fact, be delivered when the time comes—for example,\nthat a persistent inflation shortfall will be met by future inflation above 2 percent. As is\nwell known from the research literature, makeup strategies, in general, are not time\nconsistent because when the time comes to push inflation above 2 percent, conditions at\nthat time will not justify that action. Thus, one of the most important questions we seek\nto answer in our review is whether the Fed could, in practice, attain the benefits of\nmakeup strategies that are possible in theoretical models.\nThe next question the review is considering is, “Are existing monetary policy\ntools adequate to achieve and maintain maximum employment and price stability, or\nshould the toolkit be expanded? And, if so, how?” The FOMC’s primary monetary\npolicy tool is its target range for the federal funds rate. In December 2008, the FOMC\ncut that target to just above zero in response to financial turmoil and deteriorating\neconomic conditions. Because the U.S. economy required additional support after the\nELB was reached, the FOMC deployed two additional tools in the years following the\ncrisis: balance sheet policies and forward guidance about the likely path of the federal\nfunds rate.17\nIn addition to assessing the efficacy of these existing tools, the review is\nexamining additional tools for easing policy when the ELB is binding. During the crisis\nand its aftermath, the Federal Reserve considered some of the tools deployed by other\n17 As an illustration of the shortfall in policy support created by a binding ELB during the Global Financial\nCrisis, the simple policy rules considered in a January 2017 speech by then-Chair Janet Yellen prescribed\nsetting the federal funds rate between negative 1-1/2 and negative 9 percent; see Yellen (2017). In addition\nto using these two additional monetary policy tools, the Federal Reserve implemented a number of other\nmeasures to stabilize the financial system, increase household and business confidence, and more generally\nsupport the economic recovery. These supplementary measures included the setting up of several credit\nfacilities and the introduction of stress tests for systemically important financial institutions.\n\n- 8 -\ncentral banks but ultimately found them wanting in the U.S. context. But the review is\nreassessing the case for these and other tools in light of more recent experience in other\ncountries.\nThe third question the review is considering is, “How can the FOMC’s\ncommunication of its policy framework and implementation be improved?” Our\ncommunication practices have evolved considerably since 1994, when the Federal\nReserve released the first statement after an FOMC meeting. Over the past decade or so,\nthe FOMC has enhanced its communication both to promote public understanding of its\npolicy goals, strategy, and actions and to foster democratic accountability. These\nenhancements include the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy\nStrategy; postmeeting press conferences; various statements about the principles and\nstrategy guiding the Committee’s normalization of monetary policy following the\nfinancial crisis; and quarterly summaries of individual FOMC participants’ economic\nprojections, assessments about the appropriate path of the federal funds rate, and\njudgments of the uncertainty and balance of risks around their projections.18\nAs part of the review, we are assessing the Committee’s current and past\ncommunications and additional forms of communication that could be helpful. For\nexample, there might be ways to improve communication about the coordination of\npolicy tools or the interplay between monetary policy and financial stability.\n18 Starting in 1979, the Federal Reserve published a summary of individual economic projections from\nvarious Board members, FOMC members, or FOMC participants in the semiannual Monetary Policy\nReport. With the introduction of the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) in 2007, the FOMC\nincreased the frequency of the releases of policymaker projections, expanded the set of economic variables\nincluded, and extended the forecast horizon. Because the SEP includes individual contributions of\nprojections and assessments from all FOMC participants, it captures a broader range of views than those of\nFOMC members. For a discussion and data, see Bernanke (2007) and Romer (2010).\n\n- 9 -\nActivities and Timeline for the Review\nLet me turn now to our review process itself.19 An important piece of this review\nhas been a series of 14 Fed Listens events, hosted by the Board and the Reserve Banks\nfrom late February until mid-October. We heard from a broad range of interested\nindividuals and groups, including business and labor leaders, community development\nprofessionals, and academics. At a research conference at the Federal Reserve Bank of\nChicago in early June, we heard from prominent academic economists as well as national\nand community leaders. Our Fed Listens events have provided us with a valuable\nperspective on the labor market that could not otherwise be gleaned from aggregate\nstatistics; these events have also offered insights into how the monetary levers we pull\nand push affect communities, credit availability, and small businesses.\nLast summer, the FOMC began to assess what we have learned at the Fed Listens\nevents and to receive briefings from System staff on topics relevant to the review.20 At\nour July meeting, FOMC participants agreed that our current framework for monetary\npolicy has served the Committee and the U.S. economy well over the past decade.\nFOMC participants noted that the Committee’s experience with forward guidance and\nasset purchases has improved its understanding of how these tools operate. As a result,\nthe Committee could proceed more confidently in using these tools in the future if\neconomic circumstances warranted. However, overall, we judged that forward guidance\nand balance sheet tools, while helpful, did not eliminate the risk of returning to the ELB.\n19 Information about the review and the events associated with it are available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review-of-monetary-policy-strategy-tools-and-\ncommunications.htm.\n20 See Board of Governors (2019).\n\n- 10 -\nAt our September meeting, we discussed makeup strategies in the context of a\nlower neutral policy interest rate, a reduction in conventional policy space, and a higher\nlikelihood that future economic downturns will involve a return to the ELB. We\ngenerally agreed that our current monetary policy framework is flexible enough to allow\nthe Committee to choose the policy actions that best support our dual-mandate objectives\nin a wide variety of economic circumstances.\nOur discussions will continue at future meetings. In particular, we have not yet\nbegun to consider potential changes to communication practices, including the\nCommittee’s consensus Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.\nThe statement has helped articulate and clarify the Federal Reserve’s approach to\nmonetary policy, and we have agreed that any changes we might make to our strategy\nwould likely call for some modification of this consensus statement.\nWe will continue to report on our discussions in the minutes of our meetings and\nshare our conclusions when we finish the review, likely around the middle of next year.\nConcluding Thoughts\nThe economy is constantly evolving, bringing with it new policy challenges. So it\nmakes sense for us to remain open minded as we assess current practices and consider\nideas that could potentially enhance our ability to deliver on the goals the Congress has\nassigned us. For this reason, my colleagues and I do not want to preempt or to predict\nour ultimate findings. What I can say is that any refinements or more material changes to\nour framework that we might make will be aimed solely at enhancing our ability to\nachieve and sustain our dual-mandate objectives in the world we live in today.\n\n- 11 -\nThank you very much for your time and attention.

Using a standard two country DSGE\nmodel, we derive a structural decomposition in which the nominal exchange rate is a function of\nthe expected present value of future neutral real interest rate differentials plus a business cycle\nfactor and a PPP factor. Country specific “r*” shocks in general require optimal monetary policy\nto pass these through to the policy rate, but such shocks will also have exchange rate\nimplications, with an expected decline in the path of the real neutral policy rate reflected in a\ndepreciation of the nominal exchange rate. We document a novel empirical regularity between\nthe equilibrium error in the VECM representation of the empirical Holston Laubach Williams\n(2017) four country r* model and the value of the nominal trade weighted dolla r. In fact, the\ncorrelation between the dollar and the 12 quarter lag of the HLW equilibrium error is estimated to\nbe 0.7. Global shocks to r* under optimal policy require no exchange rate adjustment because\npassing though r* shocks to policy rates ‘does all the work’ of maintaining global equilibrium.\nWe also study a richer model with international spill overs so that in theory there can be gains to\ninternational policy cooperation. In this richer model we obtain a similar decomposition for the\nnominal exchange rate, but with the added feature tha t r* in each country is a function global\nproductivity and business cycle factors even if these factors are themselves independent across\ncountries. We argue that in practice, there could well be significant costs to central bank\ncommunication and credibility under a regime of formal policy cooperation, but that ga ins to\npolicy coordination could be substantial given that r*’s are unobserved but are correlated across\ncountries.\nKeywords: Exchange rate, monetary policy, policy coordination\nJEL Codes: E4, F31, F33\n*Corresponding author: Richard Clarida, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 20 Street and\nConstitution Avenue, Washington, DC 20551.

Introduction\nOver the past 25 years, best practice monetary policy has been implemented with reference to interest\nrate feedback rules that include as inputs estimates of potential output and the real policy rate ‐ consistent with\nprice stability. Before the global financial crisis and reflecting the justly deserved influence of Taylor (1993), it\nwas common in policy simulations (Henderson and McKibbin (1993)) and in empirical work (Clarida, Gali,\nGertler (1998;2000)) to make the simplifying assumption that r* is constant. However, it has long been\nappreciated (Wicksell (1898); Friedman (1968)) that r* can be time varying and in particular, the theoretical\nanalysis of monetary policy rules in Woodford (2003) and Clarida, Gali, Gertler (1999; 2002) ‐ among many\nothers ‐ has emphasized that shocks to r* should be reflected in policy rates set by central banks seeking to keep\nthe economy as close as possible to the benchmark of a flexible price equilibrium. Since the global financial\ncrisis, estimated and projected future declines in neutral real policy rates (Laubach and Williams (2003);\nHolston, Laubach, Williams (2017)); Hamilton, et. al. (2015)) relative to the pre‐crisis experience have become an\nimportant consideration in the conduct of monetary policy and the communication of forward guidance at the\nFed and some other major central banks (Yellen (2017); Haldane (2015)).\nThe focus of this paper is on highlighting some of the theoretical and practical implications for\nmonetary policy and foreign exchange rates that derive specifically from the presence of a global factor ‐\npredicted in theory and estimated in practice ‐ embedded in neutral real policy rates in open economies.\nAfter reviewing in Section II some of the existing empirical evidence on the presence of a global factor in neutral\npolicy rates, we present in Section III a simple two‐country model (based on Gali‐Monacelli (2005) and Clarida\n(2014)) to help illustrate several points about how shocks to neutral policy rates might impact monetary policy\nand exchange rates. We show that in this model, the short run neutral real policy rate in each country will be a\nfunction of expected productivity growth in that country, so that if there is a common factor across countries in\n2\n\nproductivity growth, there will be a factor in neutral policy rates. If countries are adjusting policy in response to\ncommon, global neutral real rate shocks, this will obviously impart a positive correlation in policy even in the\nabsence policy cooperation or coordination. As for exchange rates, we derive a novel decomposition for the\n(log) nominal exchange rate as the sum of a price level term, and business cycle term, and a term which is the\npresent value of expected future neutral real policy rate differentials, with a decline in the expected future\nneutral policy rate below its long run level associated with a depreciation of the exchange rate today. By contrast,\nin this model exchange rates do not need to adjust to the global component in neutral policy rates, realized or\nexpected. In response to a global shock, a common global decline in real policy rates can ‘do all the work’ to\ngenerate global aggregate demand in line with aggregate supply.\nThe main contribution of the paper is in Section IV, in which we study a more general specification (based\non CGG (2002)) of the two‐country model in which there are international spillovers that can lead, in theory, to\ngains to international policy cooperation. We argue however, that in practice, credible policy cooperation may\nbe difficult to implement and communicate because in this model it would bind countries to set local policy rates\nbased on an index of global inflation. Moreover, in this model with international spillovers, the neutral real policy\nrate in each country will depend on expected productivity growth in all countries (and potentially also global\nbusiness cycle factors) even if there is no common factor in country productivity growth. As a result, there may\nbe significant gains to policy coordination which are achievable in practice in the non‐cooperative equilibrium\nwhere again optimal policy can be written as a Taylor type rule.\nSection V provides some concluding remarks.\nII. A Quick Review of the Empirical Evidence\nAs the motivation for this paper is the phenomenon of a time varying global factor in neutral real\ninterest rates, it seems worthwhile at the outset to provide some evidence that these rates are time varying and\nthat they appear correlated across countries. Similar to another input to monetary policy analysis – potential\noutput ‐ the neutral real policy rate is both time varying and unobservable and thus must be inferred from data.\nLaubach and Williams (2003) and more recently Holston, Laubach, and Williams (2017) have developed and\n3\n\nimplemented a widely cited methodology for estimating neutral real policy rates. The latter paper is especially\nuseful for our purpose because it consistently applies a common LW methodology to estimate neutral real\npolicy rates in the US, UK, Canada, and Eurozone. Other papers – for example Hamilton, et al. (2015), King and\nLow (2014), Rachel and Smith (2015), IMF (2013) – provide estimates that are also consistent with the presence\nof a global factor in time varying neutral real interest rates (see also Bank of England Inflation Report August\n2018, p. 39).\nFigure 1: HLW Estimates of r*\n4\nHLW Estimates of r*\n3\n2\n1\n0\nUS r* UK r* CAN r* EUR r*\n-1\nFigure 1 displays the HLW estimates of r*t for the US, UK, Europe, and Canada as of July 2016. For all\nfour countries, estimates for recent years are well below those in the 1990s and in the years preceding the Global\nFinancial Crisis (GFC). It is also interesting to note that for all countries, in the decade or so before the GFC, the\nestimates are clustered around 2% which of course is the assumed constant value for r* in the original Taylor\nRule. Figure 2, compares the HLW estimates of the US r* with the 1 year TIPS yield 4 years forward as\ncalculated by the Federal Reserve.\n4\n\nFigure 2: HLW r* and TIPS Implied Forward\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\nUS r*\nUS TIPS 1y4y Fwd\n‐1\n‐2\nAs the HLW econometric approach uses no data on TIPS yields or forwards so, the alignment between the two\nseries is noteworthy. That said, as shown in Figure 3, there is a much looser relationship between forward real\nyields in the UK (as calculated by the Bank of England) and the HLW estimates of r* for the UK.\n5\n\nFigure 3: HLW r* and Implied Linker Forward\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\nUK r*\n‐1\nUK Linker 1y5y Fwd\n‐2\nFinally, to get a sense of the co movement among the four neutral real policy rates, we plot the\nestimated r*t for the US versus a weighted average of the r*t estimates for the other three countries, with the\nweights equal to (minus) the estimated cointegrating vector coefficients reported in HLW (2017) The difference\nbetween these two series is the equilibrium error in the VECM representation of the HLW system (since HLW\nnormalize the US coefficient in the co‐integrating vector to unity).\nFigure 4: Equilibrium Error in the HLW VECM Representation\n4.00\n3.50\nHW_r*_US\n3.00\n2.50 Equilibiurm Error in HLW VECM\n2.00\nHLW_r*_index_UK,EZ,CA\n1.50\n1.00\n0.50\n0.00\n6\n\nIII. A Simple Model of Optimal Monetary Policy and Exchange Rate Determination with r* Shocks\nWe begin with a tractable two country version of the Gali–Monacelli (2005) and Clarida (2014) DSGE\nmodel of optimal monetary policy and exchange rate determination extended to allow for global as well as\ncountry specific stocks to r*t . In this model, r* t shocks are driven by common as well as country specific shocks\nto home and foreign expected productivity growth. To focus on the main points, and without loss of generality,\nwe assume in this section the ‘foreign’ country operates always at its supply determined level of output YF t =\nAF t N F t = AF t = Y t F and that foreign monetary policy is such that the price of foreign output is constant and\nequal to 1. We also normalize the non‐supply of labor in the home and foreign country to 1. By contrast, in the\nhome country, ‘cost push’ shocks in the presence of nominal rigidities can cause output and labor demand to\ndeviate from its flexible price supply determined level of output so that Y t = AF t A t X t = Y t X t . In this model,\naggregate home productivity is the product of a common global factor AF t and a home‐country specific factor At.\nThe home ‘output gap’, denoted X t, is endogenous and will be solved for as a function of shocks and the monetary\npolicy rule. An overstrike over a variable indicates its level in a flexible price equilibrium. In the model of this\nsection, with our parameter choices, the flexible price level of output in each country is just equal to the exogenous\nlevel of productivity in that country.\nHome utility takes the form U(C\nt\n)V(N\nt\n)blnC\nH,t\n(1b)lnC\nF,t\n(1)1N\nt\n1 where Ct = (CH,t)b\n(CF,t)1‐b and N t is home labor supply and b ≥ 0.5. These preference feature an intertemporal elasticity of\nsubstitution 1/σ equal to 1 and a Cobb‐Douglass aggregator for consumption. Households maximize a discounted\nsum of expected utility subject to a sequence of budget constraints\nPcpiC Ε{M D }WN DT \nt t t t,t1 t1 t t t t t\nwhere Mt,t+1 is a nominal stochastic discount factor, W t is the money wage, D t is the distribution paid on securities\nbrought into date t, Tt is lump sum tax collection, and Г t is the distribution of profits earned by producers of\nintermediate inputs. Foreign preferences and budget constrains are symmetric.\n7\n\nUp to log linearization, an Euler equation will characterize the equilibrium relationship between the log\nconsumption index (relative to its level in a non‐stochastic steady state so that any constant rate of time preference\ndifferences out), CPI inflation, and the one period nominal interest rate R t\nc E {c }(R Ecpi )\nt t t1 t t t1\nWith our assumptions on preferences, trade will be balanced period by period (Cole Obstfeld (1991)) and goods\nmarket equilibrium will imply bAF t A t X t +(1‐b)S t AF t = AF t A t X t where St is the equilibrium terms of trade (home\ngood price of foreign good) and b ≥ ½ is the expenditure share on locally produced output. This implies St = At Xt\nor in logs s t = a t + x t so that the log of the equilibrium terms of trade is equal to the home country specific factor\nin productivity a t plus the log of the home ‘output gap’ x t. We assume the law of one price and producer currency\npricing so that the log nominal exchange rate satisfies e t = st + p t where p t is the log of the price of home output.\nTo see this note that St = Et/Pt since we assume producer currency pricing, the law of one price, and the foreign\ncurrency price of the foreign good is constant and equal to 1. We have πcpi t+1 = π t+1 +(1‐b)Δs t+1 with π t+1 = p t+1 –\np t.\nFrom balanced trade and goods market equilibrium Ct=(b)b(1‐b)1‐bAFtAtXtSb‐1t Substituting out for c t and\nusing the definition of CPI and the equilibrium condition for the terms of trade, we obtain an Euler equation in\nterms of the domestic output gap and the neutral real interest rate\n(1) x t = E t x t+1 – {R t – E t (p t+1 ‐p t ) – r* t }\nwhere r*t = Et Δ aF t+1 + Et Δ a t+1 is the ex‐ante real interest rate in the home country that maintains the home output\ngap at zero. We have rF*t = Et Δ aF t+1 period by period , πFt = 0 period by period, RFt = rF*t period by period, and YF\nt = AF t period by period. We assume that at is an auto correlated deviation of the log level of home productivity\nfrom the log level of global productivity aF t which may itself possess a unit root. Note that under this stationarity\nassumption a t + E t Σ i=1,∞ Δa t+i =0 if the unconditional mean of at is 0.\nHome firms will set prices as a markup over marginal cost – which is proportional to the real product\nwage scaled by productivity ‐ in a staggered fashion a la Calvo. With our assumption on preferences, and letting\n8\n\nδ=(1‐F)(1‐βF)/F with (1‐F) the fraction of firms that reset prices each period, inflation in the price of home goods\nwill be given by\n(2) p  p E (p  p )x u\nt t1 t t1 t t t\nwhere ut is a ‐ possibly auto correlated ‐ shock to the wage mark‐up and λ= (1+φ)δ.\nThe nominal exchange rate must be consistent with asset market equilibrium, goods market equilibrium,\nand long run purchasing power parity (which will hold in this model in expectation in the long run under our\nassumptions on productivity and preferences). A structural equation which characterizes the equilibrium\nexchange rate in terms of endogenous variables can be written as\n\n(3) e  p x E (r* rF*)\nt t t t ti ti\ni0\nwhere r t * ‐ rF* t = E t Δ a t+1 is the neutral real rate differential between the home country and the foreign country .\nThus the log nominal exchange rate can be decomposed into the sum of a PPP component, a business cycle\ncomponent, and a (forward looking) r* component. Equivalently, persistent but transitory deviations from PPP are\nthe sum of a business cycle component and an r* component. The nominal exchange rate today will reflect the entire\nexpected future time path of the country specific component in the neutral real interest rate but in equilibrium\ndoes not adjust to the global component in the neutral policy rate. In particular, if today the neutral real rate at home\nis expected in the future to lie below the neutral real rate abroad, the nominal exchange rate today must weaken\nrelative to domestic prices given the state of the business cycle x t. Figure 5 depicts the empirical relationship\nbetween the nominal trade weighted dollar and the equilibrium error calculated using the parameters reported\nin HLW (2017) and shown in Figure 4. As shown in Figure 6, the equilibrium error appears to lead the trade\nweighted dollar by about 12 quarters. The simple correlation between the TW Dollar and the VECM error\nlagged 12 quarters is 0.70.\n9\n\nFigure 5: US TWD vs. HLW Vecm Error\n1.00 115\n0.80 US TWD 110\n0.60 105\n0.40 100\n0.20 95\n0.00 90\n‐0.20 85\n‐0.40 80\nHLW Equilibium Error\n‐0.60 75\n‐0.80 70\n‐1.00 65\nFigure 6: US TWD vs. HLW Vecm Error lead by 12 quarters\n1.00 115\n0.80 110\n0.60 105\nUS TWD\n0.40 100\n0.20 95\n0.00 90\n‐0.20 85\n‐0.40 80\nVECM Equilibrium Error lead by 12 q\n‐0.60 75\n‐0.80 70\n‐1.00 65\nNotice that structural exchange rate equation (3) holds in any equilibrium regardless of how the rest of\nthe model is closed. To close the model, we need to take a stand on monetary policy and the central bank\nobjective function so we can pin down domestic inflation and the output gap. There are two ways to do this.\n10\n\nWe can just assume that the objective function is quadratic in inflation and the output gap with an arbitrary\nrelative weight α on stabilizing home output at its natural level aFt + at. Or, as was derived in Clarida, Gali and\nGertler (2002) and Gali Monacelli (2005), we can follow Woodford (2003) and solve for α – and thus the optimal\npolicy rule ‐ as a function of deep parameters. So for a policymaker who wants to maximize an objective\n\nfunction proportional to WH E t[2x2] subject to the Philipps curve and the Euler and taking Et\n0 t t\nt0\n\nπt+1 as given, the first order condition will be x\nt\n\n\n\nt\nwhich is of the same form as in Clarida, Gali and\nGertler (1999). Since under optimal policy the output gap will be linear in domestic inflation, the equilibrium\nrate of inflation under optimal policy will satisfy  E{ }(2/)u . Solving forward and assuming\nt t t1 t t\nu u we obtain\nt t1 t\nπ\nt\n= (1‐βρ + λ2/α)‐1u\nt\nor πt = ψut. The optimal policy rule given α is obtained by substituting the first order condition into the Euler\nequation and using equilibriums dynamics for inflation. The system can be written as follows:\n (1)\nR r*1 E \nt t      t t1\n(4) RF  rF*\nt t\n \ne  p ( )u E (r* rF*)\nt t1  t t ti ti\ni0\nwith r*t = Et Δ aFt + Et Δ at , rF*t = Et Δ aFt and Etπt+1 = ρψut and p t‐1 = Σ i=1,∞ ψu t‐i. Thus optimal policy in the open\neconomy can be written as a forward looking Taylor rule with a time varying neutral real interest rate. The time\nvarying neutral real interest rate is, in turn, the sum of a global component and a country specific component.\nAlso notice that above we focus on an equilibrium with inflation proportional to the exogenous cost push shock\nut. As is well known, there are other equilibria in this class of DSGE models which feature speculative\n11\n\nhyperinflation, and this would be true even if we were to append a standard utility of real balances into the\nobjective function (see for example Kocherlakota and Phelan (1999) for an insightful discussion of this issue).\nNotice in this set up, under optimal monetary policy, there is a clean distinction between impact of\nneutral rate shocks (driven by forecastable changes in productivity growth) and cost push shocks. Under\noptimal policy neutral rate shocks should be reflected one for one in policy rates and will result in equilibrium\nadjustments in nominal exchange rate. These adjustments in policy rates and exchange rate are sufficient to\nkeep the economy at its flexible price equilibrium even in the presence of nominal rigidities. Cost push shocks,\nby contrast, create a tradeoff between stabilizing output and inflation. Under optimal policy, the central bank\nfollows a forward looking Taylor rule and raises the nominal interest rate by more than the rise in expected\ninflation. This optimal policy depresses output below the flexible price level so as to stabilize expected inflation.\nThe optimal policy will also have implications for the nominal exchange which will be discussed below. Note\nthat cost push shocks have no effect on the neutral policy rate unless those shocks are themselves correlated\nwith productivity shocks.\nThese three equations illustrate several points about neutral real rate shocks in open economies under\nflexible exchange rates that are worth noting.\n1. The neutral real policy rate in the open economy will in general be a function of global as well local factors\nsuch as the rate of current and expected future potential growth. If countries are adjusting policy in\nresponse to common, global neutral real rate shocks, this will obviously impart a positive correlation in\npolicy even in the absence policy coordination or cooperation.\n2. In this model with the parameter assumption we have made on the intertemporal elasticity of\nsubstitution, there is no gain to policy cooperation so that the Nash best response policy rules which here\ntake the form of Taylor type rules – which lead to the maximum level global welfare that can be obtained\nunder discretion.\n12\n\n3. The exchange rate is an asset price that will reflect, in part, expectations of the future time path of the country\nspecific component of the neutral policy rate, with a decline in the expected future neutral policy rate below\nits long run level associated with a depreciation of the exchange rate today.\n4. However, exchange rate depreciation in the face of a persistent country specific r* shock is not a ‘beggar\nthy neighbor’ policy in either motive or realization. In this simple model, trade is balanced period by\nperiod and so the exchange rate adjustment that occurs is required to maintain goods market equilibrium\nwith balanced trade and not to generate a trade surplus.\n5. Exchange rate adjustment to a persistent country specific r* shock is required because expectations that\nfuture home neutral rates will remain below neutral rates in the rest of the world are coincident with\nexpectations that home productivity and output are and will remain elevated relative to their long run\nlevels, and this elevated supply requires a weaker nominal exchange rate and a worsening terms of\ntrade as well as a lower neutral policy rate to generate the level and allocation of global aggregate\ndemand to clear the home and world goods market. In symbols ‐ Et Σi=1,∞rH*t = at\n6. By contrast, at least under optimal policy, exchange rates do not need to adjust to the global component in\nneutral policy rates, realized or expected. In response to a global shock, a common global decline in real\npolicy rates can ‘do all the work’ to generate global aggregate demand in line with aggregate supply;\n7. This may look like, but is not a globally inefficient ‘currency war’ defined as a ‘race to the bottom’ in\npolicy rates as countries seek to avoid home currency appreciation as other countries cut interest rates.\nAn interesting feature of these models which finds a great deal of empirical support and is discussed\nextensively in CGG (2002); Clarida Waldman (2008); Krugman Obstfeld Melitz (9th edition) ; and Clarida (2014) is\nthe ‘bad news good news’ result that, with an inflation targeting central bank, a shock that pushes inflation above\ntarget can trigger the expectation of a policy rate path that results in an appreciation of the nominal exchange\nrate today even though in the long run the exchange rate must (in expectation) depreciate to return to PPP. In\nour model, bad news for inflation resulting from a positive cost push shock to ut will appreciate the nominal\n13\n\nexchange rate today if α – the welfare weight on output stabilization – is less than λ – the slope of the Philipps\ncurve.\n \n(5) e  p ( )u E (r* rF*)\nt t1  t t ti ti\ni0\nA ‘cost push’ shock ut will increase domestic inflation and under optimal policy induce the central bank to raise\nthe nominal interest rate by more than expected inflation. The rise in the ex‐ante real interest rate will cause st to\nfall and this, along with the rise in the real interest rate itself, will reduce demand for home output. In the ‘bad\nnews good news’ case the equilibrium decline in st is larger in absolute value than is the equilibrium rise in\ninflation, and this can only be accomplished via an appreciation of the nominal exchange rate More broadly, the\nequilibrium nominal exchange rate in this model must possess a unit root even though shocks are stationary and our\nCole‐Obstfeld equilibrium replicates the complete market allocation. The nominal exchange rate must possess a\nunit root because time consistent monetary policy cannot deliver a stationary price level, only a stationary rate of inflation\n(Clarida, Gali and Gertler (2002); Woodford (2003)). The unit root in the nominal exchange rate is required to\nproduce a stationary equilibrium terms of trade given that optimal monetary policy produces unit root in the\nprice level.\nIV. Policy Correlation, Gains from Policy Coordination, but Potential Pitfalls from Policy Cooperation\nAlthough these are absent in the simple model of Section III, in general there may be international\nspillovers to monetary policy that are not fully incorporated in Taylor ‐ type rules that feedback solely on\ndomestic macroeconomic variables. If so, there can in theory be gains to monetary policy cooperation. By\ncooperation, we mean that home and foreign central banks set policies that maximize world welfare, even if\neach central bank would like to run a different policy taking the other central bank’s policy as given as in a Nash\nequilibrium. However, while we observe that national monetary policies are often correlated (eras of global\nmonetary easing; global rate hike cycles), they also appear sometimes to be coordinated (after all, what else are\ncentral bankers doing at all those G7 , G20, IMF, and Basel meetings?) , but rarely (if ever) do major central\nbanks respect a binding commitment to pursue cooperative policies , policies that would differ from non‐\n14\n\ncooperative policies aimed solely at satisfying their objectives for domestic inflation and employment. It has\nlong been well appreciated (Taylor (1982)) that in small or large scale open economy macro models, the\ncalibrated gains to international monetary policy cooperation (see for example, Obstfeld and Rogoff (2002)) are\nfound to be modest relative to the welfare achieved under a Nash equilibrium in which each country runs a\nsensible policy taking as given the policy of the other countries. In this section, we will make a somewhat\ndifferent and less often discussed case against global monetary policy cooperation even in a world of r* shocks.\nNamely, that in practice, adopting it – or succumbing to it! ‐ could plausibly erode central bank credibility and\npublic support for sound, rules based policies. According to this view, the all ‐ in cost to a regime of policy\ncooperation could swamp the theoretical benefits, and if so, we should not bemoan the absence of formal\nmonetary policy cooperation, we should celebrate it!\nHowever, and perhaps especially in a world in which there is a common global component in neutral\nreal policy rates across countries, international monetary policy coordination – defined to include the sharing of\ninformation and analysis regarding estimates of the unobservable inputs to policy rules such as the equilibrium\nreal rate of interest and potential output as well as the considerations that would govern the timing and\ntrajectory of a baseline policy path as well as trigger deviations from such a path – can enhance the design and\neffectiveness of baseline policy rules. We will give examples below. But while international monetary policy\ncoordination may enhance the efficiency of a policy rule framework if it is in place, there are reasons to doubt\nthat in practice there are likely to be additional material, reliable, and robust gains that would flow from a\nformal regime of binding monetary policy cooperation, at least among major G7 economies and even including a\nnumber of emerging economies with flexible exchange rates and relatively open capital accounts. In such a\nregime, national monetary policies in each country are constrained to be set so as to jointly maximize world\nwelfare. In these models, as in the earlier literature they build on, there are externalities to monetary policy that\ncreate such theoretical gains to cooperation. However, as Clarida, Gali, and Gertler (2002) and Engel (2009)\nillustrate in ‘new Keynesian’ models , and as we review below, to achieve the theoretical gains to international\nmonetary policy cooperation, policy rates in each country must be set with reference to an index of inflation\n15\n\ndeviations from target in both the home and the foreign countries. In words, whereas optimal policy in the absence\nof cooperation can be implemented with a policy rule that reacts to domestic inflation, output gaps, and the\nappropriately defined equilibrium – or neutral – real interest rate, a global welfare increasing policy must bind\ncentral banks to policy rules that react to foreign as well as domestic inflation, policy rules that they would not\nchose were they not bound.\nIn practice, there could be another problem with policy cooperation that is absent from most theoretical\ndiscussions. Simply stated, the problem is the threat to the credibility of the central bank, the challenges to\ncentral bank communication, and the resulting potential loss of support for its policy actions from the public\nwhen the policy choices required by cooperation react not only to home inflation but also to deviations of\nforeign inflation from target. For example, if home inflation is above target but foreign inflation is below target,\nthe optimal policy rule under cooperation calls for the home (real) policy rate to be lower – more\naccommodative – than it would be in the absence of cooperation (Clarida, Gali, Gertler (2002)) . In theoretical\nmodels, the commitment to the inflation target is just assumed to be perfect and credible, but in practice\ncredibility appears to be a function of central bank communication and as well the policies actually\nimplemented to push inflation back to target. In practice, central banks could have a hard time maintaining\ncredibility as well as communicating a policy that kept home real interest rates low – or in extreme cases\nnegative ‐ not because home inflation is too low, but because foreign inflation is too low! Or imagine the\nopposite case, with home inflation below target when foreign inflation is above target. In this case, the optimal\npolicy rule under cooperation calls for the home (real) policy rate to be higher – less accommodative – than it\nwould be in the absence of cooperation, not because home inflation is too high, but because foreign inflation is!\nWhile, perhaps for these reasons, we do not have many confirmed sightings of genuine monetary policy\ncooperation, we do perhaps observe rather more examples of as policy coordination. The CGG (2002) model –\nwhich is a generalization of the model of Section III ‐ provides an illustration of the value of policy coordination\nin the non‐cooperative Nash equilibrium in a symmetric two country model. We now allow for σ > 1 (which is\nconsistent with estimates often reported in the empirical macro literature) but set b = ½ so as to focus on the\n16\n\ntractable symmetric case. Under these conditions the Cole Obstfeld result will still hold and trade will be\nbalanced period by period.

Ceteris paribus,\nit is again the country specific component of the home neutral real rate that is reflected in equilibrium nominal\nexchange rate, with a decline in the neutral rate inducing a depreciation of the nominal exchange rate.\nIn the simple model of Section III, the neutral real rate in each country is solely a function of that\ncountry’s expected rate of potential output growth. However, when there are cross country spillovers, this will\n17\n\nnot be the case and instead, the neutral real rate in each country will be in equilibrium be a function home and\nforeign productivity growth as well as the home and foreign business cycle factors xt and xFt. To see this, begin with the\nequations for flexible price output at home abroad derived in CGG (2002):\n1 (1) (1)\ny ( )1[(1)(a aF) yF  xF]\nt 2 t t 2 t 2 t\n(11)\ny F ( 1 )1[(1)aF  (1) y  (1) x ]\nt 2 t 2 t 2 t\nThese two linear equations can be solved for y t and y t F each as a function of a t ,aF t ,x t, xF t . It follows that home\nand foreign neutral real rates share common global general equilibrium factors per below even if home and\nforeign productivity are independent.\n(1) (1)\nr\nt\n* \n2\nE\nt\ny\nt1\n(a\nt1\n,a\nt\nF\n1\n,x\nt1\n,x\nt\nF\n1\n)\n2\nE\nt\ny\nt\nF\n1\n(a\nt1\n,a\nt\nF\n1\n,x\nt1\n,x\nt\nF\n1\n)\n(12)\nr\nt\nF*  (\n2\n1) E\nt\ny\nt\nF\n1\n(a\nt1\n,a\nt\nF\n1\n,x\nt1\n,x\nt\nF\n1\n) (\n2\n1) E\nt\ny\nt1\n(a\nt1\n,a\nt\nF\n1\n,x\nt1\n,x\nt\nF\n1\n)\nwhich reduce to r* t = E t Δ aF t + E t Δ a t and rF* t = E t Δ aF t in the σ = 1 case. Letting t  y t  y t F denote\nthe flexible price output differential we have  (a ,x ,xF)so that the flexible price output differential\nt t t\nis in equilibrium a function of relative home productivity – as in the simpler model of Section III – as well\nas the home and foreign output gaps. In sum, regardless of how we close the model we must have\n(1) \ne  p  pF  (x  xF)E (r* rF*)\nt t t 2 t t t ti ti\ni0\nwith\n(1)\n(13) r* rF*  E (a ,x ,xF ) E (xF x )\nt t t t1 t1 t1 2 t t1 t1\nWe close the model with an policy rule that is the optimal best response taking the other\ncountry’s output as given. In the ‘home’ country CGG (2002) show that in the home country the optimal\n18\n\nNash monetary policy rule can be written as a forward looking Taylor rule\n (1)1\n*\n(14) R t  r t   1  2    E t  t1\nAnd similarly in the foreign country\n (1)1\n(15) RF\nt\nR\nt\nrF*\nt\n\n\n1\n 2 \n\n\nE\nt\nF\nt1\nUnder the optimal Nash monetary policies we still have\n \nx\nt\n\n\n\nt\nand xF\nt\n\n\nF\nt\nAnd so under optimal policy as before π t = (1‐βρ + λ2/α)‐1u t and πF t = (1‐βρ + λ2/α)‐1uF t .\nIn this more general model, the neutral real interest rate in each country will be a linear function of\nhome and foreign productivity as well as the cost push shocks, and this will be true even if home and foreign\nproductivity are independent (see equation block (12)). Thus, even if there is no global component to productivity\nthere will in general equilibrium be a global component to the neutral real interest rate because of the cross country\nspillovers that arise when σ is not equal to 1. We illustrate this with a numerical example. Let σ = 3 and φ = 1\nand solve equation block (11 ) for home and foreign flexible price output for the case in which home\nproductivity is independent of foreign productivity (so that log productivity at home is equal to at instead of at\n+ aFt in equation block (11)). The solutions are\n(16) y  6 a  1 x  2 aF  3 xF and y F  6 aF  1 xF  2 a  3 x\nt 8 t 8 t 8 t 8 t t 8 t 8 t 8 t 8 t\nwhich imply that relative flexible price output is simply\n1\n(17) y  yF a aF  (x  xf )\nt t t t 2 t t\nSo from equation (12) we have for these parameters\n6 1 2 3 6 9 2 3\nr* 2E ( a  x  aF  xF )E ( aF  xF  a  x )\nt t 8 t1 8 t1 8 t1 8 t1 t 8 t1 8 t1 8 t1 8 t1\nwhich simplifies to\n19\n\n10 2 3 1\n(18) r*  a  aF  xF  x\nt 8 t1 8 t1 8 t1 8 t1\nand symmetrically for the foreign country. So in general, even if home and foreign productivity are\nuncorrelated, the neutral real rate in each country will be a function of both home and foreign productivity.\nThe best Nash policy in this two‐country model is a Taylor type rule for setting the policy rate as a\nfunction of expected home inflation and time varying equilibrium home real interest rate which is function of\nexpected home and foreign productivity growth as well as the expected change in home and foreign output\ngaps. Thus, to the extent the foreign central bank has some comparative advantage in nowcasting (in the\nrigorous sense of Giannone, Reichlin, and Small (2008)) or forecasting foreign productivity growth and business\ncycle factors, sharing this information or even pooling these nowcasts with the home central bank could\nimprove its estimate of the home equilibrium real interest rate and thus the effectiveness of its policy rule in\nmeeting its domestic objectives. While in the simple models of Section III and IV the global drivers of the r*’s\nare assumed to be observed and with known values of the parameters mapping them to neutral policy rates, in\npractice this is not the case and coordination in such signal extraction efforts could be very valuable.\nAs discussed above, to achieve the theoretical gains from monetary policy cooperation in these models\nit no longer suffices for the policymaker to follow an instrument rule based solely on domestic inflation and the\nneutral real interest rate. Instead, under cooperation the home central bank must set the policy rate as a\nfunction of home and foreign variables. In its simplest form, this rule can be written as\n (1)1 1 (1)1\n(16) R t  r* t   1  2    E t  t1  12    2    E t F t1\nIn sum, not only do the quantitative gains from time inconsistent cooperative monetary policy rules appear to\nbe modest, but in addition the policy rules required to implement the cooperative outcome could well be\ndifficult to communicate and to adhere to without sacrificing the credibility of the inflation target and the policy\nregime itself.\n20\n\nYet another challenge to implementing in practice the sort of formal binding cooperative equilibrium\nmodeled above is related to the Orphanides (2004) critique of real time information the requirements required to\nimplement some rules based policies. For example, the inputs to equation (16) above include real time output\ngaps in both (all) countries, expected productivity growth in both countries, and the correct measure of inflation\nin each country. In practice these inputs are unobservable and time varying and must be inferred from data.\nV. Concluding Remarks\nWe have reviewed some simple examples based on rigorous models which can i) generate monetary\npolicy correlation – via the global factor present in each country’s equilibrium real interest rate; ii) rationalize\nthe alleged benefits to monetary policy coordination ; but iii) provide some intuition for why binding monetary\npolicy cooperation is rare in practice if not in academic papers. The appeal of these models is that they are\ntractable and admit intuitive closed form solutions. That said, the models make assumptions about pricing\n(producer versus local), and preferences (Cobb‐Douglass and CES that satisfy the Cole‐Obstfeld balanced trade\nconditions) that while common in the literature, are clearly special cases. Further research on the generality of\nthe results in this paper is warranted. We have focused on the global factor in neutral real policy rates and\nshown how a plausible source of fluctuations in these rates (productivity growth with a global as well as\ncountry specific component) also can trigger adjustment in the nominal exchange rates. While we have\nassumed that productivity levels in each are stationary, all the results of this paper go through with non\nstationary productivity if home and foreign productivity are cointegrated.\nIn the models of this paper, a country specific shock that pushes the expected path of the home r*t below\nthe foreign r*t requires a depreciation of the home nominal exchange rate to maintain global equilibrium even\nwith balanced trade. By contrast, a common global shock that depresses home and foreign neutral real policy\nrates equally will have no exchange rate implications. While these models are quite simple and in particular\nomit important potential additional drivers of neutral real policy rates – such as asset market imperfections and\ninstitutional and individual desires to hold safe assets – they are rich enough to shed light on the importance of\nglobal general equilibrium considerations in accounting for and inferring shifts in country neutral policy rates.\n21\n\nOne topic for future research is modeling medium and long horizon forecastable changes in neutral real policy\nrates as are estimated by HLW. The neutral real rates that we solve for in the models of Sections III and IV are\nthe rates consistent with the stochastic flexible prices equilibrium in these workhorse DSGE models and may be\nthought of a ‘short run’ r*’s. In the models of Section III and IV, the unconditional mean of these home and\nforeign r*’s are constant and equal. A worthwhile extension beyond the scope of this paper would be to\nintroduce non stationary dynamics and or segmented trends (Rappoport and Rechlin (1989)) into relative\nproductivity levels which would allow for a tighter linkage between the HLW econometric methodology and\nthe theoretical modeling of time variation in r*.\n22\n\nFigure Legends\nFigure 1: HLW Estimates of r*\nFigure 2: HLW r* and TIPS Implied Forward\nFigure 3: HLW r* and Implied Linker Forward\nFigure 4:Equilbrium Error in the HLW VECM Representation\nFigure 5: US TWD vs. HLW Vecm Error\nFigure 6: US TWD vs. HLW Vecm Error lead by 12 quarters\n23\n\nReferences\nBank of England Inflation Report, 2018 (August): 39\nCalvo, G., “Staggered Prices in a Utility‐Maximizing Framework,ʺ Journal of Monetary Economics 12: 383‐398\n(1983).\nClarida, Richard H. ʺMonetary policy in open economies: Practical perspectives for pragmatic central\nbankers.ʺ Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control 49 (2014): 21‐30.\nClarida, R., J Gali, and Gertler, “ Monetary Policy Rules in Practice: Some International Evidence,” European\nEconomic Review, (1998).\n______________, “The Science of Monetary Policy,” Journal of Economic Perspectives, (1999).\n______________, “A Simple Framework for International Monetary Policy Analysis,ʺ Journal of Monetary\nEconomics 49: 879‐904 (2002).\nClarida, R and D Waldman, “Is Bad News about Inflation Good News for the Exchange Rate” in John Campbell,\nEditor, Asset Prices and Monetary Policy, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2008.\nCole, H L., and M Obstfeld, “Commodity Trade and International Risk Sharing: How Much Do Financial\nMarkets Matter?ʺ Journal of Monetary Economics 28: 3‐24 (1991).\nCook, David, and Michael B.

Clarida\nVice Chair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“The Bank of Finland Conference on\nMonetary Policy and Future of EMU [Economic and Monetary Union]”\nHelsinki, Finland\nJuly 1, 2019\n\nI am delighted to be in Helsinki at this important conference on monetary policy\nand the future of Europe’s monetary union.1 Today I would like to discuss the broad\nreview of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy framework that my fellow policymakers\nand I are undertaking this year. We are examining the policy strategy, tools, and\ncommunication practices that we use to pursue our dual-mandate goals of maximum\nemployment and price stability. In my remarks, I will describe the motivation for and\nscope of this review and discuss some of the events that are taking place. In our review,\nwe are being transparent and open minded, and we are seeking perspectives from a broad\nrange of interested individuals and groups, including academics, other specialists, and the\npublic at large.\nMotivation for the Review\nThe fact that the Federal Reserve is conducting this review does not suggest that\nwe are dissatisfied with the existing policy framework. Indeed, we believe our existing\nframework has served us well, helping us effectively achieve our statutorily assigned\ndual-mandate goals. Nonetheless, in light of the unprecedented events of the past decade,\nwe believe it is a good time to step back and assess whether, and in what possible ways,\nwe can refine our strategy, tools, and communication practices to achieve and maintain\nthese goals as consistently and robustly as possible.2 I note that central banks in other\ncountries have conducted periodic reviews of their monetary policy frameworks, and\ntheir experience has informed the approach we are pursuing.\n1 The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of other Federal Reserve Board members or\nFederal Open Market Committee participants. I would like to thank Etienne Gagnon and Ellen Meade for\nassistance in preparing these remarks.\n2 Fuhrer and others (2018) explore the desirability of comprehensive reviews of the monetary policy\nframework. They argue that such reviews may help the Fed more effectively identify and implement\nneeded changes to its framework.\n\n- 2 -\nWith the U.S. economy operating at or close to maximum employment and price\nstability, now is an especially opportune time to conduct this review. The unemployment\nrate is near a 50-year low, and inflation is running close to our 2 percent objective. By\nconducting this review, we are ensuring that we are well positioned to continue to meet\nour statutory goals in coming years. In addition, the Federal Reserve used new policy\ntools and enhanced its communications in response to the Global Financial Crisis and the\nGreat Recession, and the review is evaluating these changes. Furthermore, U.S. and\nforeign economies have significantly evolved since the pre-crisis experience that\ninformed much of the research that provided the foundation for our current approach.\nPerhaps most significantly, neutral interest rates—or r*—appear to have fallen in\nthe United States and abroad.3 Moreover, this global decline in r* is widely expected to\npersist for years. The decline in neutral policy rates likely reflects several factors,\nincluding aging populations, changes in risk-taking behavior, and a slowdown in\ntechnology growth. These factors’ contributions are highly uncertain, but, irrespective of\ntheir precise role, the policy implications of the decline in neutral rates are important. All\nelse being equal, a fall in neutral rates increases the likelihood that a central bank’s policy\nrate will reach its effective lower bound (ELB) in future economic downturns. That\ndevelopment, in turn, could make it more difficult during downturns for monetary policy\nto support spending and employment, and keep inflation from falling too low.4\n3 For evidence of a fall in neutral rates of interest in the United States and abroad, see, among several\ncontributions, King and Low (2014); Holston, Laubach, and Williams (2017); Rachel and Smith (2017);\nand Brand, Bielecki, and Penalver (2018).\n4 For assessments of the risks that U.S. monetary policy will be constrained by the ELB and its implications\nfor economic activity and inflation, see Kiley and Roberts (2017), Erceg and others (2018),\nSwanson (2018), and Chung and others (2019).\n\n- 3 -\nAnother key development in recent decades is that inflation appears less\nresponsive to resource slack. That is, the short-run Phillips curve appears to have\nflattened, implying a change in the dynamic relationship between inflation and\nemployment.5 A flatter Phillips curve is, in a sense, a proverbial double-edged sword. It\npermits the Federal Reserve to support employment more aggressively during\ndownturns—as was the case during and after the Great Recession—because a sustained\ninflation breakout is less likely when the Phillips curve is flatter.6 However, a flatter\nPhillips curve also increases the cost, in terms of economic output, of reversing\nunwelcome increases in longer-run inflation expectations. Thus, a flatter Phillips curve\nmakes it all the more important that longer-run inflation expectations remain anchored at\nlevels consistent with our 2 percent inflation objective.7\nFinally, the strengthening of the labor market in recent years has highlighted the\nchallenges of assessing the proximity of the labor market to full employment. The\n5 For evidence of a flattening of the slope of the Phillips curve in the United States and abroad, see, among\nothers, Simon, Matheson, and Sandri (2013); Blanchard, Cerutti, and Summers (2015); and Bank for\nInternational Settlements (2017).\n6 One potential contributor to the flattening of the Phillips curve is a change in the conduct of monetary\npolicy since the 1980s toward greater stabilization of inflation and economic activity; for evidence of such\na change, see Clarida, Galí, and Gertler (2000); Boivin and Giannoni (2006); and Boivin, Kiley, and\nMishkin (2010). As discussed in Roberts (2006) and Bullard (2018), greater stabilization on the part of a\ncentral bank can lead to the estimation of flatter Phillips curves in reduced-form regressions. Similarly, the\nadoption of an explicit inflation objective, along with greater certainty regarding the conduct of monetary\npolicy, can help anchor longer-term inflation expectations and stabilize actual inflation in response to\nshocks.\n7 See Yellen (2015) for a discussion of inflation dynamics and monetary policy; see Erceg and others\n(2018) for a quantitative exploration of the monetary policy implications of a flat Phillips curve in an\nuncertain economic environment. Since the mid-1980s, movements in both realized inflation and measures\nof longer-term inflation expectations have been somewhat muted, complicating the task of extracting the\nprecise role of inflation expectations as a determinant of realized inflation. Faust and Wright (2013) review\nthe literature on inflation forecasting and present evidence in support of the conclusion that measures of\ninflation expectations help predict the trend in inflation. Cecchetti and others (2017) showed that while the\nlevel of realized inflation and four-quarter-ahead inflation expectations are positively correlated, changes in\nthese variables have been largely uncorrelated since the mid-1980s. These authors suggest that, in a low\nand stable inflation environment, policymakers should pay attention to a wide array of other indicators in\ndetermining the implications of movements in realized inflation and measures of inflation expectations.\n\n- 4 -\nunemployment rate, which stood at 3.6 percent in May, has been interpreted by many as\nsuggesting that the labor market is currently operating beyond full employment.\nHowever, the level of the unemployment rate that is consistent with full employment is\nnot directly observable and thus must be estimated. I believe the range of plausible\nestimates extends to 4 percent or below. For example, in the Summary of Economic\nProjections submitted in conjunction with the June meeting of the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC), the range of estimates for the longer-run normal unemployment rate\nis 3.6 to 4.5 percent.8\nThe decline in the unemployment rate in recent years has been accompanied by a\npronounced increase in labor force participation for individuals in their prime working\nyears.9 These increases in prime-age participation have provided employers with a\nsource of additional labor input and have been one factor restraining inflationary\npressures. As with the unemployment rate, whether participation will continue to\nincrease in a tight labor market remains uncertain.\nThe strong job gains of recent years also have delivered benefits to groups that\nhave historically been disadvantaged in the labor market. For example, African\nAmericans and Hispanics have experienced persistently higher unemployment rates than\nwhites for many decades.10 However, those unemployment rate gaps have narrowed as\nthe labor market has strengthened, and there is some indication of an extra benefit to\n8 The box “How Tight Is the Labor Market?” in the Board’s February 2018 Monetary Policy Report\ncontains a discussion of some indicators that can be used to assess labor market tightness; see Board of\nGovernors (2018a, pp. 8–9).\n9 The box “The Labor Force Participation Rate for Prime-Age Individuals” in the Board’s July 2018\nMonetary Policy Report contains a discussion of recent developments in labor force participation rates for\nprime-age individuals; see Board of Governors (2018b, pp. 8–10).\n10 See Cajner and others (2017) for a careful examination of how labor market differentials by race and\nethnicity have evolved over time.\n\n- 5 -\nthese groups as the unemployment rate moves into very low territory.11 Likewise,\nalthough unemployment rates for less-educated workers are persistently higher than they\nare for their more-educated counterparts, such gaps appear to narrow as the labor market\nstrengthens.12 And wage increases in the past couple of years have been strongest for\nless-educated workers and for those at the lower end of the wage distribution.13\nScope of the Review\nIn the Federal Reserve Act, the Congress assigned the Federal Reserve the\nresponsibility to conduct monetary policy “so as to promote effectively the goals of\nmaximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.”14 Our\nreview this year takes this statutory mandate as given and also takes as given that\ninflation at a rate of 2 percent is most consistent over the longer run with the\ncongressional mandate.\nOur existing monetary policy strategy is laid out in the Committee’s Statement on\nLonger-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.15 First adopted in January 2012, the\n11 See Aaronson and others (2019) for evidence on the relative behavior of unemployment rates by race and\nethnicity in a strong labor market. The authors find similar patterns for labor force participation rates and\nfor employment-to-population ratios.\n12 Disparities in labor market outcomes are also evident between urban and rural areas of the United States.\nHowever, these gaps have not narrowed as the labor market has strengthened. The box “Employment\nDisparities between Rural and Urban Areas” in the Board’s February 2019 Monetary Policy Report\nexamines these disparities in more detail; see Board of Governors (2019, pp. 10–12). See also Weingarden\n(2017).\n13 Wage gains for workers with different wage levels and with different levels of education can be\ncalculated using data from the Current Population Survey from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The\nEconomic Policy Institute (2019) provides convenient tabulations of these data.\n14 Even though the act lists three distinct goals, the Federal Reserve’s mandate for monetary policy is\ncommonly known as the “dual mandate.” The reason is that an economy in which people who want to\nwork either have a job or are likely to find one fairly quickly and in which the price level (meaning a broad\nmeasure of the price of goods and services purchased by consumers) is stable creates the conditions needed\nfor interest rates to settle at moderate levels. For a discussion, see Mishkin (2007). Quoted text from the\nFederal Reserve Act is in 12 U.S.C. § 225a (2000),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/section2a.htm.\n15 The statement is available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals.pdf.\n\n- 6 -\nstatement has been reaffirmed at the start of each subsequent year, including at the\nFOMC’s meeting this past January with unanimous support from all 17 FOMC\nparticipants. The statement indicates that the Committee seeks to mitigate deviations of\ninflation from 2 percent and deviations of employment from assessments of its maximum\nlevel. In doing so, the FOMC recognizes that these assessments of maximum\nemployment are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision. According to the Federal\nReserve Act, the employment objective is on an equal footing with the inflation\nobjective.\nAs a practical matter, our current strategy shares many elements with the policy\nframework known in the research literature as “flexible inflation targeting.”16 However,\nthe Fed’s mandate is much more explicit about the role of employment than that of most\nflexible inflation-targeting central banks, and our statement reflects this by stating that\nwhen the two sides of the mandate are in conflict, neither one takes precedent over the\nother. We believe this transparency about the balanced approach the FOMC takes has\nserved us well over the past decade when high unemployment called for extraordinary\npolicies that entailed some risk of inflation.\nThe review of our current framework is wide ranging, and we are not prejudging\nwhere it will take us, but events of the past decade highlight three broad questions.\nThree Questions\nThe first question is, “Can the Federal Reserve best meet its statutory objectives\nwith its existing monetary policy strategy, or should it consider strategies that aim to\nreverse past misses of the inflation objective?”\n16 For a discussion of this terminology and references, see English, López-Salido, and Tetlow (2015) and\nClinton and others (2015).\n\n- 7 -\nUnder our current approach as well as that of most flexible inflation-targeting\ncentral banks around the world, the persistent shortfalls of inflation from 2 percent that\nmany advanced economies have experienced over most of the past decade are treated as\n“bygones.” This means that policy today is not adjusted to offset past inflation shortfalls\nwith future overshoots of the inflation target (nor do persistent overshoots of inflation\ntrigger policies that aim to undershoot the inflation target). Central banks are generally\nbelieved to have effective tools for preventing persistent inflation overshoots, but the\nELB on interest rates makes persistent undershoots more likely. Persistent inflation\nshortfalls carry the risk that longer-term inflation expectations become poorly anchored\nor become anchored below the stated inflation goal.17\nIn part because of that concern, some economists have advocated “makeup”\nstrategies under which policymakers seek to undo, in part or in whole, past inflation\ndeviations from target. Such strategies include targeting average inflation over a\nmultiyear period and price-level targeting, in which policymakers seek to stabilize the\nprice level around a constant growth path.18 These strategies could be implemented\n17 These risks could be exacerbated if households and businesses expect monetary policy to be\ninsufficiently accommodative because of proximity to the ELB. For related discussions, see Reifschneider\nand Williams (2000); Adam and Billi (2007); Nakov (2008); and Hills, Nakata, and Schmidt (2016).\n18 Eggertsson and Woodford (2003) provide an early discussion of how optimal monetary policy at the ELB\nentails a commitment to reflate the price level during the subsequent economic expansion. Nessén and\nVestin (2005) discuss the relationship between average inflation targeting and price-level targeting. There\nis a dearth of empirical evidence on strategies seeking to make up for inflation deviations. Central banks\nthat pursue an inflation goal generally seek to achieve a specific rate of inflation by some time horizon—\ntypically a couple of years ahead or over the “medium run”—without regard to past inflation deviations.\nOne exception is the Reserve Bank of Australia, whose inflation goal is specified as a range of\n“2–3 per cent, on average, over the medium term” and thus might embed some notion of history\ndependence. However, Ruge-Murcia (2014) argues that the drift in the price level in Australia is\ncomparable with the drifts observed in economies with purely forward-looking specification of the inflation\ngoal. The only known historical example of price-level targeting occurred in Sweden from 1931 to 1933\nwhen the country abandoned the gold standard and attempted instead to maintain its price level. The\ntemporary adoption of price-level targeting is credited with helping Sweden avoid deflation, an outcome\nthat contrasted with that in countries that stayed on the gold standard. See Berg and Jonung (1999).\n\n- 8 -\neither permanently or as a temporary response to extraordinary circumstances. For\nexample, the central bank could commit, at the time when the policy rate reaches the\nELB, to maintain the policy rate at this level until inflation over the ELB period has, on\naverage, run at the target rate.19 Other makeup strategies seek to reverse shortfalls in\npolicy accommodation at the ELB by keeping the policy rate lower for longer than\notherwise would be the case.20 In many models that incorporate the ELB, these makeup\nstrategies lead to better average performance on both legs of the dual mandate and\nthereby, viewed over time, provide no conflict between the dual-mandate goals.21\nThe benefits of the makeup strategies rest heavily on households and firms\nbelieving in advance that the makeup will, in fact, be delivered when the time comes—\nfor example, that a persistent inflation shortfall will be met by future inflation above\n2 percent. As is well known from the research literature, makeup strategies, in general,\nare not time consistent because when the time comes to push inflation above 2 percent,\nconditions at that time will not warrant doing so. Because of this time inconsistency, any\nmakeup strategy, to be successful, would have to be understood by the public to represent\na credible commitment. That important real-world consideration is often neglected in the\nacademic literature, in which central bank “commitment devices” are simply assumed to\nexist and be instantly credible on decree. Thus, one of the most challenging questions is\n19 See Bernanke (2017) for a discussion of such a strategy. See Hebden and López-Salido (2018) for a\nquantitative assessment of that and other strategies. See also Kiley and Roberts (2017) for a strategy in\nwhich policymakers aim for inflation higher than 2 percent during economic expansions to compensate for\nbelow-target realizations of inflation during economic downturns.\n20 See Reifschneider and Williams (2000) for a strategy in which a central bank following a Taylor rule\nmakes up for shortfalls in policy accommodation during ELB episodes by subsequently keeping the policy\nrate lower than otherwise. The box “Complexities of Monetary Policy Rules” in the Board’s July 2018\nMonetary Policy Report contains an application of such a modified rule; see Board of Governors (2018b,\npp. 37–41).\n21 See English, López-Salido, and Tetlow (2015) for applications of flexible price-level targeting and\nnominal income-targeting strategies to a quantitative model of the U.S. economy.\n\n- 9 -\nwhether the Fed could, in practice, attain the benefits of makeup strategies that are\npossible in models.\nThe next question the review will consider is, “Are the existing monetary policy\ntools adequate to achieve and maintain maximum employment and price stability, or\nshould the toolkit be expanded? And, if so, how?” The FOMC’s primary means of\nchanging the stance of monetary policy is by adjusting its target range for the federal\nfunds rate. In December 2008, the FOMC cut that target to just above zero in response to\nfinancial turmoil and deteriorating economic conditions. Because the U.S. economy\nrequired additional policy accommodation after the ELB was reached, the FOMC\ndeployed two additional tools in the years following the crisis: balance sheet policies and\nforward guidance about the likely path of the federal funds rate.22\nThe FOMC altered the size and composition of the Fed’s balance sheet through a\nsequence of three large-scale securities purchase programs, via a maturity extension\nprogram, and by adjusting the reinvestment of principal payments on maturing securities.\nWith regard to forward guidance, the FOMC initially made “calendar based” statements,\nand, later on, it issued “outcome based” guidance. Overall, the empirical evidence\nsuggests that these added tools helped stem the crisis and support economic recovery by\nstrengthening the labor market and lifting inflation back toward 2 percent. That said,\nestimates of the effects of these unconventional policies range widely.23\n22 As an illustration of the shortfall in policy support created by a binding ELB during the Global Financial\nCrisis, the simple policy rules considered in a January 2017 speech by then-Chair Janet Yellen prescribed\nsetting the federal funds rate between negative 1-1/2 and negative 9 percent; see Yellen (2017). In addition\nto using these two additional monetary policy tools, the Federal Reserve implemented a number of other\nmeasures to stabilize the financial system, increase households and business confidence, and more\ngenerally support the economic recovery. These supplementary measures included the setting up of several\ncredit facilities and the introduction of stress tests for systemically important financial institutions.\n23 On the transmission channels of balance sheet policies, see D’Amico and others (2012), Joyce and others\n(2012), Clarida (2012), Woodford (2012), and Bauer and Rudebusch (2014). On the financial market\n\n- 10 -\nIn addition to assessing the efficacy of these existing tools, we will examine\nadditional tools to ease policy when the ELB is binding. During the crisis and its\naftermath, the Federal Reserve considered but ultimately found some of the tools\ndeployed by foreign central banks wanting relative to the alternatives it did pursue. But\nthe review will reassess the case for these and other tools in light of more recent\nexperience in other countries.\nThe third question the review will consider is, “How can the FOMC’s\ncommunication of its policy framework and implementation be improved?” Our\ncommunication practices have evolved considerably since 1994, when the Federal\nReserve released the first statement after an FOMC meeting. Over the past decade or so,\nthe FOMC has enhanced its communication practices both to promote public\nunderstanding of its policy goals, strategy, and actions and to foster democratic\naccountability. These enhancements include the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and\nMonetary Policy Strategy; postmeeting press conferences; various statements about the\nprinciples and strategy guiding the Committee’s normalization of monetary policy; and\nquarterly summaries of individual FOMC participants’ economic projections,\nassessments about the appropriate path of the federal funds rate, and judgments of the\nuncertainty and balance of risks around their projections.24\neffects of balance sheet policies, see Gagnon and others (2011), Joyce and others (2011), Hamilton and Wu\n(2012), D’Amico and King (2013), and Swanson (2017). For discussions of the macroeconomic effects of\nthese policy actions, see Chen, Cúrdia, and Ferrero (2012); Baumeister and Benati (2013); Engen, Laubach,\nand Reifschneider (2015); Chung and others (2019), and the references therein. For related assessments of\nforward guidance, see Campbell and others (2012); Engen, Laubach, and Reifschneider (2015); Campbell\nand others (2017); and Swanson (2017).\n24 Starting in 1979, the Federal Reserve published a summary of individual economic projections from\nvarious Board members, FOMC members, or FOMC participants in the semiannual Monetary Policy\nReport. With the introduction of the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) in 2007, the FOMC\nincreased the frequency of the releases of policymaker projections, expanded the set of economic variables\nincluded, and extended the forecast horizon. Because the SEP includes individual contributions of\n\n- 11 -\nAs part of the review, we will assess the Committee’s current and past\ncommunications and additional forms of communication that could be helpful. For\nexample, there might be ways to improve communication about the coordination of\npolicy tools or the interplay between monetary policy and financial stability.\nActivities and Timeline for the Review\nLet me turn now to our review process.25 The Board and the Reserve Banks are\nconducting Fed Listens events, during which we are hearing from a broad range of\ninterested individuals and groups, including business and labor leaders, community\ndevelopment professionals, and academics.\nOne of our Fed Listens events was a research conference at the Federal Reserve\nBank of Chicago in early June, with speakers and panelists from outside the Fed. I would\nlike to give a brief summary of what we heard there: Janice Eberly, James Stock, and\nJonathan Wright provided a thorough and thoughtful evaluation of the Federal Reserve’s\nmonetary policy strategy, tools, and communications since 2009. Lars Svensson\nevaluated the pros and cons of several monetary policy strategies that have makeup\nfeatures, and argued that average inflation targeting could be more likely than price-level\ntargeting to be understood by the public and garner credibility. Cynthia Wu and Eric\nSims used a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model to analyze the efficacy of\nseveral policy tools at the ELB—forward guidance, negative interest rates, and asset\npurchases—and the interactions between them. Stephen Cecchetti and Kermit\nprojections and assessments from all FOMC participants, it captures a broader range of views than those of\nFOMC members. For a discussion and data, see Bernanke (2007) and Romer (2010).\n25 Information about the review and the events associated with it are available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review-of-monetary-policy-strategy-tools-and-\ncommunications.htm.\n\n- 12 -\nSchoenholtz assessed the Federal Reserve’s communication practices and offered\nsuggestions for improving our most important communication vehicles.\nIn other sessions, Katharine Abraham and John Haltiwanger developed an\ninnovative search-and-matching model to estimate labor market slack—which\ncomplements the standard estimates based on unemployment gaps and Phillips curve\nrelationships. Maurice Obstfeld examined the ways that global economic integration\naffects inflation and the neutral rate of interest, and the role played by the U.S. dollar in\ntransmitting the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy to other countries. Anil Kashyap and\nCaspar Siegert spoke about the interplay between financial stability considerations and\nmonetary policy.\nOur conference also included two sessions with national and community leaders.\nA panel discussion moderated by Fed Governor Lael Brainard provided a valuable\nperspective on the labor market that could not otherwise be gleaned from the aggregate\nstatistics we often consult. Another panel discussion moderated by Federal Reserve Bank\nof Boston President Eric Rosengren offered valuable perspectives about how the\nmonetary levers we pull and push affect communities, credit availability, and small\nbusinesses.\nIn addition to the Chicago conference, 7 of the 12 Reserve Banks have hosted Fed\nListens sessions, and other events are planned for later this year. From these listening\nsessions, we have heard about innovative partnerships involving employers, workforce\ndevelopment groups, and community colleges to fill training gaps, and about greater\nflexibility in the workplace around entry requirements and working arrangements. This\ninnovation and flexibility are coming when the labor market is tight and qualified\n\n- 13 -\nworkers are scarce, and so are welcome developments from the perspective of job\ncreation and retention. All of our Fed Listens events are being conducted with a high\ndegree of transparency. (You can view videos of the events or read the summaries on our\nwebsite.)\nIn coming regularly scheduled FOMC meetings, we will begin our own\nassessment of our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices,\ninformed by what we heard at the conference and during our listening sessions in the\nFederal Reserve Districts and by the work of our staff. When the Committee tackles\nimportant issues, we take the time for wide-ranging and candid discussions, and so I\nexpect our deliberations will continue over several meetings for the remainder of this\nyear. We will share our findings with the public when we have completed our review,\nlikely during the first half of next year.\nConcluding Thoughts\nThe economy is constantly evolving, bringing with it new policy challenges. So it\nmakes sense for us to remain open minded as we assess current practices and consider\nideas that could potentially enhance our ability to deliver on the goals the Congress has\nassigned us. For this reason, my colleagues and I do not want to preempt or to predict\nour ultimate finding. What I can say is that any refinements or more material changes to\nour framework that we might make will be aimed solely at enhancing our ability to\nachieve and sustain our dual-mandate objectives in the world we live in today.\n\n- 14 -\nReferences\nAaronson, Stephanie R., Mary C.

Clarida\nVice Chair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Fed Listens: A Capstone Roundtable”\nhosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York\nNew York, New York\nMay 20, 2019\n\nI am pleased to attend this Fed Listens event providing the New York perspective\nfor the Federal Reserve’s review of our monetary policy strategy, tools, and\ncommunication practices.1 We are bringing open minds to our review and are seeking a\nbroad range of perspectives. To us, it simply seems like good institutional practice to\nengage with a wide range of interested individuals and groups as part of a comprehensive\napproach to enhanced transparency and accountability.2\nMotivation for the Review\nThe Congress charged the Federal Reserve with achieving a dual mandate—\nmaximum employment and price stability—and this review will take this mandate as\ngiven. We will also take as given that a 2 percent rate of inflation in the price index for\npersonal consumption expenditures is the operational goal most consistent with our price-\nstability mandate. While we believe that our existing strategy, tools, and\ncommunications practices have generally served the public well, we are eager to evaluate\nways they might be improved.\nWith the U.S. economy operating at or close to our maximum-employment and\nprice-stability goals, now is an especially opportune time for this review. The\nunemployment rate is at a 50-year low, and inflation is running close to our 2 percent\nobjective. We want to ensure that we continue to meet our statutory goals in coming\nyears. In addition, we will evaluate the new policy tools and enhanced communication\npractices the Federal Reserve deployed in response to the Global Financial Crisis and the\n1 Additional information about Fed Listens, including background information on the initiative and a listing\nof events around the country, is available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review-of-monetary-policy-strategy-tools-and-\ncommunications-fed-listens-events.htm.\n2 Fuhrer and others (2018) explore the desirability of comprehensive reviews of the monetary policy\nframework. They argue that such reviews may help the Fed more effectively identify and implement\nneeded changes.\n\n- 2 -\nGreat Recession. Furthermore, the U.S. and foreign economies have evolved\nsignificantly since before the crisis.\nPerhaps most importantly, neutral interest rates appear to have fallen in the United\nStates and abroad.3 This global decline in neutral rates is widely expected to persist for\nyears and likely reflects several factors, including aging populations, changes in risk-\ntaking behavior, and a slowdown in technology growth. These factors’ contributions are\nhighly uncertain, but, irrespective of their precise role, the policy implications of the\ndecline in neutral rates are important. All else being equal, a fall in neutral rates\nincreases the likelihood that a central bank’s policy rate will reach its effective lower\nbound in future economic downturns. That development, in turn, could make it more\ndifficult during downturns for monetary policy to support household spending, business\ninvestment, and employment and keep inflation from falling too low.4\nAnother key development in recent decades is that inflation appears less\nresponsive to resource slack, implying a change in the dynamic relationship between\ninflation and employment.5 This change is, in a sense, a proverbial double-edged sword.\nIt permits the Federal Reserve to support employment more aggressively during\ndownturns—as was the case during and after the Great Recession—because a sustained\ninflation breakout is less likely when inflation is less responsive to employment\n3 For evidence of a fall in neutral rates of interest in the United States and abroad, see, among several\ncontributions, King and Low (2014); Holston, Laubach, and Williams (2017); Rachel and Smith (2017);\nand Brand, Bielecki, and Penalver (2018).\n4 For assessments of the risks that U.S. monetary policy will be constrained by the effective lower bound\nand its implications for economic activity and inflation, see Kiley and Roberts (2017), Erceg and others\n(2018), Swanson (2018), and Chung and others (2019).\n5 The apparent diminished responsiveness of inflation to resource slack is known in economic research as a\nflattening of the short-run Phillips curve. For evidence of this flattening in the slope of the Phillips curve in\nthe United States and abroad, see, among others, Simon, Matheson, and Sandri (2013); Blanchard, Cerutti,\nand Summers (2015); and Bank for International Settlements (2017).\n\n- 3 -\nconditions.6 However, that dynamic also increases the cost, in terms of economic output,\nof reversing unwelcome increases in longer-run inflation expectations. Thus, it is all the\nmore important that longer-run inflation expectations remain anchored at levels\nconsistent with our 2 percent inflation objective.7\nFinally, the strengthening of the labor market in recent years has highlighted the\nchallenges of assessing the proximity of the labor market to the full employment leg of\nthe Federal Reserve’s dual mandate. The unemployment rate, which stood at 3.6 percent\nin April, has been interpreted by many observers as suggesting that the labor market is\ncurrently operating beyond full employment. However, the level of the unemployment\nrate that is consistent with full employment is not directly observable and thus must be\nestimated. The range of plausible estimates likely extends at least as low as the current\nlevel of the unemployment rate. For example, in the March Blue Chip economic outlook\nsurvey, the average estimate of the natural rate of unemployment for the bottom 10\n6 One potential contributor to the flattening of the Phillips curve is a change in the conduct of monetary\npolicy since the 1980s toward greater stabilization of inflation and economic activity; for evidence of such\na change, see Clarida, Galí, and Gertler (2000); Boivin and Giannoni (2006); and Boivin, Kiley, and\nMishkin (2010). As discussed in Roberts (2006) and Bullard (2018), greater stabilization on the part of a\ncentral bank can lead to the estimation of flatter Phillips curves in reduced-form regressions. Similarly, the\nadoption of an explicit inflation objective, along with greater certainty regarding the conduct of monetary\npolicy, can help anchor longer-term inflation expectations and stabilize actual inflation in response to\nshocks.\n7 See Yellen (2015) for a discussion of inflation dynamics and monetary policy; see Erceg and others\n(2018) for a quantitative exploration of the monetary policy implications of a flat Phillips curve in an\nuncertain economic environment. Since the mid-1980s, movements in both realized inflation and measures\nof longer-term inflation expectations have been somewhat muted, complicating the task of extracting the\nprecise role of inflation expectations as a determinant of realized inflation. Faust and Wright (2013) review\nthe literature on inflation forecasting and present evidence in support of the conclusion that measures of\ninflation expectations help predict the trend in inflation. Cecchetti and others (2017) showed that while the\nlevel of realized inflation and four-quarter-ahead inflation expectations are positively correlated, changes in\nthese variables have been largely uncorrelated since the mid-1980s. These authors suggest that, in a low\nand stable inflation environment, policymakers should pay attention to a wide array of other indicators in\ndetermining the implications of movements in realized inflation and measures of inflation expectations.\n\n- 4 -\nrespondents was 3.9 percent, as compared with 4.7 percent for the highest 10\nrespondents.8\nThe decline in the unemployment rate in recent years has been accompanied by a\npronounced increase in labor force participation for individuals in their prime working\nyears.9 These increases in participation have provided employers with a significant\nsource of additional labor input and may be one factor restraining inflationary pressures.\nAs with the unemployment rate, whether participation will continue to increase in a tight\nlabor market remains uncertain.\nThe strong job gains of recent years also has delivered benefits to groups that\nhave historically been disadvantaged in the labor market. For example, African\nAmericans and Hispanics have experienced persistently higher unemployment rates than\nwhites for many decades.10 However, those unemployment rate gaps have narrowed as\nthe labor market has strengthened, and there is some indication of an extra benefit to\nthese groups as the unemployment rate moves into very low territory.11 Likewise,\nalthough unemployment rates for less-educated workers are persistently higher than they\nare for their more-educated counterparts, these gaps appear to narrow as the labor market\n8 The average estimate from the Blue Chip respondents was 4.3 percent.

Next month, we are holding a System research conference at\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, with speakers and panelists from outside the Fed.\nThe program includes overviews by academic experts of themes that are central to the\nreview.\nBuilding on the perspectives we hear and on staff analysis, the Federal Open\nMarket Committee will perform its own assessment of how it conducts monetary policy,\nbeginning around the middle of the year. We expect to make our conclusions public in\nthe first half of 2020.\nConcluding Thoughts\nThe economy is constantly evolving, bringing with it new policy challenges.

Clarida\nVice Chairman\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe Clearing House and The Bank Policy Institute Annual Conference\nNew York, New York\nNovember 27, 2018\n\nI am delighted to be speaking at this annual conference of the Clearing House and\nthe Bank Policy Institute. Today I will discuss recent economic developments and the\neconomic outlook before going on to outline my thinking about the connections between\ndata dependence and monetary policy. I will close with some observations on the\nimplications for U.S. monetary policy that flow from this perspective.1\nRecent Economic Developments and the Economic Outlook\nU.S. economic fundamentals are robust, as indicated by strong growth in gross\ndomestic product (GDP) and a job market that has been surprising on the upside for\nnearly two years. Smoothing across the first three quarters of this year, real, or inflation-\nadjusted, GDP growth is averaging an annual rate of 3.3 percent. Private-sector forecasts\nfor the full year--that is, on a fourth-quarter-over-fourth-quarter basis--suggest that\ngrowth is likely to equal, or perhaps slightly exceed, 3 percent. If this occurs, GDP\ngrowth in 2018 will be the fastest recorded so far during the current expansion, which in\nJuly entered its 10th year. If, as I expect, the economic expansion continues in 2019, this\nwill become the longest U.S. expansion in recorded history.\nLikewise, the labor market remains healthy. Average monthly job gains continue\nto outpace the increase needed to provide jobs for new entrants to the labor force over the\nlonger run, with payrolls rising by 250,000 in October. And, at 3.7 percent, the\nunemployment rate is the lowest it has been since 1969. In addition, after remaining\nstubbornly sluggish throughout much of the expansion, nominal wage growth is picking\n1 The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of other Federal Reserve Board members or\nFederal Open Market Committee participants. I am most grateful to Brian Doyle and Edward Nelson of the\nFederal Reserve Board staff for their assistance in preparing this text.\n\n- 2 -\nup, with various measures now running in the neighborhood of 3 percent on an annual\nbasis.\nThe inflation data in the year to date for the price index for personal consumption\nexpenditures (PCE) have been running at or close to our 2 percent objective, including on\na core basis--that is, excluding volatile food and energy prices. While my base case is for\nthis pattern to continue, it is important to monitor measures of inflation expectations to\nconfirm that households and businesses expect price stability to be maintained. The\nmedian of expected inflation 5-to-10 years in the future from the University of Michigan\nSurveys of Consumers is within--but I believe at the lower end of--the range consistent\nwith price stability. Likewise, inflation readings from the TIPS (Treasury Inflation-\nProtected Securities) market indicate to me that financial markets expect consumer price\nindex (CPI) inflation of about 2 percent to be maintained. That said, historically, PCE\ninflation has averaged about 0.3 percent less than CPI inflation, and if this were to\ncontinue, the readings from the TIPS market would indicate that expected PCE inflation\nis running at somewhat less than 2 percent.\nWhat might explain why inflation is running at or close to the Federal Reserve’s\nlong-run objective of 2 percent, and not well above it, when growth is strong and the\nlabor market robust? According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, productivity growth in\nthe business sector, as measured by output per hour, is averaging 2 percent at an\nannualized rate this year, while aggregate hours worked in the business sector have risen\nat an average annual rate of 1.8 percent through the third quarter. This decomposition--in\nwhich the growth in output is broken down into measures of aggregate supply, the growth\nof aggregate hours and the growth of output per hour--suggests that the growth rates of\n\n- 3 -\nproductivity and hours worked in 2018 each have been exceeding their respective longer-\nrun rates as estimated by the Congressional Budget Office.2 In other words, while\ngrowth in aggregate demand in 2018 has been above the expected long-run growth rate in\naggregate supply, it has not been exceeding this year’s growth in actual aggregate supply.\nUltimately, hours growth will likely converge to a slower pace because of\ndemographic factors. But how rapidly this happens will depend in part on the behavior of\nlabor force participation. And recent years’ developments suggest there may still be\nsome further room for participation in the job market--especially in the prime-age group\nof 25-to-54-year-olds--to rise. Labor participation by prime-age women has increased\naround 2 percentage points in the past three years and is now at its highest level in a\ndecade. That said, it is still 1-1/2 percentage points below the peak level reached in 2000.\nLabor force participation among 25- to 54-year-old men has risen by roughly 1\npercentage point in the past several years. But it is still 2 percentage points below levels\nseen a decade ago, and it is 3 percentage points below the levels that prevailed in the late\n1990s.\nAs for productivity growth, there is considerable uncertainty about how much of\nthe rebound in productivity growth that we have seen in recent quarters is cyclical and\nhow much is structural. I believe both factors are at work. The structural, or trend,\ncomponent of productivity growth is a function of capital deepening through business\ninvestment as well as a multifactor component sometimes referred to as the “Solow\nresidual.” Initial estimates from the recent GDP release indicate that equipment and\nsoftware investment in the third quarter moderated from the rapid pace recorded in the\n2 See the Congressional Budget Office’s August 2018 projections for the nonfarm business sector at\nhttps://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2018-08/51137-2018-08-potentialgdp.xlsx.\n\n- 4 -\nfirst half of the year. One data point does not make a trend, but an improvement in\nbusiness investment will be important if the pickup in productivity growth that we have\nseen in recent quarters is to be sustained.\nAs for the economic outlook, in the most recent Summary of Economic\nProjections (SEP) released in September, participants had a median projection for real\nGDP growth of 3.1 percent in 2018 and 2-1/2 percent in 2019. The unemployment rate\nwas expected to decline to 3-1/2 percent next year. And, for total PCE inflation, the\nmedian projection remains near 2 percent.\nWith a robust labor market and inflation at or close to our 2 percent inflation goal\nand based on the baseline economic outlook for 2019 I have just laid out, I believe\nmonetary policy at this stage of the economic expansion should be aimed at sustaining\ngrowth and maximum employment at levels consistent with our inflation objective. At\nthis stage of the interest rate cycle, I believe it will be especially important to monitor a\nwide range of data as we continually assess and calibrate whether the path for the policy\nrate is consistent with meeting our dual-mandate objectives on a sustained basis.\nData Dependence of Monetary Policy: What It Means and Why It Is Important\nEconomic research suggests that monetary policy should be “data dependent.”3\nAnd, indeed, central banks around the world, including the Federal Reserve, often\ndescribe their policies in this way. I would now like to discuss how I think about two\n3 The seminal reference is John B.

A monetary policy strategy must find a way to combine\nincoming data and a model of the economy with a healthy dose of judgment--and\nhumility!--to formulate, and then communicate, a path for the policy rate most consistent\nwith our policy objectives. In the case of the Fed, those objectives are assigned to us by\nthe Congress, and they are to achieve maximum employment and price stability.\nImportantly, because households and firms must make long-term saving and investment\ndecisions and because these decisions--directly or indirectly--depend on the expected\nfuture path for the policy rate, the central bank should find a way to communicate and\nexplain how incoming data are or are not changing the expected path for the policy rate\nconsistent with best meeting its objectives.4 Absent such communication, inefficient\ndivergences between public expectations and central bank intentions for the policy rate\npath can emerge and persist in ways that are costly to the economy when reversed.\nWithin this general framework, let me now consider two distinct ways in which I\nthink that the path for the federal funds rate should be data dependent. U.S. monetary\npolicy has for some time and will, I believe, continue to be data dependent in the sense\nthat incoming data reveal at the time of each Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)\nmeeting where the economy is at the time of each meeting relative to the goals of\n4 For example, long-term bond yields can be written as the sum of the expected path of the policy rate plus\na term premium. The exchange rate between two countries can be written as the sum of the policy rate path\ndifferential between two countries plus a risk premium. So even for households and firms that do not\ndirectly care about the policy rate path, they do care about long-term bond yields and exchange rates that\nreflect this path.\n\n- 6 -\nmonetary policy. This information on where the economy is relative to the goals of\nmonetary policy is an important input into the policy decision. If, for example, incoming\ndata in the months ahead were to reveal that inflation and inflation expectations are\nrunning higher than projected at present and in ways that are inconsistent with our 2\npercent objective, then I would be receptive to increasing the policy rate by more than I\ncurrently expect will be necessary. Data dependence in this sense is easy to understand,\nas it is of the type implied by a large family of policy rules in which the parameters of the\neconomy are known.5\nBut what if key parameters that describe the long-run destination of the economy\nare unknown? This is indeed the relevant case that the FOMC and other monetary\npolicymakers face in practice. The two most important unknown parameters needed to\nconduct--and communicate--monetary policy are the rate of unemployment consistent\nwith maximum employment, u*, and the riskless real rate of interest consistent with price\nstability, r*. As a result, in the real world, monetary policy should, I believe, be data\ndependent in a second sense: that incoming data can reveal at each FOMC meeting\nsignals that will enable it to update its estimates of r* and u* in order to obtain its best\nestimate of where the economy is heading.6 And, indeed, as indicated by the SEP,\n5 See the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2018), Monetary Policy Report (Washington:\nBoard of Governors, July), pp. 37-41,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/20180713_mprfullreport.pdf, or the webpage\n“Monetary Policy Principles and Practice” available on the Federal Reserve Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/monetary-policy-principles-and-practice.htm for a\ndiscussion of the policy rate paths implied by five different policy rules using parameter values typically\nassumed in the literature.\n6 If the economy can be described by a linear model in which the only two unknown parameters are r* and\nu* and the shocks that hit the economy are normal, Kalman filtering can be used to derive a closed form\nmathematical expression for how to update one’s estimate of r* and u* as new macro data arrive. But, in\npractice, “the” model of the economy is neither known, nor linear, and the shocks that strike it are not\nnormal. Thus, monetary policy in practice is, of necessity, as much or more an art than a science.\n\n- 7 -\nFOMC participants have, over the past nearly seven years, revised their estimates of both\nu* and r* substantially lower as unemployment fell and real interest rates remained well\nbelow prior estimates of neutral without the rise in inflation or inflation expectations\nthose earlier estimates would have predicted. And these revisions to u* and r* almost\ncertainly did have an important influence on the path for the policy rate that was actually\nrealized in recent years.7 I would expect to revise my estimates of r* and u* as\nappropriate if incoming data on future inflation and unemployment diverge materially\nand persistently from my baseline projections today.\nConsequences for Monetary Policy\nWhat does this mean for the conduct of monetary policy? As the economy has\nmoved to a neighborhood consistent with the Fed’s dual-mandate objectives, risks have\nbecome more symmetric and less skewed to the downside than when the current rate\ncycle began three years ago. Raising rates too quickly could unnecessarily shorten the\neconomic expansion, while moving too slowly could result in rising inflation and\ninflation expectations down the road that could be costly to reverse, as well as potentially\npose financial stability risks.\nAlthough the real federal funds rate today is just below the range of longer-run\nestimates presented in the September SEP, it is much closer to the vicinity of r* than it\nwas when the FOMC started to remove accommodation in December 2015. How close is\na matter of judgment, and there is a range of views on the FOMC. As I have already\n7 That was my inference as one who was a Fed watcher until September 17, 2018. It has also been the\ninference of some private-sector forecasters as well as some other FOMC participants. For example, see\nJanet L. Yellen (2017), “The Economic Outlook and the Conduct of Monetary Policy,” speech delivered at\nthe Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research, Stanford University, Stanford, Calif., January 19,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/yellen20170119a.htm.\n\n- 8 -\nstressed, r* and u* are uncertain, and I believe we should continue to update our\nestimates of them as new data arrive. This process of learning about r* and u* as new\ndata arrive supports the case for gradual policy normalization, as it will allow the Fed to\naccumulate more information from the data about the ultimate destination for the policy\nrate and the unemployment rate at a time when inflation is close to our 2 percent\nobjective.",

Clarida\nVice Chair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“New England Perspectives on Fed Policymaking: A ‘Fed Listens’ Conference”\nhosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston\nBoston, Massachusetts\nMay 13, 2019\n\nI am pleased to attend this Fed Listens event providing a New England\nperspective for the Federal Reserve’s review of our monetary policy strategy, tools, and\ncommunication practices.1 We are bringing open minds to our review and are seeking a\nbroad range of perspectives. To us, it simply seems like good institutional practice to\nengage with a wide range of interested individuals and groups as part of a comprehensive\napproach to enhanced transparency and accountability.2\nMotivation for the Review\nThe Congress charged the Federal Reserve with achieving a dual mandate—\nmaximum employment and price stability—and this review will take this mandate as\ngiven. We will also take as given that a 2 percent rate of inflation in the price index for\npersonal consumption expenditures is the operational goal most consistent with our price-\nstability mandate. While we believe that our existing strategy, tools, and\ncommunications practices have generally served the public well, we are eager to evaluate\nways they might be improved. That said, based on the experience of other central banks\nthat have undertaken similar reviews, our review is more likely to produce evolution, not\na revolution, in the way we conduct monetary policy.\nWith the U.S. economy operating at or close to our maximum-employment and\nprice-stability goals, now is an especially opportune time for this review. The\nunemployment rate is at a 50-year low, and inflation is running close to our 2 percent\nobjective. We want to ensure that we continue to meet our statutory goals in coming\n1 Additional information about Fed Listens, including background information on the initiative and a listing\nof events around the country, is available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review-of-monetary-policy-strategy-tools-and-\ncommunications-fed-listens-events.htm.\n2 Fuhrer and others (2018) explore the desirability of comprehensive reviews of the monetary policy\nframework. They argue that such reviews may help the Fed more effectively identify and implement\nneeded changes.\n\n- 2 -\nyears. In addition, we will evaluate the new policy tools and enhanced communication\npractices the Federal Reserve deployed in response to the Global Financial Crisis and the\nGreat Recession. Furthermore, the U.S. and foreign economies have evolved\nsignificantly since before the crisis.\nPerhaps most importantly, neutral interest rates appear to have fallen in the United\nStates and abroad.3 This global decline in neutral rates is widely expected to persist for\nyears and likely reflects several factors, including aging populations, changes in risk-\ntaking behavior, and a slowdown in technology growth. These factors’ contributions are\nhighly uncertain, but, irrespective of their precise role, the policy implications of the\ndecline in neutral rates are important. All else being equal, a fall in neutral rates\nincreases the likelihood that a central bank’s policy rate will reach its effective lower\nbound in future economic downturns. That development, in turn, could make it more\ndifficult during downturns for monetary policy to support household spending, business\ninvestment, and employment and keep inflation from falling too low.4\nAnother key development in recent decades is that inflation appears less\nresponsive to resource slack, implying a change in the dynamic relationship between\ninflation and employment.5 This change is, in a sense, a proverbial double-edged sword.\nIt permits the Federal Reserve to support employment more aggressively during\n3 For evidence of a fall in neutral rates of interest in the United States and abroad, see, among several\ncontributions, King and Low (2014); Holston, Laubach, and Williams (2017); Rachel and Smith (2017);\nand Brand, Bielecki, and Penalver (2018).\n4 For assessments of the risks that U.S. monetary policy will be constrained by the effective lower bound\nand its implications for economic activity and inflation, see Kiley and Roberts (2017), Erceg and others\n(2018), Swanson (2018), and Chung and others (2019).\n5 The apparent diminished responsiveness of inflation to resource slack is known in economic research as a\nflattening of the short-run Phillips curve. For evidence of this flattening in the slope of the Phillips curve in\nthe United States and abroad, see, among others, Simon, Matheson, and Sandri (2013); Blanchard, Cerutti,\nand Summers (2015); and Bank for International Settlements (2017).\n\n- 3 -\ndownturns—as was the case during and after the Great Recession—because a sustained\ninflation breakout is less likely when inflation is less responsive to employment\nconditions.6 However, that dynamic also increases the cost, in terms of economic output,\nof reversing unwelcome increases in longer-run inflation expectations. Thus, it is all the\nmore important that longer-run inflation expectations remain anchored at levels\nconsistent with our 2 percent inflation objective.7\nActivities and Timeline for the Review\nOur monetary policy review will have several components.8 The Board and the\nReserve Banks are hosting Fed Listens events—such as this one in Boston—in which we\nare hearing from, among others, business and labor leaders, community development\nadvocates, and academics. Next month, we are holding a System research conference at\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, with speakers and panelists from outside the Fed.\n6 One potential contributor to the flattening of the Phillips curve is a change in the conduct of monetary\npolicy since the 1980s toward greater stabilization of inflation and economic activity; for evidence of such\na change, see Clarida, Galí, and Gertler (2000); Boivin and Giannoni (2006); and Boivin, Kiley, and\nMishkin (2010). As discussed in Roberts (2006) and Bullard (2018), greater stabilization on the part of a\ncentral bank can lead to the estimation of flatter Phillips curves in reduced-form regressions. Similarly, the\nadoption of an explicit inflation objective, along with greater certainty regarding the conduct of monetary\npolicy, can help anchor longer-term inflation expectations and stabilize actual inflation in response to\nshocks.\n7 See Yellen (2015) for a discussion of inflation dynamics and monetary policy; see Erceg and others\n(2018) for a quantitative exploration of the monetary policy implications of a flat Phillips curve in an\nuncertain economic environment. Since the mid-1980s, movements in both realized inflation and measures\nof longer-term inflation expectations have been somewhat muted, complicating the task of extracting the\nprecise role of inflation expectations as a determinant of realized inflation. Faust and Wright (2013) review\nthe literature on inflation forecasting and present evidence in support of the conclusion that measures of\ninflation expectations help predict the trend in inflation. Cecchetti and others (2017) showed that while the\nlevel of realized inflation and four-quarter-ahead inflation expectations are positively correlated, changes in\nthese variables have been largely uncorrelated since the mid-1980s. These authors suggest that, in a low\nand stable inflation environment, policymakers should pay attention to a wide array of other indicators in\ndetermining the implications of movements in realized inflation and measures of inflation expectations.\n8 Information about the review and the events associated with it are available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review-of-monetary-policy-strategy-tools-and-\ncommunications.htm.\n\n- 4 -\nThe program includes overviews by academic experts of themes that are central to the\nreview.\nBuilding on the perspectives we hear and on staff analysis, the Federal Open\nMarket Committee will perform its own assessment of how it conducts monetary policy,\nbeginning around the middle of the year. We expect to make our conclusions public in\nthe first half of 2020.\nConcluding Thoughts\nThe economy is constantly evolving, bringing with it new policy challenges. So it\nmakes sense for us to remain open minded as we assess current practices and consider\nideas that could potentially enhance our ability to deliver on the goals the Congress has\nassigned us. For this reason, my colleagues and I do not want to preempt or to predict\nour ultimate finding. What I can say is that any changes to our conduct of monetary\npolicy that we might make will be aimed solely at improving our ability to achieve and\nsustain our dual-mandate objectives in the world we live in today.\n\n- 5 -\nReferences\nBank for International Settlements (2017). 87th Annual Report.

Clarida\nVice Chair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nEconomic Club of New York\nNew York, New York\nMay 30, 2019\n\nThank you for that generous introduction. I have attended Economic Club of\nNew York events many times over the years and have always enjoyed the programs that\nfeature engaging speakers sharing important insights on timely topics. It is a distinct\nhonor to appear before you today from this side of the podium, and I do hope my remarks\nwill contribute to this proud tradition.1\nIn July, the current U.S. economic expansion will become the longest on record—\nor at least the record since the 1850s, which is as far back as the National Bureau of\nEconomic Research tracks U.S. business cycles.2 In anticipation of that milestone, I\nwould like to take stock of where the U.S. economy is today, to assess its future\ntrajectory, to review some important structural changes in the economy that have\noccurred over the past decade, and to explore what all of this might mean for U.S.\nmonetary policy.\nThe Federal Reserve has a specific mandate assigned to it in statute by the\nCongress, which is the dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability. As I\nspeak today, the economy is as close to achieving both legs of this dual mandate as it has\nbeen in 20 years. My colleagues and I understand that our responsibility is to conduct a\nmonetary policy that not only is supportive of and consistent with achieving maximum\nemployment and price stability, but also, once achieved, is appropriate, nimble, and\nconsistent with sustaining maximum employment and price stability for as long as\n1 The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of other Federal Reserve Board members or\nFederal Open Market Committee participants. I would like to thank Brian Doyle, David Lopez-Salido, and\nBernd Schlusche for their assistance in preparing this speech.\n2 See the NBER’s “U.S. Business Cycle Expansions and Contractions” at\nhttps://www.nber.org/cycles.html.\n\n- 2 -\npossible. And thus, the title of my talk today is “Sustaining Maximum Employment and\nPrice Stability.”\nMidway through the second quarter of 2019, the U.S. economy is in a good place.\nOver the past four quarters, gross domestic product (GDP) growth has averaged\n3.2 percent, which compares with an average growth rate of 2.3 percent since the\nrecovery began in the summer of 2009. By most estimates, fiscal policy played an\nimportant role in boosting growth in 2018, and I expect that fiscal policies will continue\nto support growth in 2019. Over the same four quarters, the unemployment rate has\naveraged 3.8 percent, and the most recent reading, at 3.6 percent, is near its lowest level\nin 50 years. Moreover, average monthly job gains have continued to outpace the\nincreases needed to provide jobs for new entrants to the labor force. Wages have been\nrising broadly in line with productivity and prices and thus, at present, do not signal\nrising cost-push pressure. Notwithstanding strong growth and low unemployment, U.S.\ninflation remains muted—currently, it is somewhat below our 2 percent longer-run\nobjective for the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price deflator—and inflation\nexpectations, according to a variety of measures, continue to be stable.\nAs we look ahead, in our March Summary of Economic Projections, the median\nprojection of Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants was for GDP growth\nof around 2 percent as the modal, or most likely, outcome over the next three years, for\nPCE inflation to rise to 2 percent, and for the unemployment rate to edge up to\n3.9 percent by 2021.\n\n- 3 -\nBefore I discuss the outlook for monetary policy, allow me to review some\nimportant structural changes that have taken place in the economy over the past decade\nthat will be particularly relevant for our monetary policy decisions.\nStructural Changes in the U.S. Economy: Demand and Supply\nPerhaps the most significant structural change relevant to monetary policy is that\nthe real, or inflation-adjusted, rate of interest consistent with full employment and price\nstability, often referred to as the neutral rate, or r*, appears to have fallen in the United\nStates and abroad from more than 2 percent before the crisis to less than 1 percent today.3\nThe decline in neutral policy rates likely reflects several factors, including aging\npopulations, higher private saving, a greater demand for safe assets, and a slowdown in\nglobal productivity growth. The policy implications of the decline in neutral rates are\nimportant. All else being equal, a lower neutral rate increases the likelihood that a central\nbank’s policy rate will reach its effective lower bound in a future economic downturn.\nSuch a development, in turn, could make it more difficult during a future downturn for\nmonetary policy to provide sufficient accommodation to rapidly return employment and\ninflation to mandate-consistent levels.4\nAnother important potential change in the U.S. economy has been the steady\ndecline in estimates of the structural rate of unemployment consistent with “maximum”\nemployment, often referred to as u*. This decline in u* may be due in part to higher\n3 For evidence of a fall in neutral rates of interest in the United States and abroad, see, among several\ncontributions, King and Low (2014); Holston, Laubach, and Williams (2017); Rachel and Smith (2017);\nand Brand, Bielecki, and Penalver (2018).\n4 For assessments of the risks that U.S. monetary policy will be constrained by the effective lower bound\nand its implications for economic activity and inflation, see Kiley and Roberts (2017), Erceg and others\n(2018), Swanson (2018), and Chung and others (2019).\n\n- 4 -\neducational attainment and a larger proportion of older workers in the workforce today\nrelative to the workforce of past decades.5 If u* is lower than historical estimates\nsuggest, this would imply that, even with today’s historically low unemployment rate, the\nlabor market would not be as tight—and inflationary pressures would not be as strong—\nas one would expect, based on historical estimates of u*. Indeed, I believe the range of\nplausible estimates for u* may extend to 4 percent or even below.\nI also note that the decline in the unemployment rate in recent years has been\naccompanied by a pronounced increase in labor force participation for individuals in their\nprime working years.6 It has also been accompanied since 2014 by a rise in labor’s share\nof national income. As I have documented previously, in the past several U.S. business\ncycles, labor’s share has risen as those expansions proceeded because workers command\nhigher wages in a stronger labor market; notably, in those cycles, the rise in labor’s share\ndid not pass through to faster price inflation.7 The previously mentioned increase in\nprime-age labor force participation has provided employers with a source of additional\nlabor input and has been one factor restraining inflationary pressures. Notwithstanding\nthese recent gains, prime-age participation rates remain somewhat below levels achieved\nin the 1990s and may still have some more room to run. If so, then potential output could\nbe higher than many current estimates suggest.\nOver the past few years, we have also seen evidence of a pickup in U.S.\nproductivity growth, albeit from the very depressed average pace that prevailed\n5 More-educated workers and older workers both have lower structural unemployment rates, at least\nhistorically; see Aaronson, Hu, Seifoddini, and Sullivan (2015).\n6 The box “The Labor Force Participation Rate for Prime-Age Individuals” in the Board’s July 2018\nMonetary Policy Report contains a discussion of recent developments in labor force participation rates for\nprime-age individuals; see Board of Governors (2018, pp. 8–10).\n7 For more on labor’s share of national income and price inflation, see Clarida (2014, 2016).\n\n- 5 -\nthroughout most of the expansion. Indeed, as of the first quarter of this year, productivity\nin the nonfarm business sector rose 2.4 percent over the previous four quarters, its fastest\npace since 2010 when the U.S. economy was coming out of the Great Recession. By\ncontrast, in both the 2001–07 and 1982–90 economic expansions, productivity growth\nwas actually slowing relative to its average pace during those expansions. That said,\nwhile identifying inflection points in trend productivity growth in real time is notoriously\ndifficult, a pickup in trend productivity growth relative to the pace that prevailed earlier\nin the expansion is a possibility that we should not, I believe, dismiss.8\nAnother structural change relevant for monetary policy is that price inflation\nappears less responsive to resource slack than it did in the past. That is, the short-run\nprice Phillips curve appears to have flattened, implying a change in the dynamic\nrelationship between inflation and employment.9 A flatter Phillips curve is, in a sense, a\nproverbial double-edged sword. It permits the Federal Reserve to support employment\nmore aggressively during downturns—as was the case during and after the Great\nRecession—because a sustained inflation breakout is less likely when the Phillips curve\nis flatter.10 However, a flatter Phillips curve also increases the cost, in terms of economic\noutput, of reversing unwelcome increases in longer-run inflation expectations. Thus, a\n8 For more on productivity growth, see Brynjolfsson, Rock, and Syverson (forthcoming).\n9 For evidence of a flattening of the slope of the Phillips curve in the United States and abroad, see, among\nothers, Simon, Matheson, and Sandri (2013); Blanchard, Cerutti, and Summers (2015); and Bank for\nInternational Settlements (2017).\n10 One potential contributor to the flattening of the Phillips curve is a change in the conduct of monetary\npolicy since the 1980s toward greater stabilization of inflation and economic activity; for evidence of such\na change, see Clarida, Galí, and Gertler (2000); Boivin and Giannoni (2006); and Boivin, Kiley, and\nMishkin (2010). As discussed in Roberts (2006) and Bullard (2018), greater stabilization on the part of a\ncentral bank can lead to the estimation of flatter Phillips curves in reduced-form regressions. Similarly, the\nadoption of an explicit inflation objective, along with greater certainty regarding the conduct of monetary\npolicy, can help anchor longer-term inflation expectations and stabilize actual inflation in response to\nshocks.\n\n- 6 -\nflatter Phillips curve makes it all the more important that longer-run inflation\nexpectations remain anchored at levels consistent with our 2 percent inflation objective.11\nTextbook macroeconomics teaches us that understanding the economy and getting\nmonetary policy right requires that we do our best to understand if—and if so, how—the\nforces of aggregate demand and supply are evolving relative to historical experience and\nthe predictions of our models. While predicting the future is difficult, with available data\nit appears that in 2018 and in the first quarter of 2019, the supply side of the economy—\nemployment, participation, and productivity—expanded faster than most forecasters\noutside and inside the Fed expected. Notwithstanding robust growth in demand over\nthese five quarters, PCE price inflation fell somewhat short of the Fed’s 2 percent\nobjective. With this background, let me now turn to the outlook for U.S. monetary\npolicy.\nMonetary Policy\nAs I mentioned earlier, my colleagues and I on the FOMC understand that our\npriority today is to put in place policies that will help sustain maximum employment and\nprice stability in an economy that appears to be operating close to both of our dual-\nmandate objectives. In our most recent statements, we have indicated that “the\n11 See Yellen (2015) for a discussion of inflation dynamics and monetary policy, and see Erceg and others\n(2018) for a quantitative exploration of the monetary policy implications of a flat Phillips curve in an\nuncertain economic environment. Since the mid-1980s, movements in both realized inflation and measures\nof longer-term inflation expectations have been somewhat muted, complicating the task of extracting the\nprecise role of inflation expectations as a determinant of realized inflation. Faust and Wright (2013) review\nthe literature on inflation forecasting and present evidence in support of the conclusion that measures of\ninflation expectations help predict the trend in inflation. Cecchetti and others (2017) show that while the\nlevel of realized inflation and four-quarter-ahead inflation expectations are positively correlated, changes in\nthese variables have been largely uncorrelated since the mid-1980s. These authors suggest that, in a low\nand stable inflation environment, policymakers should pay attention to a wide array of other indicators in\ndetermining the implications of movements in realized inflation and measures of inflation expectations.\n\n- 7 -\nCommittee will be patient as it determines what future adjustments to the . . . federal\nfunds rate may be appropriate to support” our dual-mandate objectives.12 What does this\nmean in practice? To me, it means that we should allow the data on the U.S. economy to\nflow in and inform our future decisions.\nI believe that the path for the federal funds rate should be data dependent in two\ndistinct ways.13 Monetary policy should be data dependent in the sense that incoming\ndata reveal at any point in time where the economy is relative to the ultimate objectives\nof price stability and maximum employment. This information on where the economy is\nrelative to the goals of monetary policy is an important input into interest rate feedback\nrules. Data dependence in this sense is well understood, as it is of the type implied by a\nlarge family of policy rules, including Taylor-type rules, in which the parameters of the\neconomy needed to formulate such rules are taken as known.\nBut, of course, key parameters needed to formulate such rules, including u* and\nr*, are unknown. As a result, in the real world, monetary policy should be—and in the\nUnited States, I believe, is—data dependent in a second sense: Policymakers should and\ndo study incoming data and use models to extract signals that enable them to update and\nimprove estimates of r* and u*. Consistent with my earlier discussion, in the Summary\nof Economic Projections, FOMC participants have, over the past seven years, repeatedly\nrevised down their estimates of both u* and r* as unemployment fell and real interest\nrates remained well below previous estimates of neutral without the rise in inflation those\nearlier estimates would have predicted. And these revisions to u* and r* appeared to\n12 For example, see the May 2019 FOMC statement at Board of Governors (2019c), p.1.\n13 For discussions on the federal funds rate and data dependency, see Clarida (2018a, 2018b).\n\n- 8 -\nhave had an important influence on the path for the policy rate actually implemented in\nrecent years.\nIn addition to u* and r*, another important input into any monetary policy\nassessment is the state of inflation expectations. Indeed, I believe price stability requires\nthat not only actual inflation be centered at our 2 percent objective, but also that expected\ninflation be equal to our 2 percent inflation objective. Unlike realized inflation, inflation\nexpectations themselves are not directly observable; they must be inferred from\neconometric models, market prices, and surveys of households and firms. As I assess the\ntotality of the evidence, I judge that, at present, indicators suggest that longer-term\ninflation expectations sit at the low end of a range that I consider consistent with our\nprice-stability mandate.\nWhere does this leave us today? As I already noted, the U.S. economy is in a\nvery good place, with the unemployment rate near a 50-year low, inflationary pressures\nmuted, expected inflation stable, and GDP growth solid and projected to remain so.\nMoreover, the federal funds rate is now in the range of estimates of its longer-run neutral\nlevel, and the unemployment rate is not far below many estimates of u*. Plugging these\ninputs into a 1993 Taylor-type rule produces a federal funds rate between 2.25 and\n2.5 percent, which is the range for the policy rate that the FOMC has reaffirmed since our\nJanuary meeting. Most recently, the Committee judged at our May meeting that the\ncurrent stance of policy remains appropriate, and that decision reflects our view that some\nof the softness in recent inflation data will prove to be transitory. This judgment aligns\nwith some private-sector forecasts, which now project PCE inflation to return to 2 percent\nby 2020. However, if the incoming data were to show a persistent shortfall in inflation\n\n- 9 -\nbelow our 2 percent objective or were it to indicate that global economic and financial\ndevelopments present a material downside risk to our baseline outlook, then these are\ndevelopments that the Committee would take into account in assessing the appropriate\nstance for monetary policy.\nMonetary Policy Implementation and Balance Sheet Decisions\nSince the beginning of the year, the FOMC has made several important decisions\nabout how it will implement monetary policy and how it will conclude the process of\nnormalizing the size of its balance sheet. These decisions have been made over several\nmeetings and have been part of an ongoing process of the Committee’s deliberations.\nPlease allow me to summarize them now.\nThe FOMC decided at its January meeting to continue to implement monetary\npolicy in a regime with an ample supply of reserves—a regime often referred to as a floor\nsystem.14 Such a system, which has been in place since late 2008, does not require the\nactive management of reserves through daily open market operations. Instead, with an\nample level of reserves in the banking system, the effective federal funds rate will settle\nat or slightly above the rate of interest paid on excess reserves (IOER).15 This system has\nproven to be an efficient means of controlling the policy rate and effectively transmitting\nthe stance of policy to a wide array of other money market instruments and to broader\nfinancial conditions. The FOMC continues to view the target range for the federal funds\nrate as its primary means of adjusting and communicating the stance of monetary policy,\nalthough in doing so, we must and do take into account how our balance sheet size,\n14 For information on monetary policy implementation and balance sheet normalization, see Board of\nGovernors (2019a).\n15 The offered rate on the Overnight Reverse Repo Facility is an additional administered rate used to\ncontrol the level of the federal fund rate.\n\n- 10 -\ncomposition, and trajectory impact broader financial conditions. And as we stated in\nJanuary, although adjustments in the target range for the federal funds rate are our\nprimary tool for adjusting the stance of monetary policy, we are prepared to adjust the\ndetails of the plans for balance sheet normalization based on economic and financial\ndevelopments.\nAt its March meeting, the Committee announced that it would slow the pace of\nthe runoff of the securities holdings in its SOMA portfolio, and that it plans to cease\nbalance sheet runoff entirely by September.16 Since starting the process of balance sheet\nnormalization in 2017, the Federal Reserve’s securities portfolio has shrunk by about\n$500 billion (roughly 2-1/2 percent of GDP) and the level of reserve balances has\ndeclined about $700 billion. Consistent with our decision in March, we began to slow the\npace of runoff of our balance sheet earlier this month. When the process of normalizing\nthe size of our balance sheet concludes in September, we expect that our reserves\nliabilities will, for a time, likely remain somewhat above the level necessary for an\nefficient and effective implementation of monetary policy. If so, we plan after September\nto hold the size of our securities holdings constant for a while. During this period,\nreserve balances will continue to decline gradually as currency and other nonreserve\nliabilities increase. At the point that the Committee judges that reserve balances have\ndeclined to the level consistent with the efficient and effective implementation of\n16 Specifically, we slowed the balance sheet runoff in May by reducing the cap for monthly redemptions of\nTreasury securities from $30 billion to $15 billion; see Board of Governors (2019b).\n\n- 11 -\nmonetary policy, we plan to resume periodic open market operations to accommodate the\nnormal trend growth in the demand for our liabilities.17\nAs balance sheet normalization has progressed, the effective federal funds rate has\nfirmed relative to the IOER rate. Last year, after the federal funds rate moved up closer\nto the top of the target range set by the FOMC, we made technical adjustments in our\noperations by lowering the IOER rate relative to the top of the target range by 5 basis\npoints in June and then again in December to keep the federal funds rate well within its\ntarget range. At our May FOMC meeting, we made another technical adjustment in the\nIOER rate, reducing it by another 5 basis points to 2.35 percent. Since then, the effective\nfederal funds rate has been trading close to the level where it began the year.\nReview of Monetary Policy Strategy, Tools, and Communications\nBefore I conclude my prepared remarks, allow me to say a few words about our\nreview of our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices.18 While we\nbelieve that our existing approach to conducting monetary policy has served the public\nwell, the purpose of this review is to evaluate and assess possible refinements that might\nhelp us best achieve our dual-mandate objectives on a sustained basis.\nWith the U.S. economy operating at or close to our maximum-employment and\nprice-stability goals, now is an especially opportune time to conduct this review. We\nwant to ensure that we are well positioned to continue to meet our statutory goals in\n17 In contrast to the Federal Reserve’s large-scale asset purchases conducted over recent years, these\nperiodic technical open market operations would not have any implication for the stance of monetary\npolicy; rather, such operations would be aimed at maintaining a level of reserve balances in the banking\nsystem consistent with efficient and effective policy implementation.\n18 Additional information about the review, including background information on the initiative and a listing\nof events around the country, is available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review-of-monetary-policy-strategy-tools-and-\ncommunications.htm.\n\n- 12 -\ncoming years. Furthermore, the shifts in r* and u*, as well as the flattening of the\nPhillips curve that I discussed earlier, suggest that the U.S. and foreign economies have\nevolved in significant ways relative to the pre-crisis experience.\nThe Federal Reserve System is currently conducting “town hall”-style Fed Listens\nevents, in which we are hearing from a broad range of interested individuals and groups,\nincluding business and labor leaders, community development advocates, and\nacademics. In addition, we are holding a System research conference next week at the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago that will feature speakers and panelists from outside\nthe Fed. Building on both the perspectives we hear and staff analysis, the FOMC will\nconduct its own assessment of its monetary policy framework, beginning around the\nmiddle of the year. We will share our conclusions with the public in the first half\nof 2020.\nThe economy is constantly evolving, bringing with it new policy challenges. So it\nmakes sense for us to remain open minded as we assess current practices and consider\nideas that could potentially enhance our ability to deliver on the goals the Congress has\nassigned us. For this reason, my colleagues and I do not want to prejudge or predict our\nultimate findings. What I can say is that any refinements or more-material changes to our\nframework that we might make will be aimed solely at enhancing our ability to achieve\nand sustain our dual-mandate objectives of maximum employment and stable prices.\nThank you very much, and I look forward to your questions.\n\n- 13 -\nReferences\nAaronson, Daniel, Luojia Hu, Arian Seifoddini, and Daniel G.

    "text": "January 08, 2021\n\nVice Chair Richard H. Clarida\n\nAt the C. Peter McColough Series on International Economics Council on Foreign Relations, New York, New York (via webcast)\n\nIt is my pleasure to meet virtually with you today at the Council on Foreign Relations. 1 I regret that we are not doing this session in person, as we did last year, and I hope the next time I am back, we will be gathering together in New York City again. I look forward to my conversation with Steve Liesman and to your questions, but first, please allow me to offer a few remarks on the economic outlook, Federal Reserve monetary policy, and our new monetary policy framework.\n\nCurrent Economic Situation and Outlook In the second quarter of last year, the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic and the mitigation efforts put in place to contain it delivered the most severe blow to the U.S. economy since the Great Depression. Economic activity rebounded robustly in the third quarter and has continued to recover in the fourth quarter from its depressed second-quarter level, though the pace of improvement has moderated. Household spending on goods, especially durable goods, has been strong and has moved above its pre-pandemic level, supported in part by federal stimulus payments and expanded unemployment benefits. In contrast, spending on services remains well below pre-pandemic levels, particularly in sectors that typically require people to gather closely, including travel and hospitality. In the labor market, more than half of the 22 million jobs that were lost in March and April have been regained, as many people were able to return to work. Inflation, following large declines in the spring of 2020, picked up over the summer but has leveled out more recently; for those sectors that have been most adversely affected by the pandemic, price increases remain subdued.\n\nWhile gross domestic product growth in the fourth quarter downshifted from the once-in-a-century 33 percent annualized rate of growth reported in the third quarter, it is clear that since the spring of 2020, the economy has turned out to be more resilient in adapting to the virus, and more responsive to monetary and fiscal policy support, than many predicted. Indeed, it is worth highlighting that in the baseline projections of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) summarized in the latest Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), most of my colleagues and I revised up our outlook for the economy over the medium term, projecting a relatively rapid return to levels of employment and inflation consistent with the Federal Reserve's statutory mandate as compared with the recovery from the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). 2 In particular, the median FOMC participant projects that by the end of 2023âa little less than three years from nowâthe unemployment rate will have fallen below 4 percent, and PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation will have returned to 2 percent. Following the GFC, it took more than eight years for employment and inflation to return to similar mandate-consistent levels.\n\nWhile the recent surge in new COVID cases and hospitalizations is cause for concern and a source of downside risk to the very near-term outlook, the welcome news on the development of several effective vaccines indicates to me that the prospects for the economy in 2021 and beyond have brightened and the downside risk to the outlook has diminished. The two new SEP charts that we released for the first time following the December FOMC meeting speak to these issues by providing information on how the risks and uncertainties that surround the modal or baseline projections have evolved over time. While nearly all participants continued to judge that the level of uncertainty about the economic outlook remains elevated, fewer participants saw the balance of risks as weighted to the downside than in September. Although a little more than half of participants judged risks to be broadly balanced for economic activity, a similar number continued to see risks weighted to the downside for inflation.\n\nThe Latest FOMC Decision and the New Monetary Policy Framework At our most recent FOMC meetings, the Committee made important changes to our policy statement that upgraded our forward guidance about the future path of the federal funds rate and asset purchases, and that also provided unprecedented information about our policy reaction function. As announced in the September statement and reiterated in November and December, with inflation running persistently below 2 percent, our policy will aim to achieve inflation outcomes that keep inflation expectations well anchored at our 2 percent longer-run goal. 3 We expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomesâas well as our maximum-employment mandateâare achieved. We also expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment, until inflation has risen to 2 percent, and until inflation is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.\n\nIn addition, in the December statement, we combined our forward guidance for the federal fund rate with enhanced, outcome-based guidance about our asset purchases. We indicated that we will continue to increase our holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and our holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.\n\nThe changes to the policy statement that we made over the fall bring our policy guidance in line with the new framework outlined in the revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy that the Committee approved last August. 4 In our new framework, we acknowledge that policy decisions going forward will be based on the FOMC's estimates of \" shortfalls [emphasis added] of employment from its maximum level\"ânot \"deviations.\" This language means that going forward, a low unemployment rate, in and of itself, will not be sufficient to trigger a tightening of monetary policy absent any evidence from other indicators that inflation is at risk of moving above mandate-consistent levels. With regard to our price-stability mandate, while the new statement maintains our definition that the longer-run goal for inflation is 2 percent, it elevates the importanceâand the challengeâof keeping inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent in a world in which an effective-lower-bound constraint is, in downturns, binding on the federal funds rate. To this end, the new statement conveys the Committee's judgment that, in order to anchor expectations at the 2 percent level consistent with price stability, it \"seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time,\" andâin the same sentenceâthat therefore \"following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.\" As Chair Powell indicated in his Jackson Hole remarks, we think of our new framework as an evolution from \"flexible inflation targeting\" to \"flexible average inflation targeting.\" 5 While this new framework represents a robust evolution in our monetary policy strategy, this strategy is in service to the dual-mandate goals of monetary policy assigned to the Federal Reserve by the Congressâmaximum employment and price stabilityâwhich remain unchanged. 6\n\nConcluding Remarks While our interest rate and balance sheet tools are providing powerful support to the economy and will continue to do so as the recovery progresses, it will take some time for economic activity and employment to return to levels that prevailed at the business cycle peak reached last February. We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy and to help ensure that the recovery from this difficult period will be as robust as possible.\n\n1.

    "text": "April 14, 2021\n\nVice Chair Richard H. Clarida\n\nAt \"SOMC: The Federal Reserveâs New Policy Framework\" a forum sponsored by the Manhattan Institute's Shadow Open Market Committee, New York, New York (via webcast)\n\nOn August 27, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) unanimously approved a revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, and, at its September and December FOMC meetings, the Committee made material changes to its forward guidance to bring it into line with this new policy framework. 1 Before I discuss the new framework and the policy implications that flow from it, I will first review some important changes in the U.S. economy that motivated the Committee to assess ways we could refine our strategy, tools, and communication practices to achieve and sustain our goals in the economy in which we operate today and for the foreseeable future. 2\n\nShifting Stars and the End of \"Copacetic Coincidence\" Perhaps the most significant change in our understanding of the economy since the Federal Reserve formally adopted inflation targeting in 2012 has been the substantial decline in estimates of the neutral real interest rate, r*, that, over the longer run, is consistent with our maximum-employment and price-stability mandates. Whereas in January 2012 the median FOMC participant projected a longer-run r* of 2.25 percent and a neutral nominal policy rate of 4.25 percent, as of March 2021, the median FOMC participant projected a longer-run r* equal to just 0.5 percent, which implies a neutral setting for the federal funds rate of 2.5 percent. 3 Moreover, as is well appreciated, the decline in neutral policy rates since the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) is a global phenomenon that is widely expected by forecasters and financial markets to persist for years to come (Clarida, 2019).\n\nThe substantial decline in the neutral policy rate since 2012 has critical implications for monetary policy because it leaves the FOMC with less conventional policy space to cut rates to offset adverse shocks to aggregate demand. This development, in turn, makes it more likely that recessions will impart elevated risks of more persistent downward pressure on inflation and inflation expectations as well as upward pressure on unemployment that the Federal Reserve's monetary policy shouldâin design and implementationâseek to offset throughout the business cycle and not just in downturns themselves.\n\nWith regard to inflation expectations, there is broad agreement that achieving price stability on a sustainable basis requires that long-run inflation expectations be well anchored at the rate of inflation consistent with the price-stability goal. The pre-GFC academic literature (Clarida, Galí, and Gertler, 1999; Woodford, 2003) derived the important result that a credible inflation-targeting monetary policy strategy that is not constrained by the effective lower bound (ELB) can deliver, under either rational expectations or linear least-squares learning (Bullard and Mitra, 2002), inflation expectations that themselves are well anchored at the inflation target. In other words, absent a binding ELB constraint, a policy that targets actual inflation in these models delivers long-run inflation expectations well anchored at the target \"for free.\" And, indeed, in the 15 years before December 2008, when the federal funds rate first hit the ELBâa period when, de facto, if not de jure the Federal Reserve conducted a monetary policy that was interpreted to be targeting an inflation rate of 2 percent (Clarida, Galí, and Gertler, 2000)âpersonal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation averaged very close to 2 percent (see figure 1 ).\n\nBut this \"copacetic coincidence\" no longer holds in a world of low r* in which adverse aggregate demand shocks drive the economy in downturns to the ELB. In this case, economic analysis indicates that flexible inflation-targeting monetary policy cannot be relied on to deliver inflation expectations that are anchored at the target but instead will tend to deliver inflation expectations that, in each business cycle, become anchored at a level below the target (Mishkin, 2016). This finding is the crucial insight in my colleague John Williams's research with Thomas Mertens (2019) and in the research of Bernanke, Kiley, and Roberts (2019). This downward bias in inflation expectations under inflation targeting in an ELB world can in turn reduce already scarce policy spaceâbecause nominal interest rates reflect both real rates and expected inflationâand it can open up the risk of the downward spiral in both actual and expected inflation that has been observed in some other major economies.\n\nTwo other, related developments that have also become more evident than they appeared in 2012 are that price inflation seems empirically to be less responsive to resource slack, and that estimates of resource slack based on historically estimated price Phillips curve relationships are less reliable and subject to more material revision than was once commonly believed. For example, in the face of declining unemployment rates that did not result in excessive cost-push pressure to price inflation, the median of the Committee's projections of u*âthe rate of unemployment consistent in the longer run with the 2 percent inflation objectiveâhas been repeatedly revised lower, from 5.5 percent in January 2012 to 4 percent as of the March 2021 Summary of Economic Projections (SEP). In the past several years of the previous expansion, declines in the unemployment rate occurred in tandem with a notable and, to me, welcome increase in real wages that was accompanied by an increase in labor's share of national income, but not a surge in price inflation to a pace inconsistent with our price-stability mandate and well-anchored inflation expectations. Indeed, this pattern of mid-cycle declines in unemployment coincident with noninflationary increases in real wages and labor's share has been evident in the U.S. data since the 1990s (Clarida, 2016; Heise, Karahan, and Sahin, 2020; Feroli, Silver, and Edgerton, 2021).\n\nThe New Framework and Price Stability I will now discuss the implications of the new framework for the Federal Reserve's price-stability mandate before turning to its implications for the maximum-employment mandate. Five features of the new framework and fall 2020 FOMC statements define how the Committee will seek to achieve its price-stability mandate over time.\n\nFirst, the Committee expects to delay liftoff from the ELB until PCE inflation has risen to 2 percent and other complementary conditions, consistent with achieving this goal on a sustained basis, have also been met. 4\n\nSecond, with inflation having run persistently below 2 percent, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time in the service of keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored at the 2 percent longer-run goal. 5\n\nThird, the Committee expects that appropriate monetary policy will remain accommodative for some time after the conditions to commence policy normalization have been met. 6\n\nFourth, policy will aim over time to return inflation to its longer-run goal, which remains 2 percent, but not below, once the conditions to commence policy normalization have been met. 7\n\nFifth, inflation that averages 2 percent over time represents an ex ante aspiration of the FOMC but not a time inconsistent ex post commitment. 8\n\nAs I highlighted in speeches at the Brookings Institution in November and the Hoover Institution in January, I believe that a useful way to summarize the framework defined by these five features is temporary price-level targeting (TPLT, at the ELB) that reverts to flexible inflation targeting (once the conditions for liftoff have been reached) . 9 Just such a framework has been analyzed by Bernanke, Kiley, and Roberts (2019) and Bernanke (2020), who in turn build on earlier work by Evans (2012), Reifschneider and Williams (2000), and Eggertsson and Woodford (2003), among many others.\n\nA policy that delays liftoff from the ELB until a threshold for average inflation has been reached is one element of a TPLT strategy. Starting with our September FOMC statement, we communicated that inflation reaching 2 percent is a necessary condition for liftoff from the ELB. TPLT with such a one-year memory has been studied by Bernanke, Kiley, and Roberts (2019). The FOMC also indicated in these statements that the Committee expects to delay liftoff until inflation is \"on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.\" What \"moderately\" and \"for some time\" mean will depend on the initial conditions at liftoff (just as they do under other versions of TPLT), and the Committee's judgment on the projected duration and magnitude of the deviation from the 2 percent inflation goal will be communicated in the quarterly SEP for inflation.\n\nOur new framework is asymmetric. That is, as in the TPLT studies cited earlier, the goal of monetary policy after lifting off from the ELB is to return inflation to its 2 percent longer-run goal, but not to push inflation below 2 percent. In the case of the Federal Reserve, we have highlighted that making sure that inflation expectations remain anchored at our 2 percent objective is just such a consideration. Speaking for myself, I follow closely the Fed staff's index of common inflation expectations (CIE)âwhich is now updated quarterly on the Board's websiteâas a relevant indicator that this goal is being met (see figure 2 ). 10 Other things being equal, my desired pace of policy normalization post liftoff to return inflation to 2 percent would be somewhat slower than otherwise if the CIE index at the time of liftoff is below the pre-ELB level.\n\nOur framework aims ex ante for inflation to average 2 percent over time but does not make a commitment to achieve ex post inflation outcomes that average 2 percent under any and all circumstances. The same is true for the TPLT studies I cited earlier. In these studies, the only way in which average inflation enters the policy rule is through the timing of liftoff itself. Yet in stochastic simulations of the FRB/US model under TPLT with a one-year memory that reverts to flexible inflation targeting after liftoff, inflation does average very close to 2 percent (see the table ). The model of Mertens and Williams (2019) delivers a similar outcome: Even though the policy reaction function in their model does not incorporate an ex post makeup element, it delivers a long-run (unconditional) average rate of inflation equal to target by aiming for a moderate inflation overshoot away from the ELB that is calibrated to offset the inflation shortfall caused by the ELB.\n\nThe New Framework and Maximum Employment I turn now to the maximum-employment mandate. An important evolution in our new framework is that the Committee now defines maximum employment as the highest level of employment that does not generate sustained pressures that put the price-stability mandate at risk. 11 As a practical matter, this means to me that when the unemployment rate is elevated relative to my SEP projection of its long-run natural level, monetary policy should, as before, continue to be calibrated to eliminate such employment shortfalls, so long as doing so does not put the price-stability mandate at risk. Indeed, in our September and subsequent FOMC statements, we indicated that we expect it will be appropriate to keep the federal funds rate in the current 0 to 25 basis point target range until inflation has reached 2 percent (on an annual basis) and labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessment of maximum employment. Moreover, in our December and subsequent FOMC statements, we have indicated that we expect to continue our Treasury and MBS purchases at least at the current pace until we have made substantial further progress toward achieving these dual mandate goals. In our new framework, when in a business cycle expansion labor market indicators return to a range that in the Committee's judgment is broadly consistent with its maximum-employment mandate, it will be data on inflation itself that policy will react to, but, going forward, policy will not tighten solely because the unemployment rate has fallen below any particular econometric estimate of its long-run natural level. Of note, the relevance of uncertainty about the natural rate of unemployment or the output gap for monetary policy reaction functions is a long-studied topic that remains important. 12 For example, Berge (2020) provides a discussion around the difficult task of estimating the output gap (see figure 3 ).\n\nThese considerations have an important implication for the Taylor-type policy reaction function I consult. Consistent with our new framework, the relevant policy rule benchmark I will consult once the conditions for liftoff have been met is an inertial Taylor-type rule with a coefficient of zero on the unemployment gap, a coefficient of 1.5 on the gap between core PCE inflation and the 2 percent longer-run goal, and a neutral real policy rate equal to my SEP projection of long-run r*. 13 The most recent Monetary Policy Report features a box on policy rules, including a Taylor-type \"shortfalls\" rule in which the federal funds rate reacts only to shortfalls of employment from the Committee's best judgment of its maximum level but reverts to the rule previously described once that level of employment is reached (see figure 4 ). 14\n\nConcluding Remarks In closing, I think of our new flexible average inflation-targeting framework as a combination of TPLT at the ELB, to which TPLT reverts once the conditions to commence policy normalization articulated in our most recent FOMC statement have been met. In this sense, our new framework indeed represents an evolution, not a revolution, from the flexible inflation-targeting framework in place since 2012. Thank you very much for your time and attention, and I look forward to my conversation with Peter Ireland and Athanasios Orphanides.\n\nReferences Ahn, Hie Joo, and Chad Fulton (2020). \" Index of Common Inflation Expectations ,\" FEDS Notes.

The Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy articulates the inflation objective: \"The Committee reaffirms its judgment that inflation at the rate of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is most consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve's statutory mandate\" (paragraph 4). The FOMC statements starting with September 2020 indicate the conditions for liftoff: \"The Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time\" (paragraph 4).

The Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy articulates this concept with the following: \"The maximum level of employment is a broad-based and inclusive goal that is not directly measurable and changes over time owing largely to nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and dynamics of the labor market. Consequently, it would not be appropriate to specify a fixed goal for employment; rather, the Committee's policy decisions must be informed by assessments of the shortfalls of employment from its maximum level, recognizing that such assessments are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision. The Committee considers a wide range of indicators in making these assessments\" (paragraph 3). Return to text\n\n12. The findings of Orphanides and van Norden (2002)âthat output gap uncertainty in real time is enormousâremain true today. Moreover, as shown by several studies, including Orphanides and others (2000) and Smets (2002), \"gap\" uncertainty is relevant for the formulation of simple policy rules that feedback on endogenous macro outcomes (for, say, inflation and unemployment) rather than on \"primitive\" shocks (such as to productivity or demand). In fact, in the former case, certainty equivalence will in general not hold. Indeed, Orphanides and others (2000) and Smets (2002) show that if monetary policy is implemented with a Taylor-type rule, as output gap uncertainty increases, the optimal Taylor rule coefficient on the output gap is reduced and, if it is large enough, can be driven to zero. Orphanides and Williams (2005) make a case for monetary policy that responds less to imprecise movements in unemployment gaps and more to actual inflation in an estimated model with agents who learn over time. Finally, even if, counterfactually, gap variables were observed without error, the reduced-form theoretical relationship between slack and price inflation will in general depend on the cyclical properties of markups and labor's share, as is shown, for example, in the DSGE (dynamic stochastic general equilibrium) model of Ireland (2004). And as previously discussed, at least over the past 25 years in the United States, mid-cycle increases in productivity-adjusted wages that occur in tandem with falling unemploymentâthe wage Phillips curve relationshipâhave not been passed through to faster consumer price inflation but have empirically been absorbed in lower markups. Return to text\n\n13. Such a reference rule is similar to the forward-looking Taylor-type rule for optimal monetary policy derived in Clarida, Galí, and Gertler (1999). Return to text\n\n14. See the box \"Monetary Policy Rules and Shortfalls from Maximum Employment\" in Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2021). Note that under the FOMC's outcome-based guidance in place since September 2020, a necessary condition for liftoff from the ELB is that it judges that \"shortfalls\" from maximum employment have been eliminated. See Fuentes-Albero and Roberts (2021) for simulations of the FRB/US model with a shortfalls policy rule and an inflation threshold. Return to text\n\nAccessible Version",

    "text": "March 25, 2021\n\nVice Chair Richard H. Clarida\n\nAt the 2021 Institute of International Finance Washington Policy Summit, Washington, D.C. (via webcast)\n\nIt is my pleasure to meet virtually with you today at the 2021 Institute of International Finance (IIF) Washington Policy Summit. 1 I regret that we are not doing this session in person, but I do hope next time we will be gathering together in Washington. I look forward, as always, to a conversation with my good friend and one-time colleague Tim Adams, but first, please allow me to offer a few remarks on the economic outlook, Federal Reserve monetary policy, and our new monetary policy framework.\n\nCurrent Economic Situation and Outlook In the second quarter of last year, the COVID-19 pandemic and the mitigation efforts put in place to contain it delivered the most severe blow to the U.S. economy since the Great Depression. Gross domestic product (GDP) collapsed at a roughly 31.5 percent annual rate in the second quarter of 2020, more than 22 million jobs were lost in March and April, and the unemployment rate rose from a 50-year low of 3.5 percent in February to almost 15 percent in April. Since then, economic activity has rebounded, and it is clear that the economy has proven to be much more resilient than many forecast or feared one year ago. GDP grew by almost 8 percent at an annual rate in the second half of last year, and private forecasters project that GDP will grow roughly 6 percentâand possibly 7 percentâthis year. As shown in the latest Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), the median of Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants' projections for 2021 GDP growth is 6.5 percent. 2 If these projections are realized, GDP will grow at the fastest four-quarter pace since 1984. And, as this is a virtual meeting of the IIF, I would be remiss if I did not highlight that if these projections for U.S. economic activity are realized, rising U.S. imports will serve as an important source of external demand to the rest of the world this year and beyond.\n\nAs with overall economic activity, conditions in the labor market have recently improved. Employment rose by 379,000 in February, as the leisure and hospitality sector recouped about two-thirds of the jobs that were lost in December and January. Nonetheless, employment is still 9.5 million below its pre-pandemic level for the economy as a whole. The unemployment rate remains elevated at 6.2 percent in February, and once one factors in the decline in the labor force since the onset of the pandemic and the misclassification of some workers on temporary layoff as employed, the true unemployment rate is closer to 10 percent.\n\nIt is worth highlighting that in the baseline projections of the FOMC presented in the latest SEP released last week, my colleagues and I substantially revised up our outlook for the economy, projecting a relatively rapid return to levels of employment and inflation consistent with the Federal Reserve's statutory mandate as compared with the recovery from the Global Financial Crisis. In particular, the median FOMC participant now projects the unemployment rate to reach 4.5 percent at the end of this year and 3.5 percent by the end of 2023.\n\nWith regards to inflation, the median inflation projection of FOMC participants is 2.4 percent this year and declines to 2 percent next year before moving back up to 2.1 percent in 2023. Over the next few months, 12-month measures of inflation are expected to move temporarily above our 2 percent longer-run goal, owing to a run of year-over-year comparisons with depressed service-sector prices recorded in the spring of 2020 and supply bottlenecks limiting how quickly production can respond in the near term. However, I expect most of this increase to be transitory and for inflation to return toâor perhaps run somewhat aboveâour 2 percent longer-run goal in 2022 and 2023. This outcome would be entirely consistent with the new framework we adopted in August 2020 and began to implement at our September 2020 FOMC meeting. 3 In our new framework, we aim for inflation outcomes that keep inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent. This means that following periods when inflation has been running below 2 percentâas has been the case for most of the past decadeâmonetary policy will aim for inflation to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. And this brings me to the next topic.\n\nRecent FOMC Decisions and the New Monetary Policy Framework At our most recent FOMC meetings, the Committee made important changes to our policy statement that upgraded our forward guidance about the future path of the federal funds rate and asset purchases, and that also provided unprecedented information about our policy reaction function. As announced in the September statement and reiterated in the following statements, with inflation running persistently below 2 percent, our policy will aim to achieve inflation outcomes that keep inflation expectations well anchored at our 2 percent longer-run goal. 4 We expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomesâas well as our maximum-employment mandateâare achieved. We also expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment, until inflation has risen to 2 percent, and until inflation is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.\n\nIn addition, in our December FOMC statement, the Committee combined our forward guidance for the federal funds rate with enhanced, outcome-based guidance about our asset purchases. We indicated that we will continue to increase our holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and our holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.\n\nThe changes to the policy statement that we made over the past few FOMC meetings bring our policy guidance in line with the new framework outlined in the revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy that the Committee approved last August. In our new framework, we acknowledge that policy decisions going forward will be based on the FOMC's estimates of \" shortfalls [emphasis added] of employment from its maximum level\"ânot \"deviations.\" 5 This language means that going forward, a low unemployment rate, in and of itself, will not be sufficient to trigger a tightening of monetary policy absent any evidence from other indicators that inflation is at risk of moving above mandate-consistent levels. With regard to our price-stability mandate, while the new statement maintains our definition that the longer-run goal for inflation is 2 percent, it elevates the importanceâand the challengeâof keeping inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent in a world in which an effective-lower-bound constraint is, in downturns, binding on the federal funds rate. To this end, the new statement conveys the Committee's judgment that, in order to anchor expectations at the 2 percent level consistent with price stability, it will conduct policy to achieve inflation outcomes that keep long-run inflation expectations anchored at our 2 percent longer-run goal. As Chair Powell indicated in his Jackson Hole remarks, we think of our new framework as an evolution from \"flexible inflation targeting\" to \"flexible average inflation targeting.\" 6 While this new framework represents a robust evolution in our monetary policy strategy, this strategy is in service to the dual-mandate goals of monetary policy assigned to the Federal Reserve by the Congressâmaximum employment and price stabilityâthat remain unchanged. 7\n\nConcluding Remarks While our interest rate and balance sheet tools are providing powerful support to the economy and will continue to do so as the recovery progresses, it will take some time for economic activity and employment to return to levels that prevailed at the business cycle peak reached last February. We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy until the job is well and truly done to help ensure that the economic recovery will be as robust and rapid as possible.\n\n1.

    "text": "February 24, 2021\n\nVice Chair Richard H. Clarida\n\nAt the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Washington, D.C. (via webcast)\n\nVice Chair Clarida delivered identical remarks to the American Chamber of Commerce in Australia's \"Live from America\" webinar series on February 24, 2021.\n\nIt is my pleasure to meet virtually with you today. 1 I look forward to our conversation, but first, please allow me to offer a few remarks on the economic outlook, the Federal Reserve's monetary policy, and our new monetary policy framework.\n\nCurrent Economic Situation and Outlook In the second quarter of last year, the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic and the mitigation efforts put in place to contain it delivered the most severe blow to the U.S. economy since the Great Depression, but economic activity rebounded sharply in the third quarter, supported by a robust and unprecedented fiscal and monetary policy response. More recently, the pace of recovery has moderated in part because of a winter resurgence in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations.\n\nA number of macroeconomic data releases have been weaker than expected in recent months. Spending on services has continued to remain well below pre-pandemic levels, particularly in contact-intensive sectors, including travel, leisure, and hospitality. The pace of improvement in the labor market has slowed notably in recent months. Although more than half of the 22 million jobs that were lost last spring have been regained, the unemployment rate remained elevated at 6.3 percent in January, and once one factors in the decline in the labor force since the onset of the pandemic and misclassification, the true unemployment rate is closer to 10 percent. Core PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation is running at just 1.5 percent, and, for those sectors that have been most adversely affected by the pandemic, price increases remain subdued.\n\nOf course, we have also received some encouraging data. Retail sales stepped up considerably in January, retracing the decline late last year. The housing sector has more than fully recovered from the downturn, supported in part by low mortgage interest rates. Business investment and manufacturing production have also rebounded robustly. And while the economy might not continue to grow at the once-in-a-century 33 percent annualized rate of growth reported in the third quarter of 2020, it is clear that the economy has turned out to be more resilient in adapting to the virus, and more responsive to monetary and fiscal policy support, than many predicted. Indeed, it is worth highlighting that in the baseline projections of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) presented in the latest Summary of Economic Projections, released last December, most of my colleagues and I revised up our outlooks for the economy over the medium term, projecting a relatively rapid return to levels of employment and inflation consistent with the Federal Reserve's statutory mandate as compared with the recovery from the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). 2 In particular, the median FOMC participant projected in December that by the end of 2023âa little less than three years from nowâthe unemployment rate will have fallen below 4 percent, and PCE inflation will have returned to 2 percent. Following the GFC, it took more than eight years for employment and inflation to return to similar mandate-consistent levels.\n\nWhile the winter surge in new COVID cases and the spread of new variants of the virus are cause for concern as well as a source of downside risk to the very near-term outlook, the welcome news on the development of several effective vaccines and the passage by the Congress in late December of a package of fiscal relief measures indicate to me that the prospects for the economy in 2021 and beyond have brightened and the downside risk to the outlook has diminished.\n\nRecent FOMC Decisions and the New Monetary Policy Framework At our most recent FOMC meetings, the Committee made important changes to our policy statement that upgraded our forward guidance about the future path of the federal funds rate and asset purchases, and that also provided unprecedented information about our policy reaction function. As announced in the September statement and reiterated in the following statements, with inflation running persistently below 2 percent, our policy will aim to achieve inflation outcomes that keep inflation expectations well anchored at our 2 percent longer-run goal. 3 We expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomesâas well as our maximum-employment mandateâare achieved. We also expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment, until inflation has risen to 2 percent, and until inflation is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.\n\nIn addition, in the December statement, we combined our forward guidance for the federal funds rate with enhanced, outcome-based guidance about our asset purchases. We indicated that we will continue to increase our holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and our holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.\n\nThe changes to the policy statement that we made over the past few FOMC meetings bring our policy guidance in line with the new framework outlined in the revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy that the Committee approved last August. 4 In our new framework, we acknowledge that policy decisions going forward will be based on the FOMC's estimates of \" shortfalls [emphasis added] of employment from its maximum level\"ânot \"deviations.\" This language means that going forward, a low unemployment rate, in and of itself, will not be sufficient to trigger a tightening of monetary policy absent any evidence from other indicators that inflation is at risk of moving above mandate-consistent levels.

To this end, the new statement conveys the Committee's judgment that, in order to anchor expectations at the 2 percent level consistent with price stability, it \"seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time,\" andâin the same sentenceâthat therefore \"following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.\" As Chair Powell indicated in his Jackson Hole remarks, we think of our new framework as an evolution from \"flexible inflation targeting\" to \"flexible average inflation targeting.\" 5 While this new framework represents a robust evolution in our monetary policy strategy, this strategy is in service to the dual-mandate goals of monetary policy assigned to the Federal Reserve by the Congressâmaximum employment and price stabilityâwhich remain unchanged. 6\n\nConcluding Remarks While our interest rate and balance sheet tools are providing powerful support to the economy and will continue to do so as the recovery progresses, it will take some time for economic activity and employment to return to levels that prevailed at the business cycle peak reached last February.

    "text": "May 17, 2021\n\nVice Chair Richard H. Clarida\n\nAt \"Fostering a Resilient Economy and Financial System: The Role of Central Banks\" 25th Annual Financial Markets Conference, sponsored by the Center for Financial Innovation and Stability, Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Amelia Island, FL (via webcast)\n\nGood morning, and thank you, Raphael. I am delighted to participate in the 25th Financial Markets Conference, sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, which this year focuses on the role of central banks in fostering a resilient economy and financial system. 1\n\nCentral banks can indeed make important contributions to the resilience of the economy and the financial system. In the case of the Federal Reserve, our responsibilities include ensuring that banks are well supervised and regulated, working with other government agencies through the Financial Stability Oversight Council to promote financial stability, and, of course, conducting a U.S. monetary policy that aims to achieve our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability. As the title of my talk suggests, my remarks today will focus on the importance of some specific global financial linkages that are relevant to the execution and communication of U.S. monetary policy aimed at achieving our domestic mandates.\n\nSigns of financial globalization are abundant and evident across markets for many asset classes. But why and in what possible ways is financial globalization relevant for national monetary policies charged with achieving domestic mandates? A comprehensive and complete answer to this fundamental question is, of course, beyond the scope of a single speech, and so in my remarks today, I will focus specifically on two ways in which the integration and globalization of sovereign bond markets is relevant to the execution and communication of national monetary policies.\n\nCentral banks rightly pay a lot of attention to domestic sovereign bond yields \"across the curve\" for at least two reasons. First, yield curves for nominal and inflation-indexed bonds provide usefulâif also noisyâinformation about the expected future path of the policy rate, inflation, the business cycle, and the term premium required to hold sovereign bonds. Second, yields on long-maturity bonds represent, generally, a key channel in the transmission of monetary policy to the real economy and, specifically, are a fundamental building block markets use to discount cash flows relevant for valuing financial assets. To anticipate my bottom line, the message of this speech is that global integration of sovereign bond markets has important implications not only for how central banks extract relevant signals from observed yields on bonds issued by the domestic sovereign, but also for how central banks calibrate the transmission of policy and policy guidance to the real economy via the yields on long-maturity bonds that are relevant for saving, investment, and asset valuation.\n\nSovereign Yields Embed Global Factors There is a rich academic and practitioner literature devoted to modeling and interpreting fluctuations in domestic sovereign yield curves. A fundamental empirical regularity that motivates much of this research is that, across time and geography, yields along any given sovereign curve tend to rise and fallâand steepen and flattenâtogether over time. This empirical regularity led Litterman and Scheinkman (1991) to hypothesize and demonstrate that in the market for U.S. Treasury securities, a very small number of common factorsâtwo or, at most, threeâare able to account not only for most of the time-series variation, but also for the cross-sectional dispersion in yields across the entire Treasury curve. Moreover, the two most empirically important factors extracted statistically from the Treasury yield curve have intuitive geometric interpretations as \"level\" and \"slope.\" The \"level\" factor has approximately an equal effect on yields across the maturity spectrumâthus, changes in the level factor are often referred to as \"parallel shifts\" in the yield curveâand accounts for most of the variance in yields across the full range of maturities. The \"slope\" factor has an effect that is increasing (monotonically) in maturityâthus, changes in the slope factor are often referred to as \"steepening\" or \"flattening\" pivots in the yield curve.\n\nThe original Litterman and Scheinkman factor model, with its geometric interpretation of level and slope factors, has held up remarkably well over the ensuing three decades and has been replicated for sovereign yield curves across scores of countries around the world, revealing similar regularities. Indeed, many, if not most, major central banksâand certainly their central bank watchersâestimate yield curve models and extract the factors that are reflected in their domestic sovereign yield curves. So, for example, for the three major economies included in figure 1 , one can easily extractâusing the methodology developed in Diebold and Li (2006)âon a country-by-country basis, U.S., U.K., and German level factors as well as U.S., U.K., and German slope factors. As is clear from figure 1, level and slope factors extracted from these individual sovereign yield curves are highly correlated across these major sovereign bond markets.\n\nEconomic theory suggests at least two reasons why the factors embedded in sovereign yield curves may be correlated across countries. First, this correlation will be present if the underlying macro fundamentalsâfor example, productivity growth, savingâinvestment imbalances, and longer-term inflation expectationsâthat drive the factors are correlated across countries. 2 Second, as is emphasized in Clarida (2019c) and Obstfeld (2020), this correlation will also be present if countries are tightly financially integrated even if fundamentals themselves are independent across countries. 3\n\nInterpreting the Global Level Factor From any set of level and slope factors extracted across a collection of sovereign yield curves, one can in turn extract a global level factor and a global slope factor that account for the correlation among the country-specific level and slope factors. 4 As can be seen in figure 1, the global level factor (the blue line) accounts for most of the evident downward trend and much of the variation relative to that trend in the estimated U.S., U.K., and German level factors. But what is this global level factor? Plausibly, the global level factor embedded in these three sovereign yield curves reflects the contribution of possibly several global macro fundamental driversâincluding global productivity growth, the balance between global saving and investment, and longer-term inflation expectationsâand likely also other \"market\" or \"technical\" factors specific to the trading of these sovereigns in the global bond market.\n\nAs can be seen in figure 2, however, most of the trend and variation in the global level factor about this trend can be accounted for by the evolution of estimates of the neutral real interest rates in these countries. 5 Figure 2 plots the global level factor against a simple average of the Holston, Laubach, and Williams (2017, henceforth HLW) time-series estimates of $$r\\ast\\ $$âthe neutral real interest rate consistent with trend growth and stable inflationâfor the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany. Now, while it is certainly intuitive that an $$r\\ast\\ $$ index for these countries would be correlated with the global level factor extracted from their yield curves, the degree to which this simple index can account for the trend and variation in the global level factor around this trend is striking. And because central banks, including the Federal Reserve, typically channel Milton Friedman (1968) and believe that the evolution of $$r\\ast\\ $$ primarily reflects nonmonetary factors that are beyond the central bank's control, an \"$$r\\ast\\ $$ theory\" of the level factorâif trueâhas important implications for how central banks extract signal from noise from sovereign yield curves as well as for how they calibrate the stance of monetary policy consistent with a credible inflation target. Under this interpretation, and as was anticipated years ago by Greenspan (2005), Bernanke (2005), Clarida (2005), and others, credible inflation-targeting central banks operating in an integrated global capital marketâat least when they are operating away from their effective lower bound (ELB)âare primarily in the yield curve \"slope\" business, but much less so in the yield curve \"level\" business. 6\n\nFigure 3 shows the relationship between the yield on a 10-year Treasury note and an estimate of the neutral nominal U.S. policy rate, which I set equal to the HLW estimate of $$r\\ast\\ $$ for the United States plus a 2 percent inflation objective, a proxy for the neutral nominal interest rate when longer-term inflation expectations are anchored at the 2 percent target. As is evident from the figure and as can be verified econometrically, there has been since at least the 1990s a stable, mean-reverting dynamic relationship between the benchmark nominal Treasury yield and a neutral nominal interest rate proxy derived from the HLW time-series estimates for $$r\\ast\\ $$ in the United States.\n\nInterpreting the Slope Factor I would now like to illustrate what I mean when I say that the slope of the yield curve is an important channel through which monetary policy is transmitted. Figure 4 plots the Diebold-Li (DL) slope factor for the United Statesâwhich is included in figure 1âagainst the spread between the HLW estimate of the U.S. neutral nominal policy rate and the actual federal funds rate (hereafter the \"policy rate spread\"). As is evident from figure 4 , most of the variation in the DL slope factor for the Treasury yield curve can be accounted for by changes in the U.S. policy rate spread. 7 A simple regression over the 1999:Q1 to 2019:Q4 sample of the slope factor on the policy rate spread shown in figure 4 yields an R 2 of 0.84 with a coefficient on the policy rate spread of 1.23. In other words, over the past 20 years, more than three-fourths of the variance of the Treasury slope factor can be accounted for by the policy rate spread, which is obviously something the Federal Reserve can control when it sets the federal funds rate. The remaining variance of the benchmark Treasury slope factor is, by construction, accounted for by factors that are uncorrelated with the U.S. policy rate spread. A similar empirical relationship between the policy rate spread and the slope factor embedded in gilt and bund yield curves is also evident in the data, although there is some evidence in these markets of a structural break in these relationships between the slope factor and the policy rate spread sometime after the Global Financial Crisis. 8 In the interest of time, I shall not put forward a theory of what accounts for the residual variance of yield curve slope factors after accounting for the policy rate spread itself, but obvious candidates (certainly at the ELB) would include forward guidance about the path of the future policy rate as well as actual and prospective large-scale asset purchase (LSAP) programs.\n\nIdentifying Causation from Bond Yield Correlations It is a truism that \"correlation is not causation,\" and this is especially the case when trying to interpret contemporaneous correlation among asset prices generally and among bond yields in particular. Having identified one possible, parsimonious set of economic fundamentals that can help account for yield curve fluctuations in three major sovereign markets, I will now review what the empirical evidence has to say about the direction of causality reflected in observed correlations among sovereign yields. 9 I will explore two possibilities. The first possibility is that, in reality, there are no latent \"global\" factors whatsoever, but rather there are just U.S. factors that exogenously fluctuate and cause the global correlations in bond yields we observe in the data. There is a vast literature (Claessens, Stracca, and Warnock, 2016, provide an overview) that documents the existence of spillovers from U.S. monetary policy, especially to emerging market (EM) financial conditions, although the recent paper by Hoek, Kamin, and Yoldas (2020) suggests that the degree of those spillovers depends importantly on the source of the shock that triggers changes in Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) policy. In particular, as summarized in figure 5.1 , they identified FOMC actions associated with \"growth news\" as those that were immediately followed by changes in the 10-year Treasury yield and the S&P 500 index in the same direction, whereas actions associated with \"monetary news\" elicited changes in yields and equity prices in opposite directions. Their key finding, illustrated in figure 5.2 , was that FOMC policy rate surprises attributed to stronger U.S. growth generally have only moderate spillovers to EM financial conditions, whereas FOMC policy rate surprises attributed to U.S. inflationary pressures trigger more substantial spillovers to EM financial conditions. Regardless of the type of FOMC policy action, Hoek, Kamin, and Yoldas (2020) also found compelling evidence that the size of the spillover effects from the United States depends importantly on the degree of macroeconomic vulnerability of each emerging market economy (EME), with more vulnerable EMEs experiencing larger spillovers.\n\nWhile I certainly believe that both fundamental and financial shocks originating in the United States propagate throughout the global financial system and likely account for a significant share of the asset price correlations across global markets that we observe in the data, the evidenceâand introspectionâsuggests to me that causality can and often does run both ways. 10 Anecdotally, it is not difficult to recall eventsâplausibly exogenous to the United Statesâthat have triggered spillovers from foreign sovereign markets to the U.S. Treasury market. A prominent example would be the surprise Brexit vote of June 23, 2016. As the news of the Brexit vote filtered through global markets that day, sovereign yields plunged in both Germany and the United States. Indeed, as is shown in figure 6 , on that day, the 10-year Treasury yield fell almost 20 basis points, the single largest one-day decline in the eight yearsâand over 2,000 trading daysâbetween January 2012 and March 2020. 11\n\nThe evidence that two-way causality is reflected in sovereign bond yield correlations is not limited to one-off geopolitical events such as Brexit. For instance, Curcuru, De Pooter, and Eckerd (2018) examined 12 years of monetary policy announcements by the FOMC and the European Central Bank (ECB)âa combined total of 266 monetary policy communicationsâfocusing on how sovereign yields in one jurisdiction responded to monetary policy announcements made in the other. Their main findings are summarized in the two panels in figure 7 . The left panel presents some of the evidence of the well-known, statistically significant spillovers from FOMC policy announcements to euro-area bond markets. But, as is shown in the right panel, the authors found that the spillover effect from ECB policy announcements to U.S. yields is roughly as large as that from the FOMC announcements to bund yields. 12\n\nIn another influential study using a very different identification methodology, Ehrmann, Fratzscher, and Rigobon (2011) estimated significant and approximately equal spillovers from U.S. bond market shocks to EU bond markets, and from EU bond market shocks to the U.S. Treasury market. 13 They attributed their findings to significant incipient and anticipated portfolio allocation flows across the two jurisdictions that respond elastically to expected rate-of-return differentials. 14\n\nConcluding Remarks To sum up, I believe that in extracting signal from noise from the Treasury yield curve, it is essential to incorporate the fact that observed yields in the United States and other major sovereign markets are determined in a global general equilibrium that is reflected, at least in part, in the global level of neutral policy rates and the state of longer-term global inflation expectations. 15 Conditional on neutral policy rates and longer-term inflation expectations, the Federal Reserve and other major central banks can be thought of as calibrating and conducting the transmission of policyâbe it through rates, forward guidance, or LSAPsâprimarily through the slopes of their yield curves and much less so via their levels. 16 Thank you very much for your time and attention. I look forward to my conversation with Raphael.\n\nReferences Bauer, Michael D., and Glenn D.

Begin with the identity that the policy rate spread equals the difference between the neutral interest rate $$(r_t^\\ast+\\pi^\\ast)$$ and the current policy rate:\n\n$$s_t=r_t^\\ast+\\pi^\\ast-R_{t,1}.$$\n\nNow define the n -period term premium $$ \\tau_{t,n} $$ through the long-term rate definition:\n\n$$R_{t,n}=E_t\\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\right)\\ \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}{R_{t+i,1}+\\ \\tau_{t,n}}.$$\n\nConsider a simple data-generating process consistent with Laubach and Williams (2003) for the neutral real interest rate\n\n$$r_t^\\ast=\\ r_{t-1}^\\ast+w_t$$\n\nand a simple first-order autoregression for the policy rate spread\n\n$$s_t=\\ \\rho\\ s_{t-1}+e_{t,}$$\n\nwhere $$ w_t $$ and $$ e_t $$ are assumed to be some unforecastable disturbances.\n\nThen at any horizon $$ n $$ we have\n\n$$R_{t,n}=\\ r_t^\\ast+\\ \\pi^\\ast-\\frac{1}{n}\\left.\\frac{\\left(1-\\rho^n\\right)}{\\left(1-\\rho\\right)}\\right.s_t+\\ \\tau_{t,\\ n}.$$\n\nRegress $$ \\tau_{t,n} $$ on the policy rate spread\n\n$$\\tau_{t,n}=\\ \\tau_{0,n}+\\beta_ns_t+v_{t,n,}$$\n\nwhere $$ \\tau_{0,n} $$ and $$ \\beta_n $$ are regression parameters and $$ v_{t,n} $$ is the residual, and we have (cf. figure 3)\n\n$$R_{t,n}=\\ r_t^\\ast+\\ \\pi^\\ast+\\ \\tau_{0,n}+\\left[\\beta_n-\\left.\\frac{1}{n}\\frac{\\left(1-\\rho^n\\right)}{\\left(1-\\rho\\right)}\\right.\\right]s_t+v_{t,n}\\ .\\ $$\n\nSo yields at each maturity are anchored by the common neutral nominal rate $$ r_t^{\\ast} + \\pi^{\\ast} $$ (Bauer and Rudebusch, 2020). The difference between the long rates $$ R_{t,n} $$ and the neutral interest rate $$ (r_t^{\\ast} + \\pi^{\\ast}) $$ is a linear function of the policy rate spread with a loading that depends on the dynamics of the policy rate spread as well as the covariance between the spread and the term premium.\n\nOn May 27, 2021, this speech was updated to add a sentence to footnote 10 and add the following to the \"References\" section: Gospodinov, Nikolay (2020). \"Global Factors in U.S. Yield Curve,\" working paper, July, available at https://sites.google.com/site/gospodinovfed .\n\n1.

I am grateful to Antulio Bomfim for assistance in drafting these remarks, to Canlin Li for contributing the empirical work, and to Hannah Firestone for preparing the figures. Return to text\n\n2. For instance, Clarida (2019b) discusses the role of falling neutral real rates and longer-term inflation expectations worldwide in the decline in global sovereign bond yields. Return to text\n\n3. See Ferreira and Shousha (2021) for a rigorous econometric study of the fundamental determinants of real interest rates in global general equilibrium. Return to text\n\n4. Diebold, Li, and Yue (2008) extended the single-country model developed by Diebold and Li (2006) to a multicountry framework that allows for both global and country-specific factors to affect domestic yield curves. In these remarks, for ease of exposition, I define the global level factor as the simple average of the Diebold-Li country level factors (renormalized as discussed in the notes to figure 1). Return to text\n\n5. Recent work by Bauer and Rudebusch (2020) highlights the role of movements in neutral real interest rates in the dynamics of the yield curve. Return to text\n\n6. Interestingly, it was the success of credible inflation targeting, in addition to financial globalization, that has put central banks in the \"slope\" business. In a world in which inflation expectations are not well anchored, monetary policy can have a major effect on the level of interest rates by shifting, for better or worse, longer-term inflation expectations, as was the case in the United States from the 1960s through the early 1990s (Clarida, Galí, and Gertler, 2000). Return to text\n\n7. See Bomfim (1997) for an early exploration of the \"policy rate spread\" as a factor embedded in the Treasury yield curve as well as an early effort to obtain an estimate of $$r\\ast\\ $$ consistent with medium-term macroeconomic equilibrium. See also the appendix for a simple model linking the neutral nominal interest rate, the yield curve, the policy rate spread, and the term premium. Return to text\n\n8. For example, over the subsample 1999:Q1â2014:Q1, a regression of the DL slope factor embedded in the gilt (bund) yield curve on the U.K. (euro area) policy rate spread yields an R 2 of 0.83 (0.61) with a coefficient on the policy rate spread of 0.91 (0.96), results that are comparable with the estimates for the Treasury curve discussed earlier. However, in the remaining subsample 2014:Q2 to 2019:Q4, the slope factor in these two countries is much flatter than predicted by the empirical relationship with the policy rate spread that holds in the earlier subsample. Return to text\n\n9. I think of $$r\\ast\\ $$ and the policy rate spread as mapping a potentially large set of macroeconomic fundamentals into two scalars and thus enabling dimension reduction compatible with a factor model structure. For example, the Ferreira and Sousha (2021) specification for $$r\\ast\\ $$ includes six explanatory variables, one of which is a trade-weighted index of global productivity and demographic trends. Likewise, one can always write the policy rate spread as $$r\\ast\\ +\\ \\pi\\ast\\ -\\ \\{{r\\ast\\ +\\ \\pi\\ast\\ +\\ 1.5(\\pi\\ -\\ \\pi\\ast)\\ +\\ 0.5(gap)\\ +\\ dev}\\ \\} =\\ 1.5(\\pi\\ -\\ \\pi\\ast)\\ -\\ 0.5(gap)-\\ dev$$, where $$dev$$ is the deviation from a Taylor rule with a time-varying intercept equal to $$r\\ast\\ +\\ \\pi\\ast\\ $$. Return to text\n\n10. For example, Ferreira and Sousha (2021) attribute 85 basis points of the decline in U.S. neutral real interest rates since 2000 to global spillovers. Moreover, in their model, foreign central bank purchases of U.S. Treasury securities are a significant contributor to fluctuations in the supply of safe assets, which in turn empirically account for much of the variation in global real interest rates in their model. The notion of two-way causality was also examined empirically by Gospodinov (2020), who added a global factor to an otherwise standard affine term structure model of the U.S. Treasury curve.

Also note from figure 6 that in the weeks before and after the Brexit vote, the 10-year Treasury yield and the dollarâpound exchange rate were rising and falling together as the market assessed the likelihood of a Brexit vote (before) and the implications of a Brexit vote (after). Return to text\n\n12. The finding of two-way causality suggests that major central banks (not just the Federal Reserve) still retain a fair amount of \"monetary autonomy,\" as discussed recently by Panetta (2021). Return to text\n\n13. Ehrmann, Fratzscher, and Rigobon (2011) also examined potential spillovers between the United States and the euro area in the money and equity markets, finding that, particularly in the latter, spillovers from the euro area to the United States were very small, whereas those from the United States to the euro area were quite sizable. They attributed this asymmetry to the central role that U.S. equity markets play in world equity markets. Ehrmann, Fratzscher, and Rigobon (2011) used Rigobon's (2003) identification-through-heteroskedasticity methodology to estimate a structural model where various asset prices are determined simultaneously in the United States and the euro area. Return to text\n\n14. The evidence of two-way causality is also consistent with the U.S. economy's increasing integration with the rest of the world, which has made it more exposed to foreign shocks (Clarida, 2019a). Return to text\n\n15. Of course, there are very likely other fundamentalsâsuch as equilibrium term premiums required to hold long-duration sovereign bonds and, in many countries, default and illiquidity premiums required to hold riskier sovereign debtâthat are embedded in yield curve level and slope factors in addition to neutral policy rates and longer-term inflation expectations. Return to text\n\n16. The focus of these remarks has been on sovereign bond markets and monetary policy, but monetary policy is, of course, also transmitted through the foreign exchange market.

    "text": "May 12, 2021\n\nVice Chair Richard H. Clarida\n\nAt the \"NABE International Symposium: A Vision of the Economy Post COVID,\" Washington, D.C. (via webcast)\n\nIt is my pleasure to meet virtually with you today at the National Association for Business Economics International Symposium: A Vision of the Economy Post COVID. 1 So much has happened since we last met in Washington in February 2020, but I am grateful that technology is allowing us to gather once again, if only virtually. I look forward, as always, to my conversation with Ellen Zentner, but first, please allow me to offer a few remarks on the economic outlook, Federal Reserve monetary policy, and our new monetary policy framework.\n\nCurrent Economic Situation and Outlook In February 2020, none of us could have imagined that in a few short weeks the COVID-19 pandemic and the mitigation efforts put in place to contain it would deliver the most severe blow to the U.S. economy since the Great Depression. Gross domestic product (GDP) collapsed by more than 30 percent at an annual rate in the second quarter of 2020; more than 22 million jobs were lost, wiping out a decade of employment gains; the unemployment rate rose from a 50-year low of 3.5 percent in February to almost 15 percent in April; and inflation plummeted in response to a collapse in aggregate demand that dwarfed the contraction in aggregate supply.\n\nBut with the benefit of hindsight, it is clear that the economy has proven to be much more resilient than many forecast or feared one year ago. With timely support from monetary and fiscal policyâunprecedented in both scale and scopeâand the rapid development and deployment of several effective vaccines, the economy stabilized and began a robust recovery in the second half of 2020 that both we and outside forecasters expect to pick up steam this year. So far, the economic activity data we have received this year is consistent with this outlook. For example, GDP rose by an impressive 6.4 percent in the first quarter, with real final sales to private domestic purchasers up an eye-popping 10.6 percent. Household spending on goods is rising robustly, and spending on services is also picking up as contact-intensive sectors begin to reopen and recover. Business and residential investment have more than fully recovered from the 2020 collapse and are operating above pre-pandemic levels.\n\nHowever, after looking at the details of Friday's disappointing employment report, the near-term outlook for the labor market appears to be more uncertain than the outlook for economic activity. Employment remains 8.2 million below its pre-pandemic peak, and the true unemployment rate adjusted for participation is closer to 8.9 percent than to 6.1 percent. At the recent pace of payroll gainsâroughly 500,000 per month over the past three monthsâit would take until August 2022 to restore employment to its pre-pandemic level. But what this necessary rebalancing of labor supply and demand means for wage and price dynamics will depend importantly on the pace of recovery in labor force participation as well as the extent to which there are post-pandemic mismatches between labor demand and supply in specific sectors of the economy and how long any such imbalances persist.\n\nReadings on inflation on a year-over-year basis have recently increased and are likely to rise somewhat further before moderating later this year. Over the next few months, 12-month measures of inflation are expected to move above our 2 percent longer-run goal, largely reflecting, I believe, transitory factors such as a run of year-over-year comparisons with depressed service-sector prices recorded last spring as well as the emergence of some supply bottlenecks that may limit how quickly production can rebound in certain sectors. However, under my baseline outlook, these one-time increases in prices are likely to have only transitory effects on underlying inflation, and I expect inflation to return toâor perhaps run somewhat aboveâour 2 percent longer-run goal in 2022 and 2023. This outcome would be entirely consistent with the new framework the Federal Reserve unanimously adopted in August 2020 and began to implement at our September 2020 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. 2\n\nRecent FOMC Decisions and the New Monetary Policy Framework At FOMC meetings convened since the new framework was announced last August, the Committee made important changes to our policy statement that upgraded our forward guidance about the future path of the federal funds rate and asset purchases to bring it in line with our new framework. As announced in the September 2020 FOMC statement and reiterated in the following statementsâincluding the most recent oneâwith inflation running persistently below 2 percent, our policy will aim to achieve inflation outcomes that keep inflation expectations well anchored at our 2 percent longer-run goal. 3 We expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomesâas well as our maximum-employment mandateâare achieved. We also expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment, until inflation has risen to 2 percent, and until inflation is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.\n\nIn addition, in our December 2020 FOMC statement, the Committee combined our forward guidance for the federal funds rate with enhanced, outcome-based guidance about our asset purchases. We indicated that we will continue to increase our holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and our holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress, measured relative to the December 2020 announcement, has been made toward our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.\n\nIn our new framework, we acknowledge that policy decisions going forward will be based on the FOMC's estimates of \" shortfalls [emphasis added] of employment from its maximum level\"ânot \"deviations.\" 4 This language means that, going forward, a low unemployment rate, in and of itself, will not be sufficient to trigger a tightening of monetary policy absent any evidence from other indicators that inflation is at risk of moving above mandate-consistent levels. With regard to our price-stability mandate, while the new statement maintains our definition that the longer-run goal for inflation is 2 percent, it elevates the importanceâand the challengeâof keeping inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent in a world in which an effective-lower-bound constraint is, in downturns, binding on the federal funds rate. 5 To this end, the new statement conveys the Committee's judgment that, in order to anchor expectations at the 2 percent level consistent with price stability, it will conduct policy to achieve inflation outcomes that keep long-run inflation expectations anchored at our 2 percent longer-run goal. As Chair Powell indicated in his Jackson Hole remarks, we think of our new framework as an evolution from \"flexible inflation targeting\" to a \"flexible form of average inflation targeting.\" 6 While this new framework represents a robust evolution in our monetary policy strategy, this strategy is in service to the dual-mandate goals of monetary policy assigned to the Federal Reserve by the Congressâmaximum employment and price stabilityâthat remain unchanged. 7\n\nConcluding Remarks Notwithstanding the recent flow of encouraging macroeconomic data, the economy remains a long way from our goals, and it is likely to take some time for substantial further progress to be achieved. Our guidance for interest rates and asset purchases ties the path of the federal funds rate and the size of the balance sheet to our employment and inflation goals. We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy for as long as it takes until the job is well and truly done.\n\n1.
