Introduction\nThe Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), enacted in 1977 to encourage federally regulated\ndepository institutions to meet the credit needs of all families and communities, including those\nof lower income, is facing a major reform (Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, 2018).\nHowever, any reform effort will be hampered by the fact that existing empirical evidence on the\nsignificance, magnitude, and mechanisms of the CRA’s effects on mortgage lending, small\nbusiness lending, and community development activities has been inconclusive (Getter, 2015).\nThis paper seeks to generate clearer evidence of the CRA’s impact in the context of small\nbusiness lending. The research takes advantage of a unique opportunity provided by an\nexogenous policy shock in 2013. Because of the statistical area revision by the Office of\nManagement and Budget (OMB), 549 census tracts across the 48 contiguous states and\nWashington, D.C. that were once eligible for CRA credit (with a median family income below\n80 percent of the area median) became ineligible after 2014, while 432 previously CRA\nineligible tracts became newly eligible. The change in CRA eligibility status represents a shift\ntoward more or less prescriptive regulation for small business lending in these tracts, which\npotentially allows us to identify the CRA’s effects.\nThe empirical results provide quite consistent evidence that the CRA has had a\nsignificant impact on the volume of small business lending in lower-income neighborhoods.\nHowever, the generally positive effects of the CRA are sensitive to the type of CRA treatment,\nnamely gaining or losing CRA coverage. When a neighborhood loses its low- and moderate-\nincome (LMI) status, we see that the number of small business loans originated in that\ncommunity decreases relative to lending activities in nearby neighborhoods with unchanged\nCRA eligibility status.\n1\n\nOn the other hand, becoming CRA eligible has a positive yet less significant effect on\nsmall business lending activity in a neighborhood. The positive effect makes sense, owing to the\nincreased attention banking institutions are likely to give to these neighborhoods. The relative\nmagnitude also makes sense, because lenders will need to build capacity and accumulate\nexperience to appropriately serve the newly eligible neighborhood.\nThis study is most closely related to Ding and Nakamura (2017), which examined the\nCRA’s impact on bank mortgage lending activities in the Philadelphia area. Although our\nresearch applies a similar methodology, it differs from that research in important ways. First, it\nfocuses on a different loan product; there is no reason to assume that the patterns that exist for\none product will hold for others, especially considering that small business lending is more\ndominated by CRA lenders and often requires more soft information of borrowers than mortgage\nlending (Greenstone, Mas, Nguyen, 2014). In addition, it improves upon that study by using a\nnational sample of neighborhoods rather than focusing on a single metropolitan area. The\nnational focus, to a certain degree, allows us to explicitly test for spatial heterogeneity of the\nCRA’s effects. The results confirm that such heterogeneity does exist, with the CRA generally\nhaving a larger effect in metropolitan neighborhoods, in neighborhoods located in inner cities,\nand in the Northeast. Finally, unlike Ding and Nakamura (2017), which focuses only on the 2013\npolicy shock, this study analyzes relationships over the precrisis period as well, which had a\ndistinct policy environment and market conditions.\nThe overall consistent results of the CRA’s impact across different markets and across\ndifferent study periods suggest that lenders are responsive to the incentives that the CRA\nprovides, and that CRA designations matter in a changing financial landscape. Findings from this\n2\n\nstudy are consistent with the notion that the CRA has served as an important tool in helping meet\nthe credit needs of underserved communities and populations.\nThis study contributes to the literature in several ways. First, the unique natural\nexperiment induced by the policy shock provides us an opportunity to overcome the\nidentification challenges and data constraints that hampered prior studies. Most empirical studies\non the CRA rely on a regression discontinuity design that compares outcomes in tracts just above\nand below the CRA eligibility threshold.1 This identification strategy may be biased if the\nCRA’s effect on neighborhoods with incomes farther from the threshold is systematically\ndifferent from the effect on those close to the threshold (Ding and Nakamura, 2017; Ringo,\n2017). Furthermore, since the policy shock has led to two types of treatments — gaining or\nlosing CRA eligibility status — comparing the effects of different treatments provides\ninformation about the market failure. Finally, the examination of the possible spatial and\ntemporal heterogeneity in the effects of the CRA helps us understand the conditions under which\nthe CRA could be more effective in channeling credit to lower-income communities.\nThis paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides background information about the\nCRA, the relevant literature on the CRA’s effects, and the implications of the new statistical area\ndefinitions. Section 3 describes the methodology and data in more detail. Section 4 presents the\nempirical results. Section 5 concludes the paper and discusses policy implications.\n1\nFor a tract to be CRA eligible, it must have a median family income less than or equal to 80 percent of the median\nincome of the metropolitan area in which it is located. If the tract is not located in a metropolitan area, it is CRA\neligible if its median family income is less than 80 percent of the median family income for the nonmetropolitan\nportion of the state in which it is located.\n3\n\n2. Background and Literature Review\nThe CRA was enacted in 1977 to address the concern that depository institutions had not met the\ncredit needs of lower-income and minority neighborhoods in the years after the enactment of\nlaws in the 1960s, including the Fair Housing Act of 1968 (Munnell et al., 1996; Ross and\nTootell, 2004; Garwood and Smith, 1993; Essene and Apgar, 2009). The CRA encourages\ndepository institutions to ensure access to credit for residents in LMI neighborhoods and to LMI\nborrowers, both of which have historically been underserved, in a manner consistent with safe\nand sound operation.\nUnder the law, depository institutions are regularly examined for their compliance in the\nareas of lending, investments, and services by three federal agencies: the Federal Reserve, the\nOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\n(FDIC).2 The federal regulators assess whether depository institutions are serving the credit\nneeds of both LMI neighborhoods and LMI populations within their assessment areas. LMI\nneighborhoods are defined as census tracts that have median family incomes less than 80 percent\nof the median family income for the surrounding area.3 Assessment areas are the geographic\nareas where institutions have their main office, branches, and deposit-taking ATMs. While the\nperformance of banks and thrifts in entire communities is measured during the CRA\n2\nDepository institutions include federally chartered financial institutions, such as national banks and savings\nassociations, and state-chartered commercial and saving banks. Smaller institutions that meet certain criteria\nundergo lending and community reinvestment tests or a lending test only.\n3\nThe designation is based on the median family income of a tract to the median income of a surrounding area. If the\nratio is below 50 percent, the tract is considered low-income; 50 percent to 79.9 percent is moderate-income; 80\npercent to 119.9 percent is middle-income; 120 percent or higher is upper-income. The surrounding area for a census\ntract is either the metropolitan statistical area or the metropolitan division, or, for those tracts not located in a\nmetropolitan area, the nonmetropolitan area of the state.\n4\n\nexamination, CRA-related activities in LMI neighborhoods and within a banking institution’s\nassessment area are weighted heavily (Avery, Bostic, and Canner, 2005).\nThe CRA has at least two channels to incentivize compliance by depository institutions.\nFirst, federal regulators must consider an institution’s CRA performance when evaluating an\napplication by that institution for a merger or acquisition, the formation of branch, or other\nbusiness activity. If the benefits of obtaining an Outstanding or Satisfactory CRA rating\noutweigh the costs, the CRA will effectively promote depository institutions to expand their\nservices in LMI neighborhoods and among LMI populations. Second, and more indirectly, the\npublic release of loan-level data through the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) allows\ncommunity activists and public interest groups to monitor banking institutions and provide an\nindependent source of bank discipline where the CRA is concerned.\nA number of previous studies have found that banking institutions complied with the law\nby engaging more with local community organizations and shifting their lending activities to\nCRA-eligible neighborhoods. For example, the number of newly initiated CRA agreements —\nbanking institution pledges to provide substantial resources to targeted groups and communities\n— in a county is positively associated with lending activities in the area over a three-year period,\nand the increased lending persists even after the expiration of an agreement (Bostic and\nRobinson, 2003; 2005). Survey responses also indicate that many CRA-related lending activities\nwould not otherwise have happened absent the law, which demonstrates the role of the CRA in\nshaping credit flows in traditionally underserved neighborhoods (Avery, Bostic, and Canner,\n2005).\n5\n\nHowever, the empirical evidence on the effectiveness of the CRA on lending activities\ndirectly is, at best, mixed (Getter, 2015). A group of researchers at the Joint Center for Housing\nStudies compared CRA-regulated lenders and those lenders not covered by the CRA, as well as\nlending patterns within and outside of their assessment areas, and concluded that the CRA had\nhelped expand access to mortgage lending in the 1993–2000 period (Joint Center for Housing\nStudies, 2002). On the other hand, Dahl, Evanoff, and Spivey (2002) found that banking\ninstitutions that had their CRA ratings downgraded did not significantly alter their lending\nbehaviors, which suggested that this channel of CRA influence had not been effective.\nMore recent studies examining the causal effects of the CRA have gone beyond the\nsimple ordinary least squares models used in the early literature and instead applied\nmethodologies featuring more rigorous identification strategies. One of the most frequently used\napproaches has been the regression discontinuity strategy. The regression discontinuity approach\nexploits the fact that CRA eligibility is determined by whether the median income of a tract is\nless than 80 percent of the median income of the surrounding area. The existence of an income\nthreshold allows researchers to identify the causal effects of the CRA by comparing the\noutcomes in census tracts just below and above the threshold (Avery, Calem, and Canner, 2003;\nBerry and Lee, 2008; Gabriel and Rosenthal, 2008; Bhutta, 2011; Avery and Brevoort, 2015).\nUsing this approach, for example, Bostic and Lee (2017) found that the number and dollar\namount of small business loans were greater among CRA-eligible tracts during 1996–2002 and\n2012–2014, while small business lending lagged in those tracts between 2003 and 2011.\nAlthough its intuitive design and mild assumptions for causal identification are appealing,\nthe regression discontinuity design might not be the perfect method for examining the causal\neffects of the CRA. The local treatment effects found from this approach might not necessarily\n6\n\ngeneralize to other conditions. Tracts just below the income threshold are the most affluent\nneighborhoods among CRA-eligible tracts, and thus might have lending patterns that are\nsystemically different from neighborhoods with substantially lower incomes. Second, because\nthe approach focuses on the tracts near the income threshold, sample sizes and statistical power\ndecrease as the window gets narrower.\nA difference-in-differences framework may help overcome some of these identification\nchallenges and data constraints. The idea is simple: Given an exogenous shock, measuring how\nthe difference in the outcome variable (e.g., credit supply) between entities that are newly\neligible or ineligible for the CRA (the treatment group) and those whose status remained constant\n(the control group) changes from the period before the shock to the period after the shock would\nreveal the effects of the CRA. One of the strengths of this approach is that it could allow us to\nestimate the CRA’s effects on those neighborhoods with median incomes that are far above or\nbelow the CRA eligibility threshold. Finding a plausibly exogenous source of variation,\nhowever, could be difficult. One example of a study using this approach is Zinman (2002), which\nleverages time variation in CRA incentives across bank size associated with 1995 CRA reforms.\nIt finds that the CRA increases lending to small businesses and that these increases improve\ncounty-level payroll and reduce business bankruptcies. Ding and Nakamura (2017) and Ringo\n(2017) also employ difference-in-differences approaches and use changes in the definitions of\nmetropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) and metropolitan divisions (MDs) as the exogenous shock.\nThese studies find positive CRA effects on home mortgage lending, with the effects being\ngreater among lower-income tracts.\nThe New MSA/MD Definitions and Their Implications for CRA Lending\n7\n\nThe depository institutions subject to the CRA are examined by their lending, services,\nand investment performances in LMI tracts, or CRA-eligible tracts,4 which have a median family\nincome (MFI) below 80 percent of the surrounding area’s median family income (AMFI).5 The\nAMFI is defined as the median family income for the MSA or MD, if a family or geography is\nlocated in an MSA/MD, or the median family income for the statewide nonmetropolitan area, if a\nfamily or geography is located outside an MSA. The OMB periodically issues new delineations\nfor the MSAs and revises existing ones to better reflect economic and demographic realities. In\n2013, the OMB published a new set of MSA/MD definitions as part of its comprehensive review\nof statistical area standards and definitions after the 2010 census.6 Because the CRA eligibility of\nneighborhoods is based on the tract-to-area MFI ratio, the substantial changes in AMFIs induced\nby the new statistical area definitions have led to abrupt changes in the income designations for\nmany tracts.\nAs a result of these definition changes, 818 tracts had their CRA eligibility status change.\nOf these, 423 were previously ineligible tracts that became newly CRA eligible.7 There are\nseveral types of newly eligible tracts. One type includes tracts that were newly defined as part of\nan MSA in 2014 (about 40 percent of newly eligible tracts). Because the median family income\nof an MSA is often higher than that for all nonmetropolitan areas of a state, a tract that became\n4\nWe use the term CRA-eligible tract as shorthand only to mean that the tract is an LMI tract with an MFI below the\nthreshold of 80 percent relevant to CRA regulation. This does not necessarily mean that none of the lending to a\nCRA-ineligible neighborhood qualifies for CRA credit. For example, lending to LMI borrowers in middle- or upper-\nincome neighborhoods is still eligible for CRA credit.\n5\nAMFI is defined as the MFI for the MD if a family or geography is in an MSA that has been subdivided into MDs.\nThe Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) estimates MFI for MSAs, MDs, and\nnonmetropolitan portions of each state.\n6\nSee more details at www.ffiec.gov/cra/OMB_MSA.htm.\n7\nWe exclude those census tracts that were nonmetropolitan areas in both 2013 and 2014, tracts with zero\npopulation, previously nonmetro and newly ineligible tracts, and newly nonmetro and newly eligible tracts (see\nTable A1 in the Appendix for the decisions we made to narrow the study sample).\n8\n\npart of an MSA is more likely to be CRA eligible. A second includes those tracts in areas where\nMSA/MD definitions changed. For example, after Essex County in Massachusetts was added to\nthe Cambridge-Newton-Framingham, MA MD, the MD’s median family income increased from\n$83,500 to $93,300. This caused a number of tracts in relatively poorer Essex County to become\nCRA eligible. In another case, the San Francisco-San Mateo-Redwood City MD was split into\nthe San Francisco-Redwood City-South San Francisco MD and the San Rafael MD after 2014.\nFor neighborhoods in the new San Rafael MD, the AMFI increased slightly from $101,200 to\n$104,100, causing neighborhoods with income slightly higher than the previous LMI threshold to\nbecome CRA eligible.\nA total of 395 tracts that were previously CRA eligible lost their status as a result of the\ndefinition changes. There were several types of newly ineligible tracts, too. The first is tracts that\nwere newly defined as nonmetro or rural tracts (about 9.3 percent of all newly ineligible tracts).\nBecause the median family income of a rural area in a state is often lower than that of an MSA in\nthat state, a tract that was newly defined to be in a rural area is less likely to be CRA eligible.\nOther tracts were in areas with changed MSA or MD definitions. For example, after Essex\nCounty in Massachusetts was added to the Cambridge-Newton-Framingham, MA MD, the MD’s\nmedian family income decreased from $101,000 to $93,300. This caused a number of tracts in\nMiddlesex County to become CRA ineligible. When the San Francisco-San Mateo-Redwood\nCity MD was split into the San Francisco-Redwood City-South San Francisco MD and the San\nRafael MD, the MD’s median family income decreased from $101,200 to $94,800 for\nneighborhoods in the new San Francisco-Redwood City-South San Francisco MD, causing\nneighborhoods with income slightly below the LMI threshold to become CRA ineligible.\n9\n\nIf lenders subject to the CRA closely monitor the changes in the CRA eligibility of\nneighborhoods and make strategic adjustments in their lending behavior accordingly, we should\nbe able to isolate the CRA’s effects by identifying shifts in lending activity in the newly eligible\nand ineligible tracts relative to shifts in counterpart neighborhoods. The change in the income\ndesignations of a large number of neighborhoods across the nation thus provides us a unique\nopportunity to implement a sharper identification strategy by investigating how lenders have\nresponded to gaining or losing CRA coverage because of an exogenous policy shock.\nWe view changes in CRA eligibility by this channel as an exogenous policy shock.\nAlthough it is known that changes in MSA and MD definitions will be coming, it is very unlikely\nthat those changes could be anticipated by banking institutions, as the methods for making these\ndeterminations are not transparent ex ante to those not involved in the process.\n3. Methodology and Data\nThis study uses a set of difference-in-differences models to compare the volume of small\nbusiness lending during the two years before and the two years after January 1, 2014, in the\nneighborhoods with changed CRA eligibility status (the treatment group) and in those of a\ncontrol group of comparable neighborhoods. In the spirit of a regression discontinuity design, we\nuse geographically proximate neighborhoods with slightly higher or lower median incomes as\ncontrol groups. Intuitively, in the absence of the redefinitions of MSAs in 2013 and their\nincorporation into the determination of CRA eligibility starting in 2014, we would not expect\nany sharp changes in small business lending patterns in the treatment group after January 1,\n2014, relative to the control group. Thus, we attribute any significant differences in lending\n10\n\nactivity between the treatment group and the control group to the effects of gaining or losing\nCRA coverage.\nTract-Level Difference-in-Differences Regression Models\nUsing the policy shock discussed above, we attempt to identify the CRA’s effects by\ncomparing variation in lending in the treatment and control tracts before and after the policy\nchange. The two-way, tract-level difference-in-differences model can be specified as:\nY = β + β TREAT + β POST + β TREAT ∗ POST +γ N +ε (1)\nit 0 1 i 2 t 3 i t i it ,\n∗ ∗ ∗ ∗\nwhere Y represents the value of the outcome measure Y (the number and dollar amount of small\nit\nbusiness lending) for tract i in year t. TREAT represents whether tract i is one that became newly\ni\neligible or ineligible after 2014; the variable is ultimately omitted in the estimation because we\ninclude tract fixed effects. POST is a dummy variable assigned a value of one for the post-2014\nt\nperiod. TREAT ∗ POST is the two-way interaction of the time and treatment dummies. The\ni t\ncoefficient of the two-way interaction term β is expected to capture the CRA’s effect on\n3\noutcome measure Y. N represents the fixed effect of tract i, which helps control for tract-level\ni\nunobserved heterogeneity. Additionally, robust standard errors are used to address potential\nheteroskedasticity.\nFor this analysis, there are effectively two treatment groups: tracts that were previously\nCRA eligible but became CRA ineligible (newly CRA ineligible) and tracts that were previously\nCRA ineligible but became CRA eligible (newly CRA eligible) after the definition change.\nBecause lenders may react differently to gaining or losing CRA eligibility, we estimate separate\nregressions for the two treatment groups.\n11\n\nControl group tracts are located within a half-mile radius of a tract in the treatment group,\nhave a median family income between roughly 50 percent and 100 percent of the area median,\nand did not have their CRA eligibility status change between 2013 and 2014.8\nThe final sample includes 1,071 control group tracts to be compared with the newly\nineligible tracts and 1,279 control group tracts to be compared with the newly eligible tracts.\nDescriptive statistics for the treatment and control tracts are shown in Table 1. As the MSA\nboundaries changed, the average median income ratio among the newly ineligible tracts\nincreased from 74.4 percent in 2013 to 88.7 percent in 2014; the control tracts for them had\nsimilar average values — 73.7 percent in 2013 and 87.9 percent in 2014. Likewise, the average\nmedian income ratio among newly eligible tracts declined from 88.4 percent in 2013 to 74.6\npercent in 2014, and the control group tracts had comparable numbers (89.8 percent in 2013 and\n77.3 percent in 2014). Compared with the LMI tracts, treatment and control tracts tend to have\nhigher median incomes, greater population, and fewer minorities, and they are more likely to be\nin principal cities.\nBecause control tracts were more common in some MSAs, the tracts in the control groups\nwere weighted to avoid any issues of over- or underrepresentativeness. The weights are\ncomputed to ensure the share of control tracts within each MSA equals the share of treatment\ntracts in the same MSA. Of course, some decisions we made to identify the control groups may\nbe arbitrary, such as the range of the income window and the way to calculate the weights, so we\n8\nFor example, the control group for the newly ineligible tracts is those with unchanged CRA eligibility status,\nwithin a half-mile radius of a newly ineligible tract, and with a median family income between 80 percent and 100\npercent of area median in 2013 or between 50 percent and 80 percent of the area median in 2014.\n12\n\nconduct a set of sensitive analyses to discern how sensitive the results are to some of our\nanalytical decisions.\nData\nThe primary data used for the analysis are the CRA small business lending data provided\nby the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC). The CRA aggregate flat files\ninclude information on the number and dollar amount of small business loans originated by\nbanks and thrifts that are subject to CRA reporting. In a CRA report, small business loans are\ndefined as business loans of $1 million or less. The data also provide the number and dollar\namount of those loans to businesses with gross annual revenues of $1 million or less (hereafter,\nsmaller firms). These data are aggregated at the census tract level. Although they provide limited\ninformation compared with the HMDA mortgage data, the CRA data are the most\ncomprehensive publicly available data on small business lending. Greenstone, Mas, and Nguyen\n(2014) reported that the CRA data cover approximately 86 percent of all loans of $1 million or\nless.\nUsing the CRA small business lending data set, we test the role of the CRA on four\noutcome variables: (1) the number of small business loans, (2) the dollar amount of small\nbusiness loans, (3) the number of small business loans to small firms, and (4) the dollar amount\nof small business loans to small firms. All figures are inflation-adjusted to 2016 dollars. To\nassess activities associated with direct underwriting experiences, we focus on small business loan\n13\n\noriginations, rather than loan purchases.9 We also restrict our sample to census tracts within\nMSAs or MDs at least once before and after the 2013 MSA/MD redefinitions, as lenders are less\nlikely to include nonmetro neighborhoods in their CRA assessment areas (Avery, Bostic, and\nCanner, 2005).\nThe changes in the total numbers and dollar amounts of small business loan originations\nin the treatment and the control groups pre- and post-treatment are summarized in Table 2. In the\nnewly ineligible tracts, we observe a smaller increase after 2014 in the total number of small\nbusiness loan originations by CRA-covered lenders, relative to the control group (Table 2).\nDuring the two years after the MSA/MD redefinitions in 2013, the number of small business loan\noriginations increased by 13.8 percent in the newly ineligible tracts, smaller than the increase of\n19.5 percent for the control group. This pattern is consistent across other outcomes. In the newly\neligible tracts, however, the increases in the number and dollar amount of small business\noriginations were only slightly larger than that of the control group (e.g., an 18.5 percent increase\nin the number of small business loans in the treatment tracts, compared with a 16.8 percent\nincrease in the control tracts).\nOverall, the descriptive analysis suggests that, relative to the control group, there was a\nsmaller increase in the volume of small business loan originations after 2014 in neighborhoods\nthat became CRA ineligible, while there was a slightly larger increase in small business lending\nactivities in the newly eligible tracts. While these descriptive statistics support the notion that\nCRA incentives shape bank small business lending activities in LMI neighborhoods, we want to\nverify these findings by the regression analysis using data aggregated at the tract level.\n9\nAlso, the number of small business loan purchases (1.6 million) was only a third of the loan originations (4.6\nmillion) and the amount of small business loan purchases ($2 billion) was about 2 percent of the loan originations\n($99 billion) in 2016.\n14\n\n4. Empirical Results\nThis section summarizes the findings regarding the CRA’s effects on small business lending and\nheterogeneity in the CRA’s effects from the baseline regressions and the results of various\nrobustness checks using alternative control groups, different study periods, and different\nweighting methods.\nEffects of the CRA on the Volume of Small Business Lending\nTable 3 summarizes the regression results from the baseline model, which uses a control\ngroup of the tracts within half a mile of any neighborhoods in the treatment group and with\nslightly higher or lower incomes than the CRA threshold (50 percent to 100 percent of area\nmedian family income). Tracts in the control group remained either CRA eligible or CRA\nineligible through the study period. The top panel of the table presents results that suggest that\nthe loss of CRA coverage leads to a significant decline in the number of small business loans,\nalthough the CRA’s effects on the dollar amount of small business loans are statistically\ninsignificant. Becoming CRA ineligible causes an average decline of 3.3 small business loans (or\n5.8 percent of the pre-2014 mean10) per tract-year in the post-2014 period and a decrease of 2.4\nloan originations to smaller firms (or 9.3 percent of the pre-2014 mean). By contrast, the bottom\npanel of the table shows that gaining CRA eligibility status generally does not have a significant\nimpact on small business lending at the aggregate level, for either the number or dollar amount\nof small business loans.\n10\nIn 2012–2013, the average numbers of small business loans and small business loans to smaller firms were 56.8\nand 25.9, respectively, among the newly CRA ineligible tracts.\n15\n\nWe conducted additional analyses to understand the forces driving the differences in the\nvolume of small business originations between newly ineligible neighborhoods and control\ngroup neighborhoods. Because the control group used in the baseline model includes tracts that\nwere either consistently CRA eligible or consistently CRA ineligible, the relative decline in\nsmall business lending in the newly ineligible tracts could represent the tracts being treated either\nless favorably than the CRA-eligible tracts (a decrease relative to consistently CRA-eligible\ntracts), more similarly to the consistently CRA-ineligible tracts (a decrease relative to\nconsistently CRA-ineligible tracts), or both.\nTo evaluate these possibilities, we ran separate regressions for the two types of control\ngroups: one including only tracts with LMI status in both 2013 and 2014 (remaining eligible)\nand the other one composed of those with non-LMI status in both 2013 and 2014 only\n(remaining ineligible). When the remaining eligible group serves as the control (Table 4), the\neffect of losing CRA coverage becomes much larger (a decline of 6.5 loans, compared with a\ndecline of 3.3 loans when combining both remaining eligible and remaining ineligible tracts in\nthe control). By contrast, point estimates for the CRA’s effect on the number of loans originated\nare close to zero and become insignificant when the remaining ineligible group was used as the\ncontrol. These results suggest that those tracts that lost CRA ineligibility were quickly treated\nless favorably than those neighborhoods that were CRA eligible throughout the study period.\nWhen we replicated the analysis for the newly eligible tracts (Table 5), the CRA’s effects\nremain statistically insignificant, but the point estimates for the CRA’s effect are potentially\ninstructive. The point estimate for the numbers of loans originated suggests that the increase in\nlending is smaller in the newly CRA-eligible tracts (-1.2 loans) than for tracts that were eligible\nfor the entire period. Moreover, the magnitude of the CRA’s effect when the remaining ineligible\n16\n\ngroup serves as the control suggests an increase in the volume of lending (1.3 loans versus 0.2\nloans in the baseline). This pattern of the CRA’s effects, although insignificant, makes sense.\nOne would expect an elevated amount of lending in the newly eligible tracts compared with\nconsistently ineligible tracts owing to the new incentive to lend. However, because small\nbusiness lending takes significant time and expertise — for example, to collect hard and soft\ninformation about borrowers — it might be more challenging to increase the supply of credit in a\nnewly eligible neighborhood to get it to the level of lending observed in neighborhoods where\nthat expertise has had more opportunity to develop. But one should not make too much of this,\ngiven that all the coefficients are statistically insignificant.\nIdentification Assumption\nThere are important assumptions for the difference-in-differences approach used in this\nstudy. The parallel trend assumption, which assumes parallel trends among treatment and control\ngroups prior to the treatment, is the most critical one to ensure the internal validity of difference-\nin-differences models. To evaluate whether this assumption holds in our data, we conducted\nfalsification tests for other periods, based on the idea that the CRA’s effects we found based on\nthe exogenous policy shock in 2013 during the 2012–2015 period would not exist in other\nperiods. To do this, we repeat the regression models for four-year periods, from 2005–2008 to\n2013–2016.11 If we find a significant effect in other years, it may indicate that there were\nunobserved characteristics that potentially yielded biased estimates. For those tracts with\n11\nThe CRA asset-size threshold was set to $1 billion for small institutions and $250 million for intermediate small\ninstitutions in 2005, and it has gradually increased with inflation and other factors. Before 2005, it was $250 million\nfor small institutions, and intermediate small institutions had no threshold.\n17\n\nchanged boundaries, we converted small business lending outcomes from the 2000 census tract\nboundaries to the 2010 boundaries, using block-level population as weights.12 Also, we excluded\nthose tracts where CRA eligibility status changed in the 2012 census data refresh for the periods\nincluding the break (e.g., 2009–2012 or 2011–2014), given the concern that changed CRA\neligibility status would likely impact small business lending during that period. The results are\nshown in Figure 1. The dots represent the estimated coefficients on the interaction term, and the\nvertical bars are the 95 percent confidence interval of the coefficients.\nIn general, the newly eligible and ineligible tracts had no systemic difference in small\nbusiness lending in earlier or later years compared with those control tracts. Among those newly\nineligible tracts, the estimated coefficient is not significantly different from zero in the years\nbefore the 2013 policy shock and becomes significant for the periods that include the 2013–2014\nbreak. The coefficient becomes statistically significant during our study period (2012–2015) for\ntwo outcomes: the number of small business loans and the number of loans to smaller firms,\nwhich supports the contention that the CRA’s effects found in this study were mainly due to the\nexogenous policy shock in 2014. Results from the diagnostic tests of the parallel trend\nassumption give us confidence for the use of the difference-in-differences model as the\nidentification strategy.\nRobustness Check\nSome decisions we made to identify the control group, such as the choice of income\nranges and buffers used to identify control tracts, had an arbitrary element to them, so we\n12\nWe repeated the same analysis for the census tracts with consistent boundaries. The results were qualitatively\nunchanged.\n18\n\nconducted a set of sensitivity analyses using alternative control groups to discern how robust the\nresults are to some of our analytical decisions. For the sake of simplification, we include only the\nresults of some of the important robustness checks and mention some general patterns from the\nrobustness testing. Table 6 summarizes the CRA’s effects from regressions using alternative\ncontrol groups identified using different income ranges (70 percent–90 percent, 50 percent–100\npercent, 50 percent–110 percent, and 50 percent–120 percent) and different buffers (a half-mile,\ntwo miles, and five miles). The results provide qualitatively consistent evidence that the loss of\nCRA coverage leads to a significant decline in the number of small business loans (overall and\noriginations to smaller firms), while the effects of becoming CRA eligible remain insignificant\nfor newly eligible tracts.\nOf course, we notice some slight differences in the CRA’s effects when alternative\ncontrol groups are used. First, the effect of losing CRA coverage becomes larger when we use\ntracts within a narrower income range: We find a decline of 5.8 loans on average when the\nincome range of 70 percent to 90 percent of area median family income is used, compared with a\ndecline of 3.3 loans when using the broader income range of 50 percent to 100 percent. In\naddition, when we use control groups comprising tracts in different buffers (a half-mile, two\nmiles, and five miles), the magnitude of the CRA’s effect decreases with the increase in the\nbuffer. The results are consistent with the notion of a spatial decay of the CRA’s effects and a\nless significant effect of the CRA on neighborhoods with incomes farther from the income\neligibility threshold.\nWe also applied state-level, instead of MSA-level, weighting to check whether the results\nare sensitive to the types of weighting method used. The results remain quite consistent when the\nstate-level weighting method is used.\n19\n\nSpatial Heterogeneity in the CRA’s Effects on Small Business Lending\nWe further evaluate whether the CRA’s effects identified in the baseline model vary\nacross neighborhoods and regions. We first examine whether the CRA has a larger effect in\nneighborhoods that had been defined as part of an MSA for the whole study period, excluding\nthose formerly or newly nonmetro, or rural, tracts. While most newly ineligible tracts were\nwithin MSA boundaries during the study period, almost 40 percent of newly eligible tracts were\nnewly merged into an MSA in 2014 as a result of the MSA/MD redefinitions. Because nonmetro\nneighborhoods are less likely to be included in lenders’ assessment areas, we suspect that lenders\nhave less experience and infrastructure in those previously nonmetro tracts than in other\nmetropolitan neighborhoods. If more resources and effort are needed for lenders to increase\nsmall business lending in these newly eligible metro tracts, the CRA’s effects are expected to be\nlarger by dropping these neighborhoods from the final sample.\nWhen focusing on neighborhoods that had been defined as part of an MSA for the whole\nstudy period (Table 7), we find that the magnitude of the effect of gaining CRA eligibility\nbecomes larger (an increase of 2.3 loans versus 0.2 loans in the baseline) and significant in some\nspecifications, although the one included in Table 6 is statistically insignificant.13 The CRA’s\neffects in the newly ineligible metropolitan tracts, however, remain quite consistent after\n13\nThe effects of gaining CRA eligibility in tracts remaining part of an MSA become significant when alternative\ncontrol groups are used, such as using a narrower income range (70–90 percent of area median) or the larger buffer\n(2 miles or 5 miles). Results are not included here but are available upon request.\n20\n\ndropping a small share of tracts (less than 10 percent) that were classified as nonmetro areas after\n2014.14\nSecond, because the CRA was in part motivated by concerns about redlining and\ndiscrimination issues in inner-city neighborhoods, we expect the CRA may have had a greater\nimpact on neighborhoods in central cities in major population centers than on those in suburban\nareas and small cities. The regression results (column 3 in Table 7) confirm that losing CRA\neligibility status has a larger effect on neighborhoods in principal cities, which are the main core\ncities or the largest cities of metropolitan areas. Becoming CRA ineligible leads to an average\ndecline of 5.6 small business loans per tract-year for neighborhoods in principal cities (or 9.9\npercent of the pre-2014 mean), larger than the decline of 3.3 loans in the baseline model.\nSimilarly, losing CRA coverage for tracts in principal cities leads to a decrease of 3.6 loans to\nsmaller firms, larger than the decline of 2.4 loans when the full sample is used. The effect of\nbecoming CRA eligible, however, remains insignificant for neighborhoods in principal cities.\nThird, the newly ineligible tracts are not evenly distributed across the nation. Nearly half\n(49.4 percent) are in the Northeast, about 28.0 percent are in the South, 17.5 percent are in the\nMidwest, and the remainder (about 5.0 percent) are in the West. Similarly, most newly eligible\ncensus tracts are located in the Northeast (52.0 percent), followed by the South (29.6 percent),\nthe Midwest (14.3 percent), and the West (4.1 percent). We explore whether geographic location\nis associated with different CRA effects by partitioning the sample by region and reestimating\nthe baseline regression, the results of which are in the final four columns of Table 7. We find that\n14\nThe analysis of newly ineligible neighborhoods does not include the previously eligible tracts in nonmetropolitan\nareas. They may be defined as CRA eligible, but they are less likely to be included in lenders’ CRA assessment\nareas.\n21\n\nthe CRA treatment, either gaining or losing CRA eligibility status, has a much larger effect in the\nNortheast. We observe a decrease of 7.3 loans on average in the Northeast after a tract becomes\nCRA ineligible, larger than the overall average effect of a decrease of 3.3 loans. The effects of\ngaining CRA eligibility on the number of small business loans remain statistically insignificant,\nbut the magnitude becomes larger for the Northeast. In contrast, the CRA’s effects are generally\nstatistically insignificant in three other regions, except for some significant coefficients in the\nSouth (but with the opposite sign).\nIn considering these results across geographies, we note that there was a concentration of\ntracts with changed CRA eligibility status after 2013 in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New\nYork. These tracts are more likely to be located in metropolitan areas or in principal cities, and\nthey are more spatially concentrated than those in other regions.15 Thus, if the CRA has a larger\neffect in metropolitan areas and inner-city neighborhoods (as our results suggest), it is\nunsurprising to observe more significant effects of CRA treatment in the Northeast.\nTemporal Heterogeneity in the CRA’s Effects on Small Business Lending\nResults from the various regressions discussed above provide generally consistent\nevidence that there were fewer small business loans originated in neighborhoods that became\nCRA ineligible, relative to the comparison group, after the 2013 MSA/MD redefinitions. While\nthe CRA designation matters during the 2012–2015 period, a related question is whether the\nresults are robust over time, especially during periods in which market conditions and the policy\n15\nFor example, the old Philadelphia MD alone has a total of 102 newly ineligible tracts and a total of 80 newly\neligible tracts (Ding and Nakamura, 2017).\n22\n\nenvironment are different. To evaluate potential temporal heterogeneity, we replicated the\nanalysis using 2003–2004 data. The 2003–2004 sample includes tracts with changed CRA\neligibility status after the 2003 MSA redefinitions, as well as control tracts identified using the\nsame algorithm used in the 2012–2015 analysis.16 The regression results are summarized in\nTable 8.\nInterestingly, the 2003–2004 results are quite consistent with the findings from the 2012–\n2015 sample: Losing CRA eligibility status causes a significant decline in the number of small\nbusiness loans, as well as in the number of small business loans to smaller firms. The magnitude\nof the CRA’s effects on the total number of originations identified in the 2003–2004 analysis is\nquite similar (a decrease of 3.8 loans versus a decline of 3.3 loans during 2012–2015), while the\ndecline in originations to smaller firms is slightly smaller (a decline of 2.0 loans versus a decline\nof 2.4 loans during 2012–2015). Consistent with the 2012–2015 results, gaining CRA eligibility\nstatus after 2003 generally does not have a significant impact on small business lending.\nThe results from this robustness test point strongly to the robustness of the CRA effect.\nThe 2003–2004 analysis is based on a completely different sample of neighborhoods. Also, the\nprecrisis period was characterized by the subprime boom and relatively loose underwriting\nstandards — a policy environment and market conditions that differed markedly from the post-\nGreat Recession period.\n16\nBecause the CRA eligibility status for a small number of census tracts changed from 2002 to 2003 as a result of\nthe use of the 2000 census information, we chose to focus on the 2003–2004 period only, instead of the 2002–2005\nperiod.\n23\n\n5. Conclusion\nThis study provides new empirical evidence on the effects of the CRA on small business lending\nactivities. Capitalizing on changes to MSA/MD definitions that altered CRA eligibility for nearly\n1,000 tracts, we conducted an analysis that uncovered heterogeneous CRA effects. When a\nneighborhood loses its LMI designation and becomes CRA ineligible, it is quickly treated by\nbanking institutions less favorably than those neighborhoods that have been consistently eligible\nunder the CRA. By contrast, the effects of gaining CRA eligibility status on small business\nlending activities are generally insignificant at the aggregate level. The pattern of point estimates\nprovides some indication that banking institutions start to give more attention to newly eligible\nneighborhoods. The findings are robust when different study periods and a set of alternative\ncontrol groups are used.\nOverall, the empirical results are consistent with the contention that the CRA, a law that\nencourages depository institutions to help meet the credit needs of the LMI households and\nneighborhoods, has made small business credit more accessible to its targeted areas. While there\nis some heterogeneity in the CRA’s effects across neighborhoods, the results suggest that a CRA\ndesignation still matters in a changing financial landscape. Findings from this study, as well as\nfrom other studies that find a significant impact of the CRA (for example, Ding and Nakamura,\n2017), imply that the CRA has served as a useful tool in helping meet the credit needs of\nunderserved communities and populations. They further suggest that its preservation can help\nensure that the goal of equal access to credit be achieved in a changing regulatory environment\nand evolving market conditions.\n24\n\nThis study focuses only on the CRA’s effects on the volume of small business lending.\nMany other unanswered questions remain. For example, the CRA could have much broader\neffects on small business lending by altering the underwriting, pricing, or sources of small\nbusiness credit. If data become available, future research could benefit from an examination of\nthe effects of the CRA on both the quality and costs of small business lending. In addition,\nnondepository institutions (e.g., online marketplace lenders or fintech companies) have been\nplaying an increasingly vital role in small business lending (U.S. Small Business Administration,\n2017). However, the CRA does not cover nondepository institutions, and nondepository small\nbusiness lenders do not have to report their data to regulators. Future research could evaluate the\nsmall business lending activities of lenders not covered by the CRA, with perhaps a focus on\nhow this relates to and affects the activities of depository institutions in the small business\nmarket, especially in lower-income communities. Such research could uncover important\ninsights that can inform how best to modernize the CRA in a changing financial landscape.\n25\n\nReferences\nAvery, Robert B., Raphael W. Bostic, and Glenn B.
