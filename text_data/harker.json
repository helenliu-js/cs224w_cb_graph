Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nInnovative Pathways to an Equitable Workforce Recovery\nWorkforce Realigned National Launch Event\nPhiladelphia, PA (Virtual)\nJune 3, 2021\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nHello! What an engaging and important event this has been. And I sincerely mean it when I say those are\nsome tough acts — plural — to follow. So thank you all for joining us. I am truly pleased to be here with\nyou today to close things out.\nBut first, a bit of housekeeping before I proceed. That’s my standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express\ntoday are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee or in the Federal Reserve System.\nThe Problem\nToday’s event, the book we are releasing, and so much of the work we do every day at the Federal\nReserve is motivated by the same central insight: Declining economic mobility is one of the defining\nchallenges of our time. Indeed, not only is it an economic challenge that needs to be solved — it’s also,\nin my view, a direct challenge to our nation’s highest ideals. One of the animating creeds of our country,\nafter all, is that no person should be held back by the circumstances of their birth.\nBut far too many of people’s paths to success have been blocked. Intergenerational mobility has fallen in\nrecent decades. Income inequality has remained stubbornly high.\nThat can breed frustration; at times even complacency. It’s natural for people to feel hopeless in the\nface of monumental problems; they can feel insurmountable.\n1\n\nInnovative Solutions\nAnd that’s why today’s program has been so inspiring. What this program’s presentations and the\nstories we have read about in the book demonstrate so vividly is that these problems can be solved.\nWhile the case studies we highlight here are special, they are not aberrations. The ideas and tools\nthey’ve developed are practical — and in many cases, replicable. I’m an engineer by trade and a\npragmatist by education and disposition. So what I think is really great about these programs is that they\nare focused on what works.\nPart of recognizing what works is being clear-eyed about what doesn’t. The “train and pray” model,\nwhere people are trained for skills without a guaranteed job at the other end, has not historically been\nparticularly effective. Neither are training or educational opportunities that are unaffordable and thus\nunattainable to the very people who need them most. That’s crucial because we know that, to have a\ndecent shot at earning a family-sustaining wage, people need some form of post-high school training or\neducation.\nExperimentation and bold innovation are key to determining what works — and central to what we do\nat the Philadelphia Fed’s Economic Growth & Mobility Project. We believe in exploring how our research\ncan be applied to real community problems.\nThat’s why a couple of years ago we partnered with stakeholders in Philadelphia to advance a one-of-a-\nkind “pay for success” job training model that links Comcast, a major employer here, with Philadelphia\nWorks, our local publicly funded job training board.\nWhile the program is still in its early stages, the lessons from the model can be applied to partnerships\nbetween employers and training organizations across the country. The way it works is that the\nworkforce board, Philadelphia Works, pays for training for new hires up front; the employer then\nreimburses the board if certain benchmarks, such as staying on the job for six months, are met.\nThis is good for both parties: Workers get the skills the employers need, and the workforce\norganizations know they are training for real job opportunities. You can read more about this exciting\nand important model in the book.\nThe exciting truth is that there are innovative and important programs taking shape all over the country.\nThe book describes many of them, like Career Impact Bond programs that enable workers to upskill\naffordably, as well as the groundbreaking higher-ed initiatives in Texas and Virginia that link payment for\n2\n\nprograms to student employment and income after graduation. What these programs have in common\nis they often represent a mindset shift — away from old models and toward planning around outcomes,\nbuilding flexibility into contracts, sharing risk, and paying proportionate to impact.\nNow, we certainly know that a book won’t do all those things on its own. This book is instead a jumping-\noff point: a way to highlight an emerging set of principles that define a more nimble training ecosystem\nthat works better for all workers and that truly charts a way to an equitable workforce recovery.\nAnd the task is truly urgent. Despite the improving economy, we still have 8 million fewer jobs than we\ndid prior to the pandemic — closer to 11 million, if you assume we would have been creating around\n200,000 jobs a month without the pandemic. Tens of millions more are stuck in jobs with only limited\nopportunities. Now is the moment for bold action.\nThe Work Ahead\nIn the coming months, we will be convening and supporting local communities through a spotlight series\nto bring ideas from the book to their situations. If one of the case studies in the book speaks to you —\nand if you think you could assemble a local team to help adapt that idea and test it — we want to help.\nThe plan is still evolving, but the team behind Workforce Realigned, along with our partners, will support\nyour team with technical assistance, relevant nationwide expertise, and connections with others\npursuing similar initiatives. If you want to learn more, check out our webpage for information at\nworkforcerealigned.org. We really want to hear from you.\nSo, thank you again for joining us today. Now let’s go out there and make it happen.\n3",

Harker\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily\nthose of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\nWelcoming Remarks\nBook Launch\nShared Prosperity in America’s Communities\nFisher Fine Arts Building\nUniversity of Pennsylvania\nMarch 23, 2016\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood evening and thank you for being here tonight. It is always a pleasure to be back at the\nUniversity of Pennsylvania. I have spent 30 years of my career on college campuses, and\nnothing matches their innovation and knowledge creation anywhere.\nI am happy to cross paths again with Susan Wachter, codirector of the Penn Institute for Urban\nResearch and a former colleague of mine at the Wharton School. Susan is the coeditor of the\nbook we are here to discuss tonight, Shared Prosperity in America’s Communities. The book is\nan example of the great work Penn IUR continues to do to bring attention ― and solutions ― to\nissues that have an impact on urban areas.\nI would also like to recognize the contributions to this book that the Community Development\nStudies & Education team has made. This includes Dr. Lei Ding, who served as the book’s co-\neditor.\nShared Prosperity in America’s Communities is an impressive collection of essays from\nrespected researchers and thinkers that explores the intersection of inequality and place. This is\nthe fourth in a series of books that the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and Penn IUR have\npublished together. These volumes stem from our joint biennial conference, Reinventing Our\nCommunities. Each conference ― and accompanying book ― highlights the issues that have an\nimpact on older industrial communities.\nI can’t think of a more important or timely topic for communities than inequality and social\nmobility. I am so pleased that this was both the focus of our 2014 Reinventing conference and\ntonight’s book.\nAs reflected by Fed Chair Janet Yellen, economic inequality has long been of interest to the Fed.\nChair Yellen has expressed a desire to engage in more research on community development\ntopics, including factors that influence economic mobility.\n1\n\nAs the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, I fully support her interest in\nincreasing our focus here. And as one of my own goals, I hope the dialogue on such topics\ncontinues to happen often. I believe tonight’s book helps bridge a gap that is part of the larger\nconversation on issues including social mobility, economic inclusion, and equitable growth.\nSince joining the Fed, I have had the opportunity to see some of these issues play out in\ncommunities throughout our District. This has been through conversations with community\nleaders who we have met at the Fed and through tours of the District. And what I have learned\nfrom these experiences reflects many of the themes in the Shared Prosperity book and the\ntopics of tonight’s discussion.\nShared Prosperity in America’s Communities provides important insights on the intersection of\ngeography and opportunity. This helps us understand the cost of inequality. And that cost is\ngreat.\nRaj Chetty, one of the book’s contributors, suggests that a child born into the bottom quintile of\nincome distribution, has a 7.5 percent chance of reaching the top quintile in the United States.\nHe says, “Improving opportunities for children from disadvantaged families to succeed should\nbe a priority for policy makers not just because it is one of the core principles of American\nsociety but also because improving mobility can have substantial economic payoffs.”\nI agree with Raj. It’s not only in the name of justice and fairness that we should focus on this\ntopic. It’s also because this is an economically smart thing to do. These issues are of particular\nimportance here in the City of Philadelphia, given the demographics that I am sure you are all\nfamiliar with today.\nDespite signs of economic growth and progress, Philadelphia is still the second-poorest large\ncity in America, with a poverty rate of 26.5 percent, according to the latest U.S. Census figures.\nPhiladelphia also has the highest deep poverty rate of the nation’s 10 most populous cities.\nWhile Philadelphia has experienced recent job growth, the rate of growth has been slower than\nother U.S. cities. Also, the jobs are predominantly low wage and perpetuate ― rather than\nreverse ― the cycle of poverty.\nWe are lucky to have two of the book’s authors here tonight:\n• Elizabeth Kneebone, a fellow at the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings\nInstitution, and\n• Paul Jargowsky, a professor of public policy and the director of the Center for Urban\nResearch and Education at Rutgers University–Camden.\n2\n\nWe also have two leaders in attendance from our local community who will discuss the\nimplications of inequality for the City of Philadelphia. They are:\n• Eva Gladstein, the deputy managing director of health and human services for the City\nof Philadelphia, and\n• Laura Sparks, the executive director of the William Penn Foundation.\nAs I approach policy decisions, it is discussions such as the one tonight that help me best\nrepresent the Third District in Washington, D.C. The topics, research, and personal stories add a\nhuman element to the data I review each day.\nThat said, it is important to have forums where research can inform practice and practice can\ninform research. This book is an illustration of that approach, and I hope we can continue\nworking together.\nThank you for joining us here tonight and for your continued efforts to achieve economic\ngrowth and stability in our region.\nI will now hand the discussion over to Theresa Singleton, vice president of Community\nDevelopment Studies & Education Department at the Fed and the moderator for tonight’s\nconversation.\n3",

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nIntroduction\nThank you for attending today’s conference. I am glad to see so many here for a discussion on\nwhat I view as a pressing issue not only in our region but throughout the United States. Today,\nwe will look at some of the promising new approaches and emerging strategies for addressing\nyouth unemployment. In particular, we will look at how apprenticeships and employer-led\nstrategies can bolster our efforts in this area.\nI want to first thank our speakers who will be sharing their expertise on youth employment and\nthe policy, research, and practice perspectives associated with this issue.\nThanks also to our cosponsors, the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and The Annie E. Casey\nFoundation. I would like to point out some of the important work these organizations are doing\nin this field:\n• The Cleveland Fed has partnered with our Bank on a number of initiatives related to\nworkforce development. Paul Kaboth and his team have done tremendous work in\nproviding economic and community development practitioners with a greater\n1\n\nunderstanding of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act. Joe Ott’s recent paper,\nin particular, clarified the finer points of the legislation and how it might aid workers,\nemployers, and communities.1\n• The Annie E. Casey Foundation strives to increase economic opportunities for low-\nincome families, focusing on the needs of young people, and is currently funding several\ninnovative workforce development initiatives.\nFinally, I would like to thank Theresa Singleton and her community development team from the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia for organizing today’s event.\nA Focus on Employment\nThe idea of promoting maximum employment has always been part of the Federal Reserve’s\nmission. This concept was formalized in 1977 when Congress amended the Federal Reserve Act,\nestablishing what is now commonly referred to as the Fed’s dual mandate: to achieve price\nstability and to promote maximum, sustainable employment. There are various ways in which\nwe contribute to this objective of maximum employment.\nThe Research functions across the Federal Reserve System are an important source of data and\nanalysis on labor market issues, and we can be a resource for organizations that provide\nmeaningful programs for the unemployed. And a significant amount of activity has occurred in\nthe System’s community development function:\n• The community development divisions at Reserve Banks and at the Federal Reserve\nBoard of Governors have been increasingly active in workforce development. Many\nReserve Banks, including this one and the Cleveland Fed, have conducted listening\nsessions with educators and employers.\n• The Atlanta and Kansas City Reserve Banks published a book, Transforming U.S.\nWorkforce Development Policies for the 21st Century, which is available here today.\n• And earlier this year, the Federal Reserve Banks of Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Atlanta\nproduced a major research study on opportunity occupations in the nation’s largest\n1 https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/publications/special-reports.aspx\n2\n\nmetropolitan economies. Opportunity occupations are jobs that pay at least the national\nmedian salary and are accessible to those without a bachelor’s degree. These types of\nopportunities, of course, will be a central focus of today’s conference.\nHere at the Philadelphia Fed, our staff has been particularly focused on workforce-related\nchallenges, issues, and opportunities for young people between the ages of 16 and 24. The\ndecrease in labor force participation among young people in recent years has been striking,\ndeclining from about 66 percent in 2000 to 55 percent in 2015.2\nWe recognize that while much of the economy has rebounded in recent years, significant\nbarriers still exist for young people in the job market. This is especially true for those young\npeople who are currently disconnected, which is to say that they are neither employed nor in\nschool. This population is also increasingly referred to as opportunity youth because they\nrepresent an untapped resource in our nation’s economy. Measure of America, a project of the\nnonprofit Social Science Research Council, reported that close to 14 percent of Americans\nbetween the ages of 16 and 24 are disconnected and that these rates are higher for minority\nyouths. More than one-fifth of all African American youths and more than 16 percent of all\nLatino youths are disconnected.\nThese numbers point to an urgent need for communities to make efforts to engage these young\npeople, in particular. We’re fortunate in Philadelphia to have several organizations doing\ntremendous work. I have had the privilege of recently touring the facilities of the YouthBuild\nPhiladelphia Charter School, Philadelphia Works, and District 1199C Training & Upgrading Fund.\nIn their own unique ways, these organizations are focused on reengaging young people in this\nregion and in helping them learn job skills and in finding meaningful work. While each\norganization is unique in its approach, common threads still exist among them. These\norganizations are successful, in large part, because they realize that their work goes far beyond\njob training. There is a personal aspect to their work that is critical to their efforts. They offer a\nsense of belonging, a sense of direction, and even a sense of family to those who lack these\n2 The percentages are based on third quarter seasonally adjusted data for the respective years provided by the U.S.\nBureau of Labor Statistics.\n3\n\nnecessities in their personal lives. Also, by way of their investments in the lives of these youths,\nthese organizations and programs are having an important and positive impact on the future\nregional economy.\nFor each of us, one person entrusted us with our first job. This person made an investment in us\nthat is still yielding outcomes today. For me, I benefited greatly from having work opportunities\nat an early age. At 14, I started working on a farm near my hometown in New Jersey. And I can\ntell you that I learned things from my first job and from my first boss, John McGroarty, that I\nstill reflect on to this day. While much of farming seems routine, trust me, it takes a lot of\ncreativity and tenacity to catch pigs that have escaped from their sty.\nStarting to work at an early age taught me many skills that could be easily transferred to any\njob, and these skills made it easier for me when I started my career in earnest years later.\nGetting a feel for a professional environment at an early age was invaluable. I learned that if\nyou work hard and show a desire to expand your knowledge, new opportunities can and do\narise. And, perhaps most importantly, John taught me the value of having a mentor. I worked\nfor John and his family for more than eight years. Over the course of my career, I have been\nvery fortunate to have had several mentors, such as my father-in-law, along the way. Each one\ninvested significantly in my development. Looking back at my career path as I wrote today’s\nremarks, I was struck by how important mentorship was to me and for others entering the\nworkforce. This is true for formal apprenticeships and the more informal interactions that occur\nwhen adults make personal investments of their time in young people. The investment John\nmade in me 40 years ago has had a tremendous impact on where and who I am today.\nThe Problem\nThe problem we face is that too few young people are securing the types of job opportunities\nmany of us had. Too many young people are not engaged in work or education — they are not\nconnected — and this can set them back for the rest of their lives. Research shows that when\nyoung people are not active in work or school, they fail to develop adequate professional skills,\nand they ultimately have lower earnings over a lifetime. Given the significant role of consumer\n4\n\nspending in the economy, this disengagement of young people from the labor market can also\nhave lasting impact on local and regional economic growth.\nWe know that education contributes to an individual’s future earnings, but work experience\nmatters as well. The Federal Reserve Board’s Division of Consumer and Community Affairs\nconducted a survey of young workers that confirmed the importance of work experience and\nearly entry into the workforce. Survey respondents who had a paid job during high school were\nmore likely to be currently working than those who did not.\nThis survey of young workers indicated that some of the difficulties young people face when\nlooking for a job are felt even more acutely by low-income and minority individuals. Many of\nthese individuals are ambitious young people who are eager to join the workforce, but\nobstacles in the way can become insurmountable without proper support systems.\nNew Perspectives, New Partners, New Pathways\nThe issues facing disconnected youth are complex, and the barriers are real, as many in this\naudience can attest. We are all here today because we recognize the need for new\nperspectives, new partners, and new pathways for young people.\nApprenticeships\nApprenticeships offer one way to broaden access to training and employment. Apprenticeships\nhave been the staple of workforces throughout modern history. George Washington was an\napprentice surveyor, and Ben Franklin was an apprentice printer.\nApprentices receive structured on-the-job training, wages, industry-recognized credentials, and\ndirect access to jobs and careers. Employers, in turn, obtain highly trained employees and\nincreased productivity; they may also have a better experience in retaining employees.\nIn an assessment and cost-benefit analysis of the Registered Apprenticeship — or RA —\nprogram in 10 states, Mathematica Policy Research conducted a study and noted that RA\nparticipants had substantially higher earnings than nonparticipants. The study estimated that\napprentices who completed their RA programs would receive an average of around $300,000\n5\n\nmore in compensation over their lifetime, including benefits, than nonparticipants.3 These\nprograms can have a significant impact on the lives of workers and the economy; however, they\nhave had limited application here in the United States.\nApprenticeships reach approximately 55 to 70 percent of youths in Austria, Germany, and\nSwitzerland. As a share of the total labor force, apprenticeships account for just under\n4 percent in Australia and Germany, just under 3 percent in the U.K., but only 0.3 percent in the\nU.S. And, while in most other countries apprenticeships begin after secondary schooling, in the\nUnited States, the average age of an RA program participant is now 28 years old. We must\nconsider ways to make it easier for young people to access these programs.\nNew Partners\nWe realize that it is just as important to engage employers as it is young people. It is important\nto recognize the needs of employers — to know what they are looking for and to partner with\nthem as we train young people in skills that will translate into careers.\nToday, you will hear from several speakers who are working across fragmented systems or silos\nto create real solutions in our communities. For example, Michael Wiggins is with us today from\nSouthwire — a wire and cable producer in Georgia — that has collaborated with local school\ndistricts to develop a program that addresses high drop-out rates and creates a job pipeline for\nlocal talent. Southwire’s 12 for Life program blends classroom instruction and on-the-job\ntraining. It has been successful in matching talented, ambitious young people with fulfilling\ncareers at the company, and, in turn, it has also helped produce successful members of the\nworkforce.\nThe program that you will hear more about from Michael underscores how much more our\nregions can achieve when employers are actively engaged and when mentors are available and\nwilling to share knowledge.\n3 See “An Effectiveness Assessment and Cost-Benefit Analysis of Registered Apprenticeship in 10 States,” by\nMathematica Policy Research, 2012 at http://wdr.doleta.gov/research/FullText_Documents/ETAOP_2012_10.pdf.\nThe 10 states include New Jersey and Pennsylvania.\n6\n\nNew Pathways\nLater in the program, you will hear from Simran Sidhu from the YouthBuild Philadelphia Charter\nSchool. I had the privilege of meeting with Simran and some of her students last week at\nYouthBuild. The visit highlighted the importance of career advancement and supporting youth\nat each transition, whether it is from high school to community college or from community\ncollege to a first job. I met with students who said that one of their biggest barriers to success\nin school was simply not having an adult in their lives who cared. After struggling with reading\nor math and without the proper support system, they simply withdrew. Simran and her staff\nfocus on giving these individuals the support they need, which goes far beyond job training.\nYouthBuild has a wonderful partnership with Starbucks that involves training students to\nbecome baristas and then transitioning them into jobs. The technical side of that partnership is\ngoing well, and it is something I can personally attest to after being fortunate enough to sample\na cup of coffee prepared by the students. But after I spent some time in the school, it became\napparent that the program has a far greater impact than simply training future baristas. It is\nabout giving our youth the necessary skills and the vision to see beyond that first job, allowing\nthem to go from being a barista to becoming a store manager or possibly even a district\nmanager. It is about creating a pathway to success through personal contact and professional\ntraining programs.\nConclusion\nIn order to meet the needs of our young people and to secure our long-term economic future,\nwe need to make real investments in their training and employment today. It is key to support\nthese individuals not just as students, but as neighbors, as members of our community, and as\npart of our economy. This approach will bolster our efforts in helping to put young people on a\npath of success and in addressing a pressing issue in our regional and local economies.\nThe investment that John McGroarty made in me more than 40 years ago has had a profound\nand lasting impact on my career. As we proceed with today’s critical conversations, I would like\nto challenge each one of us to consider the investments we are making in our young people\n7\n\ntoday, particularly those who are disconnected. There are many ways we can each be involved,\nsuch as through apprenticeships, internships, and mentoring. At the corporate level, we can do\neven more. It will undoubtedly take new and innovative approaches and collaboration across\nsectors to create these lasting and essential career pathways for young people. It is a\ncomplicated and layered challenge but one that is worth pursuing.\nGoing forward, I can see one of my primary focuses will be to explore ways to strengthen the\nThird District in the area of workforce development. As we deepen our engagement in\nworkforce development issues, we want to hear from you about how we can be most helpful in\nthis space.\nThank you again for joining us today and thank you also for the important work you do in our\ncommunities.\n8",

    "text": "An Economic Outlook\nTemple University\nPhiladelphia, PA\nFebruary 28, 2017\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the FOMC.\n\nAn Economic Outlook\nTemple University\nPhiladelphia, PA\nFebruary 28, 2017\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood afternoon. It’s a pleasure to be here, and I want to thank everyone for coming, even those\nof you who are just trying to get out of class.\nToday I’d like to talk about the economy as a whole, which I’m sure you expect of a Fed\npresident. But I’d like to start with a refresher course on the Fed and what it is we do as well as a\nsort of monetary policy 101. That’s not to assume no one knows what we do, although I’m often\nsurprised at cocktail parties to hear how much power people think I have. I can’t single-handedly\nmove markets, although it’s flattering people think so.\nIt’s more to reset the wider conversation about where the U.S. economy is today, what\nchallenges we’re facing, and what can be done to really change its course. And, frankly, since I\nhave a captive audience, I’m not missing an opportunity to talk to the next generation of\npotential Fed employees.\nBefore I begin, the first rule of the Fed club is: Don’t talk about the Fed club until you’ve\ndelivered the standard disclaimer — the views I express today are mine alone and do not\nnecessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\nThe Fed: Overview\nFirst, the very basic overview. The Federal Reserve System is made up of 12 regional Banks\nacross the country and a Board of Governors in Washington, D.C. I’m president of the\n1\n\nPhiladelphia Fed, which covers eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey, and Delaware. Each\nof the regional Banks is an independent entity, and we represent our Districts when we meet in\nD.C. to formulate monetary policy.\nWe do that roughly every six weeks at the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC,\nmeetings. That’s where we vote on monetary policy, which is now mostly about moving interest\nrates.\nThe governors always have a vote as does the president of the New York Fed. The rest of us\nrotate onto voting positions. I’m voting this year for the first time. I’ve noticed people care a lot\nmore about what I have to say recently, which I’m sure is just a coincidence.\nWhen we’re not in a voting position, we’re still part of the conversation. One of the benefits of\nthe System is that we get to be the voices for the people in our regions.\nThe Federal Reserve has a dual mandate outlined by Congress: price stability and maximum\nemployment. We also regulate banks, process payments, and conduct economic research.\nAnd — the part that never gets enough attention, in my opinion — we do research and work in\nour communities to help strengthen local economies. We have an exceptional team in\nPhiladelphia, and I’m not just saying that because they make me look good. We recently had\nChair Yellen come with us to visit the West Philadelphia Skills Initiative, which connects\nunemployed people in the area with employers. The Philadelphia Fed’s Community\nDevelopment team works with organizations to promote stronger economies through everything\nfrom skills training to research on economic mobility. And they connect people and issues to the\nresources they need.\nDifferent Banks also sometimes specialize in particular research areas. Obviously, Dallas does a\nlot on energy markets. New York has a special focus on international financial markets. In\nPhiladelphia, our area of expertise is consumer credit: cards, household debt, student loans, etc.\nSo, that’s the Fed overview. We do a lot of things other than monetary policy.\n2\n\nMonetary Policy: The Basics\nThat said, monetary policy is still the big one. And that’s where I come — if you’ll indulge me\n— to my second primer of the day: monetary policy 101.\nMonetary policy is not the all-powerful tool it’s often portrayed as. It’s relatively limited in its\nscope, and it’s a relatively blunt instrument. In normal times, monetary policy is mostly raising\nand lowering interest rates — or keeping them the same.\nIn extraordinary times, we may use tools like quantitative easing or forward guidance. But the\nmajority of it is the somewhat boring business of keeping rates at a level that encourages a\nhealthy economy and helps us meet our dual mandate.\nFiscal and other policy areas are where you’ll find the decisions that really affect things like\ngrowth. The Fed creates the conditions in which a healthy economy can thrive. We till the land\nand make the soil fertile, if you will. But the actual thriving part — planting the seeds and\ntending the crops — are decisions beyond our control, which brings me to where we stand now\nin our role and our decisions.\nThe economy, overall, is in pretty good shape. After eight-plus long years of recovery, the\neconomy is more or less back to full health.\nWe added 227,000 jobs in January, continuing a steady pace of employment. The unemployment\nrate stands at 4.8 percent, at or below my estimate of the natural rate.\nI want to say here that when Fed policymakers talk about employment, we’re doing it at a\nnational level. I’m not blind to the realities on the ground, particularly in my own District. There\nare pockets here and around the country that have been left out of the rebound. There are\ndemographics that have been persistently cut out of that good labor-market fortune. The\nunemployment rate for African American men, for example, was 8 percent in January.\nWe make policy at a national level, so we look at national averages. But we understand that there\nare areas that still need particular focus. It’s part of the reason we, as presidents, make sure we\nfeed back the realities on the ground in our Districts. Some of the issues we can help address\nthrough our community development work, but most of it is up to fiscal and other policy.\n3\n\nAs for inflation, that’s been a little more stubborn, but we’re on track there as well. The myth\nabout inflation is that the Fed is only concerned about it when it gets too high. In truth, we have a\ngoal of 2 percent, and we worry about deviation in either direction. I don’t mean we run around\nwith our hair on fire if it’s a little higher or a little lower once in a while. We’re looking for an\naverage over the medium term.\nIt surprises some people that the issue with inflation over the past few years is that it’s been too\nlow. That sounds odd to a lot of people, especially those of us who lived through the high\ninflation of the late ’70s and early ’80s. The students in the audience definitely won’t remember\nthat, and I think some of the faculty might even be too young.\nIn any event, we’re starting to see upward movement on our goal, and I see inflation rising to\nmeet our target sometime late this year or early next, which means that we’re essentially at our\ngoal.\nOur job now is to maintain the land and keep conditions right for economic growth.\nFor our part, that’s about how we manage interest rates. I see three hikes as appropriate for 2017,\nassuming things stay on track.\nGrowth\nThe growth part, however, is up to fiscal and other policy.\nSo, what really does move the economy?\nAnd what problems are we actually facing?\nI think it’s safe to say there are a lot of opinions about both of those. And I hear most of them.\nWhether I like it or not …\nSo, I’d like to cut through the noise.\nWith employment generally at our goal and inflation on track to meet it, the issue now is growth.\nFrom an economic modeling standpoint, growth right now is more or less what we should\nconsider normal. My forecast for 2017 is a touch above 2 percent.\n4\n\nIf we want to move that needle, we need to address the underlying factors that are keeping it at\nits current rate.\nGrowth is fundamentally productivity plus growth of the labor force, and therein lie two of the\nbigger problems facing the American economy.\nProductivity\nI’ll start with productivity. Productivity has been falling lately — not just in the U.S.,\nincidentally, but globally. And to some extent, the reasons are a mystery.\nThere is one school of thought, popularized by the economist Robert Gordon, that productivity\nhas been spurred throughout history by big, game-changing inventions. Think steam engine,\nelectricity, the Internet. And that the only way we will see productivity on par with past surges is\nif some revolutionary new invention again changes the way we do business. Well, wait a minute.\nDoesn’t the vast world of Internet-enabled work count? In this theory, not really. The\nexplanation would be that in the first tech revolution, most of the innovation went to making\nbusinesses work more efficiently, letting them produce more with less. In this iteration, the\nmajority of the disruption has been in areas of leisure rather than business. Some might even\nargue that the availability of such personal distractions has caused us to be less productive\nbecause we’re more distracted.\nThis might sound terrifying because what else is there to invent? But in this view of the world,\nall isn’t lost because we never really know when the next big revolution is around the corner.\nI’m not personally dedicated to this theory. I think there are ways to increase productivity. But\nit’s been a potent and interesting point of discussion.\nThe other question most often posed is whether we’re measuring productivity correctly. With all\nthe web-based business out there, is it even possible to measure output? Aren’t we assessing\nproductivity on an outdated scale?\nThe first thing I’ll say is that productivity is notoriously difficult to measure. And the economy\nmay be changing in ways that make it even harder. We have the best minds available working on\nthis, but they fully admit it’s difficult to keep up. For example, how do we include smartphone\n5\n\napps that are downloadable for free in measures of output? Research at our Bank suggests that,\neven if we correct for this, it would only make a small difference in the rate of output growth. So,\nour best guess remains that productivity has slowed, while at the same time, there is widespread\nagreement that output and productivity are likely somewhat greater than we think. Welcome to\nthe dismal science.\nLabor Force Participation Rate\nThe second factor in the growth equation is the labor force.\nThere’s been a lot of talk lately about the “real” or “hidden” unemployment rate. There is some\nthought that it might be significantly higher than the official numbers say.\nTo dig into this, I should outline a few measures of how we gauge the health of the labor market.\nSome of it is what you hear frequently: U3 unemployment. You’re all econ and finance majors,\nso you know that’s the basic measure of the unemployed as a percentage of the labor force.\nYou’re unemployed if you’re looking for a job. If you’ve just graduated and you’re on your first\nsearch, you’re part of that number. If you’re looking for work after some time off, you’re part of\nit, too. If you’ve retired, if you’re not working by choice, if you’re taking a break, you’re not\nconsidered unemployed. U3, as I said, is currently 4.8 percent.\nYou also know that the U6 measure is more involved. For the uninitiated, that one takes U3 and\nadds people who are working part-time but would like to be full-time, and people who say they’d\nlike a job but stopped looking. U6 currently stands at 9.4 percent.\nWe also look at how many people are quitting their jobs, which reflects how confident they are\nthat they’ll find another. We look at how many net new jobs were created. We look at what we\nhear from businesses about how hard it is to fill positions, and a host of other information.\nThen there is the labor force participation rate. This is where things get sticky.\nThe labor force participation rate is a measure of what proportion of the working-age population\nis either employed or looking for a job. It’s easy to look at this and draw some unsettling\nconclusions, especially when I tell you that the labor force participation rate is currently 62.9\npercent.\n6\n\nThis is the number that alarms some people, but there’s more to it than meets the eye.\nFirst of all, we define the working-age population as everyone over the age of 16. So, that means\nyour kid brother who’s a junior in high school and my 92-year-old mother are both counted.\nSecond of all, we’re dealing with a different population than we have in the past. The baby\nboomers represent the biggest generation in history to start moving into retirement, and we’re\nliving longer in general. I’m pretty pleased about the last one, frankly. Ultimately, the pool of\npeople not seeking employment for very good reasons is much larger, skewing the overall\nnumber.\nSo, in the sense that low labor force participation points to an unemployment rate that is radically\nhigher than official numbers suggest, that’s not really the case.\nIt is, however, a problem. Just for different reasons.\nThe participation rate has been declining in recent years. There are a few factors that influence\nthat. For one, people are staying in school longer, and many younger people aren’t working\nwhile they’re there. For another, some people have decided that they’re happy with a one-income\nhousehold, often reflecting preferences of work–life balance.\nThe third, as I mentioned, is that the baby boomers are heading into retirement. This is the big\none.\nI say this is the big one because research by my staff shows that the fall in the labor force\nparticipation rate is mostly due to demographic factors.1\nAnd since the vast majority of the decline comes from the onset of the baby boomers’ retirement,\nthey don’t think the trend will reverse. In fact, they project that the participation rate will drop a\nfurther 2 percentage points over the next five years.2\nThis is a big deal.\n1 Shigeru Fujita, “On the Causes of Declines in the Labor Force Participation Rate,” Federal Reserve Bank of\nPhiladelphia Research Rap Special Report, February 2014.\n2 Fujita.\n7\n\nIt’s a big deal because participation affects growth. As an example, if you look at the U.S.\neconomy during the recovery, you’ll see that after the bottom out in 2009, real GDP grew at an\naverage of about 2 percent for the next six years. That’s not just slow for a recovery; it’s slow by\nhistorical averages. In comparison, in the second half of the 20th century, growth averaged 3.5\npercent. A full 1.7 percent of that came just from the expansion of the American workforce. Over\nthe course of the recovery, by contrast, the labor force has grown by an average of about 0.5\npercent. That’s less than half the historical average.\nWe also have to think about the economic pressures that demographics put on us as a country.\nWith an unprecedented wave of Americans heading into retirement and living longer to boot,\nwe’re talking about a lot of resources. Social Security, Medicare, living expenses in general.\nWhile the millennial generation is slightly larger than the boomers, they’re not yet fully in the\nworkforce, and even the oldest of them still aren’t in their prime earning years.\nThe changes to the American labor force in age, in educational attainment, and in expertise in\ncertain sectors are actually harming productivity. In general, productivity is higher in midcareer\nworkers, and their proportion of the U.S. labor market is smaller than it was during the height of\nthe baby boom’s working years.3\nDeclining participation equals shrinking output. That is, with fewer workers, the U.S. will\nproduce less. When we produce less, growth stalls. Ultimately, successful and healthy economies\nhave high participation rates.\nPolicy Possibilities\nNow that I’ve scared the daylights out of everyone, can anything be done?\nAgain, the solutions to these problems lie in areas outside monetary policy. Since I know how it\nfeels to have someone else comment on the job you’re doing, let me be clear that I’m not telling\nelected officials what to do. I’m just a policy wonk with too much data on my hands, and I\nfollow the numbers.\nSo, please take this next part as simply the analysis of an impartial, data-driven party.\n3 James Feyrer, “Demographics and Productivity,” The Review of Economics and Statistics, MIT Press, 89:1,\nFebruary 2007, pp. 100–109.\n8\n\nAs pertains to productivity and growth overall, investment in human and physical capital are\nvital; that is, education, science, health, and the infrastructure of our cities and towns. These help\ncreate a strong and diversified workforce and will help America keep its edge as a leader in\ninnovation across sectors.\nOne of the areas we’ve focused on at the Philadelphia Fed is skills training and alternative routes\nto education and professional readiness.\nThe data show that there’s a skills gap. There are jobs out there that can’t be filled because\npeople just don’t have the right training. That’s the big problem in many industries: They can’t\nfill jobs because not enough people are trained to do them.\nMy staff recently conducted a study on what they call “opportunity occupations.” These are jobs\nthat pay at or above the national median income but that don’t require a traditional four-year\ndegree. They make up close to 30 percent of the job market nationally.\nIf we reconsider the way we train people, especially for occupations that require special skills,\nwe can start to maximize the potential of our workforce. Let’s stop trying to make post-\nsecondary education one-size-fits-all when our job needs and workforce are so varied.\nOn the participation side of things, we can only grow as fast as our workforce can take on the\nwork. Right now, we just don’t have the people, unless we want my mother and her friends to\ncome out of retirement. But I’m pretty sure we’d have a fight on our hands …\nWe need more bodies in the workforce. How and whether we make the decision to do something\nabout it is again out of my hands. And I don’t want to wade into turbulent political waters. But\nthe bottom line is that we don’t have enough people, and pulling talent in from outside the\nUnited States is one way to solve the problem.\nConclusion\nThe United States is and has been an economic powerhouse for most of the past century. We’re\nthe world’s largest economy, and we have consistently been a source of innovation and\ninvention. If we want to keep our global edge, it’s time to think about broad policies that look to\nwhere we’ll be in the future. When I was playing football, we ran where the ball was headed to\n9\n\ncatch it; that’s how we have to look at policy — monetary, fiscal, and other — not where we\nare on the field but where we’re headed.\nWith that, I’m happy to turn the floor over to some questions.\n10",

    "text": "Economic Outlook\nEconomic Leadership Forum\nNew Jersey Bankers Association\nSomerset, NJ\nJanuary 17, 2020\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nEconomic Outlook\nEconomic Leadership Forum\nNew Jersey Bankers Association\nSomerset, NJ\nJanuary 17, 2020\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nOne of the things I’ve noticed about this job is that people find me a lot more interesting when I’m a\nvoting member of the FOMC. So I won’t take it personally that the last time I spoke to this group was\nalmost exactly three years ago …\nSome things look very different in 2020 than they did in 2017. The makeup of the Fed’s Board of\nGovernors has changed. We are in a different part of the business cycle. My outlook for interest rates is\nmarkedly dissimilar. But some things have held firm. Specifically, while the outlook for rates may be\nstarkly different, a lot of the phrases I used to describe the state of the economy back in 2017 still\napply today.\nThat’s positive news and pretty amazing when you consider how much the world has changed since\n2017.\nToday I will touch on three issues that are integral in today’s banking world. The first is the economic\noutlook, a key driver for loan demand and investment opportunities. The second is an aspect of\nmonetary policy that has been in the news over the past few months; namely, how the Fed is\nnormalizing its balance sheet. Last, I will touch on the ongoing efforts around modernizing the\nCommunity Reinvestment Act (CRA).\nLet me begin with the standard disclaimer — which I used three years ago — about my views being my\nown and not necessarily reflective of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\nThe Economic Outlook\nOverall, the economy is looking pretty good. We are in the longest economic expansion on record, and I\nsee growth returning to trend of about 2 percent this year, a view that is widely shared.\n1\n\nJust as I said last time I was here in 2017, I will note that the labor market continues to show\nconsiderable strength. In fact, it has outperformed most people’s expectations, with continued job\ncreation, continued low unemployment, and more people continuing to come off the sidelines.\nAt some point, we’ll return to a trend of creating about 100,000 net new jobs per month. I’ve said that,\ntoo, in years past, and it hasn’t yet come to fruition, which is great for the American workforce. And\nwhen we do return to trend — whenever that may be — it’s important to note that, while 100,000 jobs\na month may look disappointing in comparison with the strong numbers we’ve seen over the past\nseveral years, it will more than keep pace with growth in the labor force.\nMore good news in the labor market includes the fact that wages on the lower end of the pay scale have\nfinally started to rise — as they have on the higher end — although midrange paychecks could still use a\nboost.\nThe continued strength of the labor market has contributed to booming consumer confidence. And with\nconsumer spending making up some 70 percent of the U.S. economy, that makes it the hero in the\ngrowth story. Business investment, however, is lagging, and the uncertainty attached to fiscal and other\npolicies, has continued to hold it back. So, too, have international developments, including the global\nslowdown, trade uncertainty, and geopolitical tensions.\nHere’s something else I said in 2017 — and in 2018 and in 2019 — while we haven’t quite met our 2\npercent inflation target, we’re on track to get there. I still believe that inflation will rise to meet our goal,\nalbeit slowly, and we’re closing in on the target. But it has been a long time coming. To most people, this\nis a purely academic problem — who else but policymakers are going to complain that inflation is\nhovering below 2 percent? But because of our dual mandate, focusing on the inflation rate is more than\nan academic exercise.\nNew Jersey’s Economy\nAs for the Garden State’s economy, some numbers show New Jersey outperforming the nation, and\nothers show some shortfall — but not by a lot. And as a lifelong South Jersey boy, I am happy to say our\nstate’s economy is in good shape. Job growth has hovered around 1 percent over the past three years, a\nlittle below the U.S. rate of about 1.5 percent. However, the unemployment rate is 3.4 percent, which is\nslightly better than the national average. That is despite the fact that New Jersey’s jobless rate has\nticked up in recent months. But even here, I view the news as positive. That’s because the rise in the\nrate reflects more people coming back into the labor force. The state’s labor force participation rate has\n2\n\nrisen from about 62 percent last summer, to 63.6 percent at the end of 2019. That suggests more\nresidents are feeling confident about the labor market and their ability to find work.\nI should mention that the Philadelphia Fed’s own state leading index for New Jersey recently turned\nnegative. But that reflects the rise in the jobless rate. Since that rise is the result of more people coming\ninto the labor market, I am not worried about New Jersey’s economic future.\nMonetary Policy\nThe main subject of this speech is monetary policy. While it is usual to discuss interest rates, today I\nwant to touch on another key aspect of monetary policy going forward, and that is the Fed’s efforts to\nnormalize the balance sheet. This has received great attention lately, ever since the repo market\nproblems of last September.\nAs you know, at the start of 2019, the FOMC decided that we would continue to conduct monetary\npolicy in a regime of “ample reserves,” in which control over the federal funds rate is exercised primarily\nthrough the setting of administered rates, and the supply of reserves does not need to be actively\nmanaged.\nShortly after that, we announced our plan to cease asset redemptions and hold the balance sheet to\nroughly a constant size come September. As currency and other non-reserve liabilities grew, aggregate\nreserves naturally declined. Our end game was for reserves to reach a level “consistent with efficient\nand effective implementation of monetary policy.”\nThere were two primary objectives to this approach. First, to reduce uncertainty about asset purchases\nby announcing our plans well in advance. Second, to approach the necessary level of reserves, which is\nitself filled with uncertainty, with an abundance of caution.\nWe only have estimates of the demand for reserves, although we’ve conducted a great deal of research\naround the Federal Reserve System, including continued conversation with market participants. In fact,\nstaff at the Philadelphia and New York Feds were among the first to identify that the need for reserves\ncould be much larger than initially anticipated. To be on the safe side, it made sense to move slowly,\nbuying time to carefully observe market developments and better assess their implications. That is, we\ngave ourselves time for the inevitable “unknown unknowns” of life.\nJust such an unknown arose in September.\n3\n\nThe episode was clearly triggered by the outsized flows of funds to the Treasury. But the dates for tax\npayments and bond settlements are not a surprise; they are fixed on the fiscal calendar and well known\nto both policymakers and markets. Everyone was expecting large liquidity flows.\nThe impact, however, was clearly much larger than anyone anticipated, markets included.\nThe repo market took the brunt of the impact, as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) rose\nabove 5 percent on Tuesday, September 17, with some trades executed at rates as high as 10 percent.\nWhile this was certainly not an average day, it’s important to note that the repo market did not freeze.\nThe volume of secured overnight finance remained steady, at the $1.2 trillion level it had maintained for\nthe past several months.\nThe funding pressures in secured markets passed through to the federal funds market. The effective\nfederal funds rate rose to the top of target range on Monday the 16th, and surpassed the top of the\nrange by 5 basis points the next day.\nWe immediately took action to ensure that the effective fed funds rate returned to, and stayed within,\nthe target range. The very next day, the Desk started repurchase operations to stem the pressures on\nmoney markets, and these actions have continued — including term operations — to date.\nIn October, the FOMC decided to restart asset purchases to keep reserves at or above the level reached\nin early September, at a little over $1.5 trillion. Additionally, the Desk has been conducting term and\novernight repurchase agreement operations to offset money market pressures — for instance, the\nquarter-end dynamics that are inevitably more burdensome at the year’s end. All in all, since\nSeptember, we have supplied about $400 billion in additional reserves; about $250 billion via repo\nagreements, and the rest in asset purchases.\nThese measures clearly worked, with the effective fed funds rate maintaining a virtually constant level\nsince October, and repo markets staying calm. Instead of wreaking havoc, the year’s end was a non-\nevent.\nGoing forward, the Committee remains committed to implementing monetary policy in a regime of\nample reserves, which, again, does not require active management of the supply of reserves. The\nTreasury purchases announced in October will continue until at least the next quarter to ensure we\nmeet that goal.\n4\n\nCentral to this event is the question of why liquidity did not flow smoothly to where it was needed most.\nAre some of the market’s pipes rusty? Clogged? Are more needed? Has regulation inadvertently\ncontributed to some erosion or blockage?\nAnother question is whether the Fed ought to expand our toolkit — whether we could, or should, do\nmore to ensure interest-rate control. One possibility under discussion is a standing repo facility. We are\nin the process of evaluating such a facility’s potential costs and benefits, and exploring possible designs\nas well as alternatives, so it is still very much in the discourse, rather than the decision, phase.\nWhile September’s turmoil offered perhaps too much excitement, it also provided a good deal of\ninformation. It showed that we need a larger pool of reserves than most of our estimates had initially\nindicated. It showed that when reserves are scarce, even for as short a period as a week or so, it can\ngenerate large spikes in money market rates. And it showed, unfortunately, that banks remain\nextremely reluctant to borrow from the discount window, even when that reluctance results in outsized\npenalties far above the primary credit rate.\nCRA Modernization\nFinally, I know the banking community is awaiting final resolution to the discussion about modernizing\nthe Community Reinvestment Act. Our meeting here today is taking place north of the jagged line that\ndivides New Jersey between the New York Fed and the Philadelphia Fed. For those of you in the\naudience from South Jersey, you know that the discussion about the CRA takes on significant\nimportance in the Fed’s Third District, and we have hosted one-on-one meetings, roundtable\ndiscussions, and conferences with both banks and community members to better understand their\nconcerns and gather their insights on updates to the regulation.\nThe CRA was passed in 1977, and the last significant update to the legislation was done back in 1995. As\nregulators, we have heard feedback over the years for the need to update and revise the CRA, and in\n2018, we began an interagency process to make significant changes that reflect modern banking and\ncommunity needs.\nThe Philadelphia Fed hosted a conference on CRA modernization in February 2019, and that event\nallowed us to listen as various community development experts and financial industry leaders weighed\nin on the best approach. We recognize there is value in modernizing the regulation to address the\nchanging channels that serve customers beyond bank branches, to strengthen the law’s focus on local\ncommunities, and to help bring greater consistency and predictability to CRA ratings.\n5\n\nAs you probably know, the FDIC and OCC released their proposals in the fall of 2019. Last week,\nGovernor Lael Brainard unveiled the Fed’s own approach. The Fed’s proposal is based not only on the\nfeedback we heard from bankers and communities but also insights from the advanced notice of\nproposed rulemaking public comment process and a thorough review of a number of performance\nevaluations. In my view, modernizing the CRA will help banks better meet the credit needs in the low-\nand moderate-income communities they serve.\nBecause these updates to the CRA will impact your business models, I assume that you have read the\nideas and the metrics of the Fed’s plan, so I won’t go into much detail. But let me make some points\nabout the Fed’s proposal.\nThe Fed is proposing the creation of two tests: a retail test to assess a bank’s record of retail loans and\nservices in its assessment area; and a community development test for large banks, and wholesale and\nlimited-purpose banks to measure a bank’s performance on community development loans, qualified\ninvestments, and other services. A separate retail test will align with the key focus of the CRA, which is\nto ensure that banks are meeting the credit needs of underserved markets. Separate tests also\nunderscore the importance of the ability to tailor exams to each institution’s asset size, business lines,\nand local conditions.\nOur proposal also hones in on the importance of metrics and data dashboards, and distilling that data\ninto helping banks better track and benchmark their CRA performance. We at the Fed like to say we are\n“data driven,” and these dashboards will show that data matter not just in monetary policy but in the\nwork the Fed does in ensuring the U.S. has a robust and equitable financial system.\nTo reiterate what Governor Brainard said last Wednesday, “it is more important to get reforms right\nthan to do them quickly.” I couldn’t agree more with that sentiment when it comes to an important\npiece of legislation like the CRA. To achieve that goal, regulators at the Fed are having discussions with\nthe other banking regulators. We are mindful of the business costs that two sets of rules would impose\non banks. And I am hopeful that we can create a consensus going forward.\nConclusion\nCongress gave the Federal Reserve a dual mandate to maximize employment and stabilize prices. The\ndata show that the labor market is doing incredibly well, and I believe the economy is nearing our target\ninflation rate of 2 percent. All in all, my outlook for the economy is positive, but let me add that my\noutlook will continue to be driven by the data as each report is released throughout 2020.\n6\n\nThe data will also determine my view on monetary policy. And policy entails more than interest rates. As\nthe Fed oversees its balance sheet, we will be mindful of the unexpected, such as happened last\nSeptember.\nAnd with that, let me open the floor up to questions.\n7",

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nThe Pandemic, Automation, and Artificial Intelligence\nExecutive Briefing: AI and Machine Learning\nGlobal Interdependence Center\nPhiladelphia, PA (virtual)\nOctober 6, 2020\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood afternoon and welcome! I’m thrilled to be with you today, even if we are meeting ― fittingly for\nthe topic of today’s webinar ― in a rather “artificial” format. We are all hoping that the next time we\ngather together, it will actually be in person.\nNow, we may be meeting in unusual circumstances today, but some things never change. One of those\nis my standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect\nthose of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or in the Federal Reserve System.\nWe’re gathered here for what I’m certain will be a fascinating discussion on artificial intelligence ― and\nspecifically, the effect that COVID-19 has had on the field.\nCOVID-19 and the Economy\nBut I think there is an unwritten rule somewhere that every time a Fed president addresses an audience,\nhe or she also must also give an outlook on where the economy is headed. It’s one of the hazards of the\njob, I suppose.\nSo, I’ll begin with that, offering a quick look at where the economy has been, where it is now, and where\nit might be headed. And after that, I’ll share a few considerations on automation and AI.\nIt’s no secret that the economy has been profoundly affected by the same scourge that has kept us\nphysically apart today: COVID-19. So, let’s begin with where we are with COVID-19, given that the virus\nitself, more than anything else, is determining the trajectory of the economy.\n1\n\nAs you well know, still less than a year after COVID-19 first emerged, the virus has infected more than 30\nmillion people around the world and killed more than 1 million.\nOur own country has been particularly hard hit. Because of the United States’ inability to control the\nvirus, we’ve experienced approximately 21 percent of the world’s deaths, despite housing only about 4\npercent of the world’s population. Infection rates have come down from the highs we saw in the spring\nand summer, but the virus is still circulating widely in large swaths of the country. And in recent days,\nwe’ve even seen alarming spikes in other areas, like New York City, that we had hoped had permanently\nsuppressed their infection rates.\nAnd even within this disproportionately hard-hit country, certain communities have suffered more than\nothers. Racial minorities, particularly Black Americans and Hispanics, have been sickened from the\ncoronavirus at a far higher rate than other groups. They have also died at a higher rate. And in the\nensuing economic contraction, they have lost their jobs at a higher rate.\nA virus as contagious, deadly, and frankly as mysterious as COVID-19 was bound to have a significant\neconomic impact. Even before state and local governments took action this spring, many Americans had\nstopped dining out, getting on airplanes, and checking in to hotels. State and local governments then\ncompounded the economic misery when ― and I want to stress that they did so in a responsible\nattempt to protect public health ― they shuttered many businesses deemed nonessential.\nThe upshot? In the second quarter of this year, the U.S. experienced its worst quarterly GDP drop in\nrecorded history when the economy contracted at an annualized rate of nearly 33 percent. Twenty-two\nmillion jobs evaporated. Those with low-wage jobs, particularly racial and ethnic minorities, were\nhardest hit.\nThe good news is, following that contraction, the economy has rebounded faster than many of us had\nprojected. Stay-at-home orders have been lifted, and though large segments of the economy remain\ndepressed, millions of Americans have returned to their jobs. Indeed, about half of those 22 million\nresidents who were suddenly out of work earlier this year are now back, enough to nudge the\nunemployment rate down from 10.2 percent to 7.9 percent, which is still disastrously high.\nFor now, I expect this recovery to continue, though not fast enough that, by the end of this year, GDP\nwill have returned to where it was before the pandemic struck. In fact, there have been a few recent\nsigns of plateauing, suggesting that a return to the baseline will take quite some time. Segments like\ntourism and hospitality will remain subdued for a long time to come, presenting an overall drag on GDP\n2\n\nand employment growth. Employment, unfortunately, probably won’t be back to pre-pandemic levels\nuntil 2023. Last week’s disappointing jobs report underscored how far we have to go.\nI want to caution that this forecast is freighted with uncertainty because, once again, of COVID-19. The\nscenario of continued growth that I have presented depends on a sustained decline in the rate of new\ninfections ― probably a result of nearly universal mask wearing, especially indoors ― that ensures only\nsporadic new outbreaks. We’re also assuming that a vaccine becomes widely available sometime mid to\nlate next year. But COVID-19, as the world has learned all too painfully, is difficult to control. And so, the\npath of the economy largely depends on the path of the virus.\nIt depends in no small part, too, on the path that the federal government chooses to take. My forecasts\nare assuming an additional $1 trillion of fiscal support, which has yet to materialize.\nCOVID-19 and Automation\nFundamentally, this pandemic has had the effect of accelerating trends that were already present in our\nsociety. Categories like department stores were already struggling ― and COVID-19 only served to\nexpedite their obsolescence. Racial minorities like Black Americans were already more likely to be\nunemployed than other groups ― and COVID-19 heightened this yawning disparity.\nSimilarly, trends in labor markets like the increased use of automation are not new. They are simply\nhappening at a more rapid clip since the onset of the pandemic.\nFor decades, the U.S. economy has seen increasing automation in industries spanning manufacturing to\nfood service to office work. But the COVID-19 pandemic has ensured that those transitions are now\noccurring at lightning speed.\nResearchers here at the Philadelphia Fed have been closely studying the effect of the pandemic on labor\nmarkets and automation and have made several key ― if still rather preliminary ― findings. I would like\nto share some with you.\nSome of their findings have been predictable: It turns out that the most automatable jobs are those that\ndo not permit remote work and those that carry a high risk of COVID-19 transmission. Obviously,\nmachinery and software are not susceptible to the virus so have often become more attractive options\nthan human workers during the pandemic. Think of meat-packing and slaughterhouse jobs, for example,\nwhich are increasingly automated. Or, closer to home, think of the Pennsylvania Turnpike laying off\nmore than 500 workers this spring as it switched to automatic tolling.\n3\n\nOther findings are more surprising and deeply alarming. You might expect that a lot of the jobs that\nwere eliminated because of COVID-19 might come roaring back after the virus passes, for example. But\nthis might not be the case.\nFed researchers have found, based on precedent dating to prior recessions, that, in fact, many of the\njobs that the pandemic eliminated may never return ― even after the virus has passed. They will instead\nbe automated. Those Pennsylvania Turnpike workers were permanently laid off, for instance.\nOur researchers have also found that minority workers are more likely than other groups to hold jobs\nthat could be lost, permanently, to automation. And that leads to the alarming conclusion that\npandemic-induced automation will, as we have in fact seen, only serve to accentuate preexisting\ndisparities in our society.\nWe can’t stop technological progress, of course. But this wave of automation will require each of us to\nthink hard about how we can transition affected workers into new, stable careers filled with\nopportunity.\nCOVID-19 and Algorithms\nThe pandemic likewise has had a profound effect on the algorithmic artificial intelligence that is\nincreasingly used to power large segments of our economy. Algorithms are built on precedent, and so\nit’s little surprise that as COVID-19 caught governments unawares, it also significantly affected their\nability to process what was happening. The algorithms ― like all of us ― had simply never experienced\nthe set of circumstances that COVID-19 presented. And so many algorithms have seen a deterioration in\ntheir performance during this period.\nTake credit scores. One would assume that in a time when 22 million Americans had lost their jobs and\nmillions more Americans had their hours cut that credit scores would have declined. But in fact, the\nopposite happened: Credit scores have, in the aggregate, risen during this period.\nOne reason for this is that, even in this economic downturn, delinquencies are actually down because\nthe aforementioned CARES Act mandated loan forbearance. That was absolutely the right thing to do\nbut led the currently used algorithms to the counterintuitive conclusion that default probabilities have\nin fact decreased.\nAnother consideration going forward will be to ensure that algorithms do not serve to perpetuate the\nkinds of discrimination that we have seen historically in our financial sector. Will machine learning\n4\n\nperpetuate long-standing inequities in, for instance, the rate at which certain racial groups are turned\ndown for loans?\nThis issue will require a conversation spanning academic fields ― computer science, law, economics,\nand others.\nAnd it will also require action from not just regulators but probably lawmakers, too, given that many of\nthe laws governing discrimination date back to 1961, when computers couldn’t even fit inside a single\nroom. Conversations like the one we are hosting today hold important implications for the future of our\neconomy ― and making sure that we are building an equitable future for all of us.\nAnd in the meantime, we can rest assured the development of artificial intelligence and machine\nlearning will continue ― though I hope it stops before they figure out a way to replace Fed presidents\nwith robots.\nThank you very much.\n5",

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nEconomic Outlook: The Labor Market, Rates, and the Balance Sheet\nMarket News International (MNI) Connect Roundtable\nNew York, NY\nMay 23, 2017\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood evening; it’s a pleasure to be here.\nTonight, I’d like to give you an overview of my outlook for the economy going forward,\nincluding my preferences for the path of monetary policy. Which, I assume, is what you’re\nexpecting from me.\nI also assume you expect the standard disclaimer, which I’ll get out of the way immediately: The\nviews I express here this evening are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone\nelse in the Federal Reserve System.\nEconomic Outlook\nLet’s jump right in.\nStarting off, the advance estimate of first quarter GDP was that it grew only 0.7 percent. That’s\nprompted a lot of concern, which I think is an overreaction. It’s not a good idea to get caught up\nin a single data point, or report, or even a quarter’s numbers. It’s more important to look at\nunderlying trends and what they say about the economy’s trajectory in the medium term.\nA slow first quarter isn’t something to ignore entirely, but weak first quarters have been a feature\nof the economy for the past several years. It’s essentially the norm now. Seasonality, weather,\nand low inventory investment were the main culprits this time, and those are likely transitory —\nthey’ve been issues in the past, and they’ve retreated as the year wore on. So, it’s not enough to\nmake me think that we’re headed in the wrong direction. It is enough to make me revise my\n1\n\ngrowth projection down by 0.1 percentage point for the year, but that’s about the extent of it.\nOverall, that means I see growth of about 2.3 percent for 2017.\nTurning to the inflation side of our mandate, we’re still on track. While numbers have retreated\nslightly, again, I’m looking at the trend. A month or two in the wrong direction isn’t enough to\nmake me lose faith.\nOn employment, things are looking very good. The unemployment rate has dropped to its lowest\npoint in a decade, quits are up, and we’re starting to see upward pressure on wages. I estimate 2.5\nto 3 percent wage growth this year, which is good. It’s what has been missing from this recovery.\nI expect the unemployment rate to continue to edge down, dropping as low as 4.2 percent around\nthe end of next year. As for job creation, I estimate a rate of about 200,000 a month on average\nfor 2017, falling to about 100,000 a month by the end of 2019.\nHere’s another point I want to make about headlines making more waves than they should. In the\nrelatively near future, we’re not going to need the same pace of job creation as we did over the\npast several years. We had a lot of ground to make up for then, but we won’t need the same rate\ngoing forward. Estimates vary, but somewhere between 70,000 and 100,000 a month is what\nmany believe is appropriate to keep up with population growth.1\nUltimately, we’re looking at a labor market with very little slack left.\nIn the near term, that means we should start to see movement on wage growth. In the medium\nterm, it means we’re going to be seeing a more moderate pace of job creation. In the longer term\n… it means a serious talk about the labor market.\nLabor Force Participation\nThe labor force participation rate is still low. In the past couple of years, it’s moved roughly\nsideways, which was an upward surprise to some, given demographic motivators. And it was a\ndownward surprise to others who speculated that more people would start to come back off the\nsidelines as the recovery continued.\n1 See, for example, Daniel Aaronson, Scott A. Brave, and David Kelley, “Is There Still Slack in the Labor Market,”\nChicago Fed Letter, 359, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago (2016).\n2\n\nI’m in the camp that says we’re still projected to stay at a lower rate than previous years and that\nwe won’t see a reversal in that trend going forward. Research by my staff is clear that the fall in\nthe labor force participation rate is mostly due to demographic factors.2\nThe most influential impact is coming from the first wave of baby boomers starting to retire.\nThere’s also the simple fact that we’re living longer, so there are just more people in the mix.\nWhich I think is something to be celebrated, personally.\nThere are other contributing factors: students not working while they’re in school, for instance. A\nshift in views on work–life balance that has more people making the tradeoff of a single-income\nhousehold. And then there’s the one that’s received the most attention: the declining participation\nof the prime age male cohort. There are a lot of theories and research on where they’ve gone.\nAlan Krueger’s much-talked-about recent paper found that close to half of the prime age men not\nin the labor force may have a serious health condition that keeps them from working.3\nThat said, there is some nuance to the prime age male conundrum. While the overall\nparticipation rate is low and there’s no evidence that it will surge upward, there is some room for\nprime age men’s participation to edge up a bit. The largest contributor to this group’s\nnonparticipation in recent years has been disability. Which theoretically should be long-lasting or\npermanent. But my staff’s research shows that at least some of that can be cyclical.\nThat, of course, will contribute marginally to the overall rate, although it won’t give us the boost\nwe need to keep up with growth.\nIf we look at the U.S. economy during the recovery, we can already see some effects of low\nparticipation. After bottoming out in mid-2009, real GDP grew at an average of about 2 percent\nfor the subsequent six years. That’s very slow for a recovery, and it’s even slow by historical\naverages. Growth averaged 3.5 percent in the second half of the 20th century — 1.7 percent of\nthat came from the expansion of the American workforce. By contrast, the labor force has only\ngrown by 0.5 percent over the recovery, less than half the historical average.\n2 Shigeru Fujita, “On the Causes of Declines in the Labor Force Participation Rate,” Research Rap Special Report,\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia (February 2014).\n3 Alan B. Krueger, “Where Have All the Workers Gone?” Princeton University and National Bureau of Economic\nResearch (October 2016).\n3\n\nThen there are the demographic shifts: The changes to the American labor force in age, in\neducational attainment, and in expertise in certain sectors are actually harming productivity. In\ngeneral, productivity is higher in midcareer workers, and their proportion of the U.S. labor\nmarket is smaller than it was during the height of the baby boom’s working years.4 Even though\nmillennials outnumber us, they aren’t all fully in the workforce, and even the oldest ones aren’t\nquite in their prime earning years.\nWith all those people in retirement and with people living longer, there are more economic\npressures to contend with. And the consequence of a declining participation rate means that\noutput per capita will grow more slowly.\nWe therefore have a workforce that is less productive than it used to be with the pressure of\ncaring for a retiring segment of the population that is bigger than it’s ever been before. There will\nbe a strain on Medicare and Social Security, leaving fewer resources for the country to spend on\nother areas — for instance, maintaining our competitive global edge.\nMy remarks today will be heavy with caveats. The first being that as a Fed president, I’m not in\nthe business of telling other people how to conduct their policy. So, the points I make today are\nfrom the perspective of someone who is affected — as a policymaker and a citizen — by the\ndecisions made in legislative halls but not as someone who’s in a position to make those changes\nhimself.\nMonetary policy is fairly limited in its scope. The Fed’s job is to create the conditions for a\nstrong and healthy economy. Changing the trajectory of U.S. growth takes legislative action.\nThe fact is that this is basically it. This is the labor force we have. And if we expect our economy\nto expand, we need people to do the jobs we have now and the ones that are coming in the future.\nEmployers are struggling to fill the positions they have open. Even with workforce development\nand training programs, which are necessary, we just don’t have the people. We need to close the\n4 James Feyrer, “Demographics and Productivity,” The Review of Economics and Statistics, MIT Press, 89:1,\nFebruary 2007, pp. 100–109.\n4\n\ngap in the workforce. And given long-term demographic trends, that means we need to turn to\noutside sources.\nAgain, I want to be clear: I’m not suggesting immigration policy or telling anyone how to go\nabout legislating. But from a purely economic standpoint, immigration, particularly high-skilled\nimmigration, is a source of immense potential for economic growth. Fundamentally, we need\nmore people; that’s how we get more growth.\nMonetary Policy\nBut let me talk about the policy that is within my purview.\nFirst and foremost, based on the strong economic outlook, I continue to see three rate hikes for\n2017 as appropriate. That, as ever, is assuming that things unfold in line with my projections.\nThen there’s the 800-pound gorilla in the room. Or, should I say, the $4.5 trillion gorilla in the\nroom: the balance sheet.\nI know everyone here has the specifics down, but for the benefit of anyone who might not, and\nfor posterity’s sake, a very quick primer on where we are and how we got here.\nIn normal times, the Fed holds mostly short-term treasuries. In extraordinary times, like in the\nrecession and its aftermath, we’ve turned to unconventional policies, including QE. Which meant\nwe were buying assets on a much larger scale and venturing into longer-term treasuries along\nwith mortgage-backed securities. That swelled the balance sheet to $4.5 trillion, which is\nsignificantly larger than the $2 trillion it was when we started extraordinary monetary policy and\nthe roughly $900 billion it was before the crisis.\nSince we stopped the purchases, in late 2014, we’ve simply reinvested the proceedings as\nthey’ve come to maturity to keep the balance sheet constant. The discussion now is how and\nwhen to begin unwinding those assets, and, to some extent, why.\nThe why part is easy: As the economy continues its march toward normal, we’ll need to start\nremoving accommodation. That’s a point I want to emphasize. Monetary policy has been very\naccommodative for almost nine years. As we start the process of normalization, it’s important to\nremember that tightening policy isn’t the same thing as tight policy. We’re talking about easing\n5\n\nour foot off the proverbial gas — very slowly, I might add — we’re not talking about applying\nthe brakes.\nWe will still be holding a lot of assets, we’ll still have rates that are historically very low, and the\noverall stance of monetary policy will still be very supportive of growth.\nThis is about recognizing that we’re headed toward an economy at full health and that means we\nstart hovering over the punch bowl again, just in case we need to take it away. We don’t have our\nhands on it yet; we’re just edging toward it in case the economy starts to look like it’s\noverheating.\nAnother factor of the “why” is that we want our unconventional tools to be at their most\neffective. As productivity has dropped, it’s taken the neutral funds rate with it, which means the\nzero lower bound is closer and we have less room for maneuver. That constricts the efficacy of\nusing the fed funds rate. And if something were to happen, if another crisis were to occur, further\nasset purchases may prove less effective, or perhaps even more difficult to execute, with a large\nbalance sheet still in place.\nAs for the “when” part, I’m going to disappoint the journalists in the room by saying that the\ntiming isn’t tied to a specific date or number. It’s the same discussion we had about when to start\nraising rates: We don’t want to get too far behind the curve on inflation and get forced into an\nabrupt or steep correction course that could cause market disruption. But we also don’t want to\ncommit to a course of action if the data were to start moving in the wrong direction. I do think\nwe’ll start sometime this year, but I’m not tying it to any numerical determinant, whether that’s a\ndecimal point on inflation or a day in the calendar.\nThe “how” is predictable, slow, and as boring as possible. There are different options under\ndiscussion, but we’re looking for a normalization process that is gradual and essentially on\nautopilot. If something happens, of course we’ll intervene, but we fundamentally want to push\nthe start button and leave it to churn slowly away. We’ll still discuss the balance sheet in\nmeetings, but if things are good, we’ll leave it to gradually unwind in the background.\nAnd we’ll let you know. I can say with absolute certainty that markets will get a heads up with a\ngood amount of time.\n6\n\nI can also definitively say that it will be boring. It will be the policy equivalent of watching paint\ndry. Fed presidents had a brief encounter with people finding us interesting over the past few\nyears. Now we’re headed back to the natural state of things, where people try to avoid getting\nstuck next to us at dinner parties.\nThe funds rate will be our primary monetary policy tool, and we’ll keep the unconventional ones\nin the arsenal in case we need to use them again, which I hope we won’t.\nSo, that’s it. I know I’ve probably disappointed some of you by not giving dates and times and\nthe secrets of the chamber … although I’m sure you’re going to ask me in Q&A anyway. And\nwith that, I’ll turn it over to you to do exactly that.\nThank you.\n7",

Harker today are my own and not\nnecessarily those of the\nFederal Reserve System or\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nthe Federal Open Market\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia Committee (FOMC).\n\nEconomic Outlook\nGlobal Interdependence Center\nCentral Banking Series Conference\nNassau, Bahamas\nFebruary 17, 2025\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThank you, it is my pleasure to join you all for this conference.\nThis is the last time I will be attending a Global Interdependence Center (GIC) event as\npresident and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, given my upcoming\nretirement at the end of June. So, please, and for perhaps the last time, allow me to remind\nyou that the views I am about to express are my own do not necessarily reflect those of my\ncolleagues throughout the Federal Reserve System or on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC).\nI must also express my sincere thanks to GIC, and Executive Director Jill Fornito, for\nbringing us together.\nGIC’s work to enhance understanding of the underpinnings of global economic conditions\nthrough convenings such as this — whether we be central bankers, academics, or private-\nsector economists and experts — has prepared us to knowledgably face challenges and\nfind opportunities.\nAs president of the Philly Fed, I feel somewhat an obligation to, at this moment, mention\nour fair city’s most-celebrated citizen, Benjamin Franklin, who is widely quoted to have\nsaid, “An investment in knowledge pays the best interest.” Now, he said those words before\nthe United States was even the United States and over a century before the Federal\nReserve System was established. But leave it to Ben Franklin to provide timeless guidance.\nSo, I sincerely hope the time we’re investing together now will similarly pay interest by\npresenting ideas on how we can, together, foster greater global economic opportunity,\nstability, and growth.\nAnd now that I’ve uttered the “I” word, I might as well get into my outlook!\nAs you know, two-and-a-half weeks ago, the FOMC voted to hold the policy interest rate\nsteady at 4.25 to 4.5 percent. Even though I am not a voting member of the Committee this\nyear, I do fully support this decision.\n\nAcross the final three FOMC meetings of 2024, the Committee decided to reduce the policy\nrate by a full percentage point. In doing so, we recalibrated the stance of monetary policy to\na point where it remains restrictive, but less so than last summer, when the policy rate had\nbeen above 5 percent for more than 12 months. The recalibration has left policy in good\nposition for the road ahead. We will remain data dependent, looking for the underlying\nconditions, and making decisions based on our best assessment of the outlook and risks.\nLooking at inflation — and at personal consumption expenditure (PCE) inflation,\nspecifically — the December-to-December annual rate of 2.6 percent headline and 2.8\npercent in the core categories largely met expectations. The latest Consumer Price Index\n(CPI) data for January point to a bit of a bump for prices. Though I must say, again, in\nJanuary. In the last decade, CPI inflation in January has surprised on the upside nine out of\n10 times. My conjecture is that seasonal adjustments are struggling to keep up with a fast-\nchanging economy, and we need to parse the underlying trends from the month-to-month\nnoise.\nTo be sure, inflation has remained elevated and somewhat sticky over the past several\nmonths, both in the overall and core figures. But that notwithstanding, I do believe that our\ncurrent positioning will bring inflation back to target, in the next two years if conditions\nbroadly evolve as I expect. If we were to look at monetary policy as we would a gauge on\nour car dashboards, the needle would still be pointing to the “restrictive” side, albeit less\nso than it was five or more months ago. We need to continue letting monetary policy do its\nwork and letting the data roll in. But, indeed, there are also upside risks which we cannot\neasily dismiss, which I’ll touch on in a moment.\nLabor markets have largely returned to balance. Last year ended with a stellar report for job\ngrowth, and this year started pretty well too, so the signs indicate hiring has continued at a\ndecent clip.\nSo, I am concerned when I hear or read observers referring to the jobs numbers as\nrepresenting a “slow down” in hiring. Well, yes, it is slower when compared to the torrid\npace of growth in the months coming out of the pandemic. Some jobseekers may be taking\nlonger today to find new employment than they had in, say 2022, but the numbers imply\nthat persistence pays off and workers are finding jobs. And in an overall historic context, I’d\nsuggest that the labor market has recalibrated to where it was in 2018 or 2019. And I don’t\nknow many of us who would argue that the labor market was in poor shape then. Quite the\nopposite.\nNow, surely, it is our nature to want to parse out month-over-month fluctuations. But, as I\nsaid earlier, I am more interested in trends gleaned by looking over a longer time horizon\nthan I am noise from a single report. In the labor picture, one thing I see is average monthly\nemployment creation over the entire course of 2024 largely mirroring the pace of growth of\nthe years immediately preceding the pandemic.\n2\n\nThe unemployment rate remains low and is about in line with my projections. Meanwhile,\nGDP growth has similarly continued apace, with 2024 proving the American economy more\nresilient than some forecasts had predicted. And while fourth-quarter growth came in\nlower than the previous quarter, the economy stood firm especially in the face of an\nOctober highlighted by a major labor strike and multiple natural disasters. And yet again,\nconsumers came in with another strong quarter of spending, even if there are some clouds\nin the distance that we should not ignore as I’ll touch on, as well.\nI would also point to the Philadelphia Fed’s own Aruoba-Diebold-Scotti business\nconditions index, which measures a slew of high-frequency indicators. This index has been\nmoving upward since October and has been tracking in generally positive territory since\nlate November.\nAs we started the year, the Philly Fed’s January Manufacturing Business Outlook Survey —\nthe MBOS — registered its biggest jump in current activity in nearly four years. Now,\nobviously, one month does not a trend make, so I will certainly be looking at the release of\nthis month’s MBOS later this week for greater guidance.\nAll in all, the current data paints a picture of an American economy that continues to\nfunction from a position of strength. Inflation is still elevated and the mission is not yet\naccomplished — but I am encouraged both by the longer-view, which clearly points to\ndisinflation in the last two years, and the zoomed-in view, seeing key categories like shelter\nmove in the right direction. GDP and production remain resilient. Labor is largely in\nbalance. And these are reasons enough for holding the policy rate steady.\nAnd while I won’t commit to a specific timetable, I remain optimistic that inflation will\ncontinue a downward path and the policy rate will be able to decline over the long run. This\ndoes not mean that there aren’t areas of potential concern. In fact, the only thing I can say\nwith any certainty is that there are many uncertainties.\nUpside risks to inflation and downside risks to employment remain in the balance. With\nregard to inflation, we simply do not yet know what, if any, impacts we may see from new\neconomic policies and priorities, whether they be domestic or foreign in nature and\nimpact.\nAs a reminder, it is not the Fed’s role to devise, let alone comment upon, any such policies.\nOur role is to use the monetary policy tools at our disposal to ensure we can meet our dual\nmandate within those chosen frameworks. And there are risks from entirely non-\ngovernmental happenings as well, such as the impact that avian flu may have not just on\nthe price of eggs but also on all the products which rely upon eggs for production.\nMoreover, I must acknowledge that as far as I can stand here and say that the American\neconomy is operating from a position of overall strength, there are many, many families and\n3\n\nbusinesses for whom that pronouncement rings somewhat hollow. And, in fact, I see some\nof the basis for their sentiment in the data we collect at the Philadelphia Fed.\nFor example, the Philly Fed has access to a long data series looking at consumer credit. In\nthe aggregate, overall credit card delinquency rates have been moving sideways. But our\nstaff has found an increasing practice of consumers making only the minimum payment\ntoward their credit card balances, with more than one-in-nine active accounts now making\njust the minimum monthly payment. Now, certainly, not every minimum payment will\nbecome a missed payment, and not every account is going to fall into the hole of\ndelinquency. Some consumers, surely, will cure their accounts and clear their balances.\nBut the data show the increasing stress that many consumers are facing in managing to\nkeep their heads above a financial waterline.\nMoreover, our Consumer Finance Institute (CFI) recently conducted a survey in which it\nasked individuals expressly about the cost of their home or renters, health, and auto\ninsurance premiums. The CFI report of the survey is yet to be final, but I do wish to share\nsome of its insights with regard to homeowners insurance, specifically. First, insurance\nholders reported increases in their premiums over the prior year at a higher rate than any\nother insurance product. Moreover, more of them described the increase as “significant.”\nSecond, homeowners were much more likely to have taken on a higher deductible as a\nmeans of managing the increase in premiums. In other words, they are willing to take\nfinancial risks in the future, literally betting the house, in order to improve their liquidity\nposition right now.\nNow, when it comes to the inflation indices — whether you are looking at the CPI or PCE —\ninsurance costs may not carry enormous weight within in the overall equations. But,\naround kitchen tables they do, especially among households which already feel financial\nstress.\nAnd as GDP has been buoyed by the resilience of consumer spending, it does raise a\nconcern as to how long this appetite for spending will persist.\nAt the moment, these are still just clouds on the horizon. Whether they dissipate or gather\nis still, pardon the pun, up in the air. We just need to make sure we’re watching very\ncarefully because while there certainly is no virtue to acting too late there is also no virtue\nto acting too soon.\nAgainst this backdrop, the responsible play is to watch the hard data as they come in, along\nwith the soft data we glean from our contacts, to listen to the story they are telling us, and\nthen acting accordingly to the moment. I have only three more FOMC meetings to attend\nbefore my retirement, but this is the playbook that I will be following. Between our January\nmeeting and the next FOMC meeting in March, we will have received two additional CPI and\nPCE readings, along with two months’ worth of employment reporting.\n4\n\nThat allows us ample time to read deep into a whole lot of data. And that’s good. In this\nwork we disengage from hypotheticals and focus on realities. The more data points we\nhave, the better these realities come into focus. Our actions, let alone our public\npronouncements, cannot be based on conjecture but rather on facts. And by “us” and\n“our” I do not mean those of us sitting around the FOMC conference table, but all of us\nhere.\nI thank you for allowing me these few moments and, Bill, I look forward to our discussion.\n5",

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nThe Outlook for 2021 Nationally and Locally\nPhiladelphia Business Journal Economic Forecast\nPhiladelphia, PA (virtual)\nJanuary 7, 2021\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood morning! It’s great to be here … at least in some form. I’m hopeful that the next time we convene\nit will be in 3D.\nAnd happy new year! After the year we just had ― filled with tremendous loss, pain, and dislocation and\ndisunity in our nation ― I and my colleagues at the Fed recommit our efforts to serve the Third District\nand the country in order to build a strong and inclusive economy, an economy that works for all\nAmericans.\nMy plan for this morning is to share a few thoughts on where the national economy is now and where\nit’s headed. Given that this is a Philadelphia audience, I’ll then offer some thoughts on the outlook for\nour region. After that, we’ll open things up for a Q&A, which I’m really looking forward to. I will\nespecially welcome the hard questions, such as “What became of our Eagles this year?”\nBut before we proceed, I need to give you my standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my\nown and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or in\nthe Federal Reserve System.\nThe State of the Virus\nNow, it’s no secret that the economy has been profoundly affected by the same scourge that has kept us\nphysically apart today: COVID-19.\n1\n\nWhen you’re looking for a house, a realtor will tell you what the three most important things are:\nlocation, location, and location. And when you’re talking to a Fed president, he or she will tell you that\nthe three most important things affecting the economy are: the virus, the virus, the virus.\nSo, let’s begin with where we are with COVID-19, given that the virus itself ― more than anything else\n― is determining the trajectory of the economy.\nIn the space of about a year, the virus has infected more than 85 million people around the world and\nkilled more than 1.8 million. In the U.S., the death toll has now surpassed 350,000. The math is stark:\nWith 4 percent of the world’s population, we’ve suffered 20 percent of the world’s fatalities. Certain\ncommunities have borne the brunt of the virus more than others, with racial minorities both becoming\ninfected with the coronavirus and dying at higher rates than White Americans.\nWhile the number of infections and deaths fell during the warmer months, cases have been on the rise\nsince September. And deaths, a lagging indicator, are tragically now even more voluminous than they\nwere during the first wave of COVID-19 last spring.\nIt’s truly impressive that several pharmaceutical companies were able to develop highly effective\nvaccines for COVID-19 at warp speed ― a real tribute to modern ingenuity. But what matters more than\nvaccines is vaccinations ― that is, getting needles in people’s arms.\nThere, our country’s performance has been incredibly disappointing so far. Fewer than 5 million people\nhave received their first dose of the vaccine ― less than 2 percent of our total population. In Israel, by\ncontrast, they’ve managed to distribute the first dose to more than 15 percent of the country’s\npopulation.\nThe State of the National Economy\nCOVID-19 has been utterly determinative of the U.S. economy’s performance, both as local\ngovernments impose measures to curtail the spread, which depress economic activity, and as\nconsumers change their behavior to protect themselves and their loved ones. The latter is a crucial point\nthat sometimes gets lost.\nBut the bottom line is this: If people don’t feel safe, they won’t engage in the broader economy.\nAnd so, even before state and local governments took action last spring, many Americans had stopped\ndining out, getting on airplanes, and boarding public transit. That’s a trend that has continued\n2\n\nthroughout the pandemic. Many local governments have introduced measures to curtail indoor\nrestaurant dining. But even before that, data that we look at here at the Fed showed that people had\nbegun dining out less.\nIt isn’t surprising then that the economy has largely tracked the spread of the virus. In the second\nquarter of last year, as the U.S. endured its first wave of COVID-19 and as state and local governments\nimplemented various shutdown measures, the U.S. experienced its worst quarterly GDP drop in\nrecorded history. The economy contracted at an annualized rate of nearly 32 percent; 22 million jobs\nevaporated. Those with low-wage jobs, particularly racial and ethnic minorities, were the hardest hit.\nFollowing that contraction, the economy rebounded quite nicely. Stay-at-home orders were lifted, and\nmillions of Americans returned to their jobs. Indeed, a little more than half of those 22 million residents\nwho were suddenly out of work earlier in 2020 are now back, enough to nudge the unemployment rate\ndown from 14.7 percent in April to 6.7 percent today, which is still far too high, especially because the\nheadline number masks the millions of Americans who have simply dropped out of the labor force. It’s\nalso troubling that the ranks of the long-term unemployed have swelled.\nOur country’s economic tribulations, tracking the path of the virus, have wreaked havoc on people’s\nlives. Since the onset of the pandemic, the Philadelphia Fed’s Consumer Finance Institute has conducted\nseveral nationwide surveys of consumers about their financial situation.\nNot surprisingly, last spring saw a huge surge in Americans facing financial hardship. But then, as cases\ndeclined in the warmer months and the economy reopened, things looked up. Between April and July\n2020, respondents to the survey reported steady improvements. Increasingly fewer of those responding\nto the survey reported losing their job, experiencing declines in income, and having trouble making ends\nmeet.\nWith the resurgence of the virus, those trends have turned sharply negative once again. While the latest\nsurvey found fewer respondents reporting job losses, they did report more income declines and\nincreased concerns about their financial futures.\nThe hard times will be with us for a little while longer. On the national level, for now, I’m expecting the\nfourth quarter of last year to show modest growth, before a significant slowing in the first quarter of this\nyear ― possibly even negative growth. In other words, “happy new year” has a caveat.\n3\n\nThe good news is that the weakness should stay relatively short lived ― as we all hope COVID-19\nvaccinations become more widely available. The recently passed $900 billion of fiscal support ― while\nwe can quibble over the details ― should also help buoy the economy. I am optimistic that in the second\nhalf of 2021, the economy ― and frankly, life ― should begin to look much more normal. GDP growth\nshould be strong in the second half of the year, and through 2022, before a light tapering in 2023.\nThe State of the Local Economy\nHere in our area, the situation should look similar to the national picture, with slow to negative growth\nin the beginning of the year and a much healthier ― in all senses of the word ― second half of 2021.\nOur region, for better or worse, tends to be roughly a middle-of-the-pack player when it comes to\neconomic trends. We don’t boom like some areas, but we don’t bust like them either.\nLocal employment figures show that this trend has remained true during the COVID-19 pandemic. As of\nlate last year, in Pennsylvania, year-over-year employment was down 7.8 percent, which is roughly in\nthe middle of the pack among the states. In New York State, for instance, employment was down 11.2\npercent, whereas it was down only 4.5 percent in Texas.\nBut of course those numbers mask vast gaps across different sectors of the economy within our region.\nIn the Philadelphia area, like in the rest of the country, the hardest hit sectors have been leisure and\nhospitality and education and health services. In leisure and hospitality alone, nearly 100,000 jobs have\nbeen lost in the Philadelphia MSA since March. The upshot is that year over year, about 30 percent of\ntotal employment in that sector has evaporated ― a stunning decline. In education and health services,\nmeanwhile, nearly 30,000 jobs have been eliminated since the onset of the pandemic.\nManufacturing, by contrast, has held up relatively well, with employment down less than 5 percent.\nOutput in manufacturing has remained strong as well, with activity at or above pre-pandemic levels. And\ngiven that employment has declined slightly in manufacturing and output has not, this means the sector\nhas figured out ways of being more productive during the pandemic.\nThe Coming Recovery\nI expect that, as we recover, the economic picture will remain uneven, with wildly unequal outcomes\nacross sectors of the economy. There’s a strong chance that consumer habits will have changed long\nterm, even when we’ve finally rid ourselves of COVID-19. That will have significant impacts.\n4\n\nWith the boom in videoconferencing, for instance, business travel could remain depressed indefinitely,\nplacing stress on hotels and restaurants. Americans may have become even more addicted to online\nshopping, harming the physical retail industry. And higher education ― my old industry ― faces major\nthreats not only from changes brought on by the pandemic, but also from the country’s demographics.\nThe traditional college-age population has actually begun to decline.\nAll of these changes would in turn have knock-on effects to other sectors of the economy, like\ncommercial real estate. And a downturn in commercial real estate would, of course, affect the financial\nindustry … et cetera, et cetera.\nAutomation represents another challenge. Researchers at the Philadelphia Fed have found that many of\nthe jobs that the pandemic eliminated may never return ― even after the virus has passed. They will\ninstead be automated. To take an example near and dear to all of our hearts, the Pennsylvania Turnpike\nhas switched permanently to automatic tolling ― a change that was initially spurred by the onset of the\npandemic and the need to promote social distancing.\nToday, I’d like to challenge all of us to think hard about ways to make sure the coming recovery is not\nonly strong, but equitable.\nAnd that’s a subject I would be happy to address more during the Q&A, as the Philadelphia Fed is\nworking on a number of important projects. It’s my firm belief that, as we emerge from this tragic\nperiod, we can seize many opportunities to build the society we all want.\nSo, thank you, and happy new year once again. Now let’s open this up for discussion.\n5",

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nSupporting Small Business Owners of Color1\nRacism and the Economy: Focus on Entrepreneurship\nPhiladelphia, PA (Virtual)\nJune 2, 2021\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood afternoon and welcome! It’s an honor to be here at this, the Federal Reserve’s sixth virtual session\non racism and the economy. This series, sponsored by all 12 Reserve Banks, examines the economic\nimpact of structural racism and advances bold ideas and concrete actions to achieve an economy that\nmakes opportunity available to everyone and that achieves maximum employment. I’m thrilled to be\nhere and delighted that we have such a robust turnout — an indication of how urgent this issue is.\nBut before we begin, I have to give you my standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my\nown and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or in\nthe Federal Reserve System.\nThe tragic events of last year threw our country’s tortured relationship with racism into stark relief. The\nCOVID-19 crisis, in both its health and economic effects, disproportionately impacted people and\ncommunities of color. And the death of George Floyd spurred civil unrest that illuminated the structural\nracism that remains stubbornly pervasive in our society.\nBut even though last year’s events brought structural racism to the forefront of the country’s\nconsciousness, they were hardly novel. They were instead part of a long and painful history that has\nindelibly stained American history.\n1 Note: This speech was prerecorded for the Racism and the Economy: Focus on Entrepreneurship event.\n1\n\nIndeed, we are convening one day after the 100-year anniversary of the Tulsa Race Massacre, an act of\nracial terrorism in which a White mob destroyed a thriving Black neighborhood — “the Black Wall\nStreet” — in that Oklahoma city.\nIn addition to the lives lost, the Tulsa massacre destroyed scores of small businesses, which are the\nfocus of today’s vitally important session. Entrepreneurship and small business ownership provide\nopportunities for Americans to generate wealth and build thriving communities. They are also an\nessential plank in building an equitable workforce recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and an\neconomy that works for all Americans.\nSmall businesses are drivers of job growth. As of 2018, there were more than 30 million American small\nbusinesses, meaning they employ fewer than 500 people. Those small businesses collectively employ\nnearly 60 million people or about half of the country’s private workforce.\nAnd crucially, small businesses can be an engine for building a more racially equitable economy: More\nthan 8 million small businesses are owned by racial minorities. Here in Philadelphia, we are particularly\nsensitive to the concerns of these vital businesses. In Philadelphia — the nation’s largest predominantly\nBlack city — fully 99.7 percent of businesses are small businesses.\nBut let’s be honest. These statistics, impressive as they are, belie the very real structural barriers that\nstymie entrepreneurship among racial and ethnic minorities. For instance, despite its large African\nAmerican population, only 6 percent of small businesses here in Philadelphia are helmed by Black\nowners and that includes sole proprietorships.\nOne real problem is a lack of banking relationships. This became painfully obvious during the\nadministration of the CARES Act’s PPP loans, which were largely funneled through preexisting\nrelationships between lenders and business owners. PPP loans have been a vital lifeline for small\nbusinesses during the pandemic as local governments shuttered businesses and consumers stayed\nhome.\nBut they weren’t distributed equitably. In fact, not even close.\nAccording to data submitted by applicants to the Small Business Administration, which managed the\nprogram, during the height of the pandemic, fully 83 percent of PPP loans went to businesses owned by\nWhite entrepreneurs. Black business owners, by contrast, received only 1.9 percent of the loans issued.\nA separate study found that, not only did Black business owners apply for PPP loans at a lower rate than\n2\n\nother groups, their applications were also turned down at higher rates — even when controlling for\nrevenue and credit.\nIt’s clear that profound structural barriers are limiting minority entrepreneurs from accessing capital.\nAll too often shut out from traditional lenders offering favorable rates, Black business owners are forced\nto turn to predatory lenders. That means that money that could be spent on buying goods and services,\nrenting storefronts, or hiring workers goes toward interest payments. And the entire economy suffers\nfor it.\nThere are exciting and important efforts afoot to redress these disparities, which is one of the reasons\ntoday’s session is so important. CDFIs, for instance, are a crucial tool for channeling capital into minority\ncommunities. And new venture capital funds that focus specifically on minority-owned businesses are\nanother exciting development.\nBut piecemeal efforts cannot — and will not — be the entire solution to this problem.\nIt will take all of us — state and local governments, the banking community, and, yes, the Federal\nReserve — to break down these barriers and build an equitable and durable economic recovery.\nFor our part, at the Philadelphia Fed, we are launching our 2021 Reinventing Our Communities cohort\nprogram, in which community cohorts in nine cities across the country will work together to frame,\ncontextualize, and organize in order to spark an equitable small business recovery and to strengthen\nsupport for small business owners of color.\nOur hope is that through peer learning the Fed will provide communities with the tools to identify\nstructural racism and then create a plan to address it tailored to where they are.\nNow, you’re about to hear from a series of speakers who will illuminate racism’s effect on minority\nentrepreneurs — and this is crucial — on how we can work creatively and urgently to disrupt the status\nquo.\nDr. Robert E. Weems Jr., a distinguished professor of business history at Wichita State University and our\nkeynote speaker, will share his insights on impediments to minority small business owners and solutions\nto overcome them.\nOur disrupters panel, featuring three dynamic leaders, will pitch and interrogate radical solutions for\naddressing racism in entrepreneurship.\n3\n\nAnd then we’ll hear from three entrepreneur/activists, who will reflect on the solutions discussed and\nthe implications for their real-life experiences as businesspeople.\nFinally, you’ll hear reflections from my colleagues, the Reserve Bank presidents from Dallas, Chicago,\nand Atlanta, to reflect on what we heard today.\nI’m really excited about today’s program.\nSo, again, thank you for joining us today. And now, let me turn things over to my Fed colleague Neel\nKashkari who will introduce Dr. Weems. Neel?\n4",

    "text": "A Shot in the Arm:\nStimulating the American Workforce\nWorld Affairs Council of Philadelphia\nPhiladelphia, PA\nOctober 13, 2016\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily\nthose of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\nA Shot in the Arm: Stimulating the American Workforce\nWorld Affairs Council of Philadelphia\nPhiladelphia, PA\nOctober 13, 2016\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood morning, it’s a pleasure to be here.\nI’m Pat Harker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, and a lot of\npeople have no idea what that means.\nI’m sure most of you do, or you likely wouldn’t be here. But if you’ll bear with me, I’m\ngoing to spend the first couple of minutes today on a brief overview of the Federal\nReserve System and the role we play in the economy. The Fed has been the subject of a\nlot of talk and debate lately, so it seems like a good time to revisit the basics.\nSince I’m wading into the subject of public commentary, I should deliver the standard\nFed disclaimer now: I’m speaking for myself today, and my views do not necessarily\nreflect those of anyone else within the Federal Reserve System.\nThe Fed: An Overview\nThe Fed has been criticized in the past for the quality of our communication. Some of this\ncriticism is about the way we signal our intentions about policy, but some of it is really\nabout the fact that we can’t seem to speak in sentences shorter than 70 words. And we’re\nfond of terms like, “downward nominal wage rigidity,” which don’t do much to capture\nthe public’s attention.\n1\n\nSo, I’d like to speak to you plainly, I hope, and directly about what the Fed is doing and\nthe current economic conditions. I’ll talk in more detail about some of the issues that are\nat the forefront of the national conversation. And I’ll address some of the factors that can\nhelp change the trajectory of the economy.\nFirst off, the overview. There are 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks around the country,\neach of which has a president, and a Board of Governors in Washington, D.C. We all\nmeet every six weeks or so in D.C. for the FOMC, the Federal Open Market Committee,\nto make a decision about what we’re going to do ― or not do ― about monetary policy.\nThe 12 presidents don’t always have a vote ― although New York always does, as do the\ngovernors ― but we all participate in the discussion. The structure of the Fed is different\nthan most nations’ central banks, which is beneficial for a country so vast and varied.\nI find two things particularly important about this structure. First, it gives voice to\ncommunities and industries all over the country, so we’re not making policy through the\nlens of one myopic view. We’re the world’s third largest country, both by geographical\nsize and by population, with a wide-ranging economy, and that’s a lot to cover. The\neconomy is very different in Seattle than it is in Camden, and it’s important that we\nassess conditions on a District level as well as a macro one. Second is that it adds a\nrichness of perspective to the discussion because we all have different backgrounds,\ndifferent ways of looking at the data, and different methods by which we judge economic\noutcomes. It helps to avoid groupthink.\nDespite meeting in the most politically charged place in the country, politics actually\nnever plays a role. The FOMC is just a bunch of policy wonks analyzing data so we can\nmake the best decisions for the American economy.\nThose decisions focus on achieving our two goals, which were set for us by Congress:\nmaximum employment and price stability. When Fed officials and talking heads discuss\nthe Fed’s “dual mandate,” that’s what they’re referring to here. The Fed is also rare\namong the world’s central banks for having two goals; most just have a single focus.\n2\n\nIt’s not really the technical definition, but we think of maximum employment as more or\nless that the job market in the United States is good enough that you can find a job if\nyou’re looking.\nPrice stability is low and steady inflation.\nNeither of the numbers associated with these goals is zero. The Fed has an inflation target\nrate of 2 percent; that is, we want prices to rise on average about 2 percent in the medium\nterm. That should allow the economy to grow without devaluing your paycheck.\nThe labor market is measured in a variety of ways, but the number most frequently cited\nis the unemployment rate. Economists have an estimate of what’s called the “natural rate”\nof unemployment, which is basically the rate we expect in a healthy economy. Currently,\nmost people put it somewhere around 5 percent. It’s not zero because the unemployment\nrate tracks people who are actively looking for jobs. So, when people graduate from\nschool, for instance, or return to the workforce after taking time off to raise children,\nthey’re counted as unemployed while they search. And people get laid off and quit jobs\nall the time, so they’re counted, too.\nLabor Force Participation in Greater Detail\nThis gets me to the first issue that’s receiving a lot of interest. You all know that we don’t\njust determine the health of the labor market by one metric. You’ve probably heard a lot\nabout the “real” or “hidden” unemployment rate lately. And I want to address that.\nWe are always circumspect when we look at these numbers because finding the pulse of\nthe American workforce is important; it’s not something we, as policymakers, are looking\nto dress up or obfuscate. Our goal is maximum employment, and we want to be sure\nwe’re achieving it. We’re not affected by election cycles or influenced by politics, and\nthat independence means we can focus on finding the best solutions possible.\n3\n\nThere are many ways to look at the data, and they tell us different things. The\nunemployment rate I just referred to ― technically called U3 unemployment ― is\ncurrently at 5.0 percent, right about the natural rate. Despite frequent talk about a sub-par\neconomy, we’re actually doing pretty well. It’s important to remember that during the\nworst of the recession, unemployment hit a 10 percent high.\nThe U6 measure ― which takes U3 and adds people who are working part time but\nwould like to be full time as well as people who say they want a job but have stopped\nlooking ― is higher, at 9.7 percent. That’s higher than we might expect but not\ndrastically so.\nThen there is the labor force participation rate, which has been the focus of a lot of recent\ndiscussion and debate.\nThe labor force participation rate looks at the number of people working in the U.S. as a\nproportion of the working-age population, which seems logical. But it is a very basic\ncalculation, and the specifics might surprise you.\nWe define working age as everyone over the age of 16. That’s a lot of people, and many\nof them aren’t working for reasons that have nothing to do with the job market. My\nmother is part of that equation, even though no one would expect her to still be punching\na timecard at her age. The high school and college students in the audience today are also\ncounted, even though a lot of you aren’t working because you’re focused on your studies.\nBut there has been a lot of concern over the decline in participation. In particular, concern\nover the driving forces.\nForces Behind the Declining Participation Rate\nLabor force participation can be affected by both “cyclical” and “structural” issues. That\nis, the rate can reflect the overall economy and its ups and downs ― the cycle of the\n4\n\neconomy ― or perhaps something that has shifted fundamentally in the structure of the\nlabor market.\nIn the aftermath of the global financial crisis and subsequent recession, labor force\nparticipation plummeted as people were laid off and couldn’t find new work. That’s the\nunfortunate normal for recessions, which is worse in one as deep as the one we\nexperienced. The deeper the recession, the longer it takes for people to find jobs, and a lot\nof them give up looking altogether. This time was no exception.\nWe hope and expect that those people will start job hunting again, once the economy\npicks back up. That’s what would normally happen as a recovery continues its progress.\nBut over the past six years, that hasn’t happened to the extent we might have predicted.\nThis raises the possibility of underlying issues or a hidden segment of the unemployed\nthat we’re not accounting for ― people who are still on the sidelines who might at some\npoint rejoin the workforce.\nResearch by my staff shows that’s not the case. They’ve found that the fall in the labor\nforce participation rate is mostly due to demographic factors.1\nThe most influential impact is coming from the first wave of baby boomers starting to\nretire. This generation will be the biggest group of older Americans in our nation’s\nhistory, which is going to have an obvious impact on the percentage of people working.\nThere’s also the simple fact that we’re living longer, so there are just more people in the\nmix, which I think is something to be celebrated, personally.\nThere are other contributory factors: We’ve seen a record number of high school\ngraduates in the U.S., and college attendance rates are, on average, rising as well. That’s\n1Shigeru Fujita, “On the Causes of Declines in the Labor Force Participation Rate,” Research Rap Special\nR e p o r t , F e d e r a l R e s e r v e B a n k o f P h iladelphia (February 2014).\n5\n\ndelaying some people from entering the workforce, and many students are foregoing\nwork while they’re studying.\nAdditionally, there seems to be a shift in views on work-life balance, with more people\ndeciding a one-income household is worth the tradeoff. For some people, it’s a matter of\nleisure time or the preference to have one stay-at-home parent; there’s any number of\nreasons.\nAll of those factors affect the very basic equation of labor force participation, and they\nshould be taken into account.\nBut we also have to look at historical precedent and whether we’re measuring by the right\nyardstick. Part of the reason the labor force participation rate rose so dramatically in the\npast was also due to demographics. The post-World War II period was marked first by\nthe baby boom and its attendant influx of workers to the economy. And it also saw the\nrapid entrance of women into the workforce. Female participation rates increased from\nless than 35 percent to around 60 percent in this period. That wave of people joining the\nworkforce made a huge difference to participation.\nBut we’re no longer in a situation that will allow for a similar boost or a similar rate.\nThere’s no large portion of society that’s left out. There’s no one group whose entry to\nthe market will have that significant an effect. And the population is growing more\nslowly, meaning we won’t see the kind of boost the baby boom gave us either.\nAfter accounting for all those factors, the lower rate of labor force participation is\nunderstandable. And in the case of people living longer and enjoying their retirement or\nmore people able to make choices that fit their life preferences, it’s a positive.\nBut the effects of the drop in the participation rate are something we need to look at here.\nBecause the vast majority of the decline is the result of the baby boomers’ retirement\n6\n\nonset, my staff doesn’t think the trend will reverse. In fact, they project that the\nparticipation rate will drop a further 2 percentage points over the next five years.\nIf the low participation rate doesn’t reflect a portion of the population that still wants, but\ncan’t get, work, does this matter?\nThe answer is yes. Or YES.\nSome Consequences of the Declining Labor Force Participation Rate\nIt matters because labor force participation affects growth. We can see that by studying\nthe U.S. economy during the recovery. After bottoming out in mid-2009, real GDP grew\nat an average of about 2 percent for the subsequent six years. That’s very slow for a\nrecovery; it’s even slow by historical averages. To put that in context, growth averaged\n3.5 percent in the second half of the 20th century ― of which 1.7 percent came from the\nexpansion of the American workforce. By contrast, the labor force has only grown by 0.5\npercent over the recovery, less than half the historical average.\nWith all those people in retirement and with people living longer, there are more\neconomic pressures to contend with. We need a labor force that can help meet that\nchallenge.\nThe consequence of a declining participation rate means that output will shrink. That is,\nwith fewer workers, the United States will produce less. When we produce less, growth\nstalls.\nThen there are the demographic shifts: The changes to the American labor force in age, in\neducational attainment, and in expertise in certain sectors are actually harming\nproductivity. In general, productivity is higher in mid-career workers, and their\n7\n\nproportion of the U.S. labor market is smaller than it was during the height of the baby\nboom’s working years.2\nWe therefore have a workforce that is less productive than it used to be with the pressure\nof caring for a retiring segment of the population that is bigger than it’s ever been before.\nThere will be a strain on Medicare and Social Security, leaving fewer resources for the\ncountry to spend on other areas ― for instance, maintaining our competitive global edge.\nUltimately, places with a high participation rate are more successful, healthier economies.\nIf that is the case, and we’ve all but tapped our resources, can anything be done?\nAgain, the answer is yes.\nAn Alternative Policy Measure: Immigration\nPart of the Fed primer is that we make monetary policy, not fiscal or other policy. So the\npoints I make today are from the perspective of someone who is affected ― both as a\npolicymaker and a citizen ― by the decisions made in legislative halls, but not as\nsomeone who’s in a position to make those changes himself.\nMonetary policy is actually limited in its scope. Taxes and spending, debts and deficits,\ngovernment funding and laws that affect the labor force are all out of our purview. The\nFed’s job is to create the conditions for a strong and healthy economy. Changing the\ntrajectory of U.S. growth will take legislative action, like investments in human and\nphysical capital, which we can’t do. But we can point out the economic benefits.\nThe fact is that we have a strong labor market. We’re a far cry from the worst of the crisis\nwhen unemployment reached 10 percent. The issue now is that employers are struggling\nto fill the jobs they have open. Even with workforce development programs, which are\n2James Feyrer, “Demographics and Productivity,” The Review of Economics and Statistics, MIT Press,\n8 9 : 1 ( F e b r u a r y 2 0 0 7 ) , p p . 1 0 0 – 1 0 9 .\n8\n\nalso necessary, we don’t have the people to fill them. We need to close the gap in the\nworkforce. And given the long-term demographic trends, we need to turn to outside\nsources.\nWe need people.\nThat’s the missing ingredient in the participation rate and in growth.\nOne potential source is immigration. Again, I want to be clear: I’m not suggesting\nimmigration policy or telling anyone how to go about legislating. I don’t want to get into\na debate about immigration or the questions of documented or undocumented residents. I\nwant to talk about the numbers and the data and their potential effect on the U.S.\neconomy.\nAnd from an economic standpoint, immigration, particularly high-skilled immigration,\nis a source of immense potential for economic growth.\nToday, immigration accounts for 13-plus percent of the U.S. population. This share has\nbeen steadily increasing over time: In 1990, it was 8 percent.\nMuch of the immigration debate surrounds the level of skill and contribution of new\narrivals to the U.S. But the truth is that much of the flow of immigration over the past 15\nyears has been highly skilled and well educated. Over that period, the college-educated\nimmigrant population grew from 5.9 million to 10.5 million. The native-born college-\neducated population also grew but at a much slower pace.\nMost important, immigrants tend to have a higher participation rate ― something we\nneed.\nThis touches on the most prevalent concern about immigration: the fear of losing\nAmerican jobs. There is, however, scant evidence to support the anxiety, especially\n9\n\nwhere skilled immigrants are concerned. In fact, most studies have shown that it’s a net\nbenefit for the rest of us.\nOne recent paper examined how the increased flow of immigrants in the STEM fields ―\nthat is, science, technology, engineering, and math ― affected the labor market outcomes\nof native born workers.3 The researchers found that a 1 percentage point increase in the\nnumber of foreign STEM workers actually increased wage growth of the college-\neducated population by 7–8 percentage points in the long run, and 3–4 percentage points\nfor those without a college education.\nThey also found that inflows of foreign STEM workers increase productivity growth\nmore generally, accounting for somewhere between 30 and 50 percent of the aggregate\nU.S. productivity growth between 1990 and 2010. Other research backs this up.4\nThis reflects the “scale effect” in economic theory ― that greater population growth is\ntied to higher per-capita growth rates. In this model, scale comes from the theory that\nmore ideas are developed when more people are engaged in research. Because anyone\ncan use the same idea at the same time, any single idea can be used by lots of people to\nproduce growth. Therefore, more people equals more ideas equals more growth.5 More\n3 Giovanni Peri, Kevin Y. Shih, and Chad Sparber, “Foreign STEM Workers and Native Wages and\nE m p l o y m e n t i n U . S .

Romer, “The New Kaldor Facts: Ideas, Institutions, Population, and Human\nCapital,” American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics, American Economic Association, 2:1 (January\n2010), pp. 224–245.\n10\n\nthan 80 percent of U.S. per capita growth in the second half of the 20th century can be\nattributed to this scale effect.6\nThe bottom line is that a larger and more highly skilled labor force fuels economic\ngrowth, something we will need to meet the demands of demography.\nI said I’d be academic, but on a personal note, I’d add this: Pretty much all of us are the\nproduct of immigration. At some point, near or far down the line of our ancestry,\nsomeone came to this country and helped make it what it is today. America is a\nconstantly evolving nation, which is one of our strengths. Much of that is due to the\ninfluence of waves of immigration that brought over new ideas and swelled the\nworkforce. It’s as true today as it was during the Industrial Revolution or at the turn of\nthe 20th century.\nOne of the comparative advantages of the United States, since our inception, has been our\nability to assimilate immigrants from all over. It built both the greatest economic power\non the planet and the American dream that defines it. We’re good at this. We’re arguably\nbetter than anyone else on earth. So let’s play to our strengths. It’s in our own economic\ninterest.\nImplications for Monetary Policy\nSince I’ve just spent some time talking about other people’s areas of policy, I’ll be fair\nand talk about what lessons this has for my own.\nFalling participation rates pose important challenges for monetary policy. Both the aging\nof the population and lower productivity will likely deliver a lower natural rate of interest\n6 C.I. Jones, “Sources of U.S. Economic Growth in a World of Ideas,” Papers 99–29, United Nations\nW o r l d E m p l o y m e n t P r o g r a m m e ( 2 0 00).\n11\n\nand slower potential GDP growth. These are difficult to measure in the first place, so\nchanges to their fundamental nature complicates monetary policy.7\nA lower natural funds rate has implications for the speed at which current monetary\npolicy should normalize. The lower the natural funds rate, the closer the current funds\nrate will be to that level, which means policy will have a shorter distance to travel to full\nnormalization. That’s important because it gives us less room to maneuver. Monetary\npolicy is a relatively blunt tool; a smaller window for operation is more appropriate for a\nscalpel.\nAnd it may be that our toolbox is getting duller: Recent studies have found that monetary\npolicy’s efficacy has been waning since the mid-1980s, and that this can be linked to the\naging of the population.8 Given our demographic realities, this puts even more pressure\non fiscal and other policies to take a long-term look at policies that can nurture growth.\nConclusion\nSo, there you have it. The U.S. labor market is strong, but participation is waning. Our\neconomy needs a boost and immigration could be the stimulant. I’m not directing anyone\nwhich path to go down, but I am saying that we need to take one.\n7 Gauti B. Eggertsson and Neil R.

Moses Dis�nguished Lecture in Transporta�on\nNorthwestern University Transporta�on Center\nNorthwestern University\nEvanston, Illinois\nNovember 8, 2023\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Execu�ve Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood evening, everyone.\nTo everyone here at the Northwestern University Transporta�on Center, it is indeed an honor to have\nbeen asked to present this year’s Leon N. Moses Dis�nguished Lecture.\nNow, if I may, here is how I intend to proceed tonight. I will begin by answering what could be a central\nques�on to the evening: “Why does a president of a Federal Reserve Bank care about transporta�on?”\nFrom there, I will share a broad outline of some of the research being conducted by the staff at the\nPhiladelphia Fed, which, I believe, can be put into ac�on to help us achieve a stronger economic and\nmore reliable transporta�on future.\nI will conclude by providing my economic outlook. A�er all, I’ll note that the Moses Lectures in 2011 and\n2017 both centered on U.S. economic outlooks, so why break unnecessarily from this apparent six-year\ncycle? Also, I am acutely aware of the impact that interest rates and monetary policy can have on\ninfrastructure investments.\nAnd if �me allows, I would be happy to engage in a discussion and answer any ques�ons to add further\nclarity to our proceedings.\n1\n\nBut first, my day job requires me to make one thing very clear. And that is the usual Federal Reserve\ndisclaimer. So, please note that the views I express are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of\nanyone else on the Federal Open Market Commitee (FOMC or in the Federal Reserve System.\nOr as folks back home in the Philadelphia region know, when talking about this evening, please say, “Pat\nsaid,” not “The Fed said.”\nNow, with all that business out of the way, let’s dive in.\nI should start by recognizing that I find myself in very like-minded company. My predominant area of\nstudy, a�er all, wasn’t economics. It was civil engineering. Economics was that side project that later\nbecame my full-�me job. But my way of looking at things — even in economics — is very much with that\nsame lens I ground in my engineering days.\nNow, let me take this a step further. As an economist, and especially as president and CEO of the\nPhiladelphia Fed, my goal is to ensure a stable economy that provides opportuni�es for everyone to\ngrow and succeed. As an engineer, and specifically as a civil engineer, my goal is to ensure a safe,\nreliable, and stable infrastructure, which provides opportuni�es for all communi�es to grow and\nsucceed.\nI know I am far from the first person to recognize this important interdisciplinary rela�onship. I can just\nlook around this room to know there are many others who do as well. And fi�ngly enough, all the way\nback in 1917, John Hayford, then director of the College of Engineering here at Northwestern University,\nwrote an essay in the Journal of Poli ical Economy �tled “The Rela�on of Engineering to Economics,”\nfrom which I will read the following:\nEconomics and engineering are closely related. Economics has been defined as the\nsocial science of earning a living. With the same appropriateness, engineering may be\ndefined to be physical science applied to helping groups … to make a beter living.1\n1 See John F. Hayford, “The Rela�on of Engineering to Economics,” Journal of Political Economy, 25:1, available at\nuchicago.edu.\n2\n\nThose words ring just as true 106 years later.\nBut in my current capacity, I can look to the Federal Reserve’s own dual mandate, the two pillars of our\nins�tu�onal mission that Congress handed to us in the late 1970s: price stability and maximum\nemployment. And neither, I could argue, are achievable without some level of modern transporta�on\ninfrastructure, and more specifically, engineering for modern transporta�on infrastructure.\nThe ability of goods and services to flow to and from markets helps ensure that prices can remain stable.\nAnd we cannot achieve maximum employment unless employers have accessible places in which to site\ntheir businesses and workers have a way to get to and from those places of employment.\nNow, certainly, the Federal Reserve does not build transport infrastructure. But the monetary policy\ndecisions we make and implement have a direct impact on the ability of those actors responsible for\nsuch ac�ons to undertake them. I will return to this thought later in my economic outlook.\nBut with this overall intellectual background, where do we find ourselves at this moment? By any\nmeasure, we are at a cri�cal �me not just in our economy, but for our infrastructure. We are now\nroughly 70 years removed from our na�on’s last, great infrastructure boom, including the construc�on of\nthe Interstate Highway System. And as with most things, �me isn’t always kind. The condi�ons of our\ninfrastructure call out for broad investment, and the condi�ons of our economy require us to look anew\nat what infrastructure means to our overall health, both literally and figura�vely.\nWithout a doubt, the United States would not be the preeminent global economy if not for our\ninfrastructure. We are a vast na�on, and our roads, bridges, tunnels, rails, and airports are very much the\n�es that bind the union together. But in what condi�on do we currently find these �es?\nFor the past almost 70 years, we have been in a mode to maintain the infrastructure we currently have.\nWe became very good at fixing things, and, let’s face it, we s�ll are. Case in point: When a sec�on of\nInterstate 95 in Northeast Philadelphia collapsed this summer — prac�cally paralyzing the East Coast’s\nmost essen�al transit corridor — it only took a mater of days for an ingenious repair plan to be put into\nplace and the road reopened. But in some ways, this is the excep�on to the usual cycle of infrastructure\n3\n\nrepair, as it took cu�ng through red tape and a quicker-than-usual accoun�ng of the economic ac�vity\nbeing lost for officials to spring into ac�on at such speed.\nTransporta�on infrastructure, as we all know, is expensive to undertake and o�en slow to accomplish.\nBut the I-95 collapse and rebuild could also become a pivot point for the way we look at infrastructure. I\ncould argue that the way many have tradi�onally looked at infrastructure is much akin to the old Oscar\nWilde line about those who “[know] the price of everything and the value of nothing.” We’ve become\nvery good at knowing how much a project will cost, but we haven’t been as good at explaining the value\nof a project — the long-range economic and quality of life benefits inherent in it. And so, I would say this\nis not just a �me for us to get beter at fixing, but a �me for us to take a fuller stock of the results of what\nwe built in the first place and the long-term implica�ons of what we may build in the future.\nI-95 in Philadelphia in itself is a good example for us to examine both of these thoughts. And, at the\nPhiladelphia Fed, it’s also perfectly located for us to do just that.\nIf you travel on I-95 through Philadelphia, it stands out in several ways. The first is more sensory and\ntac�le: I-95 severed the residents of Philadelphia from the Delaware River waterfront. In the 1950s, the\nriverfront was overwhelmingly industrial, and the residen�al areas located on it were older, so litle\nthought was likely given to the construc�on of an elevated highway with beter water views than the\nnewer buildings and houses to its west.\nBut I-95 was also constructed in an age when suburban living became the new model of the American\nDream, and when highways could speed families out of city centers and into new single-family home\ndevelopments, complete with yards and driveways, in neighboring coun�es. And when a highway was\nbuilt, the noise and air pollu�on from that many cars and trucks helped push those who could afford it\ntoward those new suburban developments.\n4\n\nLast year, two of my colleagues at the Philadelphia Fed, Vice President and Economist Jeffrey Lin and\nEconomic Advisor and Economist Jeffrey Brinkman, took a closer look at I-95, its impact in depopula�ng\nPhiladelphia, and the poten�al benefits of capping the highway.2\nAnd Lin, I should note, is a Wildcat, having completed his undergraduate studies in economics and\nmathema�cal methods in the social sciences here at Northwestern, and studied under Dr. Leon Moses.\nSo, my colleagues started by looking at the popula�on effects of freeways on central city neighborhoods,\nand what they found, if not startling, is s�ll stark. The standard narra�ve is that freeways provide access\nto opportuni�es. And this was true in the suburbs — freeways atracted development and popula�on.\nBut this was decidedly not the case in central ci�es. Lin and Brinkman found, in central ci�es, a\npopula�on decline of nearly one-third in the census tracts closest to freeways, while the popula�ons in\nthe tracts more than two miles from the nearest freeway increased by more than 50 percent. And the\ndecline in those neighborhoods closer to a freeway makes sense, not just because of noise and pollu�on,\nbut because of the nega�ve barrier effects to local ameni�es — the dead-ending of streets that\npreviously provided through access to jobs or shopping, making previously straight-forward trips longer\nfor residents.\nLin and Brinkman also calculated the value of neighborhood ameni�es in areas of Philadelphia closest to\nfreeways to be roughly 11 percent lower than in those areas farther out — and in a similar analysis, they\nfound a 17 percent difference in Chicago.\nEngineering created a means for speeding people and goods between ci�es and from city centers and\ninto suburbia, and beyond. The Interstate Highway System was an enormous achievement, and it created\nbig benefits for some. It also had enormous costs for others, especially residents of central ci�es.\nBut engineering now has the opportunity to mi�gate some of that damage, to eliminate barriers to\nameni�es, and in the process, create new economic incen�ves for folks to move back and opportuni�es\nfor those who stayed.\n2 See Jeffrey Brinkman and Jeffrey Lin, “The Costs and Benefits of Fixing Downtown Freeways,” Economic Insights,\nQ1 2022, available at philadelphiafed.org.\n5\n\nWe know, through both anecdotal evidence and through fron�er research, that more people, especially\nyoung college graduates, are looking anew at urban living.34 New work from home op�ons means that\nci�es and towns are compe�ng even more on the quality of life they can offer residents. Addi�onally,\ntraffic throughout the Philadelphia Metro area has become so endemic that one of those ini�al benefits\nof living in the suburbs — speedy access to the urban core — has been all but eliminated.\nThe Philadelphia waterfront today is a place where former warehouses and factories are being\nrepurposed and renovated for residen�al and more ground-level commercial uses. The Delaware River\nitself is also a cleaner estuary, and one which the city has con�nually sought to highlight for both\nresidents and tourists through projects like the Penn’s Landing Fes�val Pier, the mul�modal Delaware\nRiver Trail, and a just-started project to cap a one-10th of a mile por�on of I-95 at Penn’s Landing to\nbecome a new urban park.\nAnd Lin and Brinkman even looked at this last idea: capping I-95 to reconnect neighborhoods with\nameni�es. But they looked at a much bigger landscape than the current project, which is geared to only\na small part of I-95 adjacent to the neighborhoods directly east of Center City and the tourist and\nbusiness heart. They conceived of a project to cover a litle more than four miles of I-95 and simulated\nits poten�al impact. And what their simula�on suggests is a poten�al popula�on boom in those\nneighborhoods that I-95 effec�vely cut off and to some extent emp�ed, as connec�ons between those\nneighborhoods and the city at-large were remade.\nThey also calculated that the benefit to households in these neighborhoods at roughly $245 million per\nyear, or $3.5 billion over the life�me value of such a project, was greater than the es�mated current cost\nof undertaking such a program. These are big numbers. What they point to is the significant damage that\nhighway construc�on did to central city neighborhoods. What they also point to are the significant\ncurrent opportuni�es for remedia�ng that damage, if we can also focus on the value of these\ninvestments, instead of only the costs.\n3 See Victor Couture and Jessie Handbury, “Urban Revival in America,” Journal of Urban Economics, September\n2020, available at ScienceDirect.\n4 See Nathaniel Baum-Snow and Daniel Hartley, “Accoun�ng for Central Neighborhood Change, 1980–2010,”\nJournal of Urban Economics, 117, May 2020, available at ScienceDirect.\n6\n\nBut it’s not just about plan�ng grass. While parks and open space are vital, we cannot discount\ninfrastructure that could link neighborhoods together. Public transit has poten�ally a large role to play\nhere. With limited excep�ons of, for example, the New York City Subway or Boston’s T, we o�en think of\nmass transit mostly in terms of bringing suburbanites back into ci�es. In Philadelphia, for example, the\nregional Southeastern Pennsylvania Transporta�on Authority (SEPTA) is o�en skewered by\nPhiladelphians for a percep�on that it caters mostly to suburbanites — a gripe rooted in the fact that\nprepandemic, from 2007 to 2017, SEPTA’s suburban-based Regional Rail system received the plurality of\nthe agency’s capital funds even though inner-city transit atracted far more riders.5 Fair or not,\npercep�on maters and can sway public acceptance.\nAgain, this is an area where there is guiding research from the Philadelphia Fed. Economic Advisor and\nEconomist Chris Severen looked at the economic benefits of the Los Angeles Metro Rail system, an\nambi�ous effort to draw people from the epicenter of the na�on’s car culture out of their autos and into\nmass transit.6\nWhat Severen found was a 15 percent increase in transit use when Angelenos were commu�ng from one\nneighborhood to another directly connected by Metro Rail. The increase in Metro Rail commu�ng in\ndirectly adjacent census tracts was 10 percent.\nA common concern these days with local infrastructure investments is who benefits. Are the benefits\ngoing to incumbent residents who may have been harmed by past policy? Or are they going to incoming\nresidents who end up displacing exis�ng residents? On the other hand, some people might worry that\ntransit access might actually hurt neighborhoods, for example, by introducing more noise or conges�on.\nInteres�ngly, in the LA Metro case, these neighborhoods did not experience a lot of disrup�ve change.\nThe appearance of a Metro Rail sta�on did not bring in a new wealthy subset. What Metro Rail primarily\ndid was to enhance resident choice of transporta�on op�ons. It added an amenity in which residents\nfound an intrinsic value — the ability to ditch their car. The added benefits of those cars that were kept\noff the streets, in terms of traffic, noise, and pollu�on, just become a bonus. More than that, it may have\n5 See Jim Saksa, “SEPTA Riders Overwhelmingly Take the Bus and Subway. Why Does Regional Rail Receive More\nFunding?” May 2017, available at WHYY.\n6 See Christopher Severen, “A Ticket to Ride: Es�ma�ng the Benefits of Rail Transit,” Economic Insights, Q2 2020,\navailable at philadelphiafed.org.\n7\n\nchanged percep�ons of transit as something only for the suburbs or wealthy residents. Again, this kind\nof research is helping us learn about the value of transporta�on infrastructure — the long-range\neconomic and quality of life benefits.\nSuch infrastructure projects may be cri�cal in undoing one of the great transporta�on engineering\ninjus�ces of all. We now know that highways cut off people from opportuni�es today. But this might\nunderstate their nega�ve effects on the next genera�on tomorrow — through increased racial\nsegrega�on and the decreased intergenera�onal economic opportuni�es that con�nue to this day.\nAnd this brings me to a third bit of research in which the Philadelphia Fed was involved. Economic\nAdvisor and Economist Bryan Stuart recently teamed up with researchers from the University of Texas\nand UCLA.7 Their window into these intergenera�onal effects was to look at the long-term economic\nimpacts from the historical placement of railroads. And they found, true to the cliché, that there was a\n“wrong side of the tracks.” The placement of railroad tracks cemented segrega�on within communi�es\nand limited the upward mobility of specifically Black children who the tracks separated from community\nameni�es such as schools and jobs.\nWe can see this in Philadelphia, too, which has the unfortunate dis�nc�on of being the “poorest big city”\nin the na�on, and the 11th most racially segregated8 with a citywide poverty rate above 20 percent. But\nis this just a mater of bad luck for these families who find themselves below the poverty line? The\nresearch conducted by the Philadelphia Fed would say no. Many of these outcomes were caused by past\npolicies. Many of them could be addressed through transporta�on infrastructure investments today to\nbeter connect workers, families, and opportuni�es.\nIn 2022, Larry Santucci, a senior advisor and research fellow at the Philadelphia Fed’s Consumer Finance\nIns�tute, released his work in which he mapped the history of racial covenants at nearly 4,000 proper�es\n7 See Eric Chyn, Kareem Haggag, and Bryan Stuart, “The Effects of Racial Segrega�on on Intergenera�onal\nEvidence from Historical Railroad Placement,” Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia Working Paper\nMobility:\n23-18 (2023), htps://www.philadelphiafed.org/the-economy/regional-economics/effects-of-racial-segrega�on-\non-intergenera�onal-mobility-evidence-historical-railroad-placement.\n8 See “A Map of Racially Restric�ve Covenants in the City of Philadelphia,” Consumer Finance Data,\nhtps://www.philadelphiafed.org/surveys-and-data/consumer-finance-data/racial-covenants.\n8\n\ncitywide.9 Racially restric�ve covenants were one of the tools that early 20th century developers, home\nbuilders, and White homeowners used to prevent non-White individuals from accessing certain\nneighborhoods and homes. Allow me a moment to explain the findings in Santucci’s own words:\nWe didn’t see a lot in areas of the city where the housing stock was older, such as\nalong the Delaware waterfront, where White residents may have been happy to vacate\n… But we did find racial covenants bordering White and non-White neighborhoods and\ncordoning off the up-and-coming, more suburban areas in the Northeast, Northwest,\nand Southwest sec�ons of Philadelphia.\nOn a map, many of the areas of Philadelphia directly impacted by the growth of highways and the White\nflight it enabled stand out in this proposi�on. Santucci specifically notes the Delaware River waterfront,\nthe example with which I opened this talk. But even today, residents in the majority Black neighborhoods\nof Philadelphia and the surrounding region face commute �mes, on average, that are 34 minutes longer\nper week than their White counterparts. Or put another way, in the span of a year, Black commuters lose\na whole 24-hour day in commu�ng �me that White commuters keep for themselves. That was the\nfinding of another recent report by Severen and his Research Analyst Nassir Holden.10\nThis research can serve as the star�ng place for engineers and local officials, if not indeed federal ones,\nto take a more holis�c approach to transporta�on. Simply making repairs, while necessary, in many ways\nwill only extend or even exacerbate long-standing inequi�es and inequali�es. Simply making a repair to a\nfreeway that stands as an impediment to economic progress and equity won’t remove it as an\nimpediment — it will only solidify its standing for more years.\nSimply valuing infrastructure in the same old way, usually by the flow of cars or people, is self-limi�ng.\nWe should start valuing its benefits in greater totality, and especially the benefits to those who are\nsituated near these projects. And the Philadelphia Fed’s research is helping us to beter define these\nbenefits.\n9 See “Q&A: Larry Santucci on Philadelphia’s Racially Restric�ve Covenants and Their Las�ng Effects,” Federal\nReserve Bank of Philadelphia, available at philadelphiafed.org.\n10 Christopher Severen and Nassir Holden, “Not All Rush Hours Are the Same,” Economic Insights, Q3 2023,\navailable at philadelphiafed.org.\n9\n\nBut certainly, these improvements will not just happen on their own or through the benevolence of\nothers. We must pay for them. Local governments collect taxes, some of which are used for local\ninfrastructure, but most infrastructure projects have costs that require them to be bonded out over\nyears. Those funds allow for construc�on workers to be employed and for materials to be purchased.\nAnd that is where the Federal Reserve’s ac�ons can have an impact and where I, as a member of the\nFOMC, recognize my place in this transporta�on future, if even just tangen�ally. But our ac�ons on\nmonetary policy do have a direct impact on the borrowing rates for such bonds, among so much more.\nOur efforts to tame infla�on mean stabilizing the costs of construc�on and labor.\nAnd with that, I would like to give you a brief overview of my overall economic outlook. As you are\naware, a week ago, at our last mee�ng, the FOMC voted to hold the policy rate steady — our second\nconsecu�ve hold and the third in the last four mee�ngs a�er 10 consecu�ve interest rate hikes.\nI not only voted to support keeping the policy rate steady, but I was also among the first of my colleagues\nto state my posi�on that the �me had come to do so, possibly for a while. Let’s rewind for a moment.\nWe did a lot in not a lot of �me. We rapidly moved monetary policy into restric�ve territory to tame\ninfla�on and get it heading back down to our target of a 2 percent annual rate.\nNow, what we didn’t do was give the folks living in this economy, whether businesses or families, a lot of\n�me to adjust in between rate hikes. And today, if you look along the trend lines, we are experiencing a\nslow but steady disinfla�on. Interest rates remain in restric�ve territory and, so long as they are, they\nwill con�nue to put a damper on infla�on.\nYes, this economy is proving to be resilient and at �mes unwilling to bend to the will of economic\nmodels, but I believe that the path we are on is the correct one.\nI am not going to be swayed easily by a single month’s worth of data. One month can just be an outlier\nand not a harbinger. But we don’t know unless we have more outward months to weigh against it. With\nmonetary policy, there are always lags. Holding the rate steady will give those lags �me to catch up. It\nwill allow us to make more measured and educated policy rate decisions going forward — decisions,\nwhich I must add, could go either way, depending upon what the data tell us.\n10\n\nBut for the moment, as I said, I see a slow but steady disinfla�on occurring. I s�ll expect infla�on to fall\nbelow 3 percent year over year in 2024 and to get down to our 2 percent target therea�er.\nI do expect GDP growth to cool off in the coming quarters, but I do not expect a recession.\nConsumers have been powering recent GDP growth — more than half of last quarter’s increase was due\nto consumers con�nuing to open their wallets. Time will tell if they have exhausted their pandemic-era\nsavings and begin to ratchet down their own spending. Time will tell the full impact of the restart of\nstudent loan payments for countless borrowers. But I would also argue that a confident American\nconsumer is not a problem. Indeed, they may be the ones ul�mately capable of helping us achieve the\nso� landing we all envision and that has proved quite elusive in the past.\nIt is also clear that the labor market is coming into a much beter balance. I an�cipate the\nunemployment rate to end the year slightly elevated from where it currently stands — to about 4\npercent — and to rise slowly in 2024 to about 4.5 percent before dropping again to 4 percent. That\nwould put us back in line with the natural rate of unemployment, where the labor market and steady 2\npercent infla�on can coexist in balance.\nOf course, there are many lurking uncertain�es. The posi�ve movements to setle the auto worker\nstrikes give us hope that things may soon return to normal for workers and employers. But even then,\nthere are s�ll other labor ac�ons that are slowing down other industries, such as the actors’ strike.\nWe are also now only nine days away from a poten�al federal government shutdown, the impact of\nwhich would only grow the longer it goes on and could poten�ally trim a full percentage point off fourth\nquarter GDP. And of course, there are interna�onal issues that can impact our own economy.\nBut at the end of the day, while I see us on the path of taming infla�on and protec�ng our economic\nunderpinnings, I would also cau�on that a decrease in the policy rate is not something that is likely to\nhappen in the short term. I ascribe to the posi�on that rates are going to have to remain higher for\nlonger, as the other downward pressures on infla�on work in tandem with the current policy rate to\nreturn our economy to balance.\n11\n\nAnd for transporta�on, this higher-rate climate may have an impact on our ability to see some new\nprojects get from the drawing board to shovels in the ground. The necessary repairs will s�ll be done,\nand projects already begun will con�nue.\nBut progress is something for which America has always been known. And the more we take our eyes\nexclusively off the costs of a project to the overall economic benefit of a project, the more we will see\nthat price tags, while important, aren’t the only thing to consider.\nWe can s�ll, if we take the research into considera�on, make Oscar Wilde proud.\nAnd with that, I will conclude my prepared remarks for this evening. I once again thank you all for the\nprivilege to be here. I would be happy to take your ques�ons.\n12",

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nPUBLIC/OFFICIAL RELEASE // EXTERNAL\nThe Economy and the Job Market: Where We’re Going, Where We’ve Been\nRider University\nLawrence Township, NJ\nApril 14, 2022\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood evening! It’s really great to be here, a mere two years after we had initially planned to do this. The\npandemic kept us apart for far too long, and I’m thrilled that we are finally together. So, thanks so much\nfor having me.\nThe theme of this talk is “Where We’re Going, Where We’ve Been” — so I’m going to begin way, way\nback at the beginning. I want to talk a little about what the Fed is and what it does. I also want to discuss\nwhat the Fed doesn’t do, because I have to admit our powers are overestimated sometimes. I’ll then\ndiscuss the current economic situation and a little bit about the job market. Then we can move to a\nQ&A, which I’m really looking forward to.\nBut before I can do any of that, I need to give you my standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today\nare my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\nLet’s start with where we’ve been.\nFederal Reserve History and Structure\nThe First Bank of the United States was the brainchild of the man who in recent years has become\neverybody’s favorite founding father: Alexander Hamilton. The bank was located in Philadelphia when it\nwas still the capital of the country. It was established in 1791 to deal with the debt from the\nRevolutionary War and to ensure the government’s financial stability. It looked a lot different than the\nentity we are today, and it wasn’t without controversy.\n1\n\nPUBLIC/OFFICIAL RELEASE // EXTERNAL\nAs Broadway has reminded us, Thomas Jefferson was among those who worried about power that was\ntoo strong and too centralized. He even once famously said he found banks to be more dangerous than\nstanding armies. When the bank’s charter was up for renewal after its initial 20 years, the Jeffersonian\nargument won out and the measure failed by a vote each in the House and the Senate. The bank was\ndissolved.\nFive years later, Congress agreed to a central banking function a second time, and we launched the\nimaginatively named Second Bank of the United States. And 20 years after that, Congress decided not to\nrenew the charter, again owing to a strain of popular sentiment that didn’t trust powerful, centralized\ninstitutions.\nBut not having a central bank didn’t really work because it tended to breed volatility.\nThe period leading up to the third iteration of American central banking — the Federal Reserve — was\nmarked by currency instability, bank runs, and cycles of boom and bust. At one point, J.P. Morgan\nactually had to step in personally to bail out the country. If you’ve ever been to the Morgan Library &\nMuseum in New York, you can stand in the room where the solution to that financial crisis was worked\nout.\nEven during the Revolutionary War era, central banking was standard in democracies, and it remains\nthat way today. There are no developed economies that don’t have it in some form. So, the eventual\nadoption of our current central bank — in the 1913 Federal Reserve Act — was to some extent\ninevitable. And the configuration of the Federal Reserve System — a central bank with a decentralized\nstructure — is something of a testament to old-fashioned American compromise. It also reflects the\nunique demands of the United States and our economy.\nThe Federal Reserve System consists of a Board of Governors, which sits in Washington, and 12 regional\nBanks located around the country, including the one I oversee in Philadelphia.\nThe Board seats seven governors, including the Chair. Each regional Bank has its own president and\nboard of directors, which is made up of business, banking, and community leaders from the area.\nFundamentally, this provides the Fed with a perspective, within each District, of the sectors and issues\nthat make the region tick. You and I are in the Third District, which encompasses eastern Pennsylvania,\nSouth Jersey, and the state of Delaware. We’re the smallest District, geographically, but I like to think we\npunch above our weight.\n2\n\nPUBLIC/OFFICIAL RELEASE // EXTERNAL\nThe Fed’s decentralized nature is, in my view, a unique strength. We’re making national policy, but\nwe’re doing it for an enormous country, and the averages of economic data can obscure realities on the\nground. Conditions look very different in Philadelphia, Dover, or Lawrence Township than they do in\nDallas, Salt Lake City, or Honolulu. This system gives, in my view, a voice to a range of localities and\nsectors. It also allows us to focus on regional issues within each Bank’s District.\nThe United States has a unique set of needs. It’s easy to forget that we’re an outlier because we’re such\na big country: Only Russia and Canada are bigger geographically, only China and India have larger\npopulations, and no one country has a bigger economy, at least for now. And that economy is vast,\nspreading across sectors and natural resources in a way that most other nations don’t.\nSo, it makes sense that we have a system that feeds back information from around the country.\nThe other difference from most central banks is that the Fed has a dual mandate rather than a single\ngoal; that is, we’re charged with both maximum employment and price stability. Most just focus on one.\nMaximum employment encompasses a wide range of metrics, although most attention is paid to the\nunemployment rate. That number, of course, will never be zero. Instead, we try to ensure that labor\nmarkets are functioning dynamically and efficiently. Price stability, on the other hand, is low and stable\ninflation, which we judge to be around 2 percent a year. More on both of these topics in a bit.\nThe decisions we make within the Fed — the way we look at the economy and respond to data — are\nbuilt entirely on the foundation of our dual mandate. It is our North Star.\nNow that we’ve established that, I turn to the question so many people secretly want to ask: What,\nexactly, does the Fed do? I’m delighted to talk about it, but just as important, I’ll also mention what we\ndon’t do.\nWe have lending power. What that means is we do not have spending power. We have no authority\nover fiscal policy, which deals with debts, deficits, and taxes. Or investments to encourage growth. Or\ngrants to worthy organizations. Or programs to spur job creation. Those all depend on elected officials,\nbe they on the local, state, or national level.\nSo, what do we do?\nWe set monetary policy. We also regulate banks, along with an alphabet soup of government agencies.\nWe are the lender of last resort during bona fide emergencies.\n3\n\nPUBLIC/OFFICIAL RELEASE // EXTERNAL\nAnd the lede that always gets buried — and I wish it weren’t so overshadowed by discussions of interest\nrates — is that we work within our Districts to help strengthen local communities’ economies. We have\na truly exceptional team in Philadelphia in our Community Affairs department, and they work with\npartners all over the Third District. They’re doing truly vital work on employment, transportation,\nhousing, and other issues. In fact, I’ll discuss some recent research from this department a little later.\nBut first, let me talk a bit about monetary policy. Monetary policy is a fairly limited field with a fairly\nconscripted set of tools.\nOur job is to create the conditions in which a healthy economy can thrive. More than anything, we’re\ntilling the land.\nMonetary policy is about meeting our dual mandate mostly by moving interest rates. There are other\ntools we use, but in normal times, it’s mostly about moving what is technically called the federal funds\nrate. In the media, that’s usually just called the interest rate.\nThe federal funds rate is the interest rate on loans that banks make to each other overnight. That rate\ntends to influence interest rates more broadly, so the effect ripples through the economy. When we\nmove the federal funds rate, it affects the interest rate people pay on their mortgages and car loans and\nthat businesses pay to borrow to meet or expand their payrolls or buy inventory. In fact, sometimes just\nannouncing we are planning to raise the federal funds rate in the future affects these lending rates.\nWe set rates when the FOMC meets in Washington, which we do eight times a year. After two years of\nvirtual meetings, we’re finally back in person.\nRegional Bank presidents don’t always get to vote. Most of us rotate into a voting position every three\nyears, but the governors always do, as does the president of the New York Fed. New York, owing to the\npresence of Wall Street, enjoys something of a “first among equals” status within the System. And while\nthe rest of us don’t always vote, we do always represent our Districts and play a part in the discussion.\nThe FOMC discussion is never political. Because we’re appointed policymakers, we don’t respond to\nswings in public opinion or election cycles. Unlike politicians, who suffer the slings and arrows of the 24-\nhour news machine, we operate in a rare, apolitical bubble. I truly believe that the independence of the\nFed is crucial to making the best decisions possible for the American economy, free from the pressures\nof politics.\n4\n\nPUBLIC/OFFICIAL RELEASE // EXTERNAL\nAlthough we’re independent, that doesn’t mean we’re unchecked. The Fed is what’s considered\n“independent within government.” We’re overseen by Congress, but neither Congress nor the\npresidential administration has a say in the decisions we make.\nThe State of the Economy\nThat’s not to suggest the Fed doesn’t come under intense political scrutiny at times, particularly when\neconomic conditions are troubled. So now, I’d like to talk a little bit about where we are.\nWhen thinking about the state of the U.S. economy, I think it’s worth taking a step back and looking at\nthe global situation. Sometimes when we’re immersed in granular data, it can be easy to miss the\neconomic forest for the trees.\nSo, where are we?\nWell, first and foremost, we’ve made significant progress, particularly on vaccinations, but we remain\nmired in the midst of a now two-year global pandemic that has killed at least 6 million people globally\nand more than 1 million here in the United States. The human toll is immense and tragic, and the\neconomic tribulations continue to reverberate. Tens of millions around the world were thrown out of\nwork by the pandemic, and supply chains were throttled. Even now, there are significant issues getting\nsupply chains back on line, which is contributing to high inflation that is harming American families.\nRussia, meanwhile, has invaded Ukraine, fomenting death and destruction and spurring a humanitarian\ncrisis in the heart of Europe.\nI have to say, given these extraordinarily trying and tragic circumstances, one can’t help but feel a little\nbit of awe at the underlying strength of the U.S. economy.\nIn the fourth quarter of last year — coinciding, at least in part, with the Omicron surge — GDP grew at\nan annualized rate of 7 percent, with a strong inventory investment and healthy demand for capital\ngoods. For the totality of 2021, U.S. GDP growth was a very healthy 5.7 percent.\nWhile delivery times remain elevated, there are some signs in the data, and in what we hear from our\ncontacts, that supply chain constraints are finally easing, at least somewhat. It really depends on what\nindustry — or more specifically, what good — you are talking about. And shocks continue — witness the\nrecent lockdowns in China.\n5\n\nPUBLIC/OFFICIAL RELEASE // EXTERNAL\nThe job market, half of the Fed’s mandate you’ll recall, is extremely robust. For 11 straight months, new\njob creation has topped 400,000. But if you think that has led to a decline in Help Wanted signs, you’re\nwrong. Even with all this job creation, vacancy rates remain elevated.\nNominal wage growth, as one would guess given these conditions, has been strong, though it has\nrecently not kept up with inflation. Labor participation rates are edging up as well, though they remain\nbelow where they were before the pandemic. I suspect that the waning of the virus — at least here in\nthe United States — as well as uncertain equity markets and even inflation may lure people back into\nthe workforce and persuade others to delay retirement. I know some people my age who were thinking\nabout retiring have recently decided to keep working. The unemployment rate, which is below 4\npercent, should continue to fall this year.\nSo, I think it’s fair to say the Fed has met half of its dual mandate. But the other side of our mandate is\nproving more troublesome.\nThe bottom line is this: Inflation is running far too high. I am acutely concerned about this. Generous\nfiscal policies, supply chain disruptions, and accommodative monetary policy have pushed inflation far\nhigher than I — and my colleagues on the FOMC — are comfortable with. I’m also worried that inflation\nexpectations could become unmoored.\nThe consumer price index (CPI) increased in March. Compared with a year ago, CPI is up 8.5 percent. The\nincrease was driven, in part, by higher energy and food prices. Core CPI, which excludes energy and food\nprices, remains very high as well, having increased 6.5 percent in March from a year earlier. Russia’s\ninvasion of Ukraine will add to inflation pressure, not only hiking oil and gas prices but other\ncommodities, like wheat and fertilizer, as well.\nInflation is widespread. It is showing up throughout a vast array of goods that comprise the CPI “basket.”\nBoth goods and services are experiencing inflation.\nThis is why last month we announced we were raising the federal funds rate for the first time since\n2018. We raised our target by 25 basis points, and I expect a series of deliberate, methodical hikes as\nthe year continues and the data evolve. I also anticipate that we will begin to reduce our holdings of\nTreasury securities, agency debt, and mortgage-backed securities soon. While the Fed cannot do much\nto ameliorate the supply issues that are increasing inflation, we can begin to affect demand.\n6\n\nPUBLIC/OFFICIAL RELEASE // EXTERNAL\nWith the runoff of pandemic support, tightening monetary conditions, and the war in Ukraine pressuring\ncommodity prices, I think growth will moderate this year. We can probably expect to come in around 3\npercent to 3.5 percent GDP growth this year — and then falling to trend growth of 2 percent to 2.5\npercent during the next couple of years.\nInflation should begin to taper this year, too, though remain elevated, probably around 4 percent for\n2022. The following two years should bring it back to our target of 2 percent.\nThe Job Market for Non-College Workers\nNow, before we move on to our Q&A — and, by the way, I hope you’ll really grill me — I want to talk a\nlittle bit about some recent research from the Philadelphia Fed’s Community Development function.\nKeeping with our theme, I’d like, once again, to start with where we’ve been. I know it can be tough to\nremember — it sure is for me — but let’s try to think back to what economic conditions were like prior\nto the pandemic.\nIn general, the economy was actually quite healthy before COVID-19 struck, with solid GDP growth and\nlow unemployment. But those headline numbers masked serious problems, most notably in the labor\nmarket. Many prime age workers, particularly men, and especially men without college degrees, had\ndropped out of the labor force altogether — so they didn’t show up in unemployment data. Many more\nAmericans were essentially “stuck” — they may have been working, but they had jobs with stagnant\nwages and minimal opportunities for advancement.\nA big focus of our Community Development function at the Philadelphia Fed has been working to get\nmore of these workers into what we call opportunity occupations — jobs that don’t require a college\ndegree and that pay above the median wage. They even developed an interactive tool called the\nOccupational Mobility Explorer, which demonstrates that many workers in lower-wage employment\nalready possess the skills they need to transition to a higher-paying job with just a little bit of training.\nYou simply input your job and your metro area into the tool, and the Explorer suggests available career\npaths. A bill collector, for instance, could become a credit counselor and enjoy a significant bump in\nwages. I urge you to delve into the Occupational Mobility Explorer at Philadelphiafed.org.\nIn recent months, my colleagues at the Philadelphia Fed set out to answer another important question:\nHow did the pandemic affect workers without college degrees?\n7\n\nPUBLIC/OFFICIAL RELEASE // EXTERNAL\nInitially, of course, it was those workers who suffered the worst effects of the pandemic-induced\nrecession. Workers without college degrees were less likely to be able to work from home and were\nmore likely to work in industries that were shut down either by government order or because of COVID-\n19 outbreaks. The huge spike in unemployment we experienced in 2020 — at its peak, the\nunemployment nearly quadrupled — was disproportionately concentrated among those without college\ndegrees and those in lower-wage work.\nBut what happened to those workers when the economy reopened?\nBy June 2021, job openings were at record highs as a variety of factors kept workers on the sidelines\neven as consumer demand surged. Employers deployed all kinds of methods to lure workers. They, for\ninstance, offered increased flexibility and training and bumped up starting salaries. These were\nfavorable trends for workers.\nExamining a data set of job postings, Philadelphia Fed researchers identified another trend favorable to\nworkers without a college degree, in particular: The minimum level of education required in the online\njob market fell modestly, even after controlling for the postings’ broad occupation and sector\nclassifications. In other words, some job postings that before the pandemic might have required a\ncollege degree no longer did.\nAll told, compared with the five quarters preceding the pandemic, the five quarters following its onset\nincluded an additional 2.3 million “opportunity employment” job postings. You’ll recall that these are\njobs that don’t require a four-year college degree and that pay at least the median wage. These\nadditional postings can be attributed to both the greater volume of job postings for these types of jobs\nat 62 percent and also the lower educational requirements, at 38 percent of the increase. Which is to\nsay, a lot of job openings that might have been previously off-limits to someone without a college\ndegree became viable options after the start of the pandemic.\nThis is clearly a salutary trend, and we should be thinking of ways to build on it. You, as future college\ngraduates, will play a key role in building a new economy that works for everyone.\nSo, thanks again so much for having me. I hope it was worth the two-year wait. And now I’m happy to\ntake some questions.\n8",

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nEconomic Outlook for Delaware and the Na�on\nDelaware State Chamber of Commerce\n2023 Economic Outlook\nPhiladelphia, PA (virtual)\nOctober 13, 2023\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Execu�ve Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood morning, everyone.\nFirst, to President Mike Quaranta and the Delaware State Chamber of Commerce, thank you for invi�ng\nme for what has become our annual opportunity to be together — even if just virtually.\nAnd, to each of you with us, thanks for allowing me to be part of your Friday.\nI know we have a lot of ground to cover and only an hour in which to do it. And as much as I enjoy\nproviding you with my outlook, I much more enjoy the ability to drill deeper into issues through a\nconversa�on. So, let’s just get right into this.\nOf course, I must begin with the standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do\nnot necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Commitee (FOMC) or in the\nFederal Reserve System.\nOr, as I’ve become fond of saying, when you’re telling your colleagues about this morning’s conversa�on,\nyou can just say, “Pat said,” not “the Fed said.”\nNow, as you can imagine, the two topics I get asked about most are interest rates and infla�on. And that\nmakes sense, given the impact they have on the decisions made by both businesses and families. So, I’ll\nstart there.\n1\n\nA�er the last policy rate hike in July, I went on the record with my view that, if economic and financial\ncondi�ons evolved roughly as I expected, we could hold rates where they are. And while I have been\nproven wrong in less than two months before, I am happy to say that so far economic and financial\ncondi�ons are evolving as I expected, if not perhaps even a tad beter.\nDisinfla�on is under way. Economic ac�vity has been resilient. Labor markets are coming into beter\nbalance. Moreover, these condi�ons aren’t just where I see the na�onal economy but also our regional\neconomy and, specifically for today’s discussion, Delaware’s. And I’ll note those points in turn.\nSo, I remain today where I first announced myself in early August: Absent a stark turn in what I see in the\ndata and hear from contacts, both in one-on-one conversa�ons and in forums like this, I believe that we\nare at the point where we can hold rates where they are.\nLook, we did a lot, and we did it very fast. In barely more than a year, we increased the policy rate by\nmore than 5 percentage points and to its highest level in more than two decades — 11 rate hikes in a\nspan of 12 mee�ngs prior to September.\nWe also turned around our balance sheet policy, and we turned it around fast — and we con�nue to\n�ghten financial condi�ons by shrinking the balance sheet.\nBut the workings of the economy cannot be rushed, and it will take some �me for the full impact of the\nhigher rates to be felt. Holding rates steady will let monetary policy do its work. I am sure policy rates are\nrestric�ve, and as long they remain so, we will steadily press down on infla�on and bring markets into a\nbeter balance.\nBy doing nothing, we are s�ll doing something. And, actually, we are doing quite a lot.\nWe are also giving ourselves a chance to navigate some of the current uncertainty — labor strikes, oil\nprices, and the not-fully-exorcised specter of a government shutdown included.\n2\n\nI am more and more confident that not only is monetary policy currently working, but it will con�nue to\nwork. Headline PCE infla�on remained elevated in August at 3.5 percent year over year, but it is down 3\npercentage points from this �me last year. About half of that drop is due to the vola�le components of\nenergy and food. So, despite both of those being basic necessi�es of life, economists typically exclude\nthem in the so-called core infla�on rate, which gives a more accurate assessment of the pace of\ndisinfla�on and its likely path forward.\nWell, core PCE infla�on has also shown clear signs of progress, and the August monthly reading was its\nsmallest month-over-month increase since 2020. So, yes, I do see a steady disinfla�on under way, and I\nexpect it to con�nue, with infla�on dropping below 3 percent in 2024 and leveling out at our 2 percent\ntarget therea�er.\nHowever, there can be challenges in assessing the trends in disinfla�on. For example, yesterday’s release\nof September’s CPI report came out modestly on the upside, driven by energy and housing. Let me be\nclear about two things. First, we will not tolerate a reaccelera�on in prices. But second, I do not want to\noverreact to the normal month-to-month variability of prices. And for all the fancy techniques, the best\nway to separate a signal from noise remains to average data over several months. Of course, to do so,\nyou need several months of data to start with, which, in turn, demands that, yes, we remain data\ndependent but pa�ent and cau�ous with the data.\nMeanwhile, I con�nue to see GDP growth that is outperforming es�mates from earlier this year. This\neconomy is proving to be nothing if not resilient. I do expect GDP gains to con�nue through the end of\n2023, before pulling back slightly in 2024. But even as I foresee the rate of GDP growth modera�ng, I do\nnot see it contrac�ng. I do not an�cipate a recession.\nIn Delaware, the signals point in the same forward direc�on. And, in fact, business forma�on in\nDelaware, including for high-propensity businesses, remains strong, having risen con�nually since the\npandemic.\nDelaware’s Coincident Index, the Philadelphia Fed’s summary metric of economic ac�vity, increased 3.3\npercent year over year according to August data, reflec�ng generally posi�ve condi�ons. And, in fact,\nDelaware’s three-month increase of 0.6 percent matched the na�onal rate of increase. In the\n3\n\nPhiladelphia Fed’s most recent business outlook surveys, which survey manufacturing and\nnonmanufacturing firms in the Third District, including Delaware, firms overall reported declines in the\ncurrent month, but their six-month outlooks are op�mis�c for growth.\nRecognizing the importance of tourism to Delaware, I do note that the number of summer overnight\ntourist stays captured by the Rehoboth Beach–Dewey Beach Chamber of Commerce showed\naccommoda�on room counts down from last year’s high levels between Memorial Day through Labor\nDay. However, we know there is probably much influencing these numbers beyond infla�on or other\neconomic factors, including the weather.\nAll this aside, I fully recognize and appreciate these challenges that monetary policy is presen�ng to you\nand your businesses.\nThere are outside factors — factors that bring uncertainty with them — which con�nue to parallel the\nmore restric�ve stance we have pursued through the FOMC. For example, while we are now six months\npast the spring banking turmoil, the impact of that episode on credit markets is s�ll being felt; this is not\nnew to many of you.\nOur contacts throughout the banking sector con�nue to report �ghter credit condi�ons, which\nessen�ally have the impact of higher rates without requiring them to be so.\nAs I have spoken with contacts throughout the Third District this summer, I have heard from across\nindustry sectors of the challenges presented by both rates and current condi�ons in access to capital —\nfrom banking, to retail, to agriculture and manufacturing, and everyone in between.\nI know the impact the current climate is also having in the residen�al real estate sector, as higher\nmortgage rates have constricted inventory, which has, in turn, led to increasing prices and a shallowing\nof the pool of prospec�ve buyers, not just in Delaware but throughout the region and na�on.\nIn consumer finance, which I know is a par�cularly important sector for Delaware, there is data we\nfollow closely. So, we do take note that while the number of open bankcard accounts is up nearly 6\n4\n\npercent, year over year, the rate of growth in origina�ons is down during that same �me span through\nJune, according to the latest available data.\nAnd we do pay aten�on to the fact that outstanding balances are up more than 15 percent year over\nyear as of August, while more consumers are pushing their payments forward, as evidenced by both the\nnearly 6 percent increase in the number of outstanding accounts and the increase in delinquency rates.\nAnd in Delaware, the 30-day delinquency rate in mortgages has been trending upward and now exceeds\nprepandemic levels — 2.4 percent of ac�ve loans today versus 2.2 percent in February 2020.\nAddi�onally, the current turmoil in labor markets is likely to similarly exert downward pressure on\nac�vity. I would say this is perhaps most notable among the auto worker strike, given the enormous\nimpact of that industry on our overall economy. It’s an industry that isn’t composed of just the direct\nmanufacturing of cars and trucks but also the business lines of countless downstream component\nmanufacturers and suppliers.\nThere is also the immediate impact of the strike on consumer spending and economic ac�vity, as striking\nworkers are forgoing their usual wages.\nIt is obviously too soon to tell the overall impact of this strike, as well as the ongoing labor ac�on in the\nentertainment industry and elsewhere, on GDP or infla�on, but I suspect it will become obvious in the\ncoming months’ worth of data.\nAnd while an agreement was reached to temporarily keep the federal government open and running, we\ndon’t know what will happen four weeks from now when this agreement expires.\nFinally, I also believe this month’s restart of student loan payments will have a further dampening effect\non consumer spending. How much so, however, remains to be seen.\nTurning to the jobs picture, I do an�cipate na�onal unemployment to end the year at about 4 percent —\njust slightly above where we are now — and to increase slowly over the next year to peak around 4.5\npercent before heading back toward 4 percent in 2025. That is a rate in line with what economists call\n5\n\nthe natural rate of unemployment, or the theore�cal level where labor market condi�ons support stable\ninfla�on of 2 percent.\nNow, before you all post “Pat says unemployment is going up” on your social media feeds, let me be\nclear about one thing: This does not mean that I expect mass layoffs.\nThere are many factors that play into the calcula�on of the unemployment rate itself. For instance, we’ve\nhad recent months where, even as the economy added more jobs, the unemployment rate increased\nbecause more workers moved off the sidelines and back into the labor force.\nAnd, beyond the hard data, I also have to balance the so� data. For example, employers throughout the\nThird District have told me that given how hard it has been to find the workers they currently have, they\nare doing all they can to keep them.\nFor Delaware, the jobs picture remains consistent: Three straight months of labor force and household\njob gains have brought the state’s unemployment rate closer to that of the na�on than at any point in\nthe prior two years. Jobs numbers in major sectors, including construc�on, finance, and professional\nservices, are all above where they were in February 2020.\nI would also specifically note the nearly 9 percent year-over-year increase in jobs in the leisure and\nhospitality sector is back to around prepandemic levels.\nSurely, the pandemic was such a large health and economic crisis that it marks a “before” and “a�er” in\nour minds and lives, not the least of which was the tremendous loss of life that touched so many of us\nvery closely. It was a shock, in every sense of the word. To so many, the new normal s�ll does not feel\nnormal. Again, the pandemic is likely to be a defining event for the genera�ons that experienced it. This\nis true for families and businesses.\nBut, having said that, allow me to pose the following final thought: What has fundamentally changed in\nthe economy from, say, 2018 or 2019? In 2018, infla�on averaged 2 percent almost to the decimal point\nand was actually below target in 2019. Unemployment averaged below 4 percent for both years and was\nas low as 3.5 percent na�onwide and in Delaware, while policy rates peaked below 2.5 percent. From the\n6\n\ncold lens of economics, I do not see the fundamental changes that would call for large changes in natural\nrates.\nBut I could also be wrong, and, trust me, that would not be the first �me this economy has made me\nrethink some of the classic models. We just won’t know for sure un�l we have more data to look at over\n�me.\nSo, it is against this broad backdrop that I believe the prudent posi�on is one in which the policy rate can\nremain steady. Alas, you may have no�ced that I didn’t tell you how long rates will need to stay high.\nAnd, my apologies, I simply cannot tell you at this moment. My forecasts are based on what we know as\nof late 2023. As �me goes by, as adjustments are completed, and as we have more data and insights on\nthe underlying trends, I may need to adjust my forecasts, and with them my �me frames.\nI can tell you three things on my views on future policy. First, I do subscribe to the new moniker, “higher\nfor longer.” I didn’t coin it, but my expecta�on is that rates will need to stay high for a while.\nSecond, the data and what I hear from contacts and outreach, will signal to me when the �me comes to\nadjust policy either way. I really do not expect it, but if infla�on were to rebound, I know I would have\nno hesitancy to support further rate increases as our objec�ve to return infla�on to target is, simply,\nnot nego�able.\nThird, I believe that a resolute, but pa�ent, stance of monetary policy will allow us to achieve the so\nlanding that we all wish for our economy.\nAnd I think that is a good place for me to land my remarks, so we can get to have a conversa�on.\nMike, thanks for allowing me the �me, and let’s start our Q&A.\n7",

    "text": "Economic Outlook\nNew Jersey Bankers Annual Leadership Forum\nSomerset, NJ\nJanuary 20, 2023\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nEconomic Outlook\nNew Jersey Bankers Annual Leadership Forum\nSomerset, NJ\nJanuary 20, 2023\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood morning! It’s great to be here. As a lifelong Jersey boy, I’m very glad to be with a group of my\nfellow New Jerseyans. Though as a lifelong South Jersey boy, I’m not so sure how I feel about doing this\nway up here in Somerset.\nI plan to talk a bit about the country’s economic outlook and my approach to monetary policy. Then we\ncan get to questions, which I’m really looking forward to.\nBut before we do any of that, I need to give you my standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today\nare my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\nHow We Got Here\nAs we begin, I think it’s worth taking a step back and considering, briefly, how much has transpired over\nthe past several years. You really can’t understand where our economy is, or where it’s going, without\nconsidering where we’ve come from.\nFirst and foremost, of course, is the humanitarian tragedy that our country — and our world — has\nendured because of the COVID-19 virus over the past three years. More than 7.5 million people globally\nhave perished from the virus, including more than 1 million of our fellow Americans and 35,000 New\nJerseyans. This is a public health catastrophe on a global scale that is unprecedented in any of our\nlifetimes.\nThe tribulations of the U.S. economy over this period have been startling as well. During the early part of\nthe pandemic, the national economy suffered its largest contraction in recorded history as the virus\nspread and state and local governments shuttered businesses that they deemed nonessential. Tens of\n1\n\nmillions of Americans were thrown into joblessness in one of the sharpest recessions in American\nhistory.\nThat downturn was followed by a period of extraordinary economic growth as states loosened\nrestrictions and, with astonishing rapidity, highly effective vaccines against COVID-19 were developed\nand deployed.\nBut even as the economy came roaring back to health, scars were visible. Many older Americans had\nopted to retire at the onset of the pandemic, leaving labor force participation below where it was before\nCOVID-19 arrived on our shores. Supply chains were badly damaged by the virus itself as workers fell ill,\nand by government lockdowns, which shuttered factories for extended periods. This left crucial items\nlike computer chips in short supply. Meanwhile, large doses of fiscal spending from the federal\ngovernment and accommodative monetary policy from the Federal Reserve stoked demand. This led to\na phenomenon known colloquially as “too much money chasing too few goods” and the highest inflation\nin four decades.\nWhere We Are Nationally\nHigh inflation is a scourge, leading to economic inefficiencies and hurting Americans of limited means\ndisproportionately. I find it particularly disturbing that life’s true essentials like groceries, fuel, and\nshelter have skyrocketed in price.\nThe Federal Reserve is absolutely committed to bringing inflation back to our 2 percent target.\nAnd we’re doing that by adjusting our monetary policy. Last year, we raised the target for the federal\nfunds rate to between 4.25 percent and 4.5 percent. That was a significant move, and a very fast one,\ngiven that we started the year at about 0 percent. I expect that we will raise rates a few more times this\nyear, though, to my mind, the days of us raising them 75 basis points at a time have surely passed. In my\nview, hikes of 25 basis points will be appropriate going forward.\nAt some point this year, I expect that the policy rate will be restrictive enough that we will hold rates in\nplace to let monetary policy do its work. We are also shrinking our balance sheet, which is removing a\nsignificant amount of accommodation in and of itself.\nOur goal is to slow the economy modestly and to bring demand more in line with supply. The Federal\nReserve obviously can’t fix problems like supply chain issues, or an endemic shortage of workers, though\n2\n\nit does seem like these problems are finally easing a bit. But we can affect demand by making it more\nexpensive to borrow money. And that’s clearly already happening: We’re seeing unmistakable signs of a\nslowdown in the most interest-rate sensitive parts of the economy, like housing.\nWhat’s encouraging is that even as we are raising rates, and seeing some signs that inflation is cooling,\nthe national economy remains relatively healthy overall. In parts of 2022, the economy grew modestly\neven as we were tightening monetary policy substantially. Although inflation is biting, many Americans\nare still spending — even if they dip into their savings to do so.\nWe’re seeing a healthy recovery in those sectors that suffered the most during the pandemic, like\nleisure and hospitality, while some sectors that built up healthy order books like manufacturing are\ncooling somewhat. I do remain concerned about commercial real estate, as the embrace of remote and\nhybrid work is clearly dampening demand for office space in central business districts and suburban\noffice parks.\nI’m most pleased that the labor market remains in excellent shape. Last year, the U.S. economy created\n4.5 million jobs, and while we are seeing scattered layoffs in certain segments like tech, there is little\nevidence of a major downturn in the job market. In fact, a record number of Americans are employed.\nAnd indeed, the national unemployment rate is exceptionally low at 3.5 percent.\nWhere We Are Locally\nIn New Jersey, conditions look broadly similar. Much like the national economy, this region’s economy\nreflects weakening conditions in business and interest-rate sensitive areas such as housing, but\nmaintains significant strengths, particularly in the labor market. Payroll growth continues to chug along,\nunemployment claims have stayed low, and the unemployment rate has continued to drop. In fact, in\nthe state of New Jersey, the unemployment rate stands at 3.4 percent — effectively, full employment.\nAs of the third quarter of 2022, wages were up nearly 5 percent year over year in the Philadelphia–\nReading–Camden region.\nOur state’s strengths are vulnerable to ongoing challenges. One obvious weak spot is manufacturing.\nResponses to the Philadelphia Fed’s most recent Manufacturing Business Outlook Survey, which partially\ncovers New Jersey, suggested overall declines in the sector in January. The survey’s indicators for\ncurrent general activity and new orders remained negative, and the survey’s future indicators suggest\ntempered expectations for growth over the next six months.\n3\n\nHousing is also weakening considerably, certainly in part due to higher interest rates. Single-family price\ngrowth in New Jersey is trending downward and was only around 9.5 percent year over year in\nNovember 2022, well down from the double-digit price growth we experienced during the pandemic.\nAccording to Zillow, the share of listings with a price cut has increased over the past year and was 22.7\npercent in the Philadelphia metropolitan statistical area (MSA) and 14.3 percent in the New York City\nMSA as of December. In October, meanwhile, the median days on the market for a house for sale in New\nJersey was 51 days, compared with less than 30 days in May 2021, showcasing softening conditions.\nWhere We Are Going\nIn happier news, we are finally starting to see steady progress bringing inflation down across an array of\ngoods. With monetary policy doing its work, supply chains healing, and excess demand running off, I\nforecast core inflation to come in at around 3.5 percent this year — well over our 2 percent target, but\nsuggestive of clear movement in the right direction. Core inflation should fall to 2.5 percent in 2024 and\nthen back down to 2 percent in 2025.\nGDP growth will be modest, but I’m not forecasting a recession. The labor markets are simply too hot to\nindicate a significant downturn at this point. I expect real GDP growth of about 1 percent this year\nbefore climbing back up to trend growth of about 2 percent in 2024 and 2025.\nLastly, I do think we will see a very slight uptick in unemployment, probably topping out at about 4.5\npercent this year, before falling back toward 4 percent over the next two years. It’s an underrated\nadvantage that the Federal Reserve is taking on inflation from a position of such labor market strength.\nConclusion\nIn sum, the Federal Reserve is committed to bringing down inflation and to maintaining the conditions\nfor a healthy labor market. Given that you are bankers, I would also mention something I always keep in\nmind as a policymaker: When uncertainty abounds, it pays to be cautious. Just as I, as a member of the\nFOMC, am working to minimize risk, I also urge you all to think about the risks your clients face and to\nmake good decisions to guard against any possible losses.\nSo again, thanks so much for having me. Now let’s get to your questions.\n4",

    "text": "An Economic Outlook\nGreater Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce\nNetrality Properties\nPhiladelphia, PA\nApril 12, 2016\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily\nthose of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\nAn Economic Outlook\nGreater Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce\nNetrality Properties\nPhiladelphia, PA\nApril 12, 2016\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nIntroduction\nGood morning. Thanks to Bob Kane for that kind introduction.\nI would also like to thank the Greater Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce, particularly\nPresident and CEO Rob Wonderling, for inviting me here today. As someone who has spent\nmost of his life in this region and believes firmly in the integral role of business in enabling\ncommunities to thrive, I deeply value the important work of the Greater Philadelphia Chamber\nof Commerce.\nI am especially thrilled to note that my friend and former colleague John Fry will serve as the\nnext chairman of the chamber, and I applaud that excellent choice.\nLet me also acknowledge Emily Bittenbender, the recent recipient of the chamber’s prestigious\nParadigm Award. How wonderful and appropriate that this year’s award honored someone in\nthe construction field.\n\nEmily has not only broken barriers, but she has opened doors and created countless job\nopportunities during her career. That is a subject I care deeply about and will discuss in a few\nminutes.\nAn Economic Outlook\nToday I would like to offer my views on the outlook for the U.S. economy and monetary policy.\nAs always, my views are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of my colleagues on\nthe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\nAfter expressing my views on our nation’s economic health and prospects, I would like to offer\na few observations about our local economic landscape. I will concentrate on what I believe are\nthe inherent strengths and challenges in the Greater Philadelphia economy as it relates to the\nconstruction and real estate sectors.\nAn Economic Snapshot\nDespite a subdued fourth quarter when real GDP increased by 1.4 percent and a bumpy start to\nthe year, I remain upbeat. Economic fundamentals are sound, and our financial system is in\ngood shape. Labor markets remain dynamic, income growth is solid, and consumer spending\ncontinues to increase at a solid pace.\nIf there is anything that I believe would pose any risk to the forecast I will deliver, it would be\nthe strong dollar and weakening growth in China. The effects that these developments may\nhave on the U.S. economy are something that we continue to watch closely.\nEquity Markets\nEquity markets have been volatile, but despite the volatility, equity prices are pretty much\nwhere they started at the beginning of the year. Much of the volatility we have experienced is\nno doubt related to worries about the underlying strength in worldwide economic activity. This\nis especially the case with China and the continued negative impact of the strong dollar. Taken\ntogether, slower Chinese growth and the high value of the dollar create some downside risk to\nmy assessment of future economic activity.\n\nThat said, since recent signs are pointing to a bottoming out in manufacturing activity and China\nis not our major trading partner, I remain optimistic that solid fundamentals will be the\noverriding determinant of future U.S. economic activity.\nAs a policymaker, I think it is important to take a long-term view rather than to react to short-\nterm volatility and, thus, consider an array of data and longer-term trends in forming our policy\nstance. As I said, over the longer run, I am relatively optimistic.\nInflation\nLet me now turn to another important component of the U.S. economy that significantly\ninfluences monetary policy, and that is inflation. This continued to run below the FOMC’s\n2 percent target in 2015. Both the fall in energy prices and, to a lesser extent, the appreciation\nof the dollar have held down headline inflation, or total inflation, which includes commodities\nsuch as food and energy prices.\nInflation measures that remove these more volatile components are not far from our goal of 2\npercent. I believe that once energy prices stabilize and start reversing, inflation will return to\nour 2 percent target. I see headline inflation accelerating at an annual average pace of 1.5\npercent by the second half of this year.\nBut as Fed Chair Janet Yellen has emphasized, inflation expectations are also a crucial\ningredient in formulating monetary policy. She notes, “Convincing evidence that longer-run\ninflation expectations have moved lower would be a concern.” This is because such\nexpectations would make attaining our inflation target harder to achieve.\nSo far, survey evidence, like that obtained from the Philadelphia Fed’s Survey of Professional\nForecasters, does not indicate any unanchoring of inflation expectations. However, market-\nbased measures are showing that investors are seeking less compensation for inflation. But\nthere are downside risks to my baseline forecast. In particular, we have been below our\ninflation target for all but two years since 2008. Consistently below-target outcomes will\neventually lead to a lack of credibility for our 2 percent goal. Hence, it may be worth erring on\nthe side of accommodation to ensure against that outcome.\n\nHowever, there are also risks to the upside. There is a good deal of anecdotal evidence that\nfirms are planning to raise wages, especially for jobs that are proving to be hard to fill.\nI do expect some faster wage growth going forward, and accelerating wage growth could\ntranslate into more robust inflation. Additionally, it is unlikely that oil prices will continue to\ndrop, and eventually, they will contribute rather than detract from inflation.\nMonetary Policy\nMy approach to policy is to conduct it in ways that will best serve our dual mandate of\nmaximum employment and price stability. Given the behavior of oil prices, inflation is likely to\nbe quite low in the first quarter of the year, probably even negative. Regarding the employment\nside of our mandate, I believe we will attain our goal early this year, if we have not attained it\nalready.\nOver the medium term, I remain confident that inflation will return to target. Math is in our\nfavor: Energy prices would need to fall again and, by a similar magnitude, to renew their\ndownward pressure on inflation. In other words, even if energy prices remain at very low levels,\ninflation should naturally rebound as current prices become the base upon which price\nincreases are computed.\nSimilarly, import prices should stabilize as the dollar does, removing another source of\ndownward pressure on inflation. Granted, this process will take some time as the price cuts are\ntransmitted across the economy.\nAlthough I remain confident that inflation will return to the Committee’s 2 percent target, my\noutlook sees it doing so only gradually. As I mentioned before, global headwinds point to some\ndownside risks to my economic outlook.\nThese considerations make me a bit more conservative in my approach to policy, at least in the\nvery near term. Although I cannot give you a definitive path for how policy will evolve, it might\nprove prudent to wait until the inflation data are stronger before we undertake a second rate\n\nhike. So, I am approaching near-term policy more cautiously than I did a few months ago. That\nis part of being data dependent.\nAnd attentiveness to the data will be a key factor in all of my future policy recommendations as\nwell. If financial headwinds dissipate quickly and inflation picks up a bit more aggressively, it\nwill require a slightly more aggressive approach to policy.\nI believe as we move into the second half of the year with economic activity growing at trend or\nslightly above trend, the unemployment rate below its natural rate, and price pressures starting\nto assert themselves, policy can truly normalize. I mean this in the sense that we can move\naway meaningfully from the zero lower bound and that our reaction to incoming data can\nreturn to a more historical pattern.\nThat would not necessarily imply an overly aggressive path for policy. Thus, it will take fewer\nrate hikes to attain neutrality in policy than it would have 15 years ago. By historical standards,\nthat in itself implies a somewhat shallower path for interest rates than was typical of past\nrecoveries.\nReal Estate\nLooking at real estate in more detail, residential investment is an emerging bright spot for the\nnational economy as growth in this sector is currently well above its historical average. The\ndemand for housing has picked up, and prices of houses and especially rentals are growing\nstrongly.\nWhile much of the initial real estate gains were in multifamily units, which remains robust, new\nsingle-family homes have also started to accelerate more noticeably over the past year or so.\nThis is a national trend we saw happen first in cities such as New York and San Francisco\nalready. Now Philadelphia is seeing this same kind of urban gentrification.\nMuch has been written about the influx of millennials to Center City as well as the challenges of\nkeeping them here. Good schools, jobs, and competitive tax structures are critical.\n\nSince 1992, census data show a dramatic rise in the proportion of urban versus suburban\nhousing construction. We looked at Philadelphia and seven surrounding counties over the past\nfew decades:\n• From 2013 through 2015, nearly 40 percent of all residential building permits were in\nthe cities of Philadelphia and Camden.\n• This is a significant shift since the building permits were as low as 2 percent in 1992.\n• In fact, all urban residential building permits never climbed above 8 percent in the entire\nperiod between 1988 and 2002.\nThis residential growth has been accompanied by office growth as well. This has boosted both\nan improving daytime and nighttime population, which creates a vibrant city on a 24-hour basis.\nAccording to the Center City District and Central Philadelphia Development Corporation, the\naverage household income for core Center City residents is more than $100,000. This has\nincreased the demand for retail and is prompting the development of other sites on Market\nEast.\nOther highlights include:\n• The $1.2 billion Comcast Innovation & Technology Center, the largest planned project in\nthe city’s history;\n• Drexel University and Brandywine Realty Trust’s recently announced the 8-million-\nsquare-foot Schuylkill Yards mixed-use project;\n• The Navy Yard, which just celebrated its 10th anniversary with close to 12,000 workers,\nand is breaking ground on its 14th new office building;\n• And finally, the $800 million urban center slated for Camden’s waterfront. I won’t go\ninto detail because I know the CEO of Liberty Property Trust is going to speak today. But\nI am particularly excited about the vision of this project and how it will create a new\ndaytime workforce and new jobs for city residents.\n\nI toured Camden last week with Mayor Dana Redd as part of a larger discussion on community\nrevitalization. It is wonderful to see the recent shift in momentum there. These are just a few\nprojects that show how this region ― and its cities in particular ― are seeing an increase in\ndemand for urban, residential, and mixed-use development.\nDespite our region’s recent growth, we are seeing little evidence of widespread construction-\nrelated cost pressures for either materials or labor.\nWeak global demand has been driving energy and commodity prices lower this past year. In\nfact, material costs have fallen as a result as well as the cost of transporting these supplies.\nAs long as current global market conditions remain, I do not anticipate any significant\nmovement in these prices in 2016. I expect construction costs to increase at or below that of\nthe general economy in the near term. Further, labor costs are generally rising in step with that\nof the general economy.\nEmployment\nLet me now focus more closely on the labor market, employment opportunities, and workforce\ndevelopment issues for the nation and our region.\nI am fortunate to have joined the Fed at a time when our business climate maintains a steady\nand gradual improvement, and though challenges remain, we continue making strides. Robust\nemployment growth, increased disposable income, and fairly healthy household balance sheets\nshould cause consumption to grow this year by 2.7 percent, and it is the consumer who will\nunderpin the economic progress in my forecast.\nOne of the fundamental strengths supporting this economic growth will be the continued\nstrength in job growth. Each of the past three years has witnessed the creation of more than\n2 million net new jobs, and many of those jobs were in highly skilled professions.\nAlthough I expect that employment growth will slow somewhat, I am still expecting a year in\nwhich the economy creates in the neighborhood of 2 million net new jobs. We are well on pace\n\nto reach this target as monthly job gains have averaged 209,000 for the first three months of\nthe year.\nThe number of job openings nationally remains above prerecession levels, and in my meetings\naround the District, I often hear employers lament about the difficulty in finding the right\nworkers. While recruiting and attracting talent is becoming more challenging for many of your\norganizations, it is also a sign of the steady improvements and resiliency of our labor markets.\nThe rate of workers voluntarily leaving their jobs ― another key indicator of how people view\ntheir own employment prospects ― has also recently reached prerecession levels. Due to this\nreduction in labor market slack, I anticipate stronger wage growth than the 2 percent or so that\nwe achieved last year.\nWorkers returning to the labor force have also boosted the participation rate for three\nconsecutive months, and we are now just shy of 63 percent. Our participation rate was hit hard\nby the recession, but it is a number that is also heavily influenced by demographics and social\nshifts as well as by the number of discouraged workers. For instance, in the 1960s and ’70s,\nwomen entered the workforce in greater numbers, so we saw the participation rate spike.\nWhile 63 percent is still low by historical standards, the participation rate began trending down\nfrom its peak value of 67.3 in 2000 as baby boomers started their transition from work to\nretirement.\nThere’s no doubt that discouraged workers accelerated the participation rate drop we\nexperienced in recent years; however, I feel any further reductions we could experience moving\nforward is more likely to be caused by retirements and school enrollment versus discouraged\nworkers.\nAlthough we experienced a small cyclical uptick in the March unemployment rate to 5.0\npercent, I believe that the overall strength in job growth could bring the unemployment rate\ndown to 4.7 percent by year-end.\n\nSo, what does this mean for you and other business leaders who I have spoken with who need\ntrained workers to grow their businesses? It means that we must all take an active role in\ndeveloping our future workforce. We have the people.\nThere are more than 106,000 young people aged 16 to 24 in Greater Philadelphia who are not\nin school and not working. Over the past 15 years, the participation of young people in the\nlabor force has declined from 66 percent to 55 percent.\nWe need to invest in this untapped resource. One organization I want to make sure everyone\nhere knows about is the YouthBuild Philadelphia Charter School. Last fall, I saw firsthand the\ndifference the school is making in helping young people get an education and learn valuable\nskills, including in the building trades.\nThe Federal Reserve Banks of Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Atlanta produced a major research\nstudy on opportunity occupations in the nation’s largest metropolitan economies in 2015.\nOpportunity occupations are jobs that pay at least the national median salary and are\naccessible to those without a bachelor’s degree.\nWe need to support the growth of opportunity occupations through apprenticeships and\nmentorship programs that provide training and guidance.\nHow many people here started working when they were teenagers? Me, too, on a farm near\nmy hometown in New Jersey. I still reflect on things that I learned there and feel grateful for the\ntrust placed in me by John McGroarty, my first boss. I learned about the opportunities that\ncome from working hard and the perseverance it takes to improve when you make a mistake.\nConclusion\nI hope that I have paid John’s trust and patience forward. One of my primary focuses as\npresident of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia is on exploring ways to strengthen the\nThird District in the area of workforce development. We want to hear from you and other\nemployers about how we can be helpful. We have so much potential here.\n\nI have covered a fair bit of ground here, so let me wrap up by summarizing my main points.\nOverall, my view of the economy is upbeat. Our financial system is in good shape, our economic\nfundamentals are sound, our labor markets remain dynamic, and our income growth is solid.\nConsumer spending is also increasing at a solid pace.\nWe continue to face our challenges head on, and in doing so, we have made significant\neconomic strides as a nation and as a region. The renovation and revival of this beautiful\nbuilding ― where we are today and of other sites on North Broad Street ― are illustrative of\nthe resources we have for growth and renewal.\nThank you.",

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nThe Fed and the Economy: Where We’re Going, Where We’ve Been\nLa Salle University\nThe 22nd Annual Economic Outlook\nPhiladelphia, PA\nFebruary 14, 2023\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood afternoon! It’s great to return to this event. It was 2017 when I last spoke at this annual economic\noutlook. My topic back then focused on challenges in the economy. Here we are in 2023 — and there\nare still economic challenges to address — albeit very different ones from six years ago.\nThere are a few areas we’ll explore today. First, because I can’t resist donning my old teaching cap, I’d\nlike to offer some background about what the Fed is and what it does. I’ll also talk about what the Fed\ndoesn’t do, because sometimes the Fed’s powers are overestimated. I’ll then pivot to the economic\noutlook for our country and our region, and touch on my approach to monetary policy. After that, we\ncan get to some questions, which is something I always enjoy and look forward to.\nBut before we do any of that, I need to give you my standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today\nare my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\nLet’s start with some Fed history.\nFederal Reserve History and Structure\nThe First Bank of the United States was the brainchild of the man who in recent years has become\neverybody’s favorite founding father: Alexander Hamilton. The bank was located right here in\nPhiladelphia when it was still the capital of the country. It was established in 1791 to deal with the debt\nfrom the Revolutionary War and to ensure the government’s financial stability. It looked a lot different\nthan the entity we are today, and it wasn’t without controversy.\n1\n\nAs Broadway has reminded us, Thomas Jefferson was among those who worried about power that was\ntoo strong and too centralized. He even once famously said he found banks to be more dangerous than\nstanding armies. When the bank’s charter was up for renewal after its initial 20 years, the Jeffersonian\nargument won out and the measure failed by a vote each in the House and the Senate. The bank was\ndissolved.\nFive years later, Congress agreed to a central banking function a second time, and we launched the\nimaginatively named Second Bank of the United States. And about 20 years after that, Congress decided\nnot to renew the charter, again owing to a strain of popular sentiment that didn’t trust powerful,\ncentralized institutions.\nBut not having a central bank didn’t really work because it tended to breed volatility.\nThe period leading up to the third iteration of American central banking — the Federal Reserve — was\nmarked by currency instability, bank runs, and cycles of boom and bust. At one point, J.P. Morgan\nactually had to step in personally to bail out the country. If you’ve ever been to the Morgan Library &\nMuseum in New York, you can stand in the room where the solution to that financial crisis was worked\nout.\nEven during the Revolutionary War era, central banking was standard in democracies, and it remains\nthat way today. There are no developed economies that don’t have it in some form. So, the eventual\nadoption of our current central bank — in the 1913 Federal Reserve Act — was to some extent\ninevitable. And the configuration of the Federal Reserve System — a central bank with a decentralized\nstructure — is something of a testament to old-fashioned American compromise. It also reflects the\nunique demands of the United States and our economy.\nThe Federal Reserve System consists of a Board of Governors, which sits in Washington, and 12 regional\nBanks located around the country, including the one I oversee here in Philadelphia.\nThe Board seats seven governors, including the Chair. Each regional Bank has its own president and\nboard of directors, which is made up of business, banking, and community leaders from the area.\nFundamentally, this provides the Fed with a perspective, within each District, of the sectors and issues\nthat make the region tick. We are here in the Third District, which encompasses eastern Pennsylvania,\n2\n\nSouth Jersey, and the state of Delaware. We’re the smallest District, geographically, but I like to think we\npunch above our weight.\nThe Fed’s decentralized nature is, in my view, a unique strength. We’re making national policy, but\nwe’re doing it for an enormous country, and the averages of economic data can obscure realities on the\nground. Conditions can look very different in Philadelphia, Dover, or Trenton than they do in Dallas, Salt\nLake City, or Honolulu. This system gives, in my view, a voice to a range of localities and sectors. It also\nallows us to focus on regional issues within each Bank’s District.\nThe United States has a unique set of needs. It’s easy to forget that we’re an outlier because we’re such\na big country: Only Russia and Canada are bigger geographically, only China and India have larger\npopulations, and no other country has a bigger economy, at least for now. And that economy is vast,\nspreading across sectors and natural resources in a way that most other nations don’t.\nSo, it makes sense that we have a system that feeds back information from around the country.\nThe other difference from most central banks is that the Fed has a dual mandate rather than a single\ngoal; that is, we’re charged with both maximum employment and price stability. Most just focus on one.\nMaximum employment encompasses a wide range of metrics, although most attention is paid to the\nunemployment rate. That number, of course, will never be zero. Instead, we try to ensure that labor\nmarkets are functioning dynamically and efficiently. Price stability, on the other hand, is low and stable\ninflation, which we judge to be around 2 percent a year. More on both topics in a bit.\nThe decisions we make within the Fed — the way we look at the economy and respond to data — are\nbuilt entirely on the foundation of our dual mandate. It is our North Star.\nNow that we’ve established that, I turn to the question so many people secretly want to ask: What,\nexactly, does the Fed do? I’m delighted to talk about it, but just as important, I’ll also mention what we\ndon’t do.\nWe have lending power. What that means is we do not have spending power. We have no authority\nover fiscal policy, which deals with debts, deficits, and taxes. Or investments to encourage growth. Or\n3\n\ngrants to worthy organizations. Or programs to spur job creation. Those all depend on elected officials,\nbe they on the local, state, or national level.\nSo, what do we do?\nWe set monetary policy. We also regulate banks, along with an alphabet soup of government agencies.\nWe are the lender of last resort during bona fide emergencies.\nAnd the lede that always gets buried — and I wish it weren’t so overshadowed by discussions of interest\nrates — is that we work within our Districts to help strengthen local communities’ economies. We have\na truly exceptional team in Philadelphia in our Community Development and Regional Outreach\nDepartment, and they work with partners all over the Third District. They’re doing truly vital work on\nemployment, transportation, housing, and other issues.\nBut first, let me talk a bit about monetary policy. Monetary policy is a fairly limited field with a fairly\nconscripted set of tools.\nOur job is to create the conditions in which a healthy economy can thrive. More than anything, we’re\ntilling the land.\nMonetary policy is about meeting our dual mandate mostly by moving interest rates. There are other\ntools we use, but in normal times, it’s mostly about moving what is technically called the federal funds\nrate. In the media, that’s usually just called the interest rate.\nThe federal funds rate is the interest rate on loans that banks make to each other overnight. That rate\ntends to influence interest rates more broadly, so the effect ripples through the economy. When we\nmove the federal funds rate, it affects the interest rate people pay on their mortgages and car loans and\nthat businesses pay to borrow to meet or expand their payrolls or buy inventory. In fact, sometimes just\nannouncing we are planning to raise the federal funds rate in the future affects these lending rates.\nWe set rates when the FOMC meets in Washington, which we do eight times a year.\nRegional Bank presidents don’t always get to vote. Most of us rotate into a voting position every three\nyears, but the governors always do, as does the president of the New York Fed. New York, which\nconducts the Fed’s market operations, enjoys something of a “first among equals” status within the\n4\n\nSystem. I’m voting this year. I’ve noticed people care a lot more about what I have to say recently, which\nI’m sure is just a coincidence. Regardless of whether we are voting or not, we do always represent our\nDistricts and play a part in the discussion.\nThe FOMC discussion is never political. Because we’re appointed policymakers, we don’t respond to\nswings in public opinion or election cycles. Unlike elected officials, who suffer the slings and arrows of\nthe 24-hour news machine, we operate in a rare, apolitical bubble. I truly believe that the independence\nof the Fed is crucial to making the best decisions possible for the American economy, free from the\npressures of politics.\nAlthough we’re independent, that doesn’t mean we’re unchecked. The Fed is what’s considered\n“independent within the government.” We’re overseen by Congress, but neither Congress nor the\npresidential administration has a say in the decisions we make.\nThat’s not to suggest the Fed doesn’t come under intense political scrutiny at times, particularly when\neconomic conditions are troubled.\nThe State of the Economy\nI just stepped back in time a few hundred years to consider the Fed’s origins. In keeping with that time\ntravel, I think it’s worth taking a step back and considering, briefly, how much has transpired over the\npast several years. You really can’t understand where our economy is, or where it’s going, without\nconsidering where we’ve come from.\nFirst and foremost, of course, is the humanitarian tragedy that our country — and our world — has\nendured because of the COVID-19 virus over the past three years. More than 6.5 million people globally\nhave perished from the virus, including more than 1 million of our fellow Americans and nearly 50,000\nPennsylvanians. This is a public health catastrophe on a global scale that is unprecedented in any of our\nlifetimes.\nThe tribulations of the U.S. economy over this period have been startling as well. During the early part of\nthe pandemic, the national economy suffered its largest contraction in recorded history as the virus\nspread and state and local governments closed businesses that they deemed nonessential. Tens of\nmillions of Americans lost their jobs in one of the sharpest recessions in American history.\n5\n\nThat downturn was followed by a period of extraordinary economic growth as states loosened\nrestrictions and, with astonishing rapidity, highly effective vaccines against COVID-19 were developed\nand deployed.\nBut even as the economy came roaring back to health, scars were visible. Many older Americans had\nopted to retire at the onset of the pandemic, leaving labor force participation below where it was before\nCOVID-19 arrived on our shores. Supply chains were badly damaged by the virus itself as workers fell ill,\nand by government lockdowns, which shuttered factories for extended periods. This left crucial and\ndisparate items like computer chips and cream cheese in short supply. Meanwhile, large doses of fiscal\nspending from the federal government and accommodative monetary policy from the Federal Reserve\nstoked demand. This led to a phenomenon known colloquially as “too much money chasing too few\ngoods” and the highest inflation in four decades.\nWhere We Are Nationally\nHigh inflation is a scourge, leading to economic inefficiencies and hurting Americans of limited means\ndisproportionately. I find it particularly disturbing that life’s true essentials like groceries, fuel, and\nshelter have skyrocketed in price.\nThe Federal Reserve is absolutely committed to bringing inflation back to our 2 percent target.\nAnd we’re doing that by adjusting our monetary policy. Since March last year, we raised the target range\nfor the federal funds rate from zero to between 4.5 percent and 4.75 percent. That is a significant move,\nand a very fast one, with the FOMC raising rates 75 basis points at several meetings. But rates are now\nat a level that allow us to slow down and proceed cautiously and, to my mind, the days of us raising 75\nbasis points at a time have surely passed. Just at the last meeting, I voted for a hike of 25 basis points —\nwhat some would call slow but actually is closer to cruising speed when it comes to tightening. In my\nview, we are not done yet … but we are likely close.\nAt some point this year, I expect that the policy rate will be restrictive enough that we will hold rates in\nplace and let monetary policy do its work. We are also shrinking our balance sheet, which is removing a\nsignificant amount of accommodation in and of itself.\n6\n\nOur goal is to slow the economy modestly and to bring demand more in line with supply. The Federal\nReserve obviously can’t fix problems like supply chain issues, though it does seem like these problems\nare finally easing a bit. Or an endemic shortage of workers, that unfortunately has yet to ease. But we\ncan affect demand by making it more expensive to borrow money. And that’s clearly already happening:\nWe’re seeing unmistakable signs of a slowdown in the most interest-rate sensitive parts of the economy,\nlike housing.\nWhat’s encouraging is that even as we are raising rates, and seeing some signs that inflation is cooling,\nthe national economy remains relatively healthy overall. In parts of 2022, the economy grew modestly\neven as we were tightening monetary policy substantially. Although inflation is biting, many Americans\nare still spending — even if they dip into their savings to do so.\nWe’re seeing a healthy recovery in those sectors that suffered the most during the pandemic, like\nleisure and hospitality, while some sectors that built up healthy order books like manufacturing are\ncooling. I do remain concerned about commercial real estate, as the embrace of remote and hybrid\nwork is clearly dampening demand for office space in central business districts and suburban office\nparks.\nI’m most pleased that the labor market remains in excellent shape. Last year, the U.S. economy created\n4.8 million jobs, and while we are seeing some layoffs in certain segments like tech, there is little\nevidence of a major downturn in the job market. In fact, in the latest data release, a staggering half a\nmillion new jobs were created in January. There is now a record number of Americans employed. And\nindeed, the national unemployment rate is exceptionally low at 3.4 percent.\nWhere We Are Locally\nIn the Philadelphia area, conditions look broadly similar. Much like the national economy, this region’s\neconomy reflects weakening conditions in business and interest-rate sensitive areas such as housing,\nbut maintains significant strengths, particularly in the labor market. Payroll growth continues to chug\nalong, and the unemployment rate has fallen and remains low. In fact, in the Philadelphia metropolitan\nstatistical area, the unemployment rate stands at 3.8 percent — effectively, full employment. As of the\nfourth quarter of 2022, the index for wages and salaries was up above 4 percent year over year in the\nPhiladelphia–Reading–Camden region.\n7\n\nOf course, even in a hot job market, some positions remain more in demand than others. According to\nan analysis of job listings for the Philadelphia area, some of the most frequent job ads are for registered\nnurses, retail salespeople, software developers, and customer service representatives, reflecting\ncontinued hot demand in health care, tech, and retail.\nNow, our region’s strengths are vulnerable to ongoing challenges. One obvious weak spot is\nmanufacturing. Responses to the Philadelphia Fed’s most recent Manufacturing Business Outlook\nSurvey, which covers the area, suggested overall declines in the sector in January. The survey’s\nindicators for current general activity and new orders remained negative, and the survey’s future\nindicators suggest tempered expectations for growth over the next six months.\nHousing is also weakening considerably, certainly in part due to higher interest rates. Single-family price\ngrowth in Philadelphia County is trending downward and was only around 3.6 percent year over year in\nNovember 2022, well down from the 6 percent to 8 percent price growth we experienced during the\npandemic. According to Zillow, the share of listings with a price cut has increased over the past year and\nwas 22.7 percent in the Philadelphia metro area as of December. Also in December, the median days on\nthe market for a house for sale in Philadelphia was 41 days, matching the typical pre-pandemic figure,\nand showcasing a softening in conditions. The days of houses selling before they are even listed are in\nour rearview mirror.\nWhere We Are Going\nIn happier news, we are finally starting to see steady progress bringing inflation down across an array of\ngoods. With monetary policy doing its work, supply chains healing, and excess demand running off, I\nforecast core inflation to come in at around 3.5 percent this year — well over our 2 percent target, but\nsuggestive of clear movement in the right direction. Core inflation should fall to 2.5 percent in 2024 and\nthen back down to 2 percent in 2025.\nGDP growth will be modest, but I’m not forecasting a recession. The labor markets are simply too hot to\nindicate a significant downturn at this point. I expect real GDP growth of about 1 percent this year\nbefore climbing back up to trend growth of about 2 percent in 2024 and 2025.\n8\n\nLastly, I do think we will see a very slight uptick in unemployment, probably topping out modestly above\n4 percent this year. It’s an underrated advantage that the Federal Reserve is taking on inflation from a\nposition of such labor market strength.\nConclusion\nIn sum, the Federal Reserve is committed to bringing down inflation and to maintaining the conditions\nfor a healthy labor market. I hope that the first part of my talk was interesting background and that the\nsecond part helped to illuminate today’s economic environment.\nAnd one last historical mention — consider a visit to the First and Second Banks of the U.S. — they’re\nright here in our backyard at Independence National Historical Park.\nSo again, thanks so much for having me. Now let’s get to your questions.\n9",

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nHighlighting the Labor Market’s New Complexities; Listening to Worker Voices\nNational Association for Business Economics (NABE)\nMonetary Policy and Outlook Webinar\nPhiladelphia, PA (virtual)\nJune 1, 2023\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood afternoon, everyone. It is a pleasure to join you in this series on monetary policy and our\neconomic outlook.\nAnd I thank NABE for the invite and Dr. Elaine Buckberg for moderating.\nYou heard from my colleague, Richmond Fed President and CEO Tom Barkin, on Tuesday, so I am\nhonored to provide a Fed bookend to this webinar.\nI look forward to having a useful and engaging dialogue. But please allow me to open with my thoughts\non the direction in which we are heading.\nAnd I must lead with the standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not\nnecessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or in the Federal\nReserve System.\nWhile headline PCE inflation has come down from its peak of 7 percent last year, it is still running at over\n4 percent year over year — way above the Fed’s long-run target of 2 percent annually. Disinflation is\nunder way, but it is doing so at a disappointingly slow pace.\nThis persistently high inflation comes with real costs for American families — cutting into purchasing\npower and household wealth. And the pain isn’t being felt equally.\n1\n\nThe toll is falling most heavily on those least able to bear it. I’m especially concerned about the elevated\ncosts of housing, food, and health care — life’s true necessities.\nTo combat this inflation, the Fed has been working to slow the economy modestly and bring demand\nmore in line with supply. We have increased the target range for the federal funds rate — our primary\nmonetary policy tool — by 500 basis points since March 2022. Ongoing balance sheet reduction is also\ntightening financial conditions.\nWe’re already seeing promising signs that these actions are working; for example, house price indexes\nare cooling.\nAnd it is encouraging that even as we have raised rates, the national economy remains relatively healthy\noverall. Since January, we’ve experienced modest growth in economic activity.\nThere are also still a record number of Americans employed, with more than 1 million jobs created, on\nnet, so far this year. While there are some signs that labor market tightness is beginning to ease a bit,\nthe unemployment rate remains near record lows — 3.4 percent in April.\nWe’re also paying close attention to the banking system. The recent failures of Silicon Valley Bank,\nSignature Bank, and First Republic ignited an understandable wave of anxiety among banks, depositors,\nand investors. But I can assure you that the U.S. banking system remains sound and resilient.\nWe know that problems in a few banks, if left unattended, can undermine confidence in healthy banks.\nThat’s why the Treasury, the FDIC, and the Fed acted quickly to protect the U.S. economy and its\nbanking interests. The Federal Reserve also led a thorough, transparent, and swift review of the events\nsurrounding Silicon Valley Bank so we could learn what went wrong.\nSo, of course, I know the question on everyone’s mind: OK, Pat, where do we go from here?\nThe Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate: to promote full employment and\nprice stability. On the jobs front, things look quite good; we are, effectively, at full employment. But\nwhen it comes to inflation, there is still significant room for improvement.\n2\n\nIt will take some time to evaluate how recent events may impact overall economic activity and inflation.\nI expect to see tighter credit conditions for households and businesses that may slow economic activity\nand hiring, but the full extent is still unclear.\nWhat is clear is that the Fed remains fully committed to return inflation to its 2 percent target. To do\nthis, the policy stance needs to be restrictive enough — but what is “enough” is not written in stone\nsomewhere.\nInstead, I am closely monitoring incoming data, listening to our contacts and audiences, and evaluating\neconomic conditions to assess whether additional tightening will be needed.\nI do believe that we are close to the point where we can hold rates in place and let monetary policy do\nits work to bring inflation back to the target in a timely manner.\nAlong this path, I project that we will see modest growth this year, with real GDP coming in a bit below 1\npercent.\nI expect inflation to decline to somewhere around 3.5 percent this year, before falling to 2.5 percent in\n2024, and leveling out at our 2 percent target in 2025. Unemployment is also likely to tick up slightly,\nhitting around 4.4 percent this year.\nBut this is just a snapshot of what conditions look like today. We’re operating in a very uncertain\nenvironment, and I will be closely monitoring our dashboards of economic indicators and assessing their\nimplications.\nNow, as I’ve said before, survey data are an important tool in the economic business. At the Fed, we\nlook at everything from big broad numbers like GDP and employment growth to more granular figures\nlike restaurant reservations and mobility data.\nThese data — hard data — tell us a lot. But even hard data have their limits. The numbers can point in a\ncertain direction, yet there may be a lot going on underneath those numbers, which is not as easily\nvisible but is just as vital to drawing a complete picture.\n3\n\nTake, for example, the employment picture.\nThroughout the past year, each interest rate hike was predictably followed by voices warning that we\nwere about to tank the labor market and spike unemployment. That hasn’t happened, but we monitor\nthese trends to see how workers will be impacted if it does.\nGiven the tight labor market, there’s obviously something deeper happening. We continually hear from\nsome employers that certain tools aren’t working as they once did. Simply offering higher wages still\nisn’t attracting the workers some need, and some efforts to increase the productivity of current workers\nis instead leading to increased turnover.\nThese cases are especially true at the lower end of the wage scale, and this may be why some have\ngroused that, “No one wants to work anymore.” But I think we all would agree there’s more going on\nunder the surface.\nNow, I’m not strictly an economist. I’m a civil engineer. And that background is what is forcing me to\nlook at this issue in a different way.\nAnd this is what we at the Philadelphia Fed are doing. And I’d like to spend a few moments on this\nbefore we get to our Q&A.\nOver the past year, our Community Development and Regional Outreach team, along with colleagues at\nthe Atlanta Fed and elsewhere, engaged with low-wage and non-degree-holding workers nationwide in\na series of focus group conversations.\nWe’ve been listening to them and to their reasons why they may have exited the labor market at the\nonset of the pandemic to reenter from an entirely different door on the other side of it or are quitting\njobs at such a high rate.\nWe’re calling this effort the Worker Voices Project. And we released our first report — “Shifting\nPerspectives and Expectations on Employment” — one week ago.\n4\n\nYes, workers want to be paid what they believe they are worth and bring to the table, but it’s not only\nabout wages. And, yes, they want to be somewhere they can be productive and contributing employees,\nbut not if they don’t believe their contributions are appreciated, let alone rewarded.\nWhat we increasingly heard is that workers want something that we, as economists and civil engineers,\ndon’t yet have a metric for: being treated with dignity.\nAs one participant told me recently, “Work is not the end-all, be-all.” Or, in the words of another,\n“We’re looking for a place where we belong.”\nThe factors going into the decisions of where to work, or whether to go in an entirely different direction,\nare increasingly complex. And these complexities may make us rethink what we thought we knew about\nlabor markets.\nI encourage everyone to take a look at our initial Worker Voices Project report.\nFor us as policymakers, soft data are perhaps equally important to get a full understanding of our\neconomic situation. And the soft data we’re getting through Worker Voices are what will help us chart a\ncourse for a strong and growing — but also a more inclusive — American economy.\nI know that’s a lot to start with, but I also know it’s what is going to lead us to a great conversation.\nAnd, Elaine, to that end, let’s get right to it.\n5",

This university continues to live up to its motto, “Knowledge is the light of the mind,” in\neverything it does, including opening its doors for forums such as this.\nI do not wish to take away from the conversation that will follow, so with your approval, I will start right\ninto my economic outlook.\nBut obviously, before I can do that, I must first provide the standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express\nthis afternoon are my own and do not necessarily represent those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve\nSystem or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nA lot has certainly changed since I joined you for this event last January.\nAt that time, we were in the midst of a program of fed funds rate increases to get a handle on inflation.\nWhen I spoke to you last time, the rate had just been increased to a range of 4¼-to-4½ percent. Today,\nas I stand here, it is 100 basis points higher — a full percentage point.\n1\n\nYet, while the policy interest rate is indeed 1 point higher, the inflation rate is down by a much greater\namount. When we met in January 2023, core PCE inflation stood at 4.9 percent year over year. Now, we\nwon’t receive the January 2024 core PCE number until next week, but just looking at December’s year-\nover-year rate of 2.9 percent, well, that is significant improvement. Moreover, for the last six or seven\nmonths, core PCE inflation has been running essentially at a rate of 2 percent, the FOMC’s inflation\ntarget.\nLast week, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) came in with headline inflation at 3.1 percent year over year\nin January — a 0.3 percent dip from December — and core CPI inflation at 3.9 percent annually, holding\nsteady from the prior month. Now, comparing that to the prior year, in January 2023, headline CPI was\nat 6.4 percent year over year, and core CPI was at 5.6 percent. So, again, there’s measured progress.\nBut we are bound to have bumps along the road to disinflation. Indeed, the latest CPI data mildly\nsurprised analysts on the upside, as the drop in rents we see is only slowly passing through into the\ninflation numbers. And as progress can be bumpy — and uneven at times — it is important that we see\nmore evidence, allowing us to look past the vagaries of monthly data and ensure we continue on the\nright path.\nRegardless, the data overall suggest that we are in the final mile of the marathon of getting PCE inflation\nback down to our target annual rate of 2 percent. However, as anyone who has ever run a marathon can\ntell you, the final mile is often the hardest.\n“So, Pat,” I hear you asking, “where do we go from here?” Well, let me get the headline statement out\nof the way right now.\nYes, I believe that we may be in the position to see the rate decrease this year. But I would caution\nanyone from looking for it right now and right away. We have time to get this right, as we must. And to\nbe sure, next month’s meeting and FOMC vote will mark the second of eight scheduled meetings for\n2024.\nI would characterize my stance at the moment as the old, oft-used adage: “Trust but verify.” I certainly\nhave confidence that monetary policy is working as it should — and the trend lines on disinflation only\n2\n\nadd to that — but I’m not quite yet at the “verified” moment. And what I am doing in verifying is\ncompiling more evidence.\nWhat I will be looking for in the hard data will be the distribution of disinflation among goods and\nservices. As I think back to 2021, when we saw the prices of used cars jump, the predominant thinking\nwas that the inflation spike mostly reflected transitory factors. But then other goods and services\nexperienced rapid inflation, and we realized that inflation was becoming more entrenched across the\neconomy.\nToday, I’m looking at the same things, but rather in reverse. Yes, the disinflation trend has picked up the\npace — as I noted, the six-month core PCE is now consistent with inflation under 2 percent — but I again\nwant to make sure that we are seeing disinflation across goods and services.\nI have said before that there are three things that I look at most closely in inflation reports:\ntransportation, food, and shelter. These are the three things that matter the most directly to the\noverwhelming majority of American families. Well, transportation inflation is down from its peak,\nthough it remains elevated. Food inflation, while certainly prone to fluctuations because of a host of\nfactors, is generally down and back to normal levels on a year-over-year basis. Shelter inflation remains\nelevated, though I do recognize the lags inherent in the way it is calculated.\nSo, in a nutshell, I find our greatest economic risk comes from acting to lower the rate too early, lest we\nreignite inflation and see the work of the past two years unwind before our eyes.\nAlong with our work on the policy rate, we have also been reducing the size of the Fed’s balance sheet\n— what is known as quantitative tightening. That may describe what it is, but not its purpose. I prefer to\nuse the term balance sheet normalization.\nWhen we announced this plan in May 2022, we stated an intention to significantly reduce the balance\nsheet until reserve balances were “ample,” or, simply, when the balance sheet size returned to\n“normal.” Well, we’re nearly two years in, so, how is it going?\n3\n\nThere is no question that we have already achieved a significant reduction in the balance sheet of nearly\n$1.5 trillion. And we are not done yet, as reserves remain very abundant, albeit less so than in 2022.\nWhen we announced this program, we also said that normalization would proceed in “a predictable\nmanner.” And to make good on that count, we must slow as we approach normal. For this reason, and\nto make good on my promise of making normalization as boring as watching paint dry, my colleagues\nand I will start our discussions on how to slow the balance sheet reduction at the March FOMC meeting.\nWhether it be with the balance sheet or the policy rate, the overriding concern is to get everything right\nat the right time because the economy continues to hum along.\nGDP growth continues to be strong.\nWhile the labor market continues to post strong monthly gains and unemployment remains near historic\nlows, we are also seeing multiple signs that the labor market is coming into better balance, and the very\ntight conditions that characterized the immediate post-pandemic period are easing. The latest data\nshow that the ratio of openings to unemployment continues to back down closer to its pre-pandemic\nreadings. Labor force participation improved in the last year — and this is especially important since the\nlinchpin to any growing economy is an active labor force. Wage inflation has also moderated\nsubstantially.\nBut at the same time, we are not experiencing widespread layoffs. Yes, certain sectors are readjusting\ntheir workforces, most notably the tech sector, but there are not economy-wide layoffs that would\nsuggest some recessionary forces are fighting their way to the forefront. Again, this is a good thing.\nConsumer spending also continues to remain strong. Moreover, the University of Michigan’s Index of\nConsumer Sentiment reported its highest level in two-and-a-half years — and consumer expectations\nfor future inflation have come down.\nThis is a promising signal and one that we will be looking at closely in other areas of the economy as it\nhas largely been the American consumer who has kept on the path of achieving an economic soft\nlanding. But on the flip side of this, I am somewhat concerned about the increase of delinquencies in\n4\n\ncredit card and other loan repayments, especially among younger borrowers and families on the lower\nend of the income ladder.\nThis picture being painted by the hard data is also backed up by what I am hearing from contacts\nthroughout the Third District; this is the soft data upon which I place a great amount of importance\nbecause it’s the real-time check that I need in my own decision-making.\nWhen it comes to consumers, I heard months ago that they continued to spend, though they have been\nswitching to other brands to find better deals and putting more on their credit cards, rather than just\nclosing their wallets.\nAnd from employers, I’ve been hearing that while they are still hiring, they are now looking for workers\nwith more specific and necessary skill sets. As for the workers they’ve already hired, well, they’re going\nto do what they can to hold on to them.\nThis sentiment is backed by the survey data in the latest Manufacturing Business Outlook Survey, or\nMBOS, conducted by the Philadelphia Fed in which firms in the Third District reported a six-month\nexpectation for steady employment. Employers may be looking to alter hours or making other\narrangements so that things work for their operations, but the hiring free-for-all that we experienced in\nthe inflationary run-up is over while we do not see any drastic adjustments to payrolls.\nAnother MBOS data point that gives me confidence is the trend of the index for prices paid for inputs,\nwhich, though it has jumped a little from time to time, has been on a marked downward trend since late\n2021. Moreover, in a specific special question asked for the January survey regarding price expectations\nfor the upcoming year, the average expected change in costs was below the rate that they reported\nexperiencing in 2023.\nSo, where does all this leave us? I’ll go back to my initial statement. I do believe we may be near the\npoint where we can adjust the policy rate downward. But when we will actually arrive at that point, I\ncannot yet say.\n5\n\nAnd just to note, I don’t have a vote on the FOMC this year, but I still have a voice in our policy\ndiscussions and intend to use it.\nJust like last summer, when I was a voting member of the FOMC and I signaled my belief early that it\nwas time to hold rates steady, I will signal my belief that we’re ready for a rate decrease when all the\ndata — both the hard and the soft — give me that signal.\nThe American economy is, to put it mildly, a dynamic engine. And right now, this engine is the strongest\nof any in the entire world. And though we’ve been bounced around by inflation’s potholes, our careful\nand steady approach to monetary policy has kept the engine running smoothly and the tires of our\neconomy on the ground. Our actions thus far have seen us progress to our destination without the\nbroader economy sliding into a roadside ditch.\nBut obviously, we can’t take our eyes off the road. We want to get to our destination without any\nwarning lights going off or tires going flat. And at this moment, the indications are that we can do that\n— but only if we stay focused and controlled with our hands on the wheel. We can’t go too heavy on the\ngas too soon, lest we lose control or pass our exit completely and have to reroute.\nSo, to end where I began, what a difference a year makes. It has been a year of progress. And as we\ncontinue moving deeper into 2024, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia will remain a partner in the\ncontinued economic progress of our region and our nation.\nThank you very much.\n6",

    "text": "The Economy, Inflation,\nand Monetary Policy\nRisk Management Association — Philadelphia Chapter\nPhiladelphia, PA\nNovember 10, 2022\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nThe Economy, Inflation, and Monetary Policy\nRisk Management Association — Philadelphia Chapter\nPhiladelphia, PA\nNovember 10, 2022\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood morning! It’s great to see you all in person after two years of virtual meetings. While clicking a\nZoom link is, admittedly, a little bit easier than fighting traffic or dealing with transit, there’s something\nundeniably invigorating about being back together physically. So thanks so much for joining us.\nI’m eager to take your questions, so please use the Slido code indicated on the screen behind me. But\nbefore we get to the open discussion, I’d like to take a few minutes to discuss the state of the national\nand regional economy, inflation, and path of monetary policy.\nBut before I do that, I need to give you the standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my\nown and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)\nor in the Federal Reserve System.\nThe Economy\nLet’s begin with the national economy, where there are signs that activity is decelerating. Credit card\npurchase data indicate that consumer spending, which comprises around 70 percent of economic\nactivity in the United States, is slowing, with services and retail leading the decline. Investment in\nhousing has weakened, and even the boom in manufacturing, which has buoyed the economy, is\nstarting to wane.\nAfter two negative quarters of GDP growth to start the year, the third quarter saw growth of 2.6\npercent, and that was largely due to strong exports. In sum, the reopening boom we experienced as\nbusinesses came back to life after a pandemic-induced hibernation appears to be pretty much over.\n1\n\nThere is one glaring exception to this rather lackluster data set: employment. The job market continues\nto run extremely hot. The national unemployment rate is 3.7 percent, and we still have more than 10\nmillion unfilled jobs. All of which is to say, one economic category has certainly not suffered even as\nother sectors have slowed: Help Wanted signs.\nRegionally, there are signs of weakness as well, though as with the national economy, employment\nremains robust.\nThe Philadelphia Fed’s Manufacturing Business Outlook Survey is in negative territory, meaning that\nrespondents are pessimistic regarding the economic environment six months from now. Importantly,\nhowever, shipments remain in positive territory as firms work off sizable order backlogs piled up during\nthe pandemic. In residential real estate, activity has flattened after a huge boom, and we are seeing\nmore prices being reduced for home listings.\nIt also appears that central business districts in our region are going to endure lighter foot traffic in the\nforeseeable future. Employers who have called their workers back to their offices are in many cases\noffering hybrid schedules, and the data reflect this. This trend tends to be more pronounced in our\nregion than nationally. We can see this most clearly in mobility statistics, which indicate time in\nworkplaces is down 20 percent nationally and 30 percent in Philadelphia. For public transit, the drop-off\nis even more stark, with time in transit stations down 20 percent nationally and 45 percent in\nPhiladelphia.\nInflation\nNow to inflation, which remains far, far too high.\nThis is a period of tremendous hardship for Americans, particularly those of low or moderate income.\nWe’re seeing huge demand at food banks — and it’s coming, in many cases, from people who are\nworking full-time. Our contacts in the banking industry are telling us that more families are taking on\nunsecured debt to meet daily expenses.\nThe Federal Reserve’s long-range target is 2 percent annualized inflation, and right now, annualized PCE\ninflation, including food and energy, stands at 6.2 percent. Prices were up 0.3 percent in September\nfrom just a month before. Moreover, inflation is widespread throughout the economy. While initially,\nprice hikes were limited to just a few items like used cars, we’re now seeing rapid rises in prices on\neverything from new vehicles and dishwashers to life’s essentials, like food, health care, and rent.\n2\n\nMore broadly, we can’t have a well-functioning economy with high inflation, particularly if high inflation\nexpectations get embedded. To make the economy as efficient in the long run as we can, we have to get\non top of inflation.\nTo solve our inflation problem, we need to understand what has caused it. In this case, there is no\nsingular cause. It has instead been a confluence of events — essentially a “perfect storm.”\nA global pandemic, a war in Europe, and, yes, fiscal and monetary policy decisions have combined to\nlimit supply and boost demand. The result has been inflation running at 40-year highs.\nWe are committed to bringing down inflation.\nLet’s begin with constraints on supply.\nThe events of the last few years have revealed the extraordinary fragility of global supply chains. If one\nship, stuck in one canal, could ground global logistics to a halt for days, imagine the effect of a multiyear\nglobal pandemic.\nIn fact, we don’t need to imagine it: COVID-19 lockdowns have badly damaged supply chains. We all\nknow about semiconductor shortages, which have limited supplies of everything from new cars to\nwashing machines. These shortages persist, owing largely to China’s Zero-COVID policy. But the\npandemic has wrought shortages in more obscure items. A major auto company for instance, is having a\nhard time securing enough of its trademark emblems. That has slowed shipments of new vehicles.\nRussia’s horrific invasion of Ukraine further choked supply.\nAfter Vladimir Putin’s forces invaded Ukraine, shipments of grain and fertilizer fell, pushing up food\nprices. And the decline in Russia’s energy exports has helped fuel the rise in energy prices causing an\nenergy crisis in Europe and the U.K. Gasoline prices spiked here, fell a bit, and are now back up again.\nOPEC Plus has further compounded our problems by announcing it will cut production, even in the face\nof elevated prices. We know that gas prices are incredibly important to consumers and responsible for\nmuch of the decline in consumer sentiment.\nCertain U.S. government policies have contributed to our supply-side issues. While I remain neutral on\nthe overall wisdom of each of these policies, their effect on supply is undeniable. The federal\ngovernment applies tariffs on everything from Chinese-made televisions to Canadian lumber. Our\nimmigration policy, such as it is, has resulted in a more than two-year pause in legal immigration. This\n3\n\nhas certainly contributed to labor shortages; we have about 2½ million fewer workers than we would\nhave had, if we had remained on trend.\nAll of these supply constraints have been accompanied by robust demand. For one, as I indicated earlier,\nour labor market remains hot. That means Americans are earning paychecks, even if their relative value\nis declining because of inflation.\nNot surprisingly, low unemployment rates have produced significant upward pressure on wages. In\nmany regions, smaller employers with thin margins are having a hard time filling entry-level positions.\nWe’ve heard from community bankers who can’t compete with larger banks for jobs like tellers. In\ntourist regions like the Poconos and the Jersey Shore, local businesses had a great summer in terms of\nsales, but they had a very hard time staying staffed. That’s partially because of higher salary demands,\nbut also because housing has become so expensive in those areas that workers can’t afford to live there.\nFiscal policy has added to demand. The federal government pumped around $6 trillion into American\nhouseholds during the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, the amount of fiscal support\nprovided by the federal government was significantly larger than the aggregate decline in GDP triggered\nby the pandemic in the first place.\nGovernment aid was dispersed in a largely untargeted fashion. For instance, mortgage forbearance and\nstudent loan forbearance were both offered to any borrowers, no questions asked, and in the case of\nstudent loans, applied automatically. Recall why these policies were enacted; we were in the middle of a\nfull-blown panic, and the federal government needed to get money out the door. But it’s clear that\npolicies like these contributed to high levels of demand. If you don’t have to pay your mortgage for a\nyear, you have a lot more money to spend on other goods and services.\nMonetary Policy\nAnd finally, expansive monetary policy — that’s us — kept the cost of capital low for long.\nThroughout most of the COVID-19 pandemic, we kept rates near zero and enacted a major asset-buying\nprogram. These policies stoked demand, which they were designed to do.\nAs a central bank, the Federal Reserve can do little to affect the supply constraints pushing up inflation.\nAnd as I have indicated, those problems, unfortunately, will take time to resolve.\n4\n\nBut the Federal Reserve can absolutely affect demand, and that is what we are doing. We want to see\ninflation coming down steadily and consistently, and we also want to see it abating across a wide array\nof goods and services. The goal is to adjust conditions so that demand better matches supply.\nWe have two primary tools for implementing monetary policy: the federal funds rate — usually just\nthought of as interest rates — and our balance sheet.\nSince last fall, we have been tightening financial conditions. That process, at least as the market\ninterpreted it, started last September, even before we began to move the federal funds rate or taper\nour asset purchases. Instead, simply announcing that we would soon begin to taper our asset purchases\ncaused two-year Treasury yields to rise.\nThe taper began in earnest last November and is now complete. In fact, we are now reducing our\nbalance sheet. We are shedding $60 billion in Treasuries and $35 billion of agency debt and mortgage-\nbacked securities each month. Which is to say, we are removing a significant amount of financial\naccommodation quite rapidly.\nWe have also raised the federal funds rate 375 basis points since the start of the year. Granted, we\nstarted from zero, but we have raised rates significantly — and very quickly.\nIn the upcoming months, in light of the cumulative tightening we have achieved, I expect we will slow\nthe pace of our rate hikes as we approach a sufficiently restrictive stance. But I want to be clear: A rate\nhike of 50 basis points would still be significant. Since 1983, the FOMC has increased the target a total of\n88 times, and of those, 75 of the hikes were less than 50 basis points.\nAt some point next year, I expect we will hold at a restrictive rate for a while to let monetary policy do\nits work. It will take a while for the higher cost of capital to work its way through the economy.\nAfter that, if we have to, we can always tighten further, based on the data. But we should let the system\nwork itself out. And we also need to recognize that this will take time: Inflation is known to shoot up like\na rocket and then come down like a feather.\nAbove all, I want to stress that we must remain data dependent and flexible on policy. What we really\nneed to see is a sustained decline in a number of inflation indicators before we let up on tightening\nmonetary policy. And again, we need to make sure inflation expectations don’t become unanchored.\n5\n\nSo what does all of this mean for the economy? I expect that economic growth will moderate this year\nas both inflation and tightening financial conditions begin to crimp consumption. Overall, I forecast flat\nGDP growth for 2022, 1.5 percent growth in 2023, and around 2 percent growth in 2024.\nInflation will come down, but it will take some time to get to our target. I expect core PCE inflation to\ncome in around 4.8 percent in 2022, around 3.5 percent next year, and 2.5 percent in 2024.\nTurning to the job market, the unemployment rate should peak next year at 4.5 percent as financial\nconditions bite. It should then fall to 4 percent in 2024, which suggests that even as we tighten\nmonetary policy, labor markets will stay quite healthy. We’ve heard from contacts in manufacturing\nthat, given how hard they have worked to staff up, they will be extremely reluctant to cut jobs even as\nthe economy slows.\nThat gives me confidence that we can bring inflation under control without doing unnecessary damage\nto the labor market. Our resolve is strong, and our goal of stable prices and maximum employment is\nachievable.\nThanks so much for being here. I really appreciate the important work that RMA does in our region. Now\nlet’s open things up for questions.\n6",

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nThe Economic Outlook for Delaware and the Nation Amid COVID-19\nDelaware State Chamber of Commerce\nWilmington, DE (via conference call)\nMay 12, 2020\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood morning. As you probably know, I used to be the president of the University of Delaware, so it’s\ngreat to be back! At least virtually …\nBefore we begin, let me dispense with the usual Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own\nand do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or in the\nFederal Reserve System.\nIt’s no secret that we find ourselves in the midst of a crisis like none of us have experienced in our\nlifetimes. The coronavirus that arrived on our shores just a few months ago has already killed tens of\nthousands of Americans, ended a years-long streak of solid economic growth, and caused tens of\nmillions of our fellow citizens to lose their jobs.\nIt’s amazing to think how different my remarks would have been had I given them just two months ago.\nThe coronavirus is above all a public health crisis and the Federal Reserve as an institution — and me\npersonally — can’t say enough to adequately convey our gratitude toward America’s health-care\nworkers, as well as other frontline workers like police, grocery-store workers, truck drivers, and\ninnumerable others who are risking their own health for the well-being of the country.\nQuantifying the Downturn Nationally and in Delaware\nThe economic ramifications of this crisis, of course, have been stark as well.\nPerhaps most notable has been a collapse in most forms of consumer spending, a component of GDP\nthat accounts for about 70 percent of our country’s economic activity.\n1\n\nIn March, we experienced a literally unprecedented 7.5 percent fall in consumer spending, and April\ndata will surely be even worse. In the same month, manufacturing output fell to levels not seen since\n2011. And data from the Institute for Supply Management showed a stark contraction for April as well.\nFalling spending and output are reflected in the national unemployment rate, which now stands at 14.7\npercent. Delaware has suffered along with the rest of the country. Between March 21 and May 2, nearly\n100,000 Delaware residents filed for unemployment — in one week alone, 21,600 did. By contrast,\nbefore the onset of the crisis, weekly applications for unemployment in Delaware came in between 500\nand 600.\nJob losses in Delaware have been heavily concentrated in accommodations and food services, though\nthere has also been a slight decline in manufacturing employment. Banking and finance jobs, crucial in\nDelaware, have held up fairly well — in stark contrast to the last recession, which began, after all, with a\nfinancial crisis.\nIt’s notable the economic slowdown, particularly on the consumer side, was observable even before\nstates like Delaware took serious action to curtail the spread of the virus. That strongly suggests that the\ncoronavirus itself, and not just government policies designed to mitigate it, are harming the economy.\nBefore states and cities started imposing lockdowns and shutting down businesses that they deemed\nnonessential, data show the cutbacks in spending: Airline bookings were collapsing and foot traffic into\nrestaurants had already begun a steep decline, for instance. Consumers were voting with their feet — or\nat least with their wallets.\nThe point is this: Until the virus itself is under control, even as more states gradually open up, we can\nexpect the economy to underperform relative to where it was just a couple of months ago.\nFederal Reserve Actions\nDoes that mean we should simply sit on our hands until effective therapies, or a vaccine, emerges? Of\ncourse not. And as you probably know, our institution, the Federal Reserve, has taken bold action to\nhelp deal with the economic consequences of what is fundamentally a public health crisis.\nAt the Federal Reserve, we have essentially found ourselves in the role of firefighter — and we’ve\npoured water on the fire. But we want to avoid damaging the underlying infrastructure of what just a\nfew months ago was a very healthy economy. Our goal is to use our vast lending powers to maintain our\n2\n\nunderlying economic infrastructure by making sure that every sector of the economy has access to\nliquidity.\nWe have, first and foremost, acted by lowering our policy interest rate to near zero — and we expect to\nkeep it there for some time.\nWe’ve also taken a number of actions to keep credit flowing. Beginning in March, as the depths of the\ncrisis became apparent, we started buying large amounts of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed\nsecurities to prevent credit markets from seizing up. The markets have largely stabilized, and we’ve now\nslowed the rate of those purchases.\nWe’re also focusing on using all of our available tools to get loans directly into the hands of those who\nneed them most.\nTo do that, we’re going to be buying bonds from cities and states, most of whose sales tax revenues\nhave tanked along with consumer spending. This program, called the Municipal Liquidity Facility, will\nprovide essential liquidity to local governments as they fight the pandemic.\nWe’ve also set up what we’re calling our Main Street Lending facility. The goal here is to get cash in the\nhands of small- to medium-sized businesses whose operations have been hampered by the virus. These\nbusinesses tend to be the economic lifeblood of their local communities, and this lending facility is\ndesigned to forestall mass closures of small and medium-sized businesses on Main Streets across the\ncountry.\nThe Federal Reserve is also bolstering the Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program\nby supplying liquidity to financial institutions that are issuing loans to those crucial businesses.\nWe know that this crisis is severely harming the nonprofit sector as well. As a recovering academic and\nuniversity president myself, I’m acutely aware of the stress this crisis is inflicting on, for instance, the\nhigher education sector.\nThe Federal Reserve is thinking carefully about setting up facilities that can provide direct lending to\ncolleges, universities, and nonprofit medical institutions. This is crucial for Delaware because “eds and\nmeds” are vitally important to the state’s economy. Now, 17.4 percent of Delaware workers are\nemployed in the sector, more than even work in professional and business services.\nI want to be clear. We’re not in 2009 anymore and this is not quantitative easing 2.0.\n3\n\nThe principle behind quantitative easing was that people weren’t engaging in investments because the\ncost of capital was too high.\nThat is simply not the case now. The reason people aren’t engaging economically is the health crisis.\nI also want to be clear that these facilities — as well as the actions that have been taken on the fiscal\nside, especially the CARES Act that Congress passed a few weeks ago — are not economic stimulus.\nOur facilities, instead, are a form of emergency relief — of insurance. We’re doing everything we can to\nhelp people get through a really painful time.\nLooking to the Future\nSo, now the $64,000, or perhaps the $22 trillion, question. What happens next economically?\nThe second quarter data will be brutally painful as a result of both the virus and the government-\nmandated economic shutdown. Take your pick of bad, really bad, or really, really bad.\nWhat happens after that to a large extent depends on how the virus moves through our society, and our\nreaction to it in terms of balancing stay-at-home policies versus an intelligent — and I want to stress,\nintelligent — reopening.\nThere are multiple scenarios as to how this plays out. But here are just two to consider: In the more\noptimistic scenario, the economy largely opens in June, we have technology in place to contain the\nspread of the virus, and there is no second wave in the fall.\nIn that scenario, I would expect a severe contraction in GDP in the second quarter followed by a\nsignificant rebound in the second half. However, the second half rebound is not enough to fully offset\nthe contraction in Q1 and Q2; 2021 would then show above-trend annual GDP growth.\nThe less optimistic scenario is that we open too quickly and see a significant second wave of the virus.\nNot only would this be a health catastrophe, but it would reverse the recovery as well.\nIn this less hopeful scenario, I project a similar growth path to the baseline for 2020, followed by a\npainful economic contraction of GDP in 2021 as shutdowns are reintroduced.\nLonger term, of course, there will be a recovery. But I also want to stress that it might be an uneven one.\nThere’s an old saying that a rising tide lifts all boats. But that might not apply here.\n4\n\nManufacturers of durable goods, for instance, should come back quickly.\nOne large manufacturer in our District who temporarily halted operations reports that orders\nthemselves never evaporated — they were simply delayed as virus mitigation measures took effect. But\nas Delaware and other states slowly and intelligently reopen, I think we can expect manufacturing\noutput to quickly bounce back.\nTravel and hospitality, on the other hand, may be in for a longer and more painful contraction.\nBusinesses may have enough experience teleconferencing instead of holding physical meetings that they\nmay decide to cut back on corporate travel. Families may choose to avoid crowded spots like\namusement parks, cruise ships, and packed Eastern Shore beaches. The knock-on effects to airlines,\nhotels, and restaurants that cater to travelers could be severe and long lasting. That, unfortunately, is\nbad news for southern Delaware, particularly Sussex and Kent counties, both of which rely heavily on\ntourism.\nDelaware, with its large port in Wilmington, is also exposed to the vicissitudes of the global economy.\nThat was already visible in March’s data, where the total value of exports from the state totaled $335.5\nmillion. That sounds like a lot except when you consider that in March 2019, the figure stood at a high of\n$711.8 million. A pickup in export values is dependent on economies in Europe, Asia, and elsewhere\nonce again showing growth. But that too depends on how those countries manage the coronavirus and\nits economic fallout.\nCommercial real estate could also be in for a rough stretch. Companies may find that working from\nhome isn’t so bad after all and reduce physical office space. There is also a strong possibility that many\nhotels and restaurants will never reopen. There will probably be retailers, big and small, that also\nshutter permanently.\nIn the long term, the uneven recovery will present a risk to our banking sector, which is heavily exposed\nto sectors like commercial real estate. The good news is we went into this crisis with a well-capitalized\nregulated financial system. But I want to urge banks to retain capital as we prepare to enter a tough\nperiod. In my personal opinion, they probably shouldn’t be issuing large dividends at the moment.\nI want to close by mentioning a subject dear to my heart: diners!\nNear my house up here in South Jersey there’s a diner that, just a few days after restaurants were shut\ndown here, quickly turned into a full-service grocery store.\n5\n\nNow, perhaps this only demonstrates the ingenuity of the South Jersey diner sector. And I’ll admit I’m\nbiased on that score …\nBut I also think it underlines Americans’ boundless ability to adapt — to retool when the times call for it.\nI’m sure that we will get through this.\n6",

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the FOMC.\n\nAn Economic Outlook\nMain Line Chamber of Commerce\nJanuary 12, 2017\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nIntroduction\nGood morning; it’s a pleasure to be here. This is my first public speech since we raised rates in\nDecember as well as my first as a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC). I’m trying not to take it personally that people seem to find my opinions much more\ninteresting nowadays.\nToday, I’d like to give an overview of the economy, talk about the implications for monetary\npolicy, and explore some of the issues affecting the region — particularly workforce\ndevelopment.\nBefore I start, however, I should add the usual disclaimer that the views expressed today are\nmine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\nGrowth\nThe headline is that things are looking pretty good, or as I should say as a policy wonk: “The\neconomy is displaying considerable strength.” Gross Domestic Product continued to grow in the\nthird quarter at an even faster pace than in Q2. Third-quarter growth was recently revised up to\n3.5 percent. That was driven largely by consumption.\nConsumer confidence is strong, retail sales are still solid — though slightly slower than\npreviously anticipated — and equity markets are up.\nThe New Orders Index, though positive, fell slightly in December, though the Regional Business\nActivity Index increased sharply.\nAll in all, the snapshot is of a robust American economy.\nPage 2 of 7\n\nInflation\nAs you know, the Fed has a dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability. In its\nsimplest terms, that means that most people can find a job if they’re looking, and inflation stays\nlow and stable.\nStarting with inflation, we aim for an average of 2 percent. A little higher or a little lower from\ntime to time is not something to worry about. We don’t need to be exactly at 2 percent all the\ntime. We’re looking for an average over the medium term.\nPeople sometimes assume that the Fed worries more about inflation being too high than too low.\nBut we give equal weight to the distance from our goal regardless of the direction. Over the past\nfew years, inflation has been below target. That’s the main reason interest rates have been so low\nfor so long. We’re starting to see some upward movement in the price index for personal\nconsumption expenditures, which excludes food and energy. This is a long name for the Fed’s\npreferred inflation measure. Most economists simply call it “the core PCE,” and it has increased\nto 1.7 percent, near our target.\nI know the joke is that Fed policymakers must not eat or drive, because we prefer the core\nmeasure. But we’re looking for underlying trends and stripping out those volatile components\ngives us a better read. That said, the yearly growth in the headline PCE index has also increased,\nrising to 1.0 percent in the third quarter of 2016, from 0.3 percent a year earlier.\nAdditionally, inflation expectations are starting to rally around the 2 percent goal. One important\nfacet of economics is that expectations can play a role in outcomes, particularly in inflation. It’s\nsomething of a monetary self-fulfilling prophecy. If markets believe inflation will remain low,\nit’s more likely to do so. And over the past few years, not everyone was on the same page with\ntheir predictions. But as expectations consolidate around our target rate, it makes it more likely\nthat our target will become reality.\nLooking at all the information and the trends over the past few years, I see inflation on course to\nmeet our target sometime this year or next.\nLabor market\nOn the employment side of things, we’re doing very well. We had another month of solid gains\nin December, with the economy adding 156,000 jobs. That’s an average of 165,000 over the last\nquarter of 2016.\nThe unemployment rate remains low at 4.7 percent, which is at, or below what most economists\nbelieve is its natural rate of about 5 percent. The natural rate is the rate that we expect in a\nhealthy economy. Unemployment is never zero, because people will always move from job to\njob, and we add new people to the workforce every day.\nPage 3 of 7\n\nOf course, we don’t just look at the headline unemployment rate. And it should be noted that\njoblessness hits some portions of the population worse than other demographics. For instance,\nthe unemployment rate for African-American males was 8.6 percent in December, almost four\npercentage points higher than the average for the entire adult population.\nThere’s also a lot of talk about hidden pockets of unemployment, with particular concern that\npeople may have dropped out of the labor market entirely, out of frustration. But even the\nbroadest measure of unemployment has declined. That’s the U6 measure, which takes into\naccount people who aren’t currently looking for a job but say they want one and people who are\nworking part-time but would like to be full-time. That rate has dropped to 9.2 percent. While\nthat’s still higher than headline unemployment, it’s worth noting that U6 peaked at about 17\npercent during the worst of the recession and its aftermath.\nDemand for labor also remains strong and more people are quitting their jobs. That’s good news\nfor the economy — it shows workers are more confident they can find another one — though I\nsuppose some overworked HR managers might not be 100 percent thrilled about it.\nLayoffs also remain at all-time lows and job postings are near historical peaks. We continue to\nhear from our business contacts that finding workers, especially in certain occupations, is getting\nprogressively more difficult.\nTaking all these factors into account, it’s safe to call the U.S. labor market more or less at full\nhealth.\nYou’ll note my previous remarks referred to the economy as a whole. Things aren’t evenly\ndistributed across this huge and diverse country. We’re in Pennsylvania and things are different\nhere. The state’s unemployment rate has been higher than the national average, though it finally\nedged down in November, from 5.8 percent in October to 5.7 percent. That’s the first decrease\nsince January of last year.\nEmployment growth has been slower as well: While the country has experienced a rate of 1.7\npercent in job growth, we’ve seen a rate of just 0.6 percent.\nI point this out in part because this is when I get to praise the structure of the Federal Reserve\nSystem. I think it’s uniquely American to have a decentralized central bank. To have a structure\nthat makes policy for a huge and incredibly varied economy, but takes into account the\ndifferences between regions. We know that the economic fortunes of Camden don’t look like\nthose of Seattle. And when the FOMC comes together, the presidents of the 12 banks get to be a\nvoice for their communities and businesses.\nI also mention it because I’m interested to hear your take on the employment situation in the area\nand the state. How are you faring? Something I’ve heard over and over again from businesses of\nPage 4 of 7\n\nall sizes is that they have the jobs; they just can’t find the people. There seems to be a skills void\nthat can’t be filled by the existing workforce.\nMy staff recently conducted a study on what they call “opportunity occupations.” These are jobs\nthat pay at or above the national median income, but that don’t require a traditional four-year\ndegree. They make up close to 30 percent of the job market nationally. If we reconsider the way\nwe are training people and further promote the occupations that require special skills, but not a\ntraditional bachelor’s degree, we can start to maximize the potential of our workforce. Let’s stop\ntrying to make post-secondary education “one-size-fits-all” when our job needs and workforce\nare so varied.\nThis is something that I think and talk a lot about. I’m a son of the district and an unapologetic\ncheerleader for it. I’m invested, not just as the president of the Philadelphia Fed, but as someone\nwho sees the great potential of this region. I want to see us become a destination for business,\nand that means making the best use of our greatest resource: Our people.\nI should be clear that I don’t have the power to change any policy or enact any law that can bring\nthat kind of investment. But I can make the economic case to the people who do. We need to\nattract talent, train the people we have, and make the tristate area a top destination, in part by\noffering a world-class workforce.\nIt’s Peter Drucker 101: Play to your strengths. I always tell people that the best business advice I\nhave is: Make yourself invaluable. I’d offer the same advice to any city or region looking to\nbecome a business destination.\nLabor Force Participation Rate\nI will also note that despite positive overall trends in the labor market, the participation rate is\nlower than I’d like.\nThe labor force participation rate is a fairly basic calculation. It divides the workforce — those\nemployed plus those looking for work — by the population over the age of 16. That does not\ninclude people who’ve taken themselves out of the labor force.\nThe participation rate has been declining over the years, and it plummeted in the aftermath of the\ncrisis and recession, which is what we would expect. Recessions cause dips in the participation\nrate, and it tends to rebound as the economy does. But over the past six years, the rate hasn’t\nrisen back up as much as we might have thought. We can explain a number of reasons for this,\nbut later on I will talk of one trend that’s something of a mystery.\nA portion of the drop is that we simply can’t meet historical surges. In the 60s and 70s, as\nwomen entered the workforce in greater numbers, the rate surged. But we no longer have a large,\nuntapped portion of the population that can offer the same boost. So, we have to readjust\nexpectations somewhat.\nPage 5 of 7\n\nAnother contributing factor is lifestyle fit: Fewer high school and college students are working\nwhile they’re in school, and some people have decided that they’re content to have single-\nincome households.\nThen there is the big one: Demographics. The initial wave of the baby boom generation has\nstarted to retire. As the boomers exit the workforce, they’re not being replaced in the same\nnumbers. Not to mention, we’re living longer, so the share of people on the retirement end is\neven larger. This is the overwhelming factor affecting participation, and I’ll return to it shortly.\nFirst, however, the mystery of the missing prime-aged males: This very unfairly named group\nconsists of men aged 25 to 54. For reasons that we’re not quite sure of, their participation has\nbeen dropping. In 1954, the rate for all males was 98 percent, compared to 88 percent today.1\nThis makes for one of the lowest participation rates for prime-age males among developed\ncountries, and one of the most rapid declines.\nAgain, the impact has not been felt evenly. Among prime-age African-American men, the\nparticipation rate has fallen from 91 percent in 1972 — the oldest data available — to 80.3\npercent today.\nThere are some troubling features of this decline among all men. The first is that dropping out\nseems to be a persistent state. The majority of men who report not working in any given month\nhadn’t worked in the previous year either. The second is that this demographic, when working,\nadds to overall productivity, so the economy feels their loss when they are out of the workplace.\nI do want to reiterate that the group we’re talking about is men who are out of the labor force.\nFor prime-age males in the workforce, the unemployment rate is low, and the U.S. fares a lot\nbetter than our counterparts.\nAs I said, we don’t really know why this is happening to any degree of certainty. It could be that\nmen participate in the workforce more intensively in their thirties and forties, so it’s reasonable\nto assume the ageing population is playing a role. But when we analyze the data, it turns out that\nnonparticipation goes up as the age goes down. That is, the younger the age group, the more\nlikely they are to be out of the workforce. The data also show that participation rates follow\neducational attainment.\nThe consequences for this group’s lack of participation are severe, both for them and the\neconomy. Around one-third of nonparticipants live below the federal poverty line. Most get by\non government assistance or financial support from spouses or other family members.\n1 Council of Economic Advisors, June 2014. “The Long-Term Decline in Prime-Age Male Labor Force\nParticipation,” June 2014, available at\nwww.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/page/files/20160620_cea_primeage_male_lfp.pdf (last accessed January 9,\n2017).\nPage 6 of 7\n\nFor the rest of us, a lower participation rate all-around means lower productivity, which means\nlower growth.\nIt’s essential to have a robust workforce. Research by my staff shows that, due to demographics\nand the retiring baby boomers, they don’t think the low participation trend will reverse. In fact,\nthey project labor force participation could drop up to 2 percentage points further over the next\nfive years.2 That’s from where we stand now at 62.7 percent.\nMonetary Policy\nSo, what does this all mean for monetary policy? After December’s meeting, that makes a brisk\naverage of one 25-basis-point hike per year for the last two years. But I see three modest hikes as\nappropriate for the coming year, assuming the economy stays on track. Fed policymakers enjoy\nsaying we’re data-dependent and this is an area where that rings especially true.\nI’ve said it before, and it’s worth repeating, that monetary policy is a fairly limited set of tools\nwith a fairly limited reach. We will respond to changes in the economy with moves in the federal\nfunds rate, and we can do a very good job of creating the conditions that are consistent with\neconomic growth. But the kinds of policies that will deliver that growth — employment\nprograms, development, taxation, and trade policy — is up to elected officials at the local, state,\nand national levels.\nConclusion\nAll in all, things are looking good. The labor market is strong and we’re creating jobs at a good\npace. The drop in labor force participation must be addressed, but that will take legislative\naction. Inflation is moving back up to our 2 percent goal, and growth is solid. We’re starting\n2017 off on a good foot.\n2 Fujita, Shigeru. “On the Causes of Declines in the Labor Force Participation Rate,” Research Rap Special Report,\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia (February 2014), available at www.philadelphiafed.org/-/media/research-and-\ndata/publications/research-rap/2014/on-the-causes-of-declines-in-the-labor-force-participation-rate.pdf?la=en.\nPage 7 of 7",

    "text": "A Brief History of the Fed Universe\nGreater Vineland Chamber of Commerce\nVineland, NJ\nApril 17, 2019\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nA Brief History of the Fed Universe\nGreater Vineland Chamber of Commerce\nVineland, NJ\nApril 17, 2019\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nBefore I begin, I’d like to do two things.\nFirst, I want to congratulate the Chamber on its centennial year — happy anniversary.\nSecond, I want to address the elephant in the room. It might be better to avoid such a divisive\nsubject in these polarized times, but I think it’s better to face controversy head-on. So I venture\nin, bravely posing the question: Is Vineland the dandelion capital of the country or the egg\ncapital?\nThis has been a subject of internal debate at the Philadelphia Fed for weeks now, and Wikipedia\nsupports both camps.\nSo please, by a show of hands, help us start the healing: dandelion or egg?\nNow that that’s settled, I’ll turn to something almost as important: the economy.\nAt an event like this, I’d normally give an economic update and discuss what that means for my\npolicy outlook, and I intend to do that. But I’ve also been asked to give a Fed primer for anyone\nwho’s not 100 percent familiar with the history and functions of the Federal Reserve. If you\ncount yourself among them, you’re in very good company. It can be a byzantine and\ncomplicated system, and I remember being surprised, as a newly minted member of the board\nof directors, at the scope of the Fed’s work — it’s more than just interest rates.\n1\n\nWith that in mind, I’ll give a quick intro to how the Federal Reserve came to be and what it is\nwe do, then give the requisite outlook with some added context.\nAnd I will start with the most important aspect of Fed history and tradition, which is the\nstandard disclaimer: The views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect\nthose of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\nThe Federal Reserve System\nWith that done, a brief history. It’s probably safe to say that a central bank like the Federal\nReserve could only happen in America. That’s because its structure reflects a deep and long-\nstanding battle of ideological wills that are foundational to our national existence.\nThe Fed has only existed for a little over a century. Compare that with the Bank of England,\nwhich has been around since 1694, or the Riksbank, Sweden’s national bank, which was\nestablished a few decades before that. Of course, those were sovereign nations much earlier\nthan we were, but the Federal Reserve Act was passed in 1913 — not exactly the dawn of the\nrepublic. So why is that?\nWithout going too far down the historical rabbit hole, there were, in fact, attempts — and\nsuccesses — at central banking in the United States before the Fed. But their rise and fall\nreflected those competing ideological forces: On one side were those who wanted the stability\nand economic advantage wrought by a central bank, while the other housed those who\nfundamentally distrusted centralized power. This was at the heart of our founding: Federalism\nand Republicanism. Hamilton and Jefferson. Dandelion and egg.\nBefore the 20th century, we had two real central banking successes — both in Philadelphia, by\nthe way — which we imaginatively refer to as the First and Second Banks of the United States.\nBoth had 20-year charters when they were established, and both faced political climates that\nwere hostile to their renewal when the time came — which meant both were left to expire.\nThat philosophical tension never went away. But in the late 1800s, a series of booms and busts\nculminated in the Panic of 1907, and the need for a central bank became clear. The Federal\nReserve was born.\n2\n\nAgain, I will spare you the extensive details, but the important part is the result: a decentralized\ncentral bank. A compromise between those two underpinning viewpoints.\nAt its center is the Board of Governors in Washington D.C., which is where the Chair sits and is\nwhat most people think of when they hear “The Fed.” But there are also 12 District Banks\naround the country, each an independent entity with its own president and board of directors.\nPeople often ask what it’s like to work for Jay Powell, or Janet Yellen before him. But the thing\nis, I don’t. I work for our board and our District.\nThat unique Fed structure gives us a better view of the realities on the ground — the United\nStates is a vast and complicated economic machine, but it is fundamentally made up of a\ncollection of micro-economies across the cities, towns, and communities that blanket the\ncountry.\nThe regional Banks bring the viewpoints of our Districts when we meet in D.C. to formulate\nmonetary policy, which we do roughly every six weeks at the Federal Open Market Committee,\nor FOMC. Again, that local perspective is crucial, because we’re making policy at a national\nlevel, and the size and scope of the U.S. economy can flatten the peaks and valleys we see in\ndifferent areas.\nIn those meetings, we discuss monetary policy and, at the end, we vote. The governors are\npermanently in a voting position, as is the president of the New York Fed. The rest of us rotate\nin — I’m up in 2020, and despite the fact that you’d never know who’s in rotation until the last\n30 seconds of a two-day meeting, people will be a lot more interested in what I have to say\ncome January …\nCongress outlined a “dual mandate” of price stability and maximum employment for the\nFederal Reserve, which is again unusual for central banks, most of which focus solely on\ninflation. The Fed also regulates banks, processes payments, and conducts economic research.\nAnd — the part that never gets enough attention, in my opinion — we do research and work to\nhelp strengthen our local economies. As I said, each of the Banks are independent entities,\nwhich means we have the freedom to tailor our work to our own area’s needs. While all Feds\n3\n\nhave a community development function, each of us executes it in a different way. At the\nPhiladelphia Fed, we’ve created the Economic Growth & Mobility Project (EGMP), which\nfocuses on what we think are the three foundational aspects of economic mobility: job creation\n— that is, stable, well-paid jobs that lead to financial security; workforce development — that\nis, education and training for people to get those jobs; and infrastructure, which includes\neverything from housing to transportation to broadband.\nThe Fed can’t make grants or finance projects; it’s not in our congressional remit. What we can\ndo is bring people together and offer sound research. So with the EGMP, we’re forming\npartnerships around our District to help address systemic issues in what we call Research in\nAction Labs.\nThe first of those was in northeastern Pennsylvania, where they did have one of those three\npillars — a lot of jobs at fulfillment centers — but were struggling with another: infrastructure.\nThose centers are located outside of town, and the region was built like most of America in the\nlatter half of the 20th century: constructed to bring commuters from the suburbs and outskirts\ninto the city, not the other way around. So we worked with local partners, and they came up\nwith a collective set of solutions that worked for them — launching pilot programs, establishing\na council on equitable transit, and making transportation a priority in the area.\nThat part is crucial: The Fed can offer research, data, and support, but communities are the\nones that understand their own unique needs. Our job is to offer our research and convening\npower, and to share projects’ data and results with anyone who might benefit. We’ve already\nheard from communities that have issues similar to northeastern Pennsylvania, asking how they\ncan do something similar. Now that we’ve helped with the program, we can share a blueprint.\nDifferent Banks also sometimes specialize in particular research areas. Obviously, Dallas does a\nlot on energy markets. New York has a special focus on international financial markets. In\nPhiladelphia, our area of expertise is consumer credit: cards, household debt, student loans,\netc.\nSo that’s the Fed overview. We do a lot of things other than monetary policy.\n4\n\nFor instance, we use our research to share our economic outlooks.\nThe Outlook\nTurning to the first part of our mandate, “maximum employment” means, more or less, that if\nyou’re looking for a job, you can find one relatively easily. That comes with some caveats,\nincluding that it doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll find the job you want, and, obviously, this is\nnowhere near a technical term. In fact, somewhere, a cold shiver just ran down an economist’s\nspine … But by a colloquial measure, that’s what we mean.\nThe unemployment rate will never be zero. People naturally leave jobs and come in and out of\nthe labor force, and we expect some level of unemployment to reflect that. We think about a\nsort of happy medium, where jobs are available but not so abundant that it starts to put\nupward pressure on inflation; we refer to this as the “natural rate” of unemployment. It’s\nimportant to note that the natural rate is elusive – it’s more easily evaluated in the rearview\nmirror, and even then it’s not concrete enough for consensus, but we do have estimates. Most\neconomists currently put that measure somewhere around 4½ percent. So by contrast, the\ncurrent unemployment rate of 3.8 percent is relatively low. I actually see that rate moving\nfurther down this year — somewhere around the 3½ percent range — before edging back up a\nfew tenths of a percentage point.\nJob creation is another metric that garners a lot of attention, and the last two months’ data\ndefinitely made a few headlines. February’s initial number made headlines at 20,000 — though\nit’s now been revised up to 33,000 — because it was much lower than expected, and much,\nmuch lower than other months. March, on the other hand, was a robust 190,000 — which has\nbeen more or less the average number over the last half-year or so.\nThese numbers illustrate the persistent Fed mantra of data dependency. First, it’s important to\ntake a medium-term view, and not let one report or data series derail an outlook. Second, the\ndismal science is not exact. If you look at economic predictions from a year or two ago, a lot of\nthem had job creation slowing significantly by now — my own included. But the labor market\nhas shown remarkable strength, and its continued tightening has surprised a lot of experts. So\n5\n\nit’s important to be patient as the data roll in, and not jump to conclusions on the basis of one\nround — or even a generally agreed-upon prediction. We want the data to confirm it.\nTurning to price stability, the Fed has a goal of 2 percent inflation. That’s enough for the\neconomy to grow at a healthy pace without price changes causing discernable friction in the\neconomy.\nAfter several years of running persistently below our preferred 2 percent target, inflation finally\nstarted running about that rate. In recent months, it’s edged back down somewhat.\nI see inflation averaging slightly higher than 2 percent this year and next. Again, my focus is on\nthe medium-term average, and what I’m watching in particular is inflation’s trajectory — that\nis, not just its direction, but the speed at which it travels.\nAs with all things policy related, I’ll be driven by the data. In particular, I’m giving weight to core\ninflation for a better view of the fundamentals, as fluctuations in energy prices are likely to\naffect the headline metric.\nTurning finally to GDP, I see growth a bit above 2 percent for 2019, and around 2 percent next\nyear, which I see as trend.\nThat number is disappointing to a lot of people. But it’s important to remember that we’re on\ntrack for the longest economic expansion on record, and it’s coming in the context of very low\nunemployment and low and stable inflation. In that setting, continued steady growth is not\nwhat I’d call “disappointing.”\nThere are, of course, some risks to watch for, and I’m keeping an eye on global developments,\ngrowth abroad, and trade.\nAnother risk that’s been discussed is the yield curve, a part of which inverted last month. Again,\na primer for the uninitiated. The yield curve shows the difference between the return on bonds\nwith various lifespans — in general, shorter-term bonds tend to have lower returns while the\nlonger terms yield more. Economists refer to the premium on short-maturity Treasuries as “the\nmoney premium,” reflecting the idea that they have many of the features of money. The\n6\n\nnormal shorthand would be to say that they’re more liquid than long-term securities, but that\nmoney-like quality is something that investors are willing to pay for in the form of lower\nreturns.\nSo normally, there is an upward tilt to the yield curve. Long-term rates reflect expectations of\nfuture short-term rates; so if long-term rates fall below current short-term rates, it signals a\nmarket expectation that future rates will likely be lower than they are now — which happens\nwhen the economy gets weak and policymakers respond.\nTry saying that last sentence five times fast.\nWith the yield curve discussion laid out, there are some mitigating factors to consider, because\nwe’re looking at a very different economic playing field than we have in the past. The Fed’s\nbalance sheet is still historically large, which may be affecting long-term yields. And while\ninversions in the yield curve do appear to have a relationship with downturns, correlation does\nnot equal causation, and that inversion is not an absolute predictor.\nUltimately, my views are shaped by multiple indicators, and there are certainly aspects of the\neconomy — the strength of the labor market, for instance — that point to a fundamentally\nsound U.S. economy.\nAccounting for all those factors — a strong labor market, muted inflation, sustained moderate\ngrowth, and the penumbra of uncertainty — I continue to be in wait-and-see mode, and my\noutlook for rates remains, at most, one hike for 2019 and one for 2020.\nThe Fed’s Balance Sheet\nI just mentioned the Fed’s balance sheet, which is yet another aspect of Fed policy and action\nthat has captured attention lately, and the last issue I’ll touch on before we head into Q&A.\nI want to start by saying that while the balance sheet is an important part of the policy\ndiscussion, it’s not indicative of our monetary policy stance.\nA final primer, this one on the balance sheet: In the wake of the global financial crisis and the\nGreat Recession, the Fed turned to what we call “unconventional” monetary policy.\n7\n\nOur conventional means of conducting monetary policy is the federal funds rate. Lower rates\ncan encourage economic activity while higher rates can help prevent overheating. But in 2008,\nthe economy was severely damaged, and when the Fed lowered rates to essentially zero, it still\nneeded help. We had to go beyond our usual toolkit and turned to large-scale asset purchases,\nwhich was a program better known as quantitative easing, or QE. QE involved buying assets on\na larger scale and venturing into longer-term Treasuries along with mortgage-backed securities,\nor MBS. After three rounds of QE, the balance sheet — which was roughly $900 billion before\nthe crisis — had swelled to $4.5 trillion.\nIn late 2014, we stopped the purchases, and kept the balance sheet constant by reinvesting the\nproceeds as they came to maturity. A year later, the FOMC voted for the first modest rate hike,\nsignaling the first baby steps toward normalization. After three more increases to the federal\nfunds rate, the FOMC was ready to start looking at bringing the balance sheet into the\nnormalization process, voting in September of 2017 to start the unwinding process the\nfollowing month.\nAt that point, the size of the balance sheet was larger than we’d ever seen, and the MBS in\nparticular rendered its makeup different than it was before the crisis: Assets were made up\nprimarily of those Treasuries and MBS, while the liability side overwhelmingly consisted of\npaper currency and bank reserves and balances.\nThe means of unwinding the balance sheet were straightforward: We could either stop\nreinvesting the securities as they come to maturity or sell them on the open market. We opted\nfor the former, with gradually increasing caps on the amounts that were not redeemed. This\nhelped us attain the gradual, predictable, and thoroughly boring process that we’re aiming for.\nWhich brings us to 2019. At the March FOMC meeting, we said that we intend to end the\nbalance sheet runoff in September. Once we do so, we’ll reinvest paydowns from MBS —\nsubject to a cap of $20 billion per month — into Treasuries, which reflects our long-standing\nplans to hold primarily Treasuries in our portfolio.\n8\n\nThat won’t quite be the end of normalization, however. In September, when the runoff ends,\nreserves will likely still be slightly higher than what we need to “efficiently and effectively”\nimplement monetary policy, and our ultimate goal for reserves is “no more than necessary.”\nOur plan is to keep the size of our aggregate securities holdings constant for some time after\nSeptember. During this period, we will see a very — and I do stress “very” — gradual decrease\nin average reserves, as currency and other non-reserve liabilities grow over time.\nFor me, a key issue is that we only have estimates of the demand for reserves, which means we\nshould approach the “efficient and effective” level with caution.\nThis slow and steady approach, which is based on work by the Philadelphia Fed staff,1 is not\nonly the safer option, it has the additional advantage of reducing uncertainty about the\nevolution of asset redemptions, and proceeds in the FOMC’s preferred “gradual and predictable\nmanner.”\nFinally, I want to note that balance sheet normalization has received a lot of attention both in\nour meetings and communications, and will continue to do so. Again, while that does reflect its\nimportance, it does not reflect our current monetary policy stance. We often refer to the\nFOMC’s “toolkit” when discussing policy options. Balance sheet policy certainly remains an\noption, but we’ve put it back in the toolbox, and stored it in the basement — within arm’s\nreach, but out of sight for now.\nConclusion\nThat, in the smallest nutshell possible, is the combination overview of the Fed’s purposes and\nfunctions and my economic outlook as it stands today. Instead of going on any further, I’m\ngoing to stop there to turn it over to you for questions, and again, wish the Chamber a happy\n100th birthday — you don’t look a day over 85.\n1 I would like to thank Roc Armenter for his research and insight.\n9",

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nMonetary Policy Listening Tour\nFed Listens: Education, Employment, and Monetary Policy in the Third District\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nPhiladelphia, PA\nMay 17, 2019\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nIt’s a pleasure to welcome everyone to the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. Fed speakers\nusually start off with a standard disclaimer that we’re speaking for ourselves, not for anyone\nelse in the Fed System. But I’ll break that sacred vow to say on behalf of all my colleagues that\nwe’re very pleased that you’re joining us today.\nWho says policymakers don’t live dangerously?\nI want to extend an extra thanks for being here, because I know a lot of people wondered what\na discussion of monetary policy had to do with them. It’s a question our team heard more than\nonce, and it’s a fair one.\nThere are two parts to the answer. First, you are the economy. The American economy is the\nbiggest, most diverse on earth, but at its heart, it’s a collection of micro-economies made up of\npeople and businesses and communities — it’s you and your neighbors. And you’re the people\nwe conduct monetary policy for.\nSecond, we rely on feedback. Sure, we spend a lot of time looking at the myriad graphs and\ncharts and alphabet soup of equations you’d expect. But the views and experiences of people\nand businesses across our communities are also crucial components of how we measure the\nhealth of the American economy.\n1\n\nThose conversations are a regular part of how we collect and assess data. But this event is\nsomething different. It’s part of a larger listening tour that’s really about making sure we’ve got\nthe right goals in place; that we’re still measuring the right things, and that the tools we use are\nstill the best ones for the job.\nBefore I introduce our guest and get the afternoon underway, I want to take a moment to give\nthe Fed primer to put these discussions in context.\nThe Federal Reserve can be a mysterious being. It’s a complex system used to doing its job out\nof the limelight, and it’s not just the average person on the street who would struggle to explain\nits various functions.\nWhen I first joined the Philadelphia Fed’s board of directors, I was honestly surprised at how\nmuch about the Federal Reserve I didn’t know. So the Fed 101 is not because I think anyone\nhere is lacking in general knowledge; it’s because I know from experience.\nThe Federal Reserve System\nSo first, the structure.\nAt the center is the Board of Governors in Washington D.C., which is what most people think of\nwhen they hear “The Fed.” The Board has seven governors’ seats, including Vice Chair Clarida,\nwho’s joined us today and who is the driving force behind this listening tour.\nBut there are also the 12 District Banks around the country, including the one we’re in today,\neach an independent entity with its own president and board of directors.\nThe governors and presidents come together every six weeks or so in D.C. for a meeting of the\nFederal Open Market Committee — or FOMC — to discuss, and vote on, monetary policy. The\ngovernors and the president of the New York Fed are all permanent voters, while the rest of us\nrotate into position every few years. My first turn was in 2017, and I’ll be back in the saddle\nnext year.\nOne of the things that surprised me most when I first got to the FOMC is that you honestly can’t\ntell who’s a voter and who’s not until the last 30 seconds of a two-day meeting. Everyone is\n2\n\nequally involved in the debate and discussion. That’s an important detail, and it goes back to\nthe way we’re organized.\nThe Fed’s structure is an outlier; you don’t see it in other countries, and it’s something I think of\nas uniquely American: a decentralized central bank. I also think it’s the key ingredient in making\nthe best possible policy for the country.\nFirst and foremost, it gives vastly different communities a seat at the table and a voice in\ndiscussions.\nWe’re making monetary policy on a national level, and the size and scope of the U.S. economy\ncan flatten the peaks and valleys we see in different areas. Seattle’s economic reality is vastly\ndifferent than Camden’s, and the Fed’s unique structure makes sure we consider both.\nOur structure also helps to guard against groupthink. There’s an added richness to the\ndiscussions, because the people around the table have different backgrounds, different ways of\nlooking at the data, and different priorities in economic outcomes. It’s true that we could be\nmore diverse, and that’s something we’re working on. But even in our present state, there’s a\nmultitude of opinion, and the wants and needs of incredibly varied constituencies are\nrepresented.\nHaving a federated system also adds to our overall independence. While the Fed was created\nby and is answerable to Congress, we’re an independent entity, which shields us from political\npressure. That’s crucial to making good decisions. Monetary policy takes a while to work, and\nbeing free from outside influence allows us to make thoughtful, data-driven decisions about the\nmedium term.\nMonetary Policy\nSo that’s the form; what about the function?\nThe Fed is, of course, the nation’s central bank. We also regulate banks, process payments,\nconduct economic research, and work within our Districts to help strengthen local\ncommunities’ economies.\n3\n\nDifferent banks also specialize in particular research areas: Dallas has expertise in energy, for\ninstance, while New York is the go-to for financial markets. Here in Philadelphia, our focus is on\nconsumer credit.\nAnd, the subject we’re here to discuss today: We set monetary policy to meet the goals laid out\nfor us by Congress: maximum employment and price stability.\nIn their very simplest terms — with apologies to the economists in the room, who do not enjoy\nreducing things to their simplest terms — maximum employment means that if you’re looking\nfor a job, you can find one relatively easily. That comes with some caveats, of course, including\nthat it doesn’t necessarily mean the job you get will be the job you want. Price stability is low\nand stable inflation — enough for prices to grow at a healthy pace without devaluing the\nmoney in your bank account. Our current target is 2 percent.\nWhen we talk about monetary policy, it’s worth outlining not just what it can do, but what it\ncan’t.\nMonetary policy isn’t all powerful. It’s a relatively limited set of fairly blunt tools, and it has a\npretty narrow scope. In normal times, monetary policy is mostly raising and lowering interest\nrates — or keeping them the same.\nIn extraordinary times, we may use tools like quantitative easing or forward guidance — which\nis just policyspeak for telling people what to expect. But the majority of what we do is the\nsomewhat boring business of keeping rates at a level that encourages a healthy economy and\nhelps us meet our dual mandate.\nI’m often asked about aspects of the American economy that affect our work, but that we don’t\nactually have any control over. Fiscal policy, for instance, which deals with debts, deficits, and\ntaxes. Or things that take legislative action, like investments to encourage growth or programs\nto spur job creation.\nOur job is to create the conditions for a healthy economy to thrive. We till the land and make\nthe soil fertile, if you will. But the actual thriving part — planting the seeds and tending the\ncrops — take fiscal and other policy.\n4\n\nSo if it’s limited, why are we here today?\nBecause those grounding conditions — maximum employment and price stability — are crucial,\nand we want to be sure our targets, processes, and tools are still the right ones. We want to be\nsure we’re thinking about policy the right way.\nPart of coming to that conclusion is hearing from you. How you’re experiencing the job market.\nHow you’re feeling inflation. What challenges you’re seeing in your communities.\nBecause, again, you are the economy; you’re the reason we make policy in the first place.\nI want to turn it over now to Vice Chair Clarida, who, as I mentioned, is the driving force behind\nthese listening sessions.\nThank you.\n5",

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nSurvey Results on the State of the Economy\nThe Chamber of Commerce for Greater Philadelphia Economic Outlook\nPhiladelphia, PA (virtual)\nJanuary 14, 2022\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood morning! It’s great to be here sharing a stage ― well, sharing a screen ― with so many friends\nfrom the chamber and elsewhere. I know this event is a highlight of the year for many of you, and I’m\nthrilled that there is such a robust turnout this morning ― even if we were forced by COVID-19 to come\ntogether virtually rather than in person as we had hoped.\nOf course, given that so many of you are old friends, I’m sure that many of you know what I’m about to\nsay next. That’s right, the standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not\nnecessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or in the Federal\nReserve System.\nWe’re here today to look ahead to what the year 2022 has in store. But I firmly believe we can’t hope to\naccurately project into the future unless we know what’s happening on the ground right now.\nWith that said, I hope you’ve had a chance to look at the results from the Chamber of Commerce for\nGreater Philadelphia’s annual member survey. They offer, to my mind, a clear picture of an economy\nmoving in the right direction, particularly compared with where we were a year ago. But to be clear, our\nsurvey indicates far from “smooth sailing” for chamber members. The economy is improving, yes, but\nstill freighted with risks and constraints.\nSurvey data are, to my mind, an underrated tool in the economics business. At the Fed, we look at\neverything from big broad numbers like GDP and employment growth to more granular figures like auto\nsales and even restaurant reservations. And in recent years, we’ve seen the growth of new data sources\nlike mobility data, which give us information on how much people are traveling and to where.\nNow, don’t worry ― I promise you that mobility information is anonymized. We take data security very,\nvery seriously.\n1\n\nBut with survey data, we can find out how people and businesses’ economic realities are playing out on\nthe ground. And that’s crucial to all of our understanding of how the economy is really working. I know\nthat as a policymaker, I find survey data invaluable.\nI invite you to delve deep into the survey results, which make for fascinating reading. But I also wanted\nto highlight just a few data points that jumped out at me.\nFirst is just how much things have improved for chamber members over the course of the past year. The\nvast majority of survey respondents indicated higher levels of economic activity in 2021 over 2020. A full\n56 percent of respondents reported either slightly or significantly higher volumes of new orders, and 72\npercent reported slightly or significantly higher sales or revenues in 2021 over the year before.\nOur survey respondents are optimistic that these trends will continue. Nearly three-quarters are\nexpecting slightly or significantly higher sales or revenues in 2022 compared with 2021. Nearly 60\npercent are either at or have exceeded their prepandemic employment levels.\nNow, with increased sales have come increased costs, particularly on the labor side; 92 percent of\nrespondents expect wage and benefit costs to either increase slightly or significantly in the coming year.\nThat probably goes a long way toward explaining why 47 percent of respondents cited wages and 35\npercent of respondents cited the availability of labor as their top concerns for their operations going\nforward.\nWhen it comes to labor supply issues, 56 percent of respondents had difficulty hiring in the past three\nmonths because of the lack of qualified applicants, while 29 percent said that candidates were not\nwilling to accept the compensation levels they were offering. And in a fascinating demonstration of how\nthe pandemic has changed the way we work, 17 percent of respondents reported that candidates\nrejected their offers because of the lack of a fully remote option. Keep in mind that these survey results\nare largely from before Omicron became widespread, which has further hampered efforts to keep\nemployees healthy and on the job.\nIn sum, things will keep improving as long as employers have enough workers to staff their businesses.\nGoing forward, employers are going to have to think creatively about how to attract and retain talent. In\nthe end, I believe we will all benefit from that.\nSo, thank you again for joining us this morning. And now, let me turn things back to Andrea.\n2",

    "text": "An Economic Outlook\nCommercial-Industrial Realty Council’s\n25th Annual Joint Holiday Dinner\nWilmington, DE\nNovember 13, 2019\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nAn Economic Outlook\nCommercial-Industrial Realty Council’s 25th Annual Joint Holiday Dinner\nWilmington, DE\nNovember 13, 2019\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nIt’s a pleasure to be back in Blue Hens territory, and I am truly happy to be here this evening.\nI’ve worn a few professional hats in my day, each of which required a certain degree of measured\nspeech and withholding personal opinion. There are things you can and can’t say in almost every job,\nand that’s never been more true, for me, than as a Fed president. We have to be measured and\ncircumspect about how and when we speak. We steer away from controversial political and social\nissues. But I do feel, in this room tonight, that I would be remiss if I didn’t draw attention to a flagrant\nblow to the heart of Delaware culture and tradition. How on earth is punkin chunkin moving to Illinois!?\nSince I have, now, delved into a deeply important social issue, it’s a good time to give my colleagues\nconcrete deniability and share the requisite Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are my own\nand do not necessarily reflect anyone else’s in the Federal Reserve System.\nWith that taken care of: I’ve spent a lot of years talking in front of crowds, mostly in the realm of\nacademia. So my audiences have largely been required to show up and listen to the hour I had to fill. On\nthis occasion, however, I’m going to keep my remarks short, because I get much more out of your\nquestions and hearing what you have to say than I do from lecturing, and I’m positive it’s also more\ninteresting for you than listening to a policymaker drone on. Not to mention that I’ve found that those\nconversations are significantly more lively after everyone’s had a good dinner and a glass or two of wine\n… so with that, I’ll give a brief outlook on the economy and where I see policy headed, then turn it over\nto you for questions.\n1\n\nThe headline on my views these days is: not much news. Despite spirited conversations on all aspects of\nthe economy, my outlook has stayed relatively steady.\nStarting with employment, I feel comfortable saying that we’ve met our remit. The labor market\ncontinues to evince remarkable strength. Unemployment is at a 50-year low, and the pace of job\ncreation continues at above the rate we’ll need to keep pace with growth. That continued resilience is\nimportant, particularly in the Philadelphia Fed’s District — where many of our cities and towns trail\nnational averages — because as the market gets tighter and tighter, it starts to finally reach the people\nwho are most likely to miss out on the good fortune of positive economic trends. There are still people\non the sidelines, and we have continued to see more of them reenter the workforce. More people on\nthe margins are finding their way back into employment and a future. And from the business\nperspective, the biggest issue on the labor front has been a lack of skills and a lack of workers. So the\nmore people, the better, all around.\nI do want to note that this trend obviously can’t go on forever and, at some point, the pace of job\ncreation will slow. When that happens, there’s likely to be a decent amount of doom and gloom in the\nheadlines and laced through the commentary. But it’s important to remember that about 100,000 jobs a\nmonth or so is trend; it’s what we’ll need to keep pace with growth, and we’ve been seeing rates much\nhigher than that for several years. That said, I do still see unemployment staying below the 4 percent\nmark for the next couple of years, assuming that conditions play out more or less as expected.\nTurning to the inflation side of our mandate, this is, of course, the one that’s proven more difficult.\nInflation has not only shied away from our 2 percent goal for some time, it’s defied our predictions of\nwhen it will finally get there time and time again. With that in mind, I want to note that inflation is not\nrunning backwards; rather, it’s edging up — to be fair, it is sometimes taking a step back after two steps\nforward. But it is on track, and it is heading, on average, in the right direction. Ultimately, I do see it\nreaching our goal in the next 18 to 24 months.\nGrowth has also captured some negative headlines, but again, I think they mischaracterize the data: On\nthe aggregate, it has continued to meet our expectations. I remain of the opinion that we’ll see GDP\ngrowth of a little above 2 percent for 2019, returning to trend of about 2 percent next year.\nWhether or not 2 percent is an adequate pace of growth has been another subject of debate, but there\nis, by and large, consensus among economists and forecasters that this is trend. And from a policy\nperspective, there isn’t much that monetary policy can do to change that. I’ve said before — ad\n2\n\nnauseam, really — that the power and reach of monetary policy is relatively constricted. Meaningful\nchange to the nation’s growth trajectory requires fiscal policy. The Fed can create the conditions for\ngrowth to take root, but for it to flourish, it needs the nourishment of legislative action.\nWe are riding the wave of the longest economic recovery on record, and that’s a positive. The economy\nis in a good place.\nThat said, there are, of course, headwinds, the strongest being uncertainty. Trade and international\ndevelopments, including slowing overall global growth, have cast a shadow of ambiguity. And as anyone\nwho’s sat on a corporate board can tell you, in those situations, when the future is murky, you wait to\nmake decisions. And while the consumer has been the hero of this year’s growth story, that can’t be the\nsingle engine. We need business investment to drive the economy as well.\nNormally, that’s where I’d stop with an outlook speech, but I have the premier collection of Delaware’s\nreal estate community in front of me, so I don’t think I can get away without mentioning the housing\nmarket.\nOn the residential side, home price growth has slowed down noticeably in the past several years.\nHowever, the figures have been improving in recent months. And while current readings of inventory, as\nwell as construction, of single-family housing remain low relative to their historical norms, they are\nimproving. Low mortgage rates in the recent months have also had some impact. On the consumer side,\ndelinquency rates continue to fall, signaling a healthier credit market. For the Fed’s Third District, the\noverall story is similar to the national one. However, as with many indices in our area, the recovery has\ntaken a bit longer to reach our local markets.\nWith the outlook generally positive, and the economy in a good place, I come to the part that everyone\nreally cares about: rates. My own view is that we should hold steady for a while and watch how things\nunfold before taking any more action. I am not a voting member on the FOMC this year, but I held this\nsame view regarding the last two cuts. I would have preferred to hold firm. And while it wasn’t my\npreference, it does act as a good reminder that monetary policy in the United States is a deliberative\nprocess. Every region of the country is represented around the table, and policy made by a plurality of\nviews and opinions will necessarily be thoughtful and temperate.\nWith all that said and done, it’s time to move the floor over to you. One of the most important sources\nof information for a Fed president is the people who see major industries and sectors from the ground.\n3\n\nYour insight is invaluable, and I’m most looking forward to what you have to say. Especially about the\ncatastrophic loss of punkin chunkin.\n4",

Harker today are my own and not\nnecessarily those of the\nFederal Reserve System or\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nthe Federal Open Market\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia Committee (FOMC).\n\nThe Best Answers Start with the Right Questions\nGlobal Interdependence Center 42nd Annual Monetary and Trade Conference\nPhiladelphia\nJune 17, 2024\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood afternoon. It is a pleasure to once again join the Global Interdependence Center.\nIt is also my pleasure to welcome Central Bank of Ireland Governor Gabriel Makhlouf to the\nPhiladelphia Fed.\nAnd in doing so, I must acknowledge the figure who stands central in the histories of the central\nbanks in both of our respective countries — the economist Henry Parker Willis. Parker Willis\nwas one of the main architects of the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, and subsequently served as\nboth the first secretary of the Federal Reserve Board as well as the Federal Reserve System’s\ndirector of research from 1918 to 1922. And, in 1926, as the then four-year-old Irish Free State\ngrappled with the question of how to set up its own independent currency system, it enlisted\nHenry Parker Willis to lead this effort. His experiences and expertise directly influenced the Irish\nCurrency Act of 1927.\nOver the past century, Ireland and the United States have enjoyed a strong, friendly, and\nbeneficial relationship. And our history surely predates Irish independence to the ancestors of\ntoday’s millions of proud Irish Americans. As an individual, I’m proud of this history, but as a\ncentral banker, I take pride in knowing that this history extends to our financial underpinnings,\nas well!\nNow, before I get to the topics at hand, and to our moderated discussion, allow me to do away\nwith a bit of official business by noting that the views I express today are my own and do not\nnecessarily reflect those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System or on the Federal\nOpen Market Committee (FOMC). And with that disclosure now out of the way, let’s get into this\nafternoon’s program and I’ll begin with my overview of current economic conditions.\nEconomic Outlook\nAllow me to open with four brief statements. First, high inflation remains not only a leading\nconcern of many Americans, but certainly also one of mine and my colleagues’.\nSecond, the overall underpinnings of the American economy have proven nothing less than\nresilient, time and time again, despite the high rates leaning against aggregate demand for more\nthan a year now.\nThird, monetary policy overall remains positioned in restrictive territory to bring inflation back to\nits 2 percent target, while minimizing broader economic risks.\n\nAnd fourth, we are still surrounded by an air soaked with uncertainty. There are a host of risks\nand known unknowns, but what I would like to emphasize is that the data haven’t, so far,\nresolved those. Indeed, data have been what I would describe as “choppy.” Not that this is\nunheard of. As the economy becomes more balanced, the chances of a miss on the upside or\ndownside are more evenly distributed.\nBut the point stands, the data have not quite dissipated this uncertainty as I would have hoped\nthey would. Well, then, maybe I should add a fifth — more data is essential.\nWith regard to inflation, as we all saw, the promising disinflation in the second half of 2023\nunceremoniously halted through the first quarter of 2024. I had expected bumps in the road, but\nthe Q1 2024 “bump” threatened to become a hill to climb. Yet, while the lack of progress toward\nthe inflation target was concerning, inflation did not re-ignite.\nAnd while I remain very attentive to inflation risks, the latest inflation data have been quite\npromising that progress on disinflation has resumed. But “promising” falls short of the\nconfidence I want to have, before cutting rates, that inflation is on a sustainable path back to\ntarget.\nInflation has a range of impacts throughout the economy, but its greatest impact is on low- and\nmoderate-income families — those who have already been pinching their pennies over the past\ntwo years and aren’t sure how much more they can pinch. The situation has been made much\nworse as inflation hit hard the basic necessities: shelter, food, transportation.\nFortunately, we have seen quite a bit of improvement in many categories. Food prices have\nbeen essentially flat for several months now. Gas prices came down sharply in 2023. Vehicles,\nnew and used, are cheaper now than a year ago. Unfortunately, the long-term stubbornness of\nshelter inflation, especially, remains a concern along with the continually high rate of inflation in\nthe services sector, notably auto insurance and repairs — echoes of the past runups in vehicle\nprices, most likely.\nLast week’s CPI inflation release for May was very welcome, and the kind of price data I want to\nsee more of. But I would add the caveat that our inflation target is the PCE price index, not the\nCPI, the May reading of which is not due for another 11 days. If the higher inflation in the first\nquarter was a bump in the road, I want to make sure that the lower inflation we are seeing so far\nin the second quarter is not a pothole.\nI remain focused on seeing inflation return to a clear path toward our target rate of 2 percent\nannually.\nOverall, there is much in the American economy that allows me to remain optimistic.\nUnemployment remains low, job creation appears robust, and labor market participation is within\nrange of its historic levels. So, the labor market remains healthy, while supply and demand are\ncoming into better balance, as shown by the average number of job openings to job seekers, as\nwell as other measures of labor market tightness, like quits and job-to-job transitions, both of\nwhich are gently normalizing. Gross domestic product, while leveling off in the first quarter from\nthe close of 2023, continues to grow. We have seen some moderation in consumer spending as\nof late, and I am keeping a close eye on household finances.\n2\n\nAll said, as recent Fed survey data show, overall measurements of economic well-being among\nAmerican households remained essentially unchanged from 2022. The percentage of\nrespondents saying they were “doing at least okay financially” in 2023 was roughly where it was\nthe prior year, for example. And economic resilience as measured by respondents’ ability to\nafford an emergency $400 expense similarly remained unchanged.1\nYet inflation continued to eat away at the sense of true economic well-being. More respondents\nsaid their expenses increased than said their incomes increased. And, I should add, these\nresults are in line with what I hear as I speak with residents and contacts across the Third\nDistrict. This is a strong convergence of soft data.\nSo, to me the key is wrestling inflation back down to target. And, in this, progress has been\nuneven. Inflation is way down from where it was a year ago, but with the high inflation readings\nbetween January and March factored in, progress in recent months has been modest.\nI believe that the current policy interest rate, which has been held steady for nearly 11 months,\nwill continue to serve us well for a bit longer, holding us in restrictive territory to bring inflation\nback to target and mitigate upside risks.\nOver the ensuing months, I will continue to closely monitor the data — both hard and soft — on\ninflation, labor markets, and economic activity. And I will be asking whether it is, or is not, the\nright time to decrease the policy interest rate.\nWhen that time will be, exactly, I don’t yet know. I have a forecast for inflation, employment, and\neconomic activity: slowing but above trend growth, a modest rise in the unemployment rate, and\na long glide back to target for inflation.\nAnd if all of it happens to be as forecasted, I think one rate cut would be appropriate by year’s\nend — as well as a medal for myself for best economic forecaster ever. Because any forecast\nremains just that: a forecast. It is not a lock-down commitment.\nMy commitment is to remain data dependent because this is how we get through the uncertainty\nand make sure inflation returns to target, sustainably.\nIndeed, I see two cuts, or none, for this year as quite possible if the data break one way or\nanother. So, again, we will remain data dependent.\nThis is a time when the independence of the Federal Reserve System — and beyond to that of\nother central banks — will be of utmost importance. This is a fraught time in our nation and\nworld, which makes it all the more vital that we, as central bankers, remain not nonpartisan but\napolitical. We at the Fed operate under our dual mandate to ensure price stability and maximum\nemployment for the American people. That is our mandate, given by the U.S. Congress, and it is\nour goal.\nTo achieve this, we must make decisions by looking at all the data, not just a narrow set, and by\nasking and answering the right questions.\nDeepening the Economics Talent Pipeline\n1 Federal Reserve Board of Governors, “Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households in 2023,” May 21,\n2024, https://www.federalreserve.gov/consumerscommunities/shed.htm.\n3\n\nAnd that statement brings me to my final thoughts to share with you. How do we ensure we’re\nasking the right questions to begin with? I can say with great pride that the research team here\nat the Philadelphia Fed is filled with some of the brightest economic minds available. And I know\nthat goes the same for the team in Washington and at our sister banks across the Federal\nReserve System.\nWhenever I speak to students studying economics, I’m quick to note that the Federal Reserve\nSystem is the largest employer of economists in the nation. I want these future economists to\nconsider us as a potential career choice. I’m not just a central banker; I’m a recruiter!\nRecently, I’ve been pleased to see that the makeup of these student audiences has become\nsomewhat more diverse over time, but it still is not nearly representative enough. To me, this\nnext generation of economists isn’t just important because they are the ones who will sit at the\ndesks of those who have gone on to retirement or other aspects of the field. What’s more\nimportant are the perspectives they will bring into these future positions. And we need voices\nthat are not going to be afraid to challenge us into looking at old numbers with new eyes.\nTo foster this, the Philadelphia Fed has partnered with the National Association for Business\nEconomics, or NABE, in an effort to bring more historically underrepresented individuals into the\nfield of economics. But to be sure, we are not the only ones who have recognized the vital need\nfor diversity not just in economic thinking, but in economic thinkers.\nThe simple reality is that the underrepresentation of women and minority economics students at\nthe college and university level ultimately leads to an underrepresentation at the professional\nlevel.\nNearly a decade ago, in 2016, Amanda Bayer and Cecilia Elena Rouse’s article in the Journal of\nEconomic Perspectives noted that the lack of diversity within the field of economics “hampers\nthe discipline, constraining the range of issues addressed and limiting our collective ability to\nunderstand familiar issues from new and innovative perspectives.”2\nThat concern was underscored by research released by the Fed in 2017.3 That research\nmeasured student diversity in economics programs through the attainment of bachelor’s\ndegrees at hundreds of colleges and universities across the United States. It was a project that\ncaptured the annual makeup of classes from 2011 through 2015 — a yearly average of nearly\n35,000 economics majors. Overwhelmingly, the data showed that the presence of women and\nunderrepresented minorities lagged well behind that of white males.\nNow, certainly, there are many reasons why students may not choose to study economics.\nPerhaps the discipline’s moniker as the “dismal science” may hamper recruitment. But as we\nhere know, economics is far more than just “guns and butter,” being able to define “opportunity\ncost” and “mutual exclusivity,” or understanding, let alone grasping, the minutiae of monetary\npolicy.\n2 Bayer, Amanda, and Cecilia Elena Rouse, “Diversity in the Economics Profession: A New Attack on an\nOld Problem,” Journal of Economic Perspectives, Vol. 30, No. 4, Fall 2016,\nhttps://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.30.4.221.\n3 Federal Reserve Bank of New York, “Who Is Being Trained in Economics? The Race, Ethnicity, and\nGender of Economics Majors at U.S. Colleges and Universities,” https://www.newyorkfed.org/data-and-\nstatistics/data-visualization/diversity-in-economics#interactive/overview.\n4\n\nSo much of our world, and nearly every decision made by individuals and governments, whether\nthey recognize it or not, is an economic decision at its heart — everything from the goods they\npurchase, to the jobs they take, to whether or not to go to school to study economics.\nAnd homogeneity in the economic discipline prevents us from being able to more fully\ninvestigate those decisions to more fully understand choices and trade-offs, and to move\neconomics forward in a more meaningful way that captures the nuances of rapidly changing\neconomies and societies.\nEven just one year ago, Stefania Paredes Fuentes and Tim Burnett in a London School of\nEconomics blog post wrote: “Diversity among economists is crucial for policymaking as it\nenables the inclusion of a wide range of perspectives and experiences, leading to more\ninformed and effective decision-making.”4\nThis goes far beyond an ability to understand hard data. We can take all the classes we want\nand become proficient in collecting hard data and making calculations that seek to understand\ndecisions and influence policy. But hard data can only take a researcher so far. Equally\nimportant is the soft data — and there is no soft data that can be more important than a lived\nexperience.\nOr, as Anna Stansbury in the Harvard Business Review succinctly asked in 2022: “without many\neconomists from less socioeconomically advantaged backgrounds, what kinds of perspectives,\nquestions, and answers are we missing?”5\nFor us here at the Philadelphia Fed, we know that increasing the diversity of those studying and\npracticing economics isn’t just good for ensuring that our workplace is more reflective of the\nworld outside our walls, but it is crucial to ensuring that the work we produce is more reflective,\nand therefore better, as well. It is vital, as well, to the reputation of that work.\nConclusion\nIn the words of that most preeminent of Philadelphians, Benjamin Franklin, “Glass, China, and\nReputation, are easily cracked, and never well mended.”\nSo, my hope is for everyone here today to likewise commit to ensuring that the reputation of the\neconomics discipline does not crack. I ask you to commit to ensuring economics remains\nrelevant in the lives of those we aim to support through our work. I encourage you, if you have\nnot already done so, to find local partners, whether it be directly with an institution of higher\neducation or a business organization, to seek out and foster the economists of tomorrow.\nThose economists, after all, are the ones who will eventually be sitting and standing where we\nare today. And we are going to want them to look back at this convening and build upon our\nwork and progress not because we have all the answers, but because we recognize that we\ndon’t and that many questions are yet to be asked.\n4 Paredes Fuentes, Stefania, and Tim Burnett, “Lack of Diversity in Economics Holds Back Its Relevance\nand Value to Society,” London School of Economics, May 12, 2023,\nhttps://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2023/05/12/lack-of-diversity-in-economics-holds-back-its-\nrelevance-and-value-to-society/.\n5 Stansbury, Anna, “Economics Needs More Socioeconomic Diversity,” Harvard Business Review, June\n10, 2022, https://hbr.org/2022/06/economics-needs-more-socioeconomic-diversity.\n5\n\nWith that, I will conclude my prepared remarks. I thank you, again, for being part of this\nconference. And I look forward to our conversation.\n6",

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nInteresting Times\nThe Center for Financial Stability\nNew York, New York (in-person and virtual)\nMarch 29, 2022\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nHello! It’s great to be here. And I mean it today more than ever, because this is my first in-person speech\nin more than two years. I know I’m a little out of practice, because just as I was about to begin speaking,\nI made sure my mute button wasn’t on. Old habits die hard, it seems.\nIn all seriousness, thanks so much for having me. I’m very much looking forward to today’s conversation.\nI plan to discuss the economic outlook, monetary policy, housing, and a bit about money market funds.\nAnd then we can have an open discussion.\nBut before I begin, I need to give you my standard Fed disclaimer. The views I express today are my own\nand do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or\nin the Federal Reserve System.\nEconomic Outlook\nWhen I look at the current state of the world, I can’t help but think of the old curse about living in\n“interesting times.”\nWe’ve made significant progress, particularly on vaccinations, but remain mired in the midst of a now\ntwo-year global pandemic that has, tragically, killed at least 6 million people globally and around 1\nmillion here in the United States. That’s the equivalent of a city larger than San Francisco or Seattle\nbeing felled by this virus. Russia has invaded Ukraine, fomenting death and destruction and spurring a\n1\n\nhumanitarian crisis in the heart of Europe. And as policymakers, we at the Fed are confronting inflation\nrunning at multidecade highs, a subject I will touch on shortly.\nNow, all of that said — and given these extraordinarily trying and tragic circumstances — one can’t help\nbut feel a little bit of awe at the underlying strength of the U.S. economy.\nIn the fourth quarter of last year — coinciding, at least in part, with the Omicron surge — GDP grew at\nan annualized rate of 7 percent, with strong inventory investment and a healthy demand for capital\ngoods. For the totality of 2021, U.S. GDP growth was a very healthy 5.7 percent.\nWhile delivery times remain elevated, there are some signs in the data, and in what we hear from our\ncontacts, that supply chain constraints are finally easing. This should pave the way for healthy sales of\ndurable goods like automobiles and appliances.\nJob growth, a key component of the Fed’s mandate, remains robust. For 10 straight months, new job\ncreation has topped 400,000. But if you think that has led to a decline in Help Wanted signs, you’re\nwrong. Even with all this job creation, vacancy rates remain elevated.\nNominal wage growth, as one would guess given these conditions, has been strong. Labor participation\nrates are edging up as well, though they remain below where they were before the pandemic. I suspect\nthat the waning of the virus — at least here in the United States — as well as uncertain equity markets\nand even inflation may lure people back into the workforce and persuade others to delay retirement.\nThe unemployment rate, below 4 percent, should continue to fall this year.\nNow to the “10 percent” elephant in the room.\nInflation is running far too high, and I am acutely concerned about this. The consumer price index (CPI)\nwas up 10 percent annualized in February, led by another significant increase in energy prices. Over the\npast year, CPI is up 7.9 percent. Core CPI, stripping out energy and other volatile indicators, remains very\nhigh as well, with 6.2 percent annualized growth in February. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will add to\ninflation pressure, not only hiking oil and gas prices but other commodities, like wheat and fertilizer, as\nwell.\nInflation is widespread. It is showing up throughout a vast array of goods that comprise the CPI “basket”\n— and among some of those that aren’t in the basket. One of our contacts, for instance, mentioned\nwhopping membership fee increases at his golf club, suggesting this summer may be a good time to play\nat your local muni instead.\n2\n\nThe bottom line is that generous fiscal policies, supply chain disruptions, and accommodative monetary\npolicy have pushed inflation far higher than I — and my colleagues on the FOMC — are comfortable\nwith. I’m also worried that inflation expectations could become unmoored.\nWhich is why last week we announced we were raising the federal funds rate for the first time since\n2018. We raised our target by 25 basis points, and I expect a series of deliberate, methodical hikes as\nthe year continues and the data evolve. I also anticipate that we will begin to reduce our holdings of\nTreasury securities, agency debt, and mortgage-backed securities soon.\nWith the runoff of pandemic support, tightening monetary conditions, and the war in Ukraine pressuring\ncommodity prices, I think growth will moderate this year. We can probably expect to come in around 3\npercent to 3.5 percent GDP growth this year — and then falling to trend growth of 2 percent to 2.5\npercent during the next couple of years.\nI do see a potential for a significant uptick in the service sector in large, politically “blue” cities that are\nonly now waking up after a two-year pandemic-induced hibernation. Central business districts in cities\nlike New York, San Francisco, and Philadelphia should get a boost as more workers return to their offices\n— the staff of the Philadelphia Fed included. The rise of hybrid work may moderate the potential for a\nhuge boom, however. There is a big question mark hanging over the future of commercial real estate.\nInflation should begin to taper this year too — though remain elevated, probably around 4 percent for\n2022. The following two years should bring it back to our target of 2 percent.\nAll of these forecasts are freighted with uncertainty. Recall, again, that we live in “interesting times.”\nHousing\nNow, before we move to the open discussion, I’d like to turn to housing, which comprises a huge and\nvitally important sector of the U.S. economy — and, I’ve found, is a topic of particular interest here in\nNew York. With a fairly weak social safety net, for Americans, houses are not only their shelters — they\nare a significant source of their household wealth and retirement savings as well.\nIn general, the housing market is largely healthy; if anything, it’s not keeping up with demand. Housing\nstarts are robust, but inventories are low and price growth is strong. Policies that make construction\narduous in certain states and municipalities continue to impede efforts to meet demand.\n3\n\nI’d now like to turn specifically to mortgage forbearance, a subject that the staff at the Philadelphia Fed\nhas been doing some very important research on.\nAs many of you will recall, at the outset of the pandemic, the CARES Act mandated that borrowers of\nfederally insured mortgages be granted forbearances. To ensure widespread take-up, the law said\nborrowers could be granted forbearances by simply requesting it; they did not even need to prove\nhardship. The upshot was that homeowners could temporarily pause their mortgage payments without\npenalty and stay in their homes, without dinging their credit scores.\nThe CARES Act also put into place a foreclosure moratorium, followed by temporary protections against\nforeclosure. Private sector lenders adopted the same practices.\nPerhaps not surprisingly, as the pandemic began and the economy was shut down, Americans took this\nopportunity in droves: More than 8.5 million borrowers entered forbearance at some point during the\npandemic — more than 15 percent of the total mortgage market.\nThat was then, though.\nAs of last month, the number of loans in forbearance had declined by more than 90 percent, down to\naround 680,000 mortgages.\nSo, what has become of the nearly 8 million households that entered forbearance and have since come\nout of it? Our researchers at the Philadelphia Fed have been tracking this and have made some\nimportant findings.\nI’ll begin with the positive news. Nearly three-quarters of those who have exited forbearance have paid\noff or are performing, many making use of payment deferrals or loan modifications. For borrowers able\nto resume timely payment, a deferral creates a no-interest subordinated lien out of their missed\npayments not due until loan payoff. Meanwhile, loan modifications offer lower interest rates and extend\nloan terms up to 40 years while offering payment reductions of 20 percent or more.\nMoreover, our exceptionally strong housing market has kept home prices elevated. While this has had\nundeniably negative impacts on those seeking to enter the housing market, it does ensure that\nborrowers can avoid losing their homes and that banks won’t suffer losses large enough to meaningfully\naffect their capital positions. Homeowners are sitting on more than $10 trillion of tappable equity — a\nrecord. The contrast with the Great Recession is remarkable; you’ll recall back then that nearly half of all\ndistressed borrowers were “underwater.”\n4\n\nStill, nearly 1 million mortgages are seriously delinquent, split evenly between those classified by\nservicers as in loss mitigation and those not in loss mitigation. Most borrowers who remain seriously\ndelinquent and not in loss mitigation never entered forbearance at all. Many were in nonpayment\nbefore the pandemic struck.\nAnd of the borrowers classified as in loss mitigation, three-quarters are still in process and have not, as\nof yet, resumed timely payment on their mortgages. Black and Hispanic borrowers have much higher\nshares of nonpayment, either being in forbearance or delinquency. Interestingly, just as the\nunemployment rate has returned to pre-pandemic levels, the number of delinquent mortgages has also\nreturned to pre-pandemic rates.\nLenders may want to consider solutions that limit the costs of modification while providing more\npayment relief to borrowers. One such solution is for the Federal Housing Administration to offer 40-\nyear mortgage modifications. This will lower the cost relative to the 30-year option and provide more\nrelief to borrowers. While the Department of Housing and Urban Development has proposed a program\nto facilitate a 40-year mortgage, it has yet to materialize. It’s worth noting that protections against\nforeclosure expired on December 31, 2021, and foreclosure starts are back to their pre-pandemic levels\ntoo.\nMoney Market Funds and COVID-19\nNow, I’m certain you’re eager to grill me, but I want to close with a few words on what happened with\nmoney market funds (MMFs) almost exactly two years ago, just as the pandemic struck. I realize this is\nnot a happy memory, so apologies for bringing this up. COVID-19 may have been a true black swan\nevent — and we all fervently hope, a truly once-in-a-lifetime experience — but that must not preclude\nus from drawing lessons that we can use going forward.\nMarch 2020, you’ll recall, was characterized by a dash for cash. (It was also characterized by a dash for\ntoilet paper and hand sanitizer, but that is a story for another day.) Net outflows from prime MMFs,\nwhich provide crucial investment in various forms of short-term debt, was more than 17 percent —\nroughly equivalent to the outflows experienced during the 2008 financial crisis. All told, more than $140\nbillion evaporated from domestic MMFs between March 6 and March 26, 2020.\n5\n\nAs you can imagine, this run on MMFs imposed huge pressure on the kinds of short-term funding that\ncompanies rely on to stay afloat. The consequences for financial stability, and the U.S. economy at large,\nwere profound.\nSo, for the second time in 12 years, a significant outflow from MMFs ensured a concerted policy\nresponse. The Fed, in conjunction with the Treasury Department, stepped in, and on March 18, 2020, we\nannounced we were launching the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility, which was formally\ninitiated on March 23. Ultimately, 47 out of 95 domestic prime MMFs accessed the facility.\nWhat’s important to note is that as soon as we announced the advent of the liquidity fund, outflows\nfrom MMFs declined substantially. From March 23 to the end of the month, outflows were $28 billion,\nand by April, these funds were actually seeing inflows. Correlation is not causation, of course, so we\ncan’t be sure it was solely the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility that provided this\nstabilization, though researchers at the New York Fed have found compelling data that suggest it did\nhave an effect.\nAnd indeed, one thing I noticed throughout the 2020 crisis was that every time we launched a new\nlending facility — and we ended up launching quite a few — the mere announcement of it had a fairly\nsignificant effect on calming markets, even before the facility was actually up and running.\nWhile the Fed’s actions were largely successful, I would argue that we do not want the public sector to\nstep in to aid MMFs for a third time. Proposals such as introducing swing pricing requirements,\neliminating redemption gates and liquidity fees tied to the level of weekly liquid assets at prime and tax-\nexempt funds, and increases in liquid asset requirements for all funds are proposals well worth\nconsidering. When we say the Fed is the lender of last resort, we mean it.\nSo, again, thank you so much for having me. Interesting times call for, I’m certain, an interesting\ndiscussion, and now I’m happy to take questions.\n6",

    "text": "Linking Community Banks\nand Fintech Platforms\nJoint Virtual Symposium: Fintech Partnership\nPhiladelphia, PA (Virtual)\nApril 1, 2021\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nLinking Community Banks and Fintech Platforms\nJoint Virtual Symposium: Fintech Partnership\nPhiladelphia, PA (Virtual)\nApril 1, 2021\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nHello! It’s really great to be here, and I’m thrilled that we have such a large turnout. The interest in this\nevent was so large, in fact, that here at the Fed, we had our own fintech issue as we were organizing it:\nWe had to cap attendance to protect bandwidth!\nThat’s a good problem to have, of course, and I think it really speaks to the terrific program that the staff\nat the Philadelphia Fed has put together for all of us — and to the robust interest in fostering a dialogue\nbetween fintech platforms and community banks from all over the country.\nSo, again, welcome. I just regret that for those of you on the West Coast this program has to be BYOB ―\nBring Your Own Breakfast.\nNow, before we proceed, I have to give you my standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are\nmy own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or\nin the Federal Reserve System.\nThe Importance of Community Banks\nHere at the Fed we wear many hats: We’re a bank, a supervisor and regulator of other banks, and the\nlargest collection of economists in the world. We have the ability to lend money, to foster payments and\nsettlements, and to promote consumer protection and community development.\n1\n\nWe also have the power to convene. And that is precisely our aim this week: to provide a forum for open\ndiscussion among community bankers, bank regulators, and the fintech industry. We’re delighted you’re\nhere to learn about the new tools available to improve risk valuations and to enhance the customer\nexperience for clients ― among other exciting new technologies.\nI’m particularly glad that we have so many CEOs and CTOs of small community banks here today. While I\nprobably don’t need to belabor the importance of community banks to this particular audience, I think it\nsometimes gets lost just how central community banks are to our economy ― and indeed, to American\nsociety.\nJust consider the numbers. There are more than 4,800 active community bank charters across the\ncountry. And of those, almost exactly half are in communities with fewer than 50,000 residents.\nCommunity banks ― those with $10 billion or less in assets ― collectively hold more than $3 trillion in\nassets. You don’t need to rewatch It’s a Wonderful Life for the hundredth time to get a sense of how\nvitally important these institutions are.\nRisks and Opportunities\nCOVID-19 and its associated economic effects have also emphasized the importance of community\nbanks. But they have also heightened the risks to the sector in a world where more and more business is\nconducted online.\nGiven their strong relationships with local businesses, community banks were absolutely essential to\noperating the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which has kept so many small businesses afloat\nduring the shutdowns. According to my Fed colleague, Governor Michelle Bowman, community banks\nhave made up about 40 percent of the total value of PPP loans issued. It’s probably no exaggeration to\nsay that PPP would have failed without community banks’ support.\nBut economic shutdowns imposed to curtail the spread of COVID-19 ― particularly those that shuttered\nbank branches ― have also demonstrated just how important digitization is and the perils of falling\nbehind on fintech.\nOnline platforms have gobbled up an increasing number of home mortgages, for instance ― particularly\nas COVID-19 has deemphasized the importance of the in-person interactions that are the bread and\nbutter of community banking. I would encourage community bankers to explore digitization\n2\n\nopportunities for your institution and customers, as well as innovative opportunities that align with your\nstrategic plans.\nI understand, of course, that there are challenges. Smaller banks often simply don’t have the workforce\nor the cash to first, research and investigate, and then to ultimately invest in costly fintech platforms.\nThey lack the economies of scale that bigger banks enjoy. Set-up costs can be prohibitive. And, to be\nfrank, there are occasional cultural differences between the “move fast and break things” ethos of many\nfintech suppliers and the more risk-averse sensibilities of bankers.\nAnd those risks are real. Consider the astonishing rapidity of technological development. There are\nserious and understandable concerns that a year or two after making an expensive fintech investment,\nthe technology will already become obsolete. You don’t want to be stuck with a bunch of buggy whips a\nyear before the invention of the Model T.\nAnd there can be a hesitancy to embrace new technologies on the client side, too, of course. A banker in\nour area recently told me that despite her bank’s investment in fintech ― and even with her branch\noffices closed ― many clients still use the drive-through windows to do things they could easily do at\nhome. They’re even willing to wait for 20 minutes in their car to do so. Although, given the pandemic\nconditions that have kept many of us at home for a year, I certainly understand the need to get out of\nthe house.\nConclusion\nIt is precisely because of these opportunities and these risks that this symposium is such a great\nopportunity for all of us. Constructive dialogue between fintech firms and community banks offers a\npath forward for both. We can listen, and we can learn from each other.\nThe Federal Reserve, for its part, is very supportive of innovation. We’re here to convene, to support,\nand to supervise.\nThanks again and enjoy the event.\n3",

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nThe Fed: A For-Purpose Organization\nHOPE Global Forum\nOperation HOPE\nAtlanta, GA (virtual)\nOctober 19, 2020\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood afternoon! It’s an honor to be joined by all of you here today. As a Fed president, I’m not sure my\nstar power can match that of some of my fellow panelists. I’ll admit I’m no Deepak Chopra or T. D. Jakes,\nbut I’m also pretty thrilled to rub shoulders with them ― even if only virtually.\nBut on a serious note, Operation HOPE’s mission of ensuring financial uplift and economic inclusion for\nall Americans could not be more important ― or timelier, given present circumstances ― so I am very\nexcited and frankly flattered to be a part of this great series of events this week.\nI’m also excited to sketch out a few thoughts on our present circumstances and to chat with John\nBryant. But before I can get to that, there is something else I have to do. We call it the standard Fed\ndisclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on\nthe Federal Open Market Committee or in the Federal Reserve System.\nIt’s no secret to anyone here that we’re in the middle of twin crises the likes of which none of us has\never experienced. COVID-19 has sickened tens of millions of our fellow Americans and killed hundreds of\nthousands of them. And the virus, unfortunately, is still circulating widely throughout the country.\nThe pandemic also spurred an economic downturn so severe that, in the second quarter of this year, we\nexperienced the sharpest contraction of gross domestic product (or GDP) in recorded American history.\nMillions of Americans lost their jobs, and millions more had their hours cut.\nWe see the scars everywhere ― in the miles-long lines at foodbanks that indicate massive suffering and\nin the shuttered storefronts and restaurants that now dominate so many of our commercial districts\nthat just a few months ago were bustling.\n1\n\nIt’s also no secret that the effects of this unprecedented crisis have fallen most harshly on those least\nable to bear them. Racial minorities ― particularly Hispanic and Black Americans ― have been more\naffected by both the health crisis and the economic crisis than other groups.\nHispanics and Black Americans have been sickened by COVID-19 at a rate disproportionate to their\npopulation. They have also died at a higher rate. Those same groups also are more likely to hold jobs\nthat one can’t perform from home, which is probably one of the reasons their infection rates are higher\nthan other groups. They are also more likely to have held jobs that have either been replaced by\nautomation or that have simply been eliminated.\nThis is a five-alarm fire.\nThe one thing I truly admire about Operation HOPE is that it doesn’t just call itself a non-profit\norganization. It calls itself a for-purpose organization.\nThe Federal Reserve is also a for-purpose organization. Since the Fed is the nation’s central bank,\nCongress has mandated us to provide for maximum employment and stable prices ― that is, lots of jobs\nand low inflation.\nBut another purpose I believe we can work toward is narrowing the yawning racial disparities that\ncontinue to plague our society.\nSo, how do we do that?\nGiven that I am a Fed president, you probably guessed that I might say monetary policy. And I do think\nthat’s part of the solution. That’s why I’m pleased that, in late August, following a nearly two-year\nreview, the Fed announced a shift in our approach to fulfilling that dual mandate that I mentioned\nearlier.\nHere is the upshot: No longer will we head off higher inflation by preemptively raising interest rates\nbefore we have achieved full employment. Moreover, after long periods of sub-2 percent inflation (as\nwe now find ourselves in), we will accept periods of above-2 percent inflation. Tolerating the risk of\nslightly higher inflation, in our view, is worth it if it helps us achieve our employment goals.\nThat’s important because one of the salutary trends of the pre-COVID-19 economy was that economic\ngains, at least on a limited basis, were finally being enjoyed by lower-wage workers, a disproportionate\n2\n\npercentage of whom are racial minorities. We still had a very, very long way to go, of course. But it’s\nclear that we must achieve full employment if we are going to make progress on this issue.\nWe also need to do a better job of transitioning workers into careers that offer solid pay and strong\nfuture prospects. Here at the Philadelphia Fed, we’ve been thinking hard about how to get workers into\nwhat we call opportunity occupations ― that is, jobs that pay the median wage or better and that don’t\nrequire a college degree.\nI’d like to share the results of just one study we’ve done because I think the results are truly exciting.\nThe study began when Philadelphia Fed researchers, in partnership with the Cleveland Fed, asked a\nquestion: How do we transition workers in jobs most likely to disappear into stable, higher-wage\npositions?\nThey came up with an ingenious idea: They looked at the skill sets of people who are holding those jobs\nthat are most at risk of disappearing. They then matched those skills to jobs that would pay at least 10\npercent more than their current wage and that don’t require a traditional four-year degree.\nThe findings were incredibly encouraging. Looking at 33 metro areas nationwide, they found that nearly\nhalf of lower-wage employment can be paired with at least one higher-paying occupation requiring\nsimilar skills. For transitions connecting the most similar occupations identified in the study, the pay\ndifferences are significant, with an average bump in wages of almost $15,000 — a 49 percent increase in\nsalary.\nThe opportunities for public‒private partnerships to initiate these kinds of transitions are obvious, and\nI’m proud to say that the Philadelphia Fed helped launch one with Comcast and Philadelphia Works, our\nlocal workforce development board. That’s just one project, of course, but if it proves to be replicable\nacross cities and industries, I really think we can begin to move the needle.\nThere is a division within the Federal Reserve that has defined racial equity as “the just and fair inclusion\nin an economy in which all can participate, prosper, and reach their full potential, and race can no longer\npredict life outcomes.” That’s a lofty goal, of course, but a really profound one, I think: the idea that we\ncan one day decouple race from life outcomes. If we get there, I know that Operation HOPE will have\nplayed a role.\nSo, thanks again for having me, and now I’m happy to chat with John Bryant.\n3",

Harker\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nWelcome and Introductions\nGood afternoon and welcome. It’s a pleasure to be moderating this discussion of a subject\nthat’s gathered interest and commentary from a vast array of outlets: the Federal Reserve’s\nbalance sheet and what the future holds.\nI’m joined today by my colleague Jim Bullard, president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of\nSt. Louis; Lisa Emsbo-Mattingly, director of research in the Global Asset Allocation group at\nFidelity Investments; and another colleague, Governor Randy Quarles of the Federal Reserve’s\nBoard of Governors. Everyone here is familiar with our panelists, and their bios are in front of\nyou, so I’ll skip the customary recitation of their CVs — which are obviously as long as they are\nimpressive, and I think we’d all rather spend that time hearing what they have to say.\nBefore I start, I’ll issue the standard Fed disclaimer that the views expressed today are mine\nalone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System —\nsomething that my colleagues and I may well demonstrate in a few minutes. I will, however,\nspeak on their behalf to say that the disclaimer extends to all of us, to spare them having to\nrepeat it.\n1\n\nThe Fed’s Balance Sheet — A Brief History and Where Things Stand Today\nBefore I ask the first question, I’d like to start by putting the subject of the discussion in context,\nwith a quick reminder of the present state of the balance sheet and its recent history.\nIn October of 2017, we started the normalization process by decreasing the reinvestment of\nprincipal payments from our Treasury and MBS securities. Since then, we’ve reduced our\nsecurities holdings by close to half a trillion dollars.\nThe aggregate level of reserves currently stands at roughly $1.6 trillion. That’s $600 billion less\nthan when we started unwinding, because reserves decline both with asset redemptions and\nthe growth of other liabilities, such as currency. Overall, the current level of reserves is $1.2\ntrillion less than the peak of $2.8 trillion, back in 2014.\nWe noted at the time that the unwinding would be essentially on autopilot and spectacularly\nboring — though we were clear about our intent to keep an eye on things.\nAs that process has unfolded, and aggregate reserves have declined, we’re coming to a more\ninteresting juncture. And so, in recognition of the beginning of the end, last November we\nresumed our discussions of the Committee’s plans to implement monetary policy over the\nlonger run.\nStaff from across the Federal Reserve System presented excellent work on an array of options.\nAfter careful consideration, we agreed that the current implementation framework has served\nus very well. Our administered rates have proven effective at controlling short-term interest\nrates. This allows us to continue using changes in the target range of the fed funds rate as the\nprimary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy. In January, therefore, we\ncommunicated our intention to maintain an “ample supply of reserves,” that ensures control\nover the federal funds rate via our administered rates, without necessitating active\nmanagement of the supply of reserves.\n2\n\nTransition to the Long-Run Framework\nSo we stand today knowing what we want the long-run framework to look like, knowing that\nwe are getting closer every day, and knowing that we are not that far from the efficient level of\nreserves. We have therefore started discussing our transition plans to the long-run\nimplementation framework, and will continue to do that in future meetings.\nIn my view, a key issue is that we only have estimates of the demand for reserves, and we\ncertainly don’t have the luxury of a tensile test — breaking points in engineering and monetary\npolicy are very different animals.\nIt is my own view that we should approach the end of normalization with caution. Based on\nwork by my staff, I have proposed that we can substantially slow the decline in reserves by\nending the reduction in asset holdings later this year; reserves would then diminish at a very\ngradual pace, reflecting the trend growth of other Federal Reserve liabilities.1\nA slow and steady approach is not only the safer option, it’s one that will reduce uncertainty\nabout the evolution of the balance sheet. It is also firmly in line with the FOMC’s stated\nobjective to proceed in a “gradual and predictable manner.”\nQuestions for the Panel\nBack when we started the normalization journey, I promised that it would be the policy\nequivalent of watching paint dry — and it certainly was, for over a year. Yet despite laying out a\ngradual, predictable path, and communicating that path with regularity, the recent interest in\nthe subject makes me wonder if I’ve underestimated the allure of dried paint.\nSo I would like to start by asking our panelists: Given that the reduction in asset holdings was\nannounced well in advance, and given that it proceeded smoothly in the background as\npromised, why is it that balance sheet policy has suddenly leapt to the front page?\n1 I would like to thank Roc Armenter for his research and insight.\n3\n\nI’ll parcel that with a related question, because the public discussion will turn next to the\ncomposition of the balance sheet: We are on record as preferring that our securities holdings\nbe primarily Treasuries, but what about their maturity composition? More broadly, what should\nbe our most important considerations in discussing the composition of the balance sheet?\n4",

Harker\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily\nthose of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\nGrowth and the Role of Economic Policies\nMoney Marketeers of New York University, Inc.\nDown Town Association\nNew York, NY\nMarch 22, 2016\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nIntroduction\nGood evening. It is a pleasure and a privilege to have the opportunity to engage with the\ndistinguished gathering of financial professionals and leaders that Money Marketeers\nrepresents.\nThank you, Guy Haselmann, a proud Fightin’ Blue Hen from the University of Delaware, for the\ninvitation.\nOverview\nI am going to spend my time this evening talking about the prospects of long-term economic\ngrowth in the U.S. and the role of economic policies ― monetary policy included ― in affecting\nthose prospects. But before I start, let me say that my remarks today reflect my own views and\nnot necessarily the views of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or\nin the Federal Reserve System.\nAs you know, the recovery from the end of the Great Recession was slow, with the pace of\nbusiness fixed investment and job growth remaining modest for some time. Thankfully, job\ngrowth accelerated over the past 18 months, but the pace of business fixed investment still\nremains modest.1 And while the unemployment rate has fallen to levels that are seemingly\nconsistent with full employment, this occurred in tandem with a decline in the labor force\nparticipation rate.\n1\n\nThe ratio of employment to working-age population has yet to recover to its precrisis level.\nLooking forward, our forecasts of real economic growth over the next two to three years\nremain subdued.\nWhat is the underlying cause of this slow economic growth? One possibility is that recovery\nfrom the wrenching global financial crisis we experienced in 2008–2009 is a slow process.\nThere is merit to this view: Economists tell us that a recovery from a bad financial crisis can\ntake a long time, as long as seven years on average.2 So, it is possible that what we are\nexperiencing is one of these slow recoveries. In this case, a pickup in the rate of economic\ngrowth may be around the corner as the shock of the Great Recession fades away.\nBut for this evening, I am going to be a dismal economist and entertain the possibility that\neconomic growth may remain sluggish for some time to come. I am going to speculate on why\nthat might be the case and what policymakers can do to improve the economy’s growth\nprospects.\nOne topic that I will spend a few minutes on is the important role our education sector plays in\npromoting long-run economic growth. As you know, I have spent most of my career engaged\n— at various levels — in the delivery of higher education. This has now become a significant\nnational policy issue, garnering great debate about whether the sector is keeping up in a world\ndriven by rapid global integration and disruptive technological change. It is also an issue that\nconcerns the Fed because of its connection to the problem of nonperforming student loans.\nLet me say right off the bat that the long-term growth performance of our economy is a very\nbig deal. For example, you must all be aware of how scary the current projections regarding\nMedicare and Medicaid look. If these expenditure trends are combined with a significant drop\noff in the rate of GDP growth, the day when investors begin to seriously worry about the\nreturn on U.S. Treasury securities will be upon us sooner rather than later.3\n2\n\nEurope’s sovereign debt crisis should stand as a stark reminder of what can happen to a\nnation’s borrowing capacity when investors begin to lose confidence in the government’s\nability to pay its bills.\nTechnology and Capital\nLet me first talk about what we know about the basic determinants of long-run economic\ngrowth, which I will take this evening to mean sustained growth in the material standard of\nliving for ordinary people. There is a great deal of scholarship on this topic by both economists\nand historians. In an accounting sense, it all comes down to two factors: technology and\ncapital.\nBy technology, I mean our continually improving ability to produce existing goods and services\nat lower cost as well as our ability to invent new products that satisfy previously unmet human\nneeds. Historically, the trend toward greater and greater efficiency has been intimately tied to\nadvances in science, engineering, and medicine.\nI will not say much more about this trend this evening because I don’t see any slowing in the\nspeed with which the frontiers of human knowledge are expanding. If anything, new territories\nfor scientific exploration are opening up at a faster pace than ever before. So, if we are hunting\nfor the causes of slow economic growth, this is not where we should be looking.\nSo, let me then turn to the other factor: “capital.” Thanks to Thomas Piketty’s recent book,\nCapital in the Twenty-First Century, capital is now a fashionable word. But I am going to use it\nin the prosaic way economists normally use it: It’s the total of the myriad investments\nbusinesses, people, and governments made in the past to turn productive knowledge into\nactual stuff. The existing stocks of equipment, structures, and software are well-known\nexamples of capital in this sense. I will call all of this “business capital.”\n3\n\nThere is also another form of capital — embodied in people — that is also very important: This\nis the time and resources that a worker spends in acquiring knowledge in a specific field — say\nnursing or auto repair — and the resources that businesses spend to provide on-the-job\ntraining to workers. We call all of this “human capital.” Economic growth, which is measured\nas growth in the GDP per worker, results from growth in technological efficiency and growth in\nthe stocks of business and human capital per worker.\nThe Limits of Monetary Policy on Long-Term Economic Growth\nAll of this should be familiar territory. But let’s think what this accounting means for monetary\npolicy. How does monetary policy affect long-run economic growth? Well, its effects can only\nenter via the calculus that determines how much firms invest in business capital and how\nmuch firms and people invest in human capital. This makes sense. As monetary policymakers,\nwe affect interest rates in financial markets, and rates of investments depend on interest\nrates.\nBut economists tell us that over the long haul, these rates of investments cannot be affected\nmuch by monetary policy, if monetary policy succeeds in keeping inflationary expectations and\nactual inflation stable and equal to each other.\nIn this happy scenario, interest rates in financial markets will, on average, be just right to\nneutralize the rise in prices. The fact of inflation, then, will be unimportant to the investment\ndecisions people and businesses make.\nSo, this is the first point I want to make this evening. Good monetary policy — meaning\nmonetary policy that delivers on our price stability mandate — by virtue of it being good, will\nnot affect long-term economic growth. Of course, it goes without saying that bad monetary\npolicy can derail the economy and reduce economic growth.\n4\n\nHere’s another way to put it: There is a growth potential out there, and the best that monetary\npolicy can do is to help achieve that potential, but it cannot affect the potential itself. So, there\nare limits to the effectiveness of monetary policy that we must be careful to respect. In real\ntime, it is always a challenge to determine if the economy is at its growth potential or if it is\noperating above or below it. This uncertainty is at the heart of the genuine disagreements that\nmembers of the FOMC can have regarding the stance of policy.\nNow that I have emphasized the limits of monetary policy, let me now emphasize that there is\nplenty of scope for economic policies — broadly interpreted — to improve the long-run\nperformance of the U.S. economy. So, if long-term economic growth is a concern, there is a\ngreat deal that policy- and lawmakers can do to make our economy function more\nproductively and to cause economic growth to pick up.\nDeterminants of Economic Growth\nTo put my thoughts here in some order, I wish to say more about the determinants of long-\nterm economic growth. The two factors I mentioned a few minutes ago — technology and\ncapital — are great starting points if the goal is to measure the contribution of different factors\nin accounting for economic growth.\nFor instance, this accounting tells us that a country with a low standard of living must have\ninferior business technology and low levels of business and human capital. This is a start,\nsurely, but the accounting does not tell us why this is the case.\nIt turns out that the why remains a bit of a mystery, although much has been said and written\nabout it. For my purposes, I will call this final determinant of economic growth “fair\ncompetition.” By this I mean an environment in which the economic playing field is level and in\nwhich every individual and business has a decent shot at economic success.\n5\n\nYou should have no trouble recognizing this final determinant. In this country, we call it “the\nAmerican Dream.” Economists, as usual, have a more prosaic word for it; they call it the “free\nenterprise system.” They have taught us that barriers to free enterprise are the main reasons\nwhy many countries remain mired in poverty.\nThe technical knowledge needed to improve the standard of living is available — typically\nfreely — but institutions that support fair competition are lacking in many countries. And the\nincentives to improve technology and to invest in business and human capital are seriously\nblunted. So, it is the combination of technology, capital, and fair competition that keeps the\neconomic engine running in good order. If you think in these terms, you will know where\neconomic policy fits into the big growth picture; it fits in primarily to ensure fair competition.\nThis is a fairly abstract view of economic policies, but if you think of some of the landmark laws\nin this country — antitrust laws, insider-trading laws, and IP protection laws, for instance —\nyou would agree that it is a point of view that resonates. You might even argue that our\nFounding Fathers devised our Constitution to ensure fair competition. But let me give you an\nexample of another sort of policy, one that casts a different light on the idea of fair\ncompetition.\nWe live in an increasingly globalized world, and one facet of competition is the competition\nbetween nation states. Countries determine national policies to further the welfare of their\ncitizens, but entities in other countries are indirectly affected by these policies. If corporate tax\nrates are lower in Continental Europe, U.S. businesses have an incentive to locate their profit\ncenters abroad and to “store” their foreign earnings abroad, too.\nHow should American policymakers respond to these incentives? What does fair competition\nmean in this instance?\n6\n\nWell, you know how our government responded: by threatening dire consequences for\ncorporations that relocate for tax reasons. But perhaps lawmakers should ask if the problem is\njust a bunch of errant corporations or if it is a tax code that is not serving the interests our\npeople?\nIn this instance, I think fair competition means that our government should compete with\nother nations to offer a tax code that reduces deadweight losses and improves efficiency.4 We\nknow that our current tax code is far from an optimal one. This is low-hanging fruit. If we can\noffer a more efficient tax system to our citizens, our economic growth will pick up, for sure.\nA Rising Mismatch\nI am now going to talk a bit more about economic growth and human capital because this is a\ntopic that is close to my heart and because it may hold a key to our slow growth.\nAs you are aware, there is lot of anxiety regarding the economic prospects of our young\npeople. If your children are adolescents or young adults, you may personally relate to this\nanxiety. Economists tell us that the college premium has risen substantially over the past three\ndecades.\nA worker who has a high school degree at most can expect to earn substantially less than a\nworker with some college under his or her belt. At the same time, although more and more\nhigh school graduates are attempting to attend college, the fraction earning a college degree\nhas not risen much at all. This results in college completion rates that decline over time.5 This\nleaves more young people saddled with college loan debt, no degree, and without a higher-\npaying job to help pay off the loan.\nThis issue has led our administration to call for efforts to improve college completion rates as\nwell as the access to, and the quality of, a college education. They hope that such initiatives\n7\n\nwill help more young adults find gainful employment in an increasingly knowledge-based\neconomy.\nThe trend of a declining college completion rate is troubling on several dimensions. For\ninstance, why are more students dropping out when there is much to be gained from earning a\ndegree?\nOne reason could be that the average high school curriculum is not rigorous enough to\nprepare students for college. One can observe this possibility by looking at the nation’s low\nproficiency levels in reading and math among 17-year-olds. Another reason could be that\nmany students who pursue a college degree do not feel — rightly or wrongly — that the\naverage curriculum will help them find future employment.\nBe that as it may, the facts seem to be pointing to a rising mismatch between what our\neducation sector offers to students and the skills, training, and knowledge our business sector\nneeds more and more. And this disparity can have a significant impact on the overall health of\nour economy. But the word “mismatch” suggests that businesses always know the kind of\nworkers they want but cannot find them. Is there any evidence of this? Certainly, there is\nanecdotal evidence.\nI have heard employers complain about vacancies they cannot fill because of the lack of a\nqualified applicant pool. So, perhaps we need to try new ways of addressing this issue. For\ninstance, in South Carolina, regional manufacturing firms came together — out of need — to\ndevelop the Apprentice2000 program that trains young adults in Mechatronics, a multi-\ndisciplinary field of engineering.\nThese apprenticeship programs that combine some study with on-the-job training have a\nsignificant impact on the lives of workers and the economy but have had a limited application\nhere in the United States. They are far more prevalent abroad.\n8\n\nIn an assessment and cost-benefit analysis of the Registered Apprenticeship program in 10\nstates, Mathematica Policy Research estimated that, on average, those who completed a\nRegistered Apprenticeship program ― versus those who did not ― could expect to be\ncompensated around $250,000 more over their lifetime, including benefits.6 We can and\nshould expand upon these programs. So, I think the mismatch between what our education\nsector offers and what employers need is indeed real. And it is probably one reason why our\neconomic growth has been slow in coming out of the Great Recession.\nHere is the problem: Economists tell us that a mismatch between supply and demand for a\nparticular good, service, or skill should not be a cause for concern. In a market-based\neconomy, mismatches work themselves out through changes in prices that elicit the\nappropriate responses in demand and supply. But the education sector is unique in this regard.\nIt is surely at the heart of a knowledge-based economy that is not set up to respond swiftly to\nchanges in business demands for new and old skills. This is especially true when these changes\nare not marginal in nature.\nEven when a specific skill set is in demand, and a change in curriculum occurs to meet this,\nthere is significant lag time involved in producing a pipeline of graduates who have acquired\nthese skills.\nSeparately, reflect for a moment on the fact that it is only very recently that the U.S.\nDepartment of Education made detailed earnings information for college graduates publicly\navailable. Until this change, prospective students could not compare the cost of attending a\ncollege with the benefits of doing so.\nWhere there is a lack of information regarding the return on this investment that colleges\noffer, there is a weakened connection with how we make sure workplaces get the skills they\nneed. It is critical that this changes in the future.\n9\n\nIn the meantime, policymakers can reevaluate priorities and ensure that our education policies\nprovide a proper supporting role to the adjustments that need to be made. I see this falling\nwithin the scope of fair competition, where the word “fair” takes on an added meaning and\nurgency. When a large swath of young adults is increasingly ill equipped to have a decent shot\nat economic success, we risk failure on a massive scale.\nClosing\nThis brings me to the end of my talk. I have covered a fair bit of ground with you, so let me\nwrap up by summarizing my main points. First, I think that long-term economic growth is\nfundamental to our future economic well-being. Economic growth has slowed since the mid-\n1990s, and we may remain on a slow growth trajectory for some time to come.\nI talked to you about what we know of the determinants of long-run economic growth, and I\nstressed that monetary policy that successfully delivers on price stability with maximum\nemployment can affect these factors only marginally. Thus, there are limits to what good\nmonetary policy can do for us.\nSecond, I think there is a lot that can be done in the policy space to improve the prospects of\nlong-term economic growth. Reform of the corporate tax system ― to bring it more in line\nwith the tax systems of our main competitors ― is one area where I think progress is possible.\nAlso, I believe our education sector plays a critical role in our nation’s economic growth. It is a\nsector I know quite well, and I am concerned that, without a clear understanding of the return\non investment of a college degree, we are not well adapted to deal with a rapidly globalizing\nworld and fast-paced technological change.\nFinally, I mentioned some initiatives that businesses and government have taken to remedy\nthe growing mismatch between the offerings of the education sector and the demands of\n10\n\nbusiness. I think these are good beginnings, but, with help of policy and lawmakers, more can\nbe done.\nThank you.\n____________________\n1 Nonfarm payroll employment accelerated from a 1.65 percent pace in 2013 to 1.88 percent in 2014 and 2.05\npercent in 2015. In contrast, nonresidential fixed investment grew 3.03 percent in 2013, accelerated to 6.15\npercent in 2014 but slowed again in 2015 to 2.86 percent.\n2 Averaging more than 24 episodes of major financial crises (not including the most recent one), the number of\nyears for per capita output to recover its precrisis level is 7.2 years (Reinhart, Carmen M., and K. Rogoff, This Time\nis Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly, Princeton University Press, 2009, Figure 14.7). U.S. GDP per capita\nbarely surpassed its precrisis level in 2014 — seven years since the onset of the crisis in 2007. Scaled by growth in\nnominal GDP per capita, the value of CoreLogic HPI in 2015 has now recovered to its 2002 level, arguably the last\nyear before the housing boom was underway. Thus, the sector at the center of the financial crisis has also just\nreached normalcy.\n3 According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), under current law the federal debt for 2040 is projected to\nbe 107 percent of GDP. If productivity growth is 0.5 percentage point lower than the baseline projection of 1.3\npercent per year, the projected federal debt would rise to 125 percent of GDP (CBO, Long-Term Budget Outlook,\nJune 2015, Figure 7–3, p. 98).\n4 The U.S.’s top corporate income tax rate of 39 percent is the highest among Organisation of Economic Co-\noperation and Development (OECD) countries. Excluding the U.S., the average top corporate income tax rate\namong OECD countries is 25 percent. Among European OECD countries, the average top corporate income tax\nrate is 24 percent (OECD Tax Database, Table II.1, May 2015).\n5 “Why Have College Completion Rates Declined?

Harker today are my own and not\nnecessarily those of the\nFederal Reserve System or\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nthe Federal Open Market\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia Committee (FOMC).\n\nRight Now, It’s Putting One Foot in Front of the Other\nNational Association of Corporate Directors – New Jersey Chapter Economic Forecast 2025\nPrinceton, New Jersey\nJanuary 9, 2025\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood morning, everyone, and Happy New Year!\nMy thanks to the leadership of the New Jersey Chapter for the invitation to start not just my day,\nbut also my year with you.\nAnd I want to give a special thanks to my fellow South Jerseyan Rick Mroz for that warm\nintroduction.\nI must pause to recognize that as we are gathered here our nation is preparing to bid farewell to\nformer President Jimmy Carter. In fact, at this time, President Carter is on his final trip from the\nCapitol to Washington National Cathedral for his funeral. His life was one dedicated to service\n— to public service but even more so to serving people. What a tremendous legacy.\nIt is a distinct pleasure to be with you all this morning to give you my insights and thoughts on\ncurrent economic conditions and, as best I can, where I think we may be heading. But even\nmore, I am looking forward to having a conversation with you. So, I intend to keep my remarks\nrelatively brief so we can get to the fireside chat with Rick and then open the forum to your\nquestions.\nAllow me to also dispense with the most-official piece of business I must attend to, and that is to\ndeliver the standard Fed disclaimer! So, the views I express today are my own and do not\nnecessarily represent those of my colleagues throughout the Federal Reserve System or on the\nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nAnd, by the way, that’s also the last time some of you may hear me say those words, but more\non that later.\nSo, let’s get going.\nAllow me to state at the outset that, overall, our economy continues to be, arguably, strong and\nstable and indeed among the strongest and most stable in the world.\nThe strength of the U.S. economy has held despite the aftershocks of the pandemic, the runup\nin inflation, higher interest rates as the FOMC responded, and various geopolitical and other\ndevelopments.\nAlthough the torrid pace of the immediate post-pandemic recovery has slowed, GDP has\nmaintained stable, if moderate, growth. The labor markets, overall, while having similarly\ndecelerated from the post-pandemic’s historic lows in unemployment, appear to have stabilized.\nConsumer spending, overall, remains strong and consumer sentiment appears to be on the\nupswing.\n\nThese conditions have allowed us, on the FOMC, to begin the process of rolling the policy\ninterest rate back down and to recalibrate the monetary policy stance with a full percentage\npoint of cuts from September to December 2024. Monetary policy remains restrictive, but less\nso.\nAll in all, the underpinnings of our macro economy remain strong.\nNote, however, that key word, “macro.” I fully understand that, on a family-to-family basis, their\nown economic circumstances may not be mirrored. And, as a policymaker, that’s an important\nthing I must keep in mind. I must always remember that many of the indicators I look at in\nmaking my decisions are actually the accumulation of millions of actions of individuals\nthroughout our nation and throughout our economy. Individually, they are varied and diverse.\nSo, while I can say “our economy is strong,” I know that not every American household or\nbusiness may be benefitting. My goal is to help them be able to do so.\nObviously, one way to do that is to continue the effort to push inflation down to our 2 percent\nannual target. As I mentioned, we’re now nearly three years into this specific work. We have had\na great amount of success in this, as well, as we’ve seen the rate of inflation drop nearly two-\nthirds from its post-pandemic high.\nBut, as we’ve seen over the past several months, inflation has proven to be a little bumpy.\nMoreover, we knew the path would not be a straight, downhill slide — especially if we want to\nstick the soft landing that is our goal. Regardless, while we are on the path back to 2 percent\nthere remain some upside risks, as I’ll discuss in a moment.\nSuffice it to say, it’s just taking a little longer to get back to target than initially anticipated. And\nour overall goal is to make sure that we help ease out the bumps and keep ourselves traveling\nin as smooth a lane as possible. That means remaining data dependent, keeping our eyes\nopen, and not acting with haste.\nThere are positive signs to be sure. For example, shelter disinflation has finally enmeshed itself\ninto the monthly readings after being the upside outlier for many, many months.\nHere in New Jersey, especially, housing prices remain consistently above national averages, but\nto anyone who’s spent any amount of time in this state this not a surprise. We are, historically,\namong the most expensive housing markets in the nation. But recently, the trend line of New\nJersey prices appears to be decreasing in parallel with the national average and not diverging to\nthe upside.\nAdditionally, new building permits in the state jumped above the national average about a year\nago and remain steadily higher. That’s a good sign as it means not only construction\nemployment but also, in the long run, much needed additional housing units.\nWhile this is good news, I will temper it by noting the increase in mortgage delinquencies, which\nis being observed in most counties.1 Yet some of the highest rates of mortgage delinquency in\nNew Jersey are in Cumberland and Salem counties. And I probably don’t have to remind\n1 “November 2024 New Jersey Tri-State Tracking,” Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia,\nhttps://www.philadelphiafed.org/surveys-and-data/regional-economic-analysis/tristate-tracking.\n2\n\nanyone here that those are, historically, among the poorest counties in the state. So, that’s a\ntroubling statistic.\nBut it’s also not just mortgages. The data tracked by the Philly Fed’s Consumer Finance Institute\n(CFI) shows more middle- and moderate-income families and individuals are relying on credit\ncards that are nearing their maximum balances. This is a rather concerning sign that these\nhouseholds are starting to — or continuing to — struggle under the weight of higher prices.\nThere is continued moderate growth in wages, above the inflation rate, but it will take time for\nwages to match the full increase we have seen in the price of essentials since 2020.\nThe implication here is that consumer spending is resting more and more on the shoulders of\nhigher-income earners. The question is whether this is a sustainable scenario.\nI do want to give one more thought on consumers. And this is to also give a plug to the Philly\nFed’s quarterly Labor, Income, Finances, and Expectations — or LIFE — Survey. The data for\nOctober 2024 noted an improvement in consumer sentiment as measured against the previous\nmonths.2\nMore than one-in-four respondents said they were having trouble paying their bills. This was up\nonly slightly from the July 2024 survey, but still represented the highest proportion of responses\nsince the LIFE Survey began looking at this data in early 2023. Moreover, the percentage of\nrespondents who remain insecure about their ability to make ends meet over this upcoming year\nstood relatively unchanged not just from the July report, but roughly over the past year.3\nBut there is a potential bright spot here, as even though respondents’ current conditions may not\nbe fully positive, they expressed net optimism that their income will improve. This was especially\nnoted by younger survey participants. Whether or not that optimism is rewarded obviously\nremains to be seen.\nSome of that optimism could come from the fact that labor markets seem to be stabilized and\nback, largely, in balance. Wage growth has settled out. We have not seen large-scale layoffs\nand employers appear committed to retaining the workers they worked hard to hire in the post-\npandemic chaos.\nCertainly, though, when one looks at the monthly employment numbers, the numbers of new\njobs pales in comparison to the monthly increases registered in the immediate post-pandemic\nyears. However, to me, this should not be viewed as a weak pace of job creation and cause for\nconcern, but rather a deceleration back to trend from the breakneck speed in which we exited\nthe pandemic.\n2 Tom Akana, “Labor, Income, Finances, and Expectations (LIFE) Survey Report — October 2024.”\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, https://www.philadelphiafed.org/-/media/frbp/assets/consumer-\nfinance/reports/life-survey/cfi-life-report-oct-2024.pdf.\n3 Akana, “LIFE Survey Report — July 2024.” Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia,\nhttps://www.philadelphiafed.org/-/media/frbp/assets/consumer-finance/reports/life-survey/cfi-life-report-\njuly-2024.pdf.\n3\n\nOver the past year, the average number of jobs created per month was lower than in the past\ncouple of years; however, it remains consistent with monthly averages seen in the years leading\nup to the pandemic.4\nIn other words, we’re essentially back to where we were in 2018 and 2019, and the economy in\nthose years was strong.\nI am going to keep a close watch on the data to glean whatever nuances I can. But, again, in\nthe overall we are still creating jobs, maybe just not at the pace of the past couple of years.\nWorkers who want a job are still finding one — they may be having to spend a little more time\non the job market, but they are ultimately securing positions.\nAdditionally, both the latest Manufacturing and Nonmanufacturing Business Outlook Surveys\nfrom the Philly Fed report generally optimistic views for both future activity and employment.5 6\nAnd the unemployment rate is roughly where I predicted it would settle.\nMoreover, those who are finding steady employment appear more ready to stay in their current\npositions. At the Philadelphia Fed, we track the rates at which American workers transition from\none employer to another in any given month.7 This is the work of Philly Fed Senior Economic\nAdvisor and Economist Shigeru Fujita, Visiting Scholar Giuseppe Moscarini of Yale University,\nand University College London Professor Fabien Postel-Vinay.\nAs you may expect, that rate of transition jumped post-pandemic as workers chased higher\nwages and — I’m sure in some cases — what they believed were better job fits. However, this\ntransition rate is now back roughly to where it was a decade ago.\nSo, all of this together is evidence to me of a labor market that is stabilizing and finding its\nbalance once again after a few tumultuous years.\nNow, where do I think we go from here?\nUnfortunately, I cannot give you any certainty, because I face none. And in an uncertain world,\npolicy needs to remain data dependent and best positioned to deal with the risks ahead.\nAs I stated at the outset, the overall underpinnings of our economy remain strong. But we\nremain in very unsettled times and there remain, as I said earlier, numerous upside risks.\nGlobally, the war in Ukraine, the situation in the Middle East, and the seeming instability of some\ngovernments in Europe are adding more uncertainty into the overall mix. Here at home, we\nawait potential policy changes which may have an economic impact. And dare I mention the\nimpact that, say, a bird flu outbreak, on top of everything else, could have on food prices.\n4 U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor. January 2017–November 2024,\nhttps://www.bls.gov/.\n5 “December 2024 Manufacturing Business Outlook Survey.” Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia,\nhttps://www.philadelphiafed.org/surveys-and-data/regional-economic-analysis/mbos-2024-12.\n6 “December 2024 Nonmanufacturing Business Outlook Survey.” Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia,\nhttps://www.philadelphiafed.org/surveys-and-data/regional-economic-analysis/nbos-2024-12.\n7 “Fujita, Moscarini, and Postel-Vinay Employer-to-Employer Transition Probability.” Federal Reserve\nBank of Philadelphia, https://www.philadelphiafed.org/surveys-and-data/macroeconomic-data/employer-\nto-employer-transition-probability.\n4\n\nBut, as a policymaker, while I remain cautious of possible upside influences on policy, I can’t\nand won’t deal in hypotheticals. So, while I could, if I wanted to, engage in a parlor game of “if\nthis happens then we could do X and, if not, we could do Y,” that is not my job at this moment.\nMy job is to look at the data, in real time, and make decisions based on where we find ourselves\nat that given moment.\nNow, to be sure, I still see us on a downward policy rate path. Looking at everything before me\nnow, I am not about to walk off this path or turn around. But the exact speed I continue to go\nalong this path will be fully dependent upon the incoming data. Keep in mind, a projection is,\nwell, only a projection. It’s not a promise.\nSo, at this moment, I’m still just putting one foot in front of the other.\nHowever, this opinion is only valid until June 30th! That’s the day when, as many of you already\nknow, I will reach the Federal Reserve’s age and time limit for serving as the president of a\nDistrict Reserve Bank.\nAs I look across the past nearly 10 years in which I have had the honor to serve the Third\nDistrict, I see a lot of which I am proud. Economically, we’ve been able to ride out some heady\ntimes and find ourselves stronger on the back end. But, overall, I am most proud of the\npartnerships we have built across this region — with community leaders, with business leaders,\nand with organizations like NACD-NJ.\nMaintaining a strong, vibrant, and growing regional economy isn’t something that can be done\nbehind closed doors at the Philly Fed or anywhere else. It requires direct and regular outreach.\nIt requires listening intently to voices across the District and then making sure those voices are\nheard at the FOMC conference room table.\nSo many of you, individually and collectively, have been among my eyes and ears across the\npast decade. You’ve helped to not only make my job a little bit easier, but you’ve also helped\nmake it more rewarding. And for that I say, simply, thank you.\nThere are many Philly Fed programs and initiatives which I am going to continue to support and\nbuild upon during the remainder of my tenure. And one of the policy areas which I am focused\non is one which will also impact every one of you and your businesses — the issue of the future\nof higher education and, with it, the future of workforce development.\nAs many of you know, I came to this post from academia — immediately prior as president of\nthe University of Delaware and, before that, as dean of the Wharton School of the University of\nPennsylvania. As a higher education leader and as a professor, I committed my career to\nensuring the students before me were well-prepared to become the workers you could then\nfoster to have successful careers.\nAnd for many years, this pipeline from high school to college to the workforce has been the\npredominant means for upward occupational and economic mobility.\nBut we are now seeing this pipeline narrowing. There are no shortages of stories about\nstudents’ decreasing interest in going to college and, because of this, the decreasing financial\nstability of colleges and universities, especially here in the Northeast. As my Philly Fed\n5\n\ncolleague and Special Advisor for Higher Education Finance Dubravka Ritter has shown in her\nrecent work, numerous schools are teetering on the edge of a cliff — demographically,\nfinancially, and otherwise.8\nSurely, there are many factors at play. For example, the escalating cost of a college education,\nwhen paired with the ongoing student-debt crisis, is making many students and families wonder\nif the investment in a college education is going to pay off in the long run.\nAnd when the financial realities facing numerous institutions are factored in, those colleges and\nuniversities are put further behind an eight ball as potential students and faculty question\nwhether it is worth it to apply to a school which may not make it through the immediate term.\nOn the other end of the scale, those potential workers without a two- or four-year college degree\nwho nevertheless have the skills and drive necessary to succeed, find themselves on the\noutside looking in when job openings require degree attainment.\nBut here’s my take: This isn’t an either-or argument. It really must be a both-and discussion.\nThe fracture that exists between higher education and job training is, at the moment, serving no\none for the better.\nAt the Philly Fed, we recently updated and expanded our online Occupational Mobility Explorer.\nThis tool allows anyone to build a ladder of career success for themselves, either by starting\nwith their current job and — based on their existing skills — see where they can go from there.\nOr, conversely, someone contemplating their career can find their end-goal dream job and work\nbackward down the ladder to see where they can get their initial foothold.\nAdditionally, users can be directly linked to current job openings in their area.9\nEspecially for individuals without a college degree, the Explorer is there to give them proof and\nconfidence that, in a skills-based economy, they can compete and succeed.\nCertainly, some jobs do, and will into the future, require a higher education degree of some\nlevel. But that doesn’t mean there’s not someone out there, right now, who could be a\ncontributing employee and for whom a degree, if it is needed, could come down the line as they\nwork their way up the ladder.\nThe current uncertainty across the higher education landscape is without a doubt going to\nchange the way workers are trained and found. I believe we are at a real inflection point with\nregard to higher education and its future. But no one should be waiting for those ripples to settle\nout and then change their own internal talent-search processes.\n8 Robert Kelchen, Dubravka Ritter & Douglas Webber, “Predicting College Closures\nand Financial Distress.” Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, December 2024,\nhttps://www.philadelphiafed.org/-/media/frbp/assets/working-papers/2024/wp24-20.pdf.\n9 Occupational Mobility Explorer. Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia,\nhttps://www.philadelphiafed.org/surveys-and-data/community-development-data/occupational-mobility-\nexplorer.\n6\n\nAnd, in this effort and others, the Philadelphia Fed will continue to bring our research to the fore\nto help guide discussions and to foster a thriving and inclusive economy across the Third\nDistrict.\nSo, with that all said, I thank you for you being here this morning.\nI thank you, again, for your partnership and friendship over the past nearly ten years. And I\nthank you, as well, for keeping the Third District’s economy moving forward together.\nI look forward to our conversation!\n7",

Harker\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily\nthose of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\nAn Economic Outlook\nThe Bond Club of Philadelphia,\nthe CFA Society of Philadelphia, and\nthe Philadelphia Council for Business Economics\nPhiladelphia, PA\nMay 23, 2016\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nIntroduction\nGood evening. Thanks, Luke, for that kind introduction. It’s always good to see familiar faces\nfrom the Fed.\nI would also like to thank Howard Trauger and the Bond Club of Philadelphia as well as Jeremy\nBach of the CFA Society of Philadelphia for inviting me here to speak with you.\nAn Economic Outlook\nToday, I would like to offer my views on the economy and how they influence my assessment of\nappropriate monetary policy.\n1\n\nI believe that normalization of monetary policy is an important aspect for guaranteeing that the\nU.S. economy remains on a solid path, but the timing of that normalization is also key in\nensuring continued economic growth and a return of inflation to target. It is also important for\nparticipants on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to express their views on the\npolicy process as well as how they anticipate that process will unfold.\nTransparency is a central feature of policy. It helps align the public’s views with those of the\nFOMC’s, allowing policy to proceed more efficiently. Further, it helps avoid unanticipated\noutcomes that could interfere with the intentions of policymakers like me.\nBefore offering my views on the outlook for the U.S. economy and how I believe monetary\npolicy should evolve, I need to provide the following small disclaimer: These views are mine\nalone and do not necessarily reflect those of my colleagues on the FOMC or anyone else in the\nFederal Reserve System.\nEconomic activity of late, at least as measured by headline GDP, has slowed noticeably. After a\nsubdued fourth quarter when real output increased by 1.4 percent, the advance estimate for\nthe first quarter indicated that the economy grew at a mere 0.5 percent.\nPerhaps most troubling was the loss of momentum in consumer spending, which grew at an\nunexpectedly modest rate of 1.9 percent. This growth was significantly weaker than the healthy\n3.10 percent growth achieved last year.\nInvestment was also exceptionally weak, declining by 5.9 percent at an annual rate, but I, like\nmany economic commentators, believe this is temporary and largely induced by two factors:\n(1) the weakness in mining and drilling and (2) the waning drag of a fairly significant\nappreciation of the dollar that’s had a negative impact on our manufacturing sector.\nAn important question is: How much of the weakness in the first quarter GDP report is due to\nresidual problems in seasonal adjustment that have long plagued this series? For example, first\nquarters, from 1985 through 2015, have experienced the lowest annualized growth of any\nquarter in 16 of the 31 years. This is a definite statistical anomaly.\n2\n\nMoreover, first quarter growth has averaged more than a percentage point less than the\ngrowth rates we have witnessed in the succeeding three quarters. Again, a statistically\nsignificant magnitude.\nIf the problem of seasonal adjustment remains, which I am of the opinion that it does, the\ngrowth over the rest of the year should be considerably more upbeat than what transpired in\nthe first quarter.\nA measure we construct at the Philadelphia Fed that incorporates data both on expenditures\nand income, referred to as GDPplus, is immune from seasonality problems and has a number of\nother attractive properties. It indicates that first quarter growth was 1.25 percent, which is\nadmittedly not an overwhelming growth rate, but it is nowhere as troubling as the advance\nGDP estimate.\nWith some of the near term weakness, I remain guardedly optimistic about our economic\nprospects. The labor market remains extraordinarily dynamic.\nAlthough the latest employment report of 160,000 net new jobs surprised most commentators\nto the downside — and although this figure is less than the 200,000 jobs growth we have\nbecome accustomed to — I believe much of the apparent decline can be attributed to\nunseasonably cold weather in April. A so-called unseasonal seasonal.\nWork done at the Philadelphia Fed on “Weather Adjusting for Economic Data” indicates that a\nmore accurate reading of April employment growth would place that number at around\n229,000 net new jobs, implying that the labor market continues to add jobs at a long-run\nunsustainable rate.\nThat number is also more in line with the view obtained from looking at the “Job Openings and\nLabor Turnover Survey” (JOLTS) data, where job opening rates are at near-record levels. In\naddition, quit rates are approximately at their prerecession levels, and hiring rates remain at\nvery healthy levels.\n3\n\nLikewise, we are beginning to see some acceleration in wage growth, especially among those\nremaining in the same job. Anecdotes abound about the difficulty in finding skilled workers in\ncertain job categories. Furthermore, many economic fundamentals remain sound, and our\nfinancial system is in good shape. Income growth is solid, and household balance sheets remain\nhealthy. The latest retail sales numbers confirm the underlying strength of consumers. Also, the\nhousing market continues to grow slowly and steadily, and house prices continue to appreciate.\nI believe it is worth noting that the U.S. economy just weathered a series of very negative\nheadwinds and still continues to grow, for the most part, shrugging off what would probably\nthrow a weaker economy into recession.\nSlowing growth in China has depressed commodity prices and has led to a pronounced\nretrenchment in investment and employment in our energy sectors. The appreciation of the\ndollar has weighed heavily on manufacturing, but even here, there are signs that this sector has\nbottomed out.\nThe Institute of Supply Management Manufacturing Index has nudged into expansionary\nterritory over the past two months, confirming, at the national level, the improvement that has\nbeen seen in several regional surveys. And the sharp and volatile decline we witnessed in equity\nmarkets earlier in the year has subsided, and market indices are now higher on the year. Finally,\nthe price of oil appears to have stabilized at roughly 40 percent above the lows we saw earlier\nthis year. With solid fundamentals and a calming in first quarter headwinds, I anticipate\ncontinued modest economic improvement over the rest of the year.\nLet me also emphasize, that as a policymaker, I think it is important to take a long-term view\nrather than react to short-term volatility and, thus, consider an array of data and longer-term\ntrends in forming my policy stance. As I said, over the longer run, I am relatively optimistic\nabout the health of our economy.\nFocus on the Region\nWhile much of my take on the economy is based on analyzing national economic statistics and\nevaluating their implications through the lenses of other models, I also rely heavily on\n4\n\ninformation gained closer to home. It is often more timely, and, when it comes from our many\ndiverse contacts in the region, it is imbued with a richer texture than mere numbers can\nprovide.\nConditions in the Philadelphia area1 have closely tracked national trends throughout the\ncurrent recovery. Although the area was not hit as hard as the nation during the recession, it\nhas recovered a bit more slowly, taking about one year longer to recover jobs that were lost.\nBut recent job growth has been robust, with around 25,000 jobs — seasonally adjusted — in\nthe first quarter of this year. This is among the region’s top-10 fastest growth rates for any\nthree-month period since 1990.\nContacts in the region say that it seems wage pressures are building, especially among jobs in\nskilled occupations. Further, firms continue to anticipate solid job growth throughout the year.\nThese types of interactions have served to buttress my view that the economy remains on solid\nfooting.\nThe national resurgence of cities and a desire for urban living among millennials and retirees\nalike has had a noticeable impact on Center City Philadelphia and the region as a whole.\nWe’ve seen significant construction activity on projects for multifamily residential, commercial\nretail, new office space, and industrial warehousing.\nLooking at this behavior happening in my own backyard has helped me interpret the evolving\nnature of the construction industry. There are deep structural changes occurring in this industry\nand changes we need to better understand if we will react appropriately as policymakers.\n________________________________________________________\n1The Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington, PA-NJ-DE-MD-MSA includes Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Montgomery, and\nPhiladelphia counties, PA; Burlington, Camden, Gloucester, and Salem counties, NJ; New Castle County, DE; and\nCecil County, MD.\n5\n\nUrban projects that are already in the pipeline will keep local construction workers busy for\nseveral years and have made me more optimistic that both residential and nonresidential\nconstruction will contribute to economic growth going forward.\nInflation Target\nLet me now turn to another important component of the U.S. economy that significantly\ninfluences monetary policy, and that is inflation. This continues to run below the FOMC’s\n2 percent target, especially when considering the headline numbers.\nOver the past 12 months, headline PCE has been growing at only 0.8 percent, while the less\nvolatile core measure has been increasing at a closer-to-target 1.6 percent. Both the decline in\nenergy prices and, to a lesser extent, the appreciation of the dollar, have held down headline\ninflation.\nOther measures of inflation that also remove the more volatile and transitory components of\nprice changes, and thus, reflect a more accurate reading on price pressures, have remained\ncloser to the FOMC’s long-run target. For example, a series the Dallas Fed uses to measure PCE\ninflation — which I highly regard — has inflation growing by 1.8 percent over the past 12\nmonths.\nI believe that, once energy prices stabilize and start reversing, inflation will return to our\n2 percent target by sometime next year. The latest CPI report appears to confirm this view as\nheadline CPI rose by a greater-than-expected 0.4 percent in April, and the details of the report\nsuggest that we will see significant firming in the core PCE index this quarter as well.\nBut as Fed Chair Janet Yellen has emphasized, inflation expectations are also a crucial\ningredient in formulating monetary policy. This is because a divergence of expectations from\nour target would make attaining our inflation target harder to achieve.\nSo far, survey evidence, like that obtained from the Philadelphia Fed’s Survey of Professional\nForecasters, does not indicate any unanchoring of inflation expectations. And while market-\n6\n\nbased measures of inflation expectations are a bit on the low side, they have rebounded\nsomewhat of late and should continue to rebound as inflation returns to target.\nThat said, inflation has been consistently below target for a number of years, and the difficulty\nin bringing inflation back to target does call for careful monitoring of our progress on this front.\nFailure to attain our target — even with the degree of monetary accommodation that has\ncharacterized recent monetary policy — could be considered a downside risk to my fairly\noptimistic view that inflation will return to target relatively quickly.\nHowever, there are also risks to the upside. I believe that wage pressures are building and will\ncontinue to do so as the labor market moves beyond full employment. With productivity\nsomewhat weak, unit labor costs will accelerate, and, at some point, firms will have no choice\nbut to start passing these price pressures onto consumers. Additionally, the rise in energy\nprices, although they should remain at low levels for some time, will contribute to inflation.\nMonetary Policy\nMy approach to policy is to conduct it in ways that will best serve our dual mandate of\nmaximum employment and price stability. Regarding the employment side of our mandate, I\nbelieve we have, for the most part, attained our goal already and that the labor market is\nbasically functioning at full employment.\nOver the medium term, I remain confident that inflation will return to target. Energy prices\nhave rebounded a bit, and with the dollar depreciating slightly as of late, the math is in our\nfavor. This means that these factors will no longer exert a deflationary impact. Thus, I see\nheadline measures falling in line with the more stable core-type measures, and I see upward\npressure on these measures as well.\nAs actual inflation rises, so will market-based measures of inflation expectations, and so the\ncurrent low readings will recover and eliminate one of the risks to normalizing policy. If the\neconomy follows the path I expect it to follow, monetary policy will be overly accommodative\nby historical standards. That will set in motion the possibility of another risk, which is\naccelerating inflation and the need for aggressive policy actions.\n7\n\nThese types of actions that have typically been necessary to rein in accelerating inflation have\nalso been associated with negative economic outcomes. Therefore, we need to minimize the\npossibility that we could once again find ourselves in that predicament.\nAlthough I cannot give you a definitive path for how policy will evolve, I can easily see the\npossibility of two or three rate hikes over the remainder of the year. That said, all forecasts are\nsubject to fairly wide confidence bands, and mine is no exception.\nSo, even though I am aware that many of you are growing tired of the phrase “data\ndependent,” that is exactly what I will be. In the end, it is the tried-and-true way for conducting\nmonetary policy.\nClosing\nIn summary, I believe that as we move into the second half of the year with economic activity\ngrowing at trend or slightly above trend — the unemployment rate below its natural rate —\nand price pressures starting to assert themselves, policy can truly normalize.\nI mean this in the sense that we can meaningfully move away from the zero lower bound and\nthat our reaction to incoming data can return to a more historical pattern. That would not\nnecessarily imply an overly aggressive path for policy. As I said, there will likely be two or\nperhaps even three rate hikes over the course of the year.\nWe should proceed slowly for two reasons: (1) because it may take some time for inflation to\nbegin moving up in a sustainable fashion and (2) because the neutral funds rate is probably a\ngood deal lower than it was 15 years ago. Thus, it will take fewer rate hikes to attain neutrality\nin policy. By historical standards, that in itself implies a somewhat shallower path for interest\nrates than was typical of past recoveries.\nThank you. I believe we have some time for questions.\n8",

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\n“Doing Nothing” Is S�ll Doing a Lot\nNa�onal Associa�on of Corporate Directors Webinar\nNACD New Jersey and Philadelphia Chapters\nPhiladelphia, PA (virtual)\nOctober 16, 2023\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Execu�ve Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood a�ernoon, everyone.\nI appreciate that you’re all giving up part of the end of your workday for us to be together, if only\nvirtually.\nMy thanks to my good friend, Rick Mroz, for that welcome and introduc�on.\nI do believe we’re going to have a produc�ve session. But just so you all know, as much as I enjoy\nspeaking and providing my outlook, I enjoy a good conversa�on even more.\nSo, first, let’s take a few minutes so I can give you my perspec�ve on where we are headed, and then I\nwill be more than happy to take ques�ons and hear what’s on your minds.\nBut before we get into any of that, I must begin with the standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express\ntoday are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market\nCommitee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\nPut simply, this is one of those �mes where the opera�ve words are, “Pat said,” not “the Fed said.”\nNow, to begin, I’m going to first address the two topics that I get asked about most o�en: interest rates\nand infla�on. And I would guess they are the topics front and center in many of your minds as well.\n1\n\nA�er the FOMC’s last policy rate hike in July, I went on record with my view that, if economic and\nfinancial condi�ons evolved roughly as I expected they would, we could hold rates where they are. And I\nam pleased that, so far, economic and financial condi�ons are evolving as I expected, if not perhaps even\na tad beter.\nLet’s look at the current dynamics. There is a steady, if slow, disinfla�on under way. Labor markets are\ncoming into beter balance. And, all the while, economic ac�vity has remained resilient.\nGiven this, I remain today where I found myself a�er July’s mee�ng: Absent a stark turnabout in the data\nand in what I hear from contacts, I believe that we are at the point where we can hold rates where they\nare.\nIn barely more than a year, we increased the policy rate by more than 5 percentage points and to its\nhighest level in more than two decades — 11 rate hikes in a span of 12 mee�ngs prior to September. We\nnot only did a lot, but we did it very fast.\nWe also turned around our balance sheet policy — and we will con�nue to �ghten financial condi�ons\nby shrinking the balance sheet.\nThe workings of the economy cannot be rushed, and it will take some �me for the full impact of the\nhigher rates to be felt. In fact, I have heard a plea from countless contacts, asking to give them some\n�me to absorb the work we have already done.\nI agree with them. I am sure policy rates are restric�ve, and, as long they remain so, we will steadily\npress down on infla�on and bring markets into a beter balance.\nHolding rates steady will let monetary policy do its work. By doing nothing, we are s�ll doing something.\nAnd I would argue we are doing quite a lot.\nHeadline PCE infla�on remained elevated in August at 3.5 percent year over year, but it is down 3\npercentage points from this �me last year. About half of that drop is due to the vola�le components of\n2\n\nenergy and food that, while basic necessi�es, they are typically excluded by economists in the so-called\ncore infla�on rate to give a more accurate assessment of the pace of disinfla�on and its likely path\nforward.\nWell, core PCE infla�on has also shown clear signs of progress, and the August monthly reading was its\nsmallest month-over-month increase since 2020.\nSo, yes, a steady disinfla�on is under way, and I expect it to con�nue. My projec�on is that infla�on will\ndrop below 3 percent in 2024 and level out at our 2 percent target therea�er.\nHowever, there can be challenges in assessing the trends in disinfla�on. For example, September’s CPI\nreport came out modestly on the upside, driven by energy and housing.\nLet me be clear about two things. First, we will not tolerate a reaccelera�on in prices. But second, I do\nnot want to overreact to the normal month-to-month variability of prices. And for all the fancy\ntechniques, the best way to separate a signal from noise remains to average data over several months.\nOf course, to do so, you need several months of data to start with, which, in turn, demands that, yes, we\nremain data dependent but pa�ent and cau�ous with the data.\nTurning to the jobs picture, I do an�cipate na�onal unemployment to end the year at about 4 percent —\njust slightly above where we are now — and to increase slowly over the next year to peak at around 4.5\npercent before heading back toward 4 percent in 2025. That is a rate in line with what economists call\nthe natural rate of unemployment, or the theore�cal level in which labor market condi�ons support\nstable infla�on at 2 percent.\nNow, that said, as you know, there are many factors that play into the calcula�on of the unemployment\nrate. For instance, we’ve seen recent months where, even as the economy added more jobs, the\nunemployment rate increased because more workers moved off the sidelines and back into the labor\nforce. There are many other dynamics at play, too, such as technological changes or public policy issues,\nlike child care or immigra�on, which directly impact employment.\n3\n\nAnd beyond the hard data, I also have to balance the so� data. For example, in my discussions with\nemployers throughout the Third District, I hear that given how hard they’ve worked to find the workers\nthey currently have, they are doing all they can to hold onto them.\nSo, to sum up the labor picture, let me say, simply, I do not expect mass layoffs.\nI do expect GDP gains to con�nue through the end of 2023, before pulling back slightly in 2024. But even\nas I foresee the rate of GDP growth modera�ng, I do not see it contrac�ng. And, again, to put it simply, I\ndo not an�cipate a recession.\nLook, this economy has been nothing if not unpredictable. It has proven itself unwilling to s�ck to\ntradi�onal modeling and seems determined to not only bend some rules in one place, but to make up its\nown in another. However, as frustra�ngly unpredictable as it has been, it con�nues to move along.\nAnd this has led me to the following thought: What has fundamentally changed in the economy from,\nsay, 2018 or 2019? In 2018, infla�on averaged 2 percent almost to the decimal point and was actually\nbelow target in 2019. Unemployment averaged below 4 percent for both years and was as low as 3.5\npercent — both na�onwide and in our respec�ve states — while policy rates peaked below 2.5 percent.\nNow, I’m not saying we’re going to be able to exactly replicate the prepandemic economy, but it is hard\nto find fundamental differences. Surely, I cannot and will not minimize the immense impacts of the\npandemic on our lives and our families, nor the fact that for so many, the new normal s�ll does not feel\nnormal. From the cold lens of economics, I do not see underlying fundamental changes. I could also be\nwrong, and, trust me, that would not be the first �me this economy has made me rethink some of the\nclassic models. We just won’t know for sure un�l we have more data to look at over �me.\nAnd then, of course, there are the economic uncertain�es — both na�onal and global — against which\nwe also must contend. The ongoing auto worker strike, among other labor ac�ons. The restart of student\nloan payments. The poten�al of a government shutdown. Fast-changing events in response to the tragic\natacks against Israel. Russia’s ongoing war against Ukraine. Each and every one deserves a close watch.\n4\n\nThese are the broad economic signals we are picking up at the Philadelphia Fed, but I would note that\nthe regional ones we follow are also poin�ng us forward.\nFirst, while in the Philadelphia Fed’s most recent business outlook surveys, which survey manufacturing\nand nonmanufacturing firms in the Third District, month-over-month ac�vity declined, the six-month\noutlooks for each remain op�mis�c for growth.\nAnd we also publish a monthly summary metric of economic ac�vity, the State Coincident Indexes. In\nNew Jersey, the index is up slightly year over year through August, which shows generally posi�ve\ncondi�ons. However, the three-month number from June through August was down, and while both\npayroll employment and average hours worked in manufacturing increased during that �me, so did the\nunemployment rate — though a good part of that increase can be explained as more residents moved\nback into the labor force.\nAnd for those of you joining us from the western side of the Delaware River, Pennsylvania’s coincident\nindex is up more than 4 percent year over year through August and 1.7 percent since June. Payroll\nemployment was up, and the unemployment rate was down; however, the number of average hours\nworked in manufacturing decreased.\nThere are also promising signs in both states in terms of business forma�on. The number of applica�ons,\nspecifically, for high-propensity businesses — those expected to turn into firms with payroll — are\nremaining elevated compared with prepandemic levels. Again, a promising sign.\nSo, it is against this full backdrop that I have concluded that now is the �me at which the policy rate can\nremain steady. But I can hear you ask: “How long will rates need to stay high.” Well, I simply cannot say\nat this moment. My forecasts are based on what we know as of late 2023. As �me goes by, as\nadjustments are completed, and as we have more data and insights on the underlying trends, I may need\nto adjust my forecasts, and with them my �me frames.\nI can tell you three things about my views on future policy. First, I expect rates will need to stay high for a\nwhile.\n5\n\nSecond, the data and what I hear from contacts and outreach will signal to me when the �me comes to\nadjust policy either way. I really do not expect it, but if infla�on were to rebound, I know I would not\nhesitate to support further rate increases as our objec�ve to return infla�on to target is, simply, not\nnego�able.\nThird, I believe that a resolute, but pa�ent, monetary policy stance will allow us to achieve the soft\nlanding that we all wish for our economy.\nBefore I conclude and turn things over to Rick to kick off our Q&A, I do want to spend a moment on a\ntopic that he and I recently discussed, and it’s something about which I know there is generally great\ninterest: fintech. In fact, I understand there is discussion about NACD hos�ng a conference on fintech.\nWell, last month, we at the Philadelphia Fed hosted our Seventh Annual Fintech Conference, which\nbrought business and thought leaders together at the Bank for two days of real in-depth discussions. And\nI am extraordinarily proud of the fact that the Philadelphia Fed’s conference has emerged as one of the\npremier conferences on fintech, anywhere. Not that it’s a compe��on.\nI had the pleasure of opening this year’s conference, which always puts a focus on shi�s in the fintech\nlandscape. Much of this year’s conference centered around developments in digital currencies and\ncrypto — and, believe me, some of the discussions were a litle, shall we say, “spirited.” However, my\noverarching point to atendees was the following: Regardless of one’s views, whether in favor of or\nagainst such currencies, our reality requires us to move from thinking in terms of “what if” to thinking\nabout “what next.”\nIn many ways, we’re beyond the stage of thinking about crypto and digital currency and into the stage of\nhaving them as reality — just as AI has moved from being the stuff of science fic�on to the stuff of\neveryday life. What is needed now is cri�cal thinking about what is next. And we at the Federal Reserve,\nboth here in Philadelphia and System-wide, are focused on being part of this discussion.\nWe are also focused on providing not just thought leadership but actionable leadership. For example,\nthe Fed rolled out our new FedNow instant payment service platform in July. With FedNow, we will have\na more nimble and responsive banking system.\n6\n\nTo be sure, FedNow is not the first instant payment system — other systems, whether operated by\nindividual banks or through third parties, have been operational for some time. But by allowing banks to\ninteract with each other quickly and efficiently to ensure one customer’s payment becomes another’s\ndeposit, we are fulfilling our role in providing a fair and equitable payment system.\nAnother area where the Fed is assuming a mantle of leadership is in quantum compu�ng, or QC, which\nhas the poten�al to revolu�onize security and problem-solving methodologies throughout the banking\nand financial services industry. But that upside also comes with a real downside risk, should other not-\nso-friendly actors co-opt QC for their own purposes.\nRight now, individual ins�tu�ons and other central banks globally are expanding their own research in\nQC. But just as these ins�tu�ons look to the Fed for economic leadership, so, too, are they looking to us\nfor technological leadership. So, I am especially proud that this System-wide effort is being led from right\nhere at the Philadelphia Fed.\nI could go on and talk about fintech for much longer. A�er all, I’m actually an engineer more than I am an\neconomist. But I know that Rick is interested in star�ng our conversa�on, and I am sure that many of you\nare ready to par�cipate.\nBut one last thought on fintech — my answers today aren’t going to be generated by ChatGPT.\nOn that note, Rick, thanks for allowing me the �me to set up our discussion, and let’s start with the Q&A.\n7",

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nConversations with Superheroes\nRutgers University–Camden Commencement 2019\nCamden, NJ\nMay 22, 2019\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nHello, Class of 2019 — and congratulations!\nI want to talk to you today about resilience. About hard work and perseverance. About people\nwho face challenges and overcome odds.\nYes, I’m talking about … me.\nSure, you guys have worked hard to get to graduation day, and this is an incredible moment for\nyou.\nBut do you have any idea, the pressures of the commencement circuit?!\nI mean, you’re probably asking yourself right now, “Who is this guy? Man, I wish I’d graduated\nin 2015.” You know who gave the commencement address in 2015? Jon Bon Jovi.\nHow am I supposed to top that?\nI could focus on giving a great speech, but that’s a high bar, too.\nPractical advice? The “always wear sunscreen” speech already won that category.\nJokes? I’m a Fed president. I have to be very careful about what I say, especially anything\npolitical. So, there goes most of the material.\nPlus ... I’m a Fed president. We are constitutionally unfunny.\nThat leaves me with the only category of commencement speeches left: inspiration.\n1\n\nThankfully, I have good material. Because all kidding aside, I do want to talk about resilience.\nBut I want to talk about yours.\nI have all the facts and figures on the Class of 2019. But I also have a particular insight on\nRutgers–Camden students because Chancellor Haddon is on the Philadelphia Fed’s board of\ndirectors.\nWe spend part of those meetings getting feedback from our directors on their industries and\nsectors. And along with the updates on fiscal issues and education trends, Phoebe never fails to\ntalk about her students. She never fails to emphasize just how hard you work, just how much of\nyourselves you put into your education, and just how much you give back to Camden.\nSo I could already infer a lot from what Google can tell me — this is an incredibly diverse\nstudent body that draws veteran, international, and first-generation students. You’re actively\nengaged with the city, and help make Rutgers–Camden an anchor institution. You’re out there\nworking, getting real-life experience. But I also know what I hear from the person who sees you\nevery day. And she confirms what I could infer: You are special.\nYou work hard. You live and study alongside people from totally different backgrounds. You’re\nout in the community, making a difference.\nAnd I know it’s not easy. Especially if you’re the first in the family to go to college. Especially if\nyou’re in a brand new country. Especially if you’re coming back to school or returning from\nmilitary service.\nThe word Phoebe uses most is “resilience.”\nWe’re in the middle of a long-overdue cultural conversation in this country about privilege.\nAbout the ways people are and aren’t afforded access. About how the accident of birth — who\nyou’re born to, where you’re born, and what body you’re born into — can give you an artificial\nhead start or unfairly put up roadblocks.\n2\n\nBut I want you to know, whatever privilege you may or may not have, whatever hurdles are or\naren’t in the way … that resilience you have? That’s an advantage that puts you 10 yards ahead\nof everyone else. That’s your superpower.\nThat resilience means you’ll survive disappointment, because it will come. And a lot of it will be\neven worse than having me as your commencement speaker when Colorado College got Oprah.\nThat resilience means you’ll know who you are — not every day, and not all the time, because\nlife isn’t that simple. But it will center you in times of doubt, and it will always lead you back to\nyourself.\nThat resilience means you’ll experience more joy, and more fulfillment, because you’ll know\nhow to see the true value of things. You’ll know substance means more than style and\nappreciate the small things in life — and you’ll understand that sometimes the little things\naren’t little at all.\nThat resilience means you’ll speak up, and you’ll show up. It means you’ll be there for other\npeople because you already know one of life’s most valuable lessons: No one does anything\nentirely on their own. It will give you the grace to share credit, and the humility to see others’\ncontributions.\nThat resilience makes you exceptional. Don’t ever doubt that, and don’t ever forget it.\nAnd I can’t wait for you to go out in the world and use your superpower. I can’t wait to see the\ngood you do and the change you unleash.\nAnd when one of you is standing where I am today, giving the commencement address to\nanother outstanding class of Rutgers–Camden graduates, I hope you’ll look back and take a few\nlessons from today:\nBe more famous than me — which shouldn’t be hard.\nTell better jokes than me — which should be easy.\nAnd if you can’t be famous, and you can’t be funny, be inspirational. Tell them how you used\nyour superpower. Tell them how you changed the world. Because I know you will. Thank you.\n3",

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood morning, and thank you. And congratulations! This is a wonderful day. You’ve\naccomplished so much, and your friends and families are so proud of you … give yourselves a\nround of applause.\nThat’s an old trick to make it look like you were giving me standing ovations from the beginning\n…\nSome of you are probably wondering why a Fed president is giving the commencement address\nto graduates in the field of health. The answer is that I can’t charge a speaker’s fee, so I’m cheap.\nI’m just kidding … or at least I think I am. President Klasko?\nBut in all seriousness, there is some method to the madness. For one, I can tell you that you’ve\nmade an economically sound career choice. And you know it’s true because I’ve just established\nthat they can’t pay me to say it. Also, the data back me up — health care is one of the fastest\ngrowing sectors out there, and it’s set to keep expanding for the foreseeable future.\nSo graduates, you have the security of entering a job market full of opportunities. Which means,\nparents, you have the security of knowing they won’t be moving back in with you.\nThere’s also an inextricable link between physical and economic well-being. In the research\ncanon on creating economically strong communities, health is a critical factor. In fact, there’s a\n1\n\nton of research out there on how important health is to every aspect of life. It affects children’s\nprospects in education and achievement. It affects people’s ability to work and succeed in their\ncareers. It affects entire neighborhoods’ economic potential. And it affects people’s ability to\nhope.\nYou’re graduating at a time when medicine is more advanced than ever before. But perhaps the\nmost necessary and healing tool you possess predates Hippocrates. It’s the hope you give to\npeople who are suffering. That’s both the power to heal and the ability to act as a touchstone.\nThere’s an energy that attaches itself to graduation season. Across the country, you and your\npeers are headed into a world of endless possibilities.\nIt’s an air of hope. Because hope, fundamentally, is the ability to see a bright future.\nIt can be easy to forget, on days like today, that there are pockets dotting the American landscape\nwhere hope is in short supply. You’re going to see it more than other people because you’re\ngoing to see the effects close up.\nYou’ll see it in the opioid epidemic. You’ll see it in what recent research calls “deaths of\ndespair.” You’ll see it in communities that have struggled through years of neglect.\nThe effects are devastating, and they have a ripple effect across the entire health-care spectrum.\nSome of you will encounter it directly, some indirectly, but it’s likely it will touch you all\nprofessionally in some capacity.\nWhat strikes me is that the areas of the country that are struck low by the intersection of poor\nhealth and dim economic prospects, the areas that are most affected by these crises, are caught in\na spiral of hopelessness. Your connections with people, the part you’ll play in giving them hope,\ncan be life changing. In the words of Desmond Tutu: “Hope is being able to see that there is light\ndespite all of the darkness.”\nThat’s something to remember when you start your careers because the impact of working in\nhealth resonates far beyond treating a single malady. And it’s something to remember when you\nreach the midpoint, when you’re burned out from being down in the trenches, or when you start\n2\n\nto question why you went into this field in the first place. Because believe me, there will be that\ntime. Everyone has it.\nSo, when it happens, remember that you’re helping to heal people. You’re giving them back their\nhope, and that’s crucially important. And that goes for everyone here, whether it’s hands-on\nwork with patients, research, or being part of managing the overall system.\nFrankly, anyone who helps to tame the bureaucracy of health care deserves a congressional\nmedal of honor …\nSo today, in the commencement address tradition of dispensing advice, I’m not going to tell you\nto live every day like it’s your last. I’m not going to tell you to dream the impossible dream. I’m\nnot going to tell you to change the world via disruption, although certainly feel free to do all\nthose things. Instead, I’ll just tell you about the immense power of human interaction and that\nyou can change the world one quiet, empathetic, kind moment at a time.\nKeep that with you. You bring hope. You are hope. Never forget that.\nAnd never forget that wherever we wind up, none of us got there alone. Whether it’s friends,\nfamilies, partners, or even just those who let you borrow their notes when you overslept,\nsomeone helped you get here today.\nSo, I want to take a moment to applaud them, the people in the audience who helped today’s\ngraduates get here, the people who aren’t here but made all the difference, the people who sat\nbeside you in class, and the ones who stood up in front and taught.

    "text": "Revisiting the Discourse on Dynamism\nPhiladelphia Council for Business Economics\nA Chapter of the National Association for Business Economics\nPhiladelphia, PA\nApril 4, 2019\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nRevisiting the Discourse on Dynamism\nPhiladelphia Council for Business Economics\nA Chapter of the National Association for Business Economics\nPhiladelphia, PA\nApril 4, 2019\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nAlmost exactly a year ago, I was addressing the New York chapter of NABE in Midtown Manhattan. And\nit strikes me that, much like show business and politics, a year is a long time in economics, but there are,\nin fact, some strong similarities between now and then: Both components of the Fed’s dual mandate are\nin good health, my outlook is fairly positive, and I’m standing in front of a group of business economists.\nAlthough the commute was much shorter this time.\nI’ve therefore been thinking a lot about the topic I addressed at that event, which is perhaps even more\nrelevant today. Because, of course, while some aspects of the landscape have stayed the same, many\nothers have changed.\nSo with your indulgence, I’d like to revisit that subject and discuss the continued decline of business\ndynamism in the American economy. Some new research out of the Philadelphia Fed adds an interesting\ndimension, and it’s something I know business economists are thinking about right now.\nBefore I get to that, however, I’ll start with an economic outlook and preface my thoughts with the one\nthing that never changes: the standard Fed disclaimer … The views I express here today are mine alone\nand do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\nLabor Market\nTurning first to employment, the labor market continues to show sustained strength. February’s jobs\nnumbers were significantly lower than both market forecasts and previous months. However, it would\nbe a mistake to allow one month’s data to obscure the robust growth and continued tightening of the\n1\n\npast several years. In fact, I always caution that a single data series or report should not, on its own,\nderail an outlook; we look at that information in context, and the Fed’s mantra of “data driven” means\nthinking about how things unfold in the medium term.\nFor the past half-year, job creation has averaged 190,000 a month — showing stamina that has, frankly,\nsurprised many of us. At some point, the number of net new jobs will necessarily fall, but even then, it\nshould not be taken as a harbinger of economic doom. Somewhere around 100,000 a month will be\nmore than sufficient to keep up with growth in the labor force.\nAnother metric that’s surpassed expectations is the number of people coming off the sidelines, which is\nshowing up in the data in various ways: In the instances that the unemployment rate ticked slightly\nupward in recent months, for example, it has been reflective of more people coming into the labor\nforce.\nAll in all, I see a strong labor market, with unemployment continuing to move down, likely reaching a\nbasement in the 3½ percent range this year before ticking back up a few tenths of a percentage point.\nInflation\nAfter several years of running persistently below our preferred 2 percent target, inflation finally started\nrunning about that rate. In recent months, it’s edged back down somewhat.\nI see inflation averaging slightly higher than 2 percent this year and next, which is not out of line with\nhow I view our target. Running a little higher after such a long period of underperformance is not, in my\nmind, a red flag. The Fed has a symmetrical target, which means I’m equally concerned about\npersistently low inflation as I would be about its opposite.\nAgain, my focus is on the medium term average, and what I’m watching in particular is inflation’s\ntrajectory — that is, not just its direction, but the speed at which it travels.\nAs with all things policy related, I’ll be driven by the data. In particular, I’m giving weight to core inflation\nfor a better view of the fundamentals, as fluctuations in energy prices are likely to affect the headline\nmetric.\nGDP\nTurning to GDP, I see growth a bit above 2 percent for this year, returning to trend of around 2 percent\nsome time in 2020.\n2\n\nThere has been a good deal of discussion in recent days and weeks of what some call “disappointing”\ngrowth projections such as my own. When advance estimates for Q1 GDP are issued in a few weeks,\nthose voices will likely be amplified: I expect Q1 of 2019 to come in around 1.5 percent. This actually\nreflects a pattern of several years’ running, in which first quarters have consistently seen low or negative\ngrowth. However, those have balanced out when the following quarters pick up steam, which is what I\nforesee for 2019. Overall, it’s important to remember that we are still looking at continued economic\ngrowth, and are on pace for the longest economic expansion in our history. That doesn’t fall into the\ncategory of “disappointing” for me.\nI also do not think the growth forecast should be entirely surprising, since it reflects well-documented\nstructural forces, rather than transitory ones. The impact of demographics, for instance, has been\ncentral to discussions of labor force participation in recent years, and that impact, in turn, has played a\npart in the continued slowing of productivity.\nOutlook and Policy Decisions\nI still see the outlook as a net positive. That said, there are some risks I’m paying close attention to. First,\nalthough household spending continues at a strong, sustained pace, businesses report increasing\nuncertainty and decreasing confidence, dampening the investment outlook somewhat. Second, global\nfactors continue to hold my attention, including growth forecasts abroad and trade developments.\nAnd, of course, there is the renewed concern about the yield curve. While it has often been the case\nthat inversions in the yield curve have preceded downturns, a couple of points bear mention,\nparticularly because they offer some assurance.\nFirst, as we all learned in econ classes, correlation does not equal causation, and while there appears to\nbe a relationship between yield curve inversions and recessions, it’s not a foolproof indicator. Second,\nthe playing field is different this time around. The Fed’s balance sheet is still historically large —\nsomething I’ll touch on in a moment — which may be influencing long-term yields.\nUltimately, my views are shaped by multiple indicators, and there are certainly aspects of the economy\n— the strength of the labor market, for instance — that point to a fundamentally sound U.S. economy.\nAccounting for all those factors — a strong labor market, muted inflation, sustained moderate growth,\nand the penumbra of uncertainty — I continue to be in wait-and-see mode, and my outlook for rates\nremains, at most, one hike for 2019 and one for 2020.\n3\n\nI will add here that much has been made of the FOMC’s use of “patience” in discussing the future path\nof monetary policy. I agree that patience is necessary and would, in fact, draw in other of the Seven\nVirtues: Temperance guiding a moderated and thoughtful response to accumulated data; Diligence in\nwatching and evaluating that data; and, of course, Humility, in knowing that as and when those data\nindicate, we are ready and willing to change our outlooks in accordance.\nI ask for Charity only from audiences who think I’m being long-winded …\nBefore I turn to the subject for today, I do want to visit the topic of the balance sheet, as promised. My\nopening caveat here is that, while the balance sheet is clearly part of the discussion of monetary policy,\nit is not currently indicative of our monetary policy stance.\nAs noted after the March FOMC meeting, we intend to end the balance sheet runoff in September,\nresuming the reinvestment of all principal payments. Paydowns from MBS, subject to a cap of $20 billion\nper month, will be reinvested into Treasuries, which is consistent with our long-standing plans to hold\nprimarily Treasuries in our portfolio.\nThis will not quite be the end of normalization. In September, when the runoff ends, reserves will likely\nstill be somewhat above the level needed to efficiently and effectively implement monetary policy, and\nour ultimate goal for reserves is “no more than necessary.”\nWe intend to keep the size of our aggregate securities holdings constant for some time after the\nSeptember end to runoffs. During this period, we will see a very — and I do stress “very” — gradual\ndecrease in average reserves, as currency and other non-reserve liabilities grow over time.\nFor me, a key issue is that we only have estimates of the demand for reserves, which means we should\napproach the “efficient and effective” level with caution.\nThis slow and steady approach, which is based on work by the Philadelphia Fed staff,1 is not only the\nsafer option, it has the additional advantage of reducing uncertainty about the evolution of asset\nredemptions, and proceeds in the FOMC’s preferred “gradual and predictable manner.”\nSince we started unwinding in October of 2017, we stressed that the process would be entirely\nmundane — the balance sheet was put essentially on autopilot and moved to the background. Boredom\nmay not be a virtue, though we might invoke Continence in its place. And it was, in fact, entirely\n1 I would like to thank Roc Armenter for his research and insight.\n4\n\nunremarkable — and unremarked upon — until earlier this year. While there will likely be continued\ndiscussion, particularly about composition, I do believe it will — and should — be entirely excitement-\nfree.\nIn the vernacular of the FOMC’s “toolkit” as we often refer to it: Balance sheet policy certainly remains\nan option should we need it — that is, should we again see a situation in which the federal funds rate\nalone cannot provide sufficient accommodation. But we’ve put it back in the toolbox, and stored it in\nthe basement — within arm’s reach, but out of sight for now.\nBusiness Dynamism\nThis brings me, somewhat meanderingly, to the subject I want to address.\nThe U.S. economy has historically been characterized by an elevated level of dynamism. For the\nuninitiated, the U.S. is certainly “dynamic” in the colloquial sense of being innovative and imaginative,\nbut in this case, “dynamism” refers to the economic measure that is defined by turnover: New\nbusinesses enter the market and others leave, workers move from job to job, and people come in and\nout of the workforce.\nThis perpetual churn makes resources more fluid. Labor and capital are freed to flow from the least to\nthe most productive firms, and productivity, wages, and overall economic growth increase.\nOver the past three decades or so, dynamism has been in decline. In particular, the data show lower\nbusiness start-up activity, slowing labor reallocation, and much less worker mobility. During much of\nthat time — roughly the past 20 years — there’s also been a drop in productivity growth.\nWe don’t know the strength of the relationship between these two, or, indeed, if there is one. But these\nand other economic trends raise interesting possibilities and points for consideration.\nDynamism in Decline\nTo set the stage, we can see the decline in both dynamism and entrepreneurship since the early 1980s\nin a variety of measures.\n5\n\nOn the firm side, the new start-up rate has deteriorated by close to 40 percent, while the exit rate has\nbeen more or less flat.2 The result is a net start-up rate that has not just slowed, but has moved into\nnegative territory.\nI know this runs completely counter to intuition. For most of us, that time is inextricably linked to start-\nup culture. That’s when companies that would eventually become giants started with a couple of people\nin a garage. That’s when the landscape of business was changed by the dot-com boom — and saw its\nsubsequent bust — then rebounded to fundamentally alter the way we communicate and generated a\nworld of tech start-ups and angel investors. But activity in start-ups reaches far wider than technology,\nand entrepreneurship is not confined to Silicon Valley. We’re also talking about mom-and-pop shops\nand local small businesses.\nThe IPO rate — a measure that has been linked to encouraging entrepreneurship and start-up activity —\nis also falling, while M&A activity has been strong, particularly over the past decade. The end result here\nis that industries are becoming increasingly concentrated, and the average listed company is bigger,\nolder, and more profitable.3\nOn the worker side, people are now more likely to be employed at large, mature firms and are much less\nmobile than they used to be.\nThe share of employment at smaller and medium-sized younger firms has fallen from about 20 percent\nto 10 percent in the past few decades, while the proportion of workers at larger, older firms has risen\nfrom about 40 percent to 50 percent.4\nThe rate of job reallocation is falling as well — that is, the number of jobs added to and subtracted from\nthe economy. We think of this churn as a central feature of the U.S. labor market, but the reallocation\nrate has actually fallen by about 22 percent since the early ’90s.5\n2 Ryan A. Decker, John Haltiwanger, Ron S. Jarmin, and Javier Miranda, “Declining Business Dynamism: Implications\nfor Productivity?” Hutchins Center Working Paper 23 (September 2016).\n3 Credit Suisse, “The Incredible Shrinking Universe of Stocks, The Causes and Consequences of Fewer U.S. Equities”\n(March 2017).\n4 John Haltiwanger, “Top Ten Signs of Declining Business Dynamism and Entrepreneurship in the U.S.,” a paper\npresented at Kauffman Foundation New Entrepreneurial Growth Conference (June 2015).\n5 John Haltiwanger (2015).\n6\n\nWorkers are also much less mobile than they used to be. People aren’t moving for work the way they\nused to, and when they do, they don’t go as far. The rate of people moving out of state has dropped to\nless than half the average level we saw in the quarter century that followed the Second World War.6\nThe Impact of Dynamism\nWhile the data clearly point to a decline in turnover and dynamism, there’s a logical argument that asks,\n“So what?” Isn’t it possible that this is the natural state of an economy settling into middle age? What’s\nwrong with older, bigger, more profitable firms hiring people who stay around longer?\nThe very short answer is: innovation and jobs — in the case of the latter, both the number and the\nquality.\nTaking those in turn, innovation intensity is more common in younger, smaller firms. Smaller companies\nspend more on R&D as a proportion of sales, and research shows that the quality of innovation — as\nmeasured by patent citations — is inversely proportionate to firm size.7 Older, more staid organizations\nachieve productivity growth from entering and exiting markets, or from expanding and contracting their\nphysical presence, like offices or factories. A significant portion of industry-level growth in\nmanufacturing, for instance, is achieved this way.\nHigh productivity firms also grow faster, contributing to overall productivity growth.\nNew firms additionally provide job opportunities. That’s not to say that older firms don’t produce jobs —\ngenerally through continued growth, acquisition, and consolidation across industries. But fast-growing\nbusinesses, which tend to be young, have historically accounted for a substantial portion of job creation,\naveraging about 70 percent of gross annual job creation in the decades spanning 1992–2011.8 And\noverall, more fluid labor markets ease the path up the job ladder, allow workers to find better matches\nfor their skills, and can encourage attachment to the labor force.\n6 Tyler Cowen, “The Complacent Class: The Self-Defeating Quest for the American Dream,” St. Martin’s Press, New\nYork, NY (2017).\n7 Ufuk Akcigit, “Firm Size, Innovation Dynamics and Growth,” 2009 Meeting Papers 1267, Society for Economic\nDynamics (2009).\n8 Decker, Haltiwanger, Jarmin, and Miranda (2016).\n7\n\nThe Culprits\nThe fact that dynamism has slowed suggests that there has been some fundamental change in the\neconomy.\nOne theory is that regulatory burden is discouraging new start-ups. And while it is true that regulation\nhas generally increased in the U.S., that pace has not been constant or consistent across industries. We\ncan, therefore, compare industry dynamism with industry regulation and get a sense of whether there’s\nany correlation. The evidence so far indicates that the case is fairly weak, and where it does exist, it\nactually goes in the opposite direction.9 The same holds true for start-up rates.\nAnother possibility is that it’s simply too expensive to start a new business. However, if the fixed cost of\nstarting a new business had risen, we would expect to see that new firms are larger, on average, than in\nthe past — but the data don’t bear that out either.10 The inference, then, is that the amount of seed\nmoney necessary to get a new firm off the ground has not grown in any meaningful or outsized way.\nIt may be that regulation is affecting the business climate, just not in the way we usually think about it. It\nmay be — to steal a phrase from another economist — more of a “death by a thousand cuts” than a\nsingle blow of the regulatory axe, with small changes and impediments combining to create a larger\nbarrier.11\nInhibitors of local growth, such as zoning restrictions, could be impeding the flow of workers and capital\nto high productivity areas. The cost of relocating and attempting to start a new business in places like\nSan Francisco or New York is all but prohibitive. By one estimate, lowering constraints — for instance, on\nhousing supply — in high productivity cities would significantly expand their workforces and increase\noverall GDP by almost 10 percent.12\n9 Nathan Goldschlag and Alexander Tabarrok, “Is Regulation to Blame for the Decline in American\nEntrepreneurship?” George Mason University Working Paper 15-11 (February 2015).\n10 John Haltiwanger, Ron S. Jarmin, and Javier Miranda, “Who Creates Jobs? Small versus Large versus Young,”\nReview of Economics and Statistics, 95:2 (May 2013).\n11 John Haltiwanger called it “a death by a thousand cuts.”\n12 Chang-Tai Hsieh and Enrico Moretti, “Why Do Cities Matter? Local Growth and Aggregate Growth,” Kreisman\nWorking Paper Series in Housing Law and Policy (2015).\n8\n\nImportantly, the fact that the decline in business dynamism is not confined to the United States, but is\noccurring across OECD countries, suggests that broader, systemic forces are likely playing a role.13 The\nknock-on effects of technological advancement and demographics are almost certainly involved, as they\nplay a role in a variety of economic measures.\nA recent paper poses some interesting questions for the dynamism discussion.\nThe authors start with the groundwork: that economic activity is being concentrated in fewer firms; that\nentrepreneurship rates have been declining since the 1970s; and that there has been a decline in the\nshare of GDP going to labor since 1975. Then they note that these trends share the underlying factor of\nfirm demographics: Specifically that there is a shift in age distribution toward older firms — and older\nfirms have higher employment concentration.\nFundamentally, a decline in labor force growth means lower entry rates for new firms. But since the\n1970s, labor force growth has declined by 2 percentage points, while the entry rate of new businesses\nhas declined by 6 percentage points — meaning labor force decline alone is not enough to account for\nthe drop in start-ups.\nBut what if the decline in labor force growth also leads to changes in firm demographics, specifically in\nthe average size and aggregate exit rate? In that instance, the effect of labor force growth on start-ups\ncould be multiplied.14 This is an active and interesting area of research that I’ll be keeping an eye on.\nFinally, there is new research by staff at the Philadelphia Fed, which looks at the effect of interest rates.\nI want to make clear from the outset that I am not talking about the federal funds rate, which the Fed\nuses to execute monetary policy — and which we often refer to, as I have done today, simply by the\nshorthand of “rates.” They’re looking at natural rates of interest, which is an independent function of\neconomic forces that is beyond the control of us mere mortals on the FOMC. We make our policy in the\ncontext set by that natural rate.\n13 Chiara Criscuolo, Peter N. Gal, and Carlo Menon, “The Dynamics of Employment Growth: New Evidence from 18\nCountries,” OECD Science, Technology and Industry Policy Papers (May 2014).\n14 Hugo Hopenhayn, Julian Neira, and Rish Singhania, “From Population Growth to Firm Demographics:\nImplications for Concentration, Entrepreneurship, and the Labor Share,” National Bureau of Economic Research\nWorking Paper 25382 (2018).\n9\n\nLooking from the late 1990s to today, their research suggests that both the decline in the start-up rate\nand the rise in business concentration may be connected to the global decline in the natural rate over\nthe same period.\nLarger firms’ cash flow is less volatile, allowing them to carry more debt against each dollar of asset.\nThat advantage can make them more willing to buy up new ideas entering the market, particularly as\nborrowing costs decline. More research is needed, and there is no direct evidence that decreased\ninterest rates have induced larger businesses to borrow with the specific intent of accumulating ideas.\nHowever, there is certainly a logical connection. If lower borrowing costs are causing more new ideas to\nbe immediately absorbed into larger firms, then a drop in the start-up rate and growing concentration of\nsales in large firms are natural consequences.15\nIn fact, this research was sparked by a discussion we had a few years ago about the sluggishness of\nbusinesses’ real fixed investment growth in an era of record-low interest rates. We thought then that\nthe low-rate environment might be making it more profitable for large firms to grow by acquiring other\nbusinesses, rather than building new capacity. The same logic is at work here: Bigger firms can borrow\nmore cheaply than start-ups, which makes it more profitable for the bigger businesses to borrow against\nthe cash flow of a new idea and buy it from the creators.\nI should also note here that measurement adds a level of complication to the mix. Creative destruction\nat the firm level isn’t captured by dynamism statistics. Take, for example, IBM’s reinvention in the early\n1990s, after the collapse of the mainframe market. While it fundamentally remade itself into a different\ncompany, that shift wasn’t captured in the dynamism data on entry and exit. Dynamism doesn’t\nmeasure global activity very well either. In this case, Apple is the example. Apple constantly adds and\ndrops suppliers as it continues its evolution in product development; in 2013, for instance, it had about\n750 suppliers, but almost 90 percent of them were in Asia. That activity doesn’t show up in the U.S.\ndynamism statistics.\n15 Satyajit Chatterjee and Burcu Eyigungor, “The Firm Size and Leverage Relationship and Its Implications for Entry\nand Concentration in a Low Interest World,” Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia Working Paper 19-18 (March\n2019).\n10\n\nConclusion\nWhile we certainly have a measurement problem, it is still clear that dynamism is slowing and has been\ndoing so steadily, not just in the U.S., but across mature economies. It is also the case that a number of\nfactors are conspiring to keep it that way.\nI should note here that dynamism, much like food or wine, should be taken in moderation, and an\nexcess could lead to something of an economic hangover. The downside of dynamism, and the risk of\noverindulging in it, would be a glut of churn and all its attendant costs — frequent bankruptcies and\nbusiness failures, high rates of firings and layoffs, too much job-hopping by workers. But in an\nenvironment with the right amount, it has its intended effect: Resources are channeled to more\nproductive uses, workers are more engaged with the labor market, and innovation is nurtured.\n11",

Harker\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily\nthose of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\nCentral Banking and Its Discontents?\nAthenaeum of Philadelphia\nPhiladelphia, PA\nNovember 16, 2016\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood evening. It’s a pleasure to be here at the Athenaeum of Philadelphia.\nGiven the excitement of the past few weeks, I’m going to take the opportunity this evening to\nbe a little boring. I’m not going to discuss my outlook or the next rate hike, although I fully\nexpect to be asked about them. Instead, I’m going to take a step back and talk a bit about how the\nFed came to be and what it is we do, and what it is we don’t do. We’re in the birthplace of\nAmerican central banking this evening, and I like to take every opportunity to talk about this\ngreat District, headquartered in this historic, wonderful city.\nEven though I’ll mostly be addressing the whys and wherefores of the Fed System, I should still\ndeliver the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express are mine alone and do not necessarily\nreflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\nWith that out of the way, let me start, as they say, at the beginning.\nA Brief History of Central Banking\nThe First Bank of the United States was the brainchild of Alexander Hamilton and located right\nhere in Philadelphia when we were still the capital of the country. The bank was established in\n1791 to deal with the debt from the Revolutionary War and to ensure the government’s financial\nstability. It looked a lot different than the entity we are today, and it wasn’t without controversy.\nAs Broadway has reminded us — at least as it has reminded those who can get tickets —\nThomas Jefferson was among those who worried about power that was too strong and too\ncentralized. He even once famously said he found banks to be more dangerous than standing\nPage 1 of 8\n\narmies.1 When the bank’s charter was up for renewal after its initial 20 years, the measure failed\nby a vote each in the House and the Senate, and it was dissolved.\nFive years later, Congress agreed to a central banking function a second time, and we got the\nimaginatively named Second Bank of the United States. And 20 years after that, Congress again\ndecided not to renew the charter, again owing to a strain of popular sentiment that didn’t trust\npowerful, centralized institutions.\nThis makes reasonable sense given many of the founders’ philosophical foundations. But it was\nnowhere near unanimous, and the problem with not having a central bank is that it breeds\nvolatility. The period leading up to the third iteration of American central banking — the Federal\nReserve — was marked by currency instability, bank runs, and cycles of boom and bust. At one\npoint, J.P. Morgan actually had to step in to personally bail out the country. Even during the\nRevolutionary War era, central banking was standard in a democracy, and it remains that way\ntoday. Certainly there are no developed economies that don’t have it in some form. So, the\neventual adoption of our current central bank — in the 1913 Federal Reserve Act — was to some\nextent inevitable. And the configuration of the Federal Reserve System — a central bank with a\ndecentralized structure — is something of a testament to old-fashioned American compromise.2\nIt also reflects the unique demands of the United States and our economy.\nHow the Fed Is Organized\nThe Federal Reserve System consists of a Board of Governors, which sits in Washington, D.C.,\nand 12 regional Banks located around the country. The Board seats seven governors, including\nthe Chair. Each regional Bank has its own president and board of directors, which is made up of\nbusiness, banking, and community leaders from the area. Fundamentally, this provides the Fed\nwith a perspective, within each District, of the sectors and issues that make the region tick.\n1 A letter from Thomas Jefferson to John Taylor in May 1816, https://www.monticello.org/site/jefferson/private-\nbanks-quotation\n2 For more information on the Federal Reserve’s history, see the History of the Federal Reserve\nhttps://www.federalreserveeducation.org/about-the-fed/history.\nPage 2 of 8\n\nThis is an important aspect of the Fed that most other countries don’t have. We’re making\nnational policy, but we’re doing it for an enormous country, and the averages of economic data\ncan obscure realities on the ground. Conditions look very different in Philadelphia or Camden\nthan they do in Dallas or Salt Lake City. This system gives, in my view, a voice to a range of\nlocalities and sectors. It also allows us to focus on regional issues within each Bank’s District.\nThe United States has a unique set of needs. It’s easy to forget that we’re an outlier because\nwe’re such a massive country: Only Russia and Canada are bigger geographically, only China\nand India have larger populations, and no one country has a bigger economy. And that economy\nis vast, spreading across sectors and natural resources in a way that most other nations’ just\ndon’t.\nSo, it makes sense that we have a system that feeds back information from around the country.\nThe other difference from most central banks is that the Fed has a dual mandate rather than a\nsingle goal; that is, we’re charged with both maximum employment and price stability. Most just\nfocus on one.\n“Maximum employment” encompasses a wide range of metrics, although the most attention is\npaid to the unemployment rate. That number, of course, will never be zero. Instead, we try to\nensure that labor markets are functioning dynamically and efficiently. Associated with that goal\nis a fairly low unemployment level that economists term the “natural rate.” Estimates vary, but\nmost of us put it more or less at 5 percent. At 4.9 percent, that number is currently right on target,\nalthough I stress again that we do look at a variety of criteria to tell us the full shape and health\nof the labor market.\n“Price stability” is, of course, low and stable inflation. That doesn’t always mean working to\nkeep inflation from taking off; for the past several years, in fact, inflation has been stubbornly\nlow. For those of us who remember the ’70s and ’80s, the goal of increasing inflation seems\ncompletely at odds with what we were taught to want. But our goal at the moment is 2 percent,\nand we’re still running low.\nPage 3 of 8\n\nIt’s important to outline these goals because the decisions we make within the Fed — the way we\nlook at the economy and respond to data — are built entirely on the foundation of our dual\nmandate.\nNow that we’ve established that, I turn to the question so many people secretly want to ask:\nWhat, exactly, does the Fed do? I’m delighted to talk about it, but just as important, I’ll also\nmention what we don’t do.\nI want to stop for a moment because I know that might sound a bit loaded. Perhaps I’m doubting\nwhether most people can pass a Fed exam. But I find that a lot of what we do can be overlooked\nor misunderstood. I have literally had Ph.D. economists ask me why we didn’t make loans to\ncommunity organizations after the financial crisis, which, for the record, we are in no way\nauthorized to do. And people often ask what we’re doing about the deficit. Not to mention there\nis an avalanche of misinformation out there, and the Fed, as an organization, hasn’t always been\ngood at correcting it. In the absence of a rebuttal, the myth will take hold. Or, to borrow a\nfamous maxim: A lie gets halfway around the world before the truth can get its pants on.\nNot to mention, it occurs to me that the average American has much better things to do than\nmemorize the intricacies of Fed mechanisms.\nSo, I hope you’ll indulge me in an overview of the Fed and allow me to puncture a myth or two\nalong the way.\nWhat Does the Fed Do?\nFirst off, the overview: The Fed sets monetary policy. We also regulate banks, along with an\nalphabet soup of government agencies. We’re famously the lender of last resort in times of crisis.\nAnd the lede that always gets buried — and I wish it weren’t so overshadowed by discussions of\ninterest rates — is that we work within our Districts to help strengthen local communities’\neconomies. We have a truly exceptional team in Philadelphia, and they work with partners all\nover the Third District, which I could tell you about all day, but first, the broccoli: monetary\npolicy.\nMonetary policy is a fairly limited field with a fairly limited set of tools. A lot of the questions\nI’m asked, as a Fed president, are about aspects of the American economy that affect our work\nPage 4 of 8\n\nbut that we don’t actually have any control over. Fiscal policy, for instance, which deals with\ndebts, deficits, and taxes. Or investments to encourage growth. Or programs to spur job creation.\nThose all depend on elected officials, be they on the local, state, or national level.\nOur job is to create the conditions in which a healthy economy can thrive, but we’re essentially\ntilling the land. Sowing the seeds and tending the crops are the province of legislative action.\nMonetary policy is about meeting our two goals — price stability and maximum employment —\nmostly by moving interest rates. There are other tools we use, and I’ll get to those shortly, but in\nnormal times, it’s mostly about moving what is technically called the federal funds rate.\nWe set rates, as most of you know, when the Federal Open Market Committee — the FOMC —\nmeets in Washington, which we do eight times a year. Regional Bank presidents don’t always\nget to vote. Most of us rotate into a voting position every three years, but the governors always\ndo, as does the president of the New York Fed. New York, owing to the presence of Wall Street,\nenjoys something of a “first among equals” status within the system. And while the rest of us\ndon’t always vote, we do always represent our Districts and play a part in the discussion.\nIs the Fed Politically Driven?\nThat discussion, to address myth number one, is never political. Because we’re appointed\npolicymakers, we don’t respond to swings in public opinion or election cycles. Unlike\npoliticians, who suffer the slings and arrows of the 24-hour news machine, we operate in a rare,\napolitical bubble, which, I should stress, is very much in the public interest because our policy\nactions aren’t going to take effect for at least a couple of years.3 The independence of the Fed is\ncrucial to making the best decisions possible for the American economy, free from the pressures\nof politics.\nThe somewhat sad truth about the FOMC is that, unless you really love policy discussions, it’s\nnot exactly a party. It is literally just a room full of policy wonks talking through data and\nmetrics and economic theory. There’s no political discussion, no dramatic oratory; there’s\n3 Tomas Havranek and Marek Rusnak, “Transmission Lags of Monetary Policy: A Meta-Analysis,” International\nJournal of Central Banking, 9:4 (December 2013), pp. 39–75. http://www.ijcb.org/journal/ijcb13q4a2.htm.\nPage 5 of 8\n\ndefinitely no Hamilton-inspired rap battles. We’re plodding and methodical and circumspect.\nWe’re just looking to put the best policy in place.\nIs the Fed Audited?\nAlthough we’re independent, that doesn’t mean we’re unchecked. The Fed is what’s considered\n“independent within government.” We’re overseen by Congress, but neither they nor the\npresidential administration have a say in the decisions we make.\nThis is where one of the most prevalent recent myths about the Fed originates, that being the idea\nthat the Fed is not audited. Most people, when they hear the word “audit,” think of a financial\naudit. And, in that respect, we are altogether transparent. We are financially examined by both\ngovernmental agencies and independent auditors from the private sector. Our balance sheet is\npublished weekly, and we produce an annual report of each Bank’s financial statements as well\nas one for the Board of Governors.\nRecent calls to “audit the Fed” are actually about assessing our policy decisions, not our financial\nones. But this goes back to the critical independence that Congress mandated. If the Fed were\nopen to interference by elected officials, that pressure could result in short-termism and\nencourage hasty decisions to please political ends, rather than economic ones. And, in fact, the\nChair testifies to Congress at least twice a year, often more, as do many Fed officials. The Fed\nminutes are published, the Chair holds a press conference every other meeting, and we all speak\npublicly about our own views on policy decisions.\nDoes the Fed Print Money?\nThose decisions, as I said, are mostly about moving the federal funds rate, our primary monetary\npolicy tool. As I also said, the FOMC is generally a pretty milquetoast affair. In extreme times,\nhowever, like the financial crisis and the Great Recession, the Fed turns to what’s called\n“unconventional” policy. The most well known of them is quantitative easing, or QE, and it\nplays a role in the last myth I want to address, which is that the Fed prints money.\nThe Fed does issue money under its authority, but the Treasury’s Bureau of Printing and\nEngraving does the actual printing. If you look at a bill — in newer ones, it’s on the upper left —\nPage 6 of 8\n\nyou’ll see a letter and a number: B2, L12, F6. Those tell you which regional Fed Bank issued\nthat bill. We’re C3: the Third District, with the corresponding third letter of the alphabet.\nThat feeds into part of the misconception, which is a fairly pedantic distinction to make. But the\nbigger issue is the perception that the Fed prints money with abandon and could flood the market\nwith cash at any point, destabilizing the economy.\nThat’s the part I want to address because it can sound incredibly concerning stripped of detail.\nFirst things first: The Federal Reserve is essentially the banks’ bank. We want to ensure that\ninstitutions can cover their debts, so banks are required to hold a certain level of funds with us.\nThe federal funds rate is the interest rate on loans that banks make to each other overnight. That\nrate tends to influence interest rates more broadly so the effect ripples through the economy. Low\nrates encourage economic activity, which spurs job growth, which is why we keep rates low\nduring times of economic crisis. When economic activity ramps up, we increase rates to keep\ninflation under control.\nThe reason rates have been so low for so long — they were essentially at zero for close to eight\nyears — was to help the economy make it through the recovery.\nOf course, that’s not always sufficient, as we found after the financial crisis. In those instances\nwhen standard policy can’t move us around the bases, we have to play with a bigger bat. That’s\nwhy the Fed turned to QE, which is what was casually called “printing money,” a term that’s not\nquite accurate.\nQE was a round of programs of large-scale asset purchases. The Fed bought assets from the\nbanks that hold accounts with us, which came in the form of long-term Treasury- and mortgage-\nbacked securities. The so-called printing of money was the way we paid for them: The Fed\ncredited money to the banks’ accounts, money that had not been printed and technically didn’t\nexist before we pressed the metaphorical “Enter” key.\nSo, in that sense, the money was created. But it wasn’t printed, and that’s part of the issue. The\nsystem wasn’t flooded with physical dollars; it was an electronic credit on a transaction sheet so\nbanks could lend more money. And the total amount of assets in the economy did not change\nPage 7 of 8\n\nbecause each transaction was an exchange of one asset for another — a bond for a reserve, for\ninstance.\nThe “why” of this is that the fed funds rate focuses primarily on short-term interest rates. QE\nhelped keep longer-term rates low as well, which encourages individuals to take out loans and\nspend on bigger items, like homes or cars, and businesses to invest in expanding. That stimulates\neconomic activity and encourages job growth. Lower rates also drive more money into the stock\nmarket, which doesn’t sound great to a lot of people. It sounds like Wall Street getting a bonus,\nright? But a lot of pension funds and other investments made by Americans at all points on the\nwealth scale are tied to the markets, so this benefits Main Street as well.\nQE is in the past at this point, so why do I bring it up?\nI do it for the same reason I think it’s important to continue to explain, as well as we can, what\nthe Fed is doing. It wasn’t clear to a lot of people what was happening when it was underway,\nand misunderstanding can breed mistrust. We operate on the good faith of the American people,\nand it’s important that we be as clear as we can be about the steps we’re taking to protect our\neconomy. And it’s an economy we all live and work in; it’s an economy we’re steering for our\nfamilies as well as yours, so we all have skin in the game.\nConclusion\nIt’s been 225 years since the First Bank of the United States was established, and some of the\nfunction of its eventual incarnation remains as mysterious today as the founders’ penchant for\nwigs. What we can learn from history, both recent and far gone, is how to better communicate\nand ensure our constituents understand what we’re doing and why.\nPage 8 of 8",

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nLessons on Leadership\nThird Annual Lerner MBA Student Association Conference\nUniversity of Delaware’s Alfred Lerner College of Business and Economics\nNewark, DE\nFebruary 14, 2019\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood morning and thank you. It’s an absolute pleasure to be back on the UD campus and an\nhonor to be asked to speak today.1\nI’ve been asked to talk about leadership, and in thinking about what I wanted to say, I realized\nthat the best lessons I’ve learned, and any wisdom I have to impart, come from other people.\nIt’s said that good artists borrow and great artists steal, and it seems I’ve applied that to career\nphilosophies. So I’m very happy to share lessons on leadership today, with the strict proviso that\npretty much everything worth sharing I’ve learned from someone else.\nIf it’s helpful, you’re welcome; if it’s not, well, I’m telling you exactly whom to blame …\nGood Advice Can Come from Anyone\nNumber one — and I list this as number one because it’s the one I always tell my kids, it’s the\none that’s been the foundation of every good step I’ve taken in life, and because it’s totally\nunoriginal but nonetheless true — is: Keep learning and be open to advice from a multitude of\nsources.\nYour education doesn’t end when you graduate, it’s just starting. Always take a job that teaches\nyou something, particularly early on in your career, and don’t limit your pool of instruction. The\nmost influential people in your lives, the ones who will teach you the most, aren’t always going\nto be your bosses or formal mentors. They’re colleagues, people junior to you, support staff, and\n1 The views expressed here are the speaker’s own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the\nFederal Reserve System.\n1\n\npeople whose roles have nothing to do with your own. Be open to learning and be receptive to\neveryone.\nIf you had asked me even a few years ago, I would never have guessed I’d be here today —\nmoving from a career in academia to making monetary policy for the world’s most powerful\neconomy? I probably would have laughed. But I didn’t see myself in academia at first either.\nThat was just as implausible to a kid from a family of pipefitters in a blue-collar New Jersey\ntown. My sister and I were the first in our family to go to college, and even when I got there, as a\nfootball player on scholarship, it had never occurred to me that I could wind up in a professor’s\nchair.\nIt was the secretary in the engineering department, Shelley Brown, who saw something in me\nthat I couldn’t see in myself. Well, she saw something in me, and she may have been mildly\nirritated with me as well … I got injured my junior year, and I was haunting the halls of the\ndepartment when she decided I needed something to do. She sent me to a professor who needed\nan assistant and that was it; I found something I loved and I had a new goal.\nThe track I was on was headed toward something perfectly good — I’d planned on getting an\nengineering job when I finished undergrad. But Shelley flipped a switch that diverted the route\nand sent me to a PhD and academic career. It never would have happened if she hadn’t made that\nconnection, and it never would’ve happened if I hadn’t listened.\nBe Scared\nSo that’s number one of the Rules Pat Harker Stole from Smarter People. And it’s important to\ncontinue learning throughout your career, which takes on increasing consequence as you move\nup the ladder. So my next bit of advice is: Be scared. In fact, let yourself be absolutely terrified.\nI know that “feel the fear and do it anyway” isn’t original advice. But I can offer a formula.\nAgain, it’s one I owe entirely to someone else, and it’s advice that’s been invaluable to me over\nthe years.\nIt’s actually from a UD donor who had a fascinating career — not just prestigious positions but\nincredibly diverse and interesting ones. Obviously, I wanted to know how someone makes such\nan unexpected journey, and she said she relied on two things: She always wanted to be\n2\n\nsomewhere that taught her something new, and she knew a job was right if she was 70 percent\nsure she could absolutely excel in it and 30 percent scared to death that she’d have no idea what\nshe was doing.\nIt remains some of the best advice I’ve ever heard.\nThat fear creates a challenge. It makes us work harder. It trains our focus. And it makes us\ncomfortable with the discomfort of fear itself. This is not so much advice as a secret from the\ntrenches: Imposter syndrome is real. At some point, you’ll have the feeling that you don’t belong\nwhere you are, and you’ll be panicking that you’ll be found out.\nDon’t worry, 99.9 percent of the population can relate. It’s normal, it’s healthy, and if you meet\nfear halfway, you’ll not only start to get used to it, you’ll get better at moving beyond it. Be 30\npercent terrified; it’s a good thing.\nI should note that there are some limits to this advice: If you’re headed into brain surgery or in\ncharge of a large stockpile of nuclear weapons, then please, be very sure you know what you’re\ndoing.\nBe Good\nNumber three in Other People’s Wisdom is what I learned from some of the best mentors anyone\ncould ask for. And that is: Be a good person.\nBy “good” I don’t mean adhering to the tenets of some arbitrary cultural or social code; I mean:\nBe reliable, be honest, be helpful.\nThe organizational psychologist Adam Grant talks about “givers and takers”: the people who\neither focus on what people can do for them or what they can do for people. When you operate in\n“give” mode at work, you’re making things run more smoothly, but you’re also doing yourself a\nfavor.\nOperating in “give” mode is how you become the go-to person. It’s how you become the person\neverybody wants on their team. When you make the choice to be the person who will take five\nminutes, even if you’re under deadline, to help out a colleague, you become invaluable.\n3\n\nBeing “good” is about integrity. And yes, I’m making a relatively old-fashioned case. But it’s\none that’s stood the test of time. It may not fit into the popular narrative of cutthroat\nmaneuvering where nice guys finish last, but the most respected leaders I’ve ever known haven’t\nbeen amoral raiders; they’ve been honest, authentic, and trustworthy to their core.\nThere will, of course, always be examples of bravado outperforming hard work. And flashes in\nthe pan sometimes last a little longer than they should. But eventually, those people get found\nout. And in the long run, the most important asset you have — and the one thing in life you can\ncontrol — is your integrity. We rarely have a say in what life throws at us, but we do decide how\nwe handle it. In the course of my life, I have seen over and over that solidity of character will\nalways triumph, and honesty and integrity have been the marks of every great leader I’ve had the\nprivilege to know.\nBuild a Good Team and Know How to Run It\nThat grounding is especially important, because a lot of leadership is, frankly, drawing fire. And\nvery little consists of basking in glory.\nSo my next bit of advice is to build a good team and know how to run it.\nPerhaps the most essential trait of those who do this exceptionally well is knowing what they\ndon’t know.\nDavid Pottruck, the former CEO of Charles Schwab, used to talk about “leading from the\nmiddle.” What I take from that, in a nutshell, is that you’re not always going to be the smartest\nperson in the room. If you’re lucky, you’ve assembled a good enough team that you’re rarely the\nsmartest person in the room.\nGood leaders are able to cede control to someone else. Yes, you’re the ultimate decision maker,\nbut the best leaders know how to defer to the experts and follow their advice. Great leadership\nisn’t knowing everything; great leadership is knowing who your experts are and letting them\nguide you. There is no greater mark of intellectual insecurity than pretending you know\nsomething you don’t, and the most talented leaders invite input from all sides.\nAnother hallmark of a good leader is a team that fills in his or her weaknesses. As a CEO or a\npart of a team, I’d be wary of any manager who hires in their own image. To paraphrase\n4\n\nsomething an HR partner of ours says, “If I’ve got five people who think exactly the same, I\ndon’t need four of them.”\nGreat leaders build great teams, but they also know how to manage them. And, as I said, a lot of\nthat is thankless. The trick is to do it with grace and humility.\nThis time, I’m cribbing from the great Colin Powell, whom I first heard speak about leadership\nearly on in my career, when I was part of the White House Fellows program. I’d highly\nrecommend searching out his magnum opus of advice because it’s truly some of the best you’ll\nfind. In this instance, I’m keeping it to the hard, but essential, lessons that accompany the role.\nFirst, when you’re the leader of a team, you take responsibility for the group. That means you\nalways give the credit, and you always take the blame.\nSecond, take the pain early. That means when an issue arises, deal with it — don’t kick the can\ndown the road. The longer you let it sit, the more it will fester, the bigger it will grow, and the\nmore severe the consequences will be in the end.\nBe Adaptable and Let People Talk You into Things\nOne of the most important lessons I’ve learned, in particular from the people around me, is to be\nadaptable. As I said, we have very little control over what life sends our way; we can only\ncontrol how we deal with it.\nIt surprises people to hear, but the truth is that being dean of Wharton wasn’t part of my plan. I\nhad young kids and I knew what the job entailed. People thought I was too young, and I frankly\nwas perfectly happy in an academic role. But the people who knew me — from a long-time\nmentor to an advisor who’s still telling me what to do — talked me into it.\nIt was absolutely the right thing to do, but it took convincing. The moral of the story is that the\npeople around you, the ones who’ve seen you grow and develop in your career, often know you\nbetter than you know yourself. So listen to them.\nAnd be prepared for what comes next. Being adaptable is a skill, but change doesn’t happen in a\nvacuum, and the old adage rings true: When you walk through one door, another closes. You’re\ngoing to make choices in your careers, big and small, that will have consequences — and as\nmuch as what you choose to do will impact your life, so will the things you choose not to do.\n5\n\nSo my tremendously profound advice is: Don’t overthink it.\nThe best any of us can do is pick a general direction and be open to changes along the way. I\nhave a friend from my White House days who has had a detailed five-year plan since we met\nthere in 1991. Every five years, he lays out a detailed schematic of where his life is headed. And\nfor almost 30 years, it has not gone according to plan. Not once. Not a single year.\nSo be open to change, because, as the saying goes, life is what happens when you’re busy\nmaking other plans. Especially if they’re detailed, five-year ones …\nJump\nThat flexibility will help you do the final thing that other people’s wisdom has taught me, which\nis that sometimes you have to take a leap of faith. Sometimes you just have to jump.\nWhen I first got to UD, I spent the first year working out our strategic plan with my team. It was\nbeautiful; a really exceptional plan … This is what we call foreshadowing, and I’m pretty sure\nyou all know what happened next. Life happened, of course. Or, I should say, the Great\nRecession happened, and the world turned upside down.\nIn the middle of our derailed plans, I got a call from an old colleague of mine who was then at\nChrysler, asking if we wanted to buy their plant. Which, to be honest, sounded a little ridiculous.\nActually, it sounded a lot ridiculous. But we kept thinking about it — a little at first, and then\nalmost obsessively. Because the more we looked at it, the more it seemed like the opportunity of\na lifetime.\nIt wasn’t easy. First we had to convince ourselves, and then we had to convince everyone else:\ntrustees, faculty, elected officials, the community. It took a lot of collaboration and a lot of\ndiscussion and a lot of tenacity. But we did it.\nI don’t want to sound wildly self-congratulatory — and I technically can’t because it was entirely\na group effort — but I truly believe that buying that plant was the best investment the university\nhas made in 100 years. The resources that investment brought us, and the development\nunderway, are the future both of the university itself and of the economy of the state of\nDelaware. We’re talking about a major hub of science and technology, a winner of major grants,\n6\n\njobs for the community … It truly is an encapsulation of our collective future, and it’s one of the\nabsolute highlights of my professional life to have been a part of it.\nBut it took a lot to get us there. It took being open to insight from unlikely sources. It took\nswallowing a healthy dose of fear. It took the faith and goodwill we built through honesty and\nintegrity. It took assembling an expert team to tell us what we didn’t know. It took adapting to a\nnew set of circumstances. And it took a leap of faith.\nThank you.\n7",

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nPUBLIC/OFFICIAL RELEASE // EXTERNAL\nEconomic Outlook for Delaware and the Nation\nDelaware State Chamber of Commerce\nPhiladelphia, PA (virtual)\nApril 6, 2022\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nHello! It’s great to be here again for what is becoming an annual tradition. I’m very much looking\nforward to today’s conversation. I plan to discuss the economic outlook, monetary policy, and a bit of\nresearch on housing from the Philadelphia Fed. And then we can have an open discussion.\nAnd now for another tradition: the standard Fed disclaimer. The views I express today are my own and\ndo not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the\nFederal Reserve System.\nThe Economy\nWhen I addressed this group almost exactly a year ago, I called the economic recovery, both nationally\nand here in Delaware, a “work in progress.”\nI think that still holds. Economic growth and employment are robust, but I’m very concerned about\ninflation.\nLet’s begin on the positive side of the ledger.\nIn the fourth quarter of last year — coinciding, at least in part, with the Omicron surge — national GDP\ngrew at an annualized rate of 7 percent, with strong inventory investment and healthy demand for\ncapital goods. For the totality of 2021, U.S. GDP growth was a very healthy 5.7 percent. That this\noccurred in the midst of a deadly pandemic is quite a testament to the underlying strength of our\neconomy.\n1\n\nPUBLIC/OFFICIAL RELEASE // EXTERNAL\nJob growth, a key component of the Fed’s mandate, remains robust. For 11 straight months, new job\ncreation has topped 400,000. But if you think that has led to a decline in Help Wanted signs, you’re\nwrong. Even with all this job creation, vacancy rates remain elevated, at a near record.\nNominal wage growth — as one would guess given these conditions — has been strong, though lately it\nhas not been keeping up with inflation. Labor participation rates are edging up as well, though they\nremain below where they were before the pandemic. I suspect that the waning of the virus — at least\nhere in the United States — as well as uncertain equity markets and even inflation may lure people back\ninto the workforce and persuade others to delay retirement. The unemployment rate, which is below 4\npercent, should continue to fall this year.\nIn Delaware, the recovery continues apace.\nThe unemployment rate is nearing pre-pandemic levels, overall gains in payroll employment have been\nsteady, labor market conditions are tight, and the housing market remains hot. Consumer traffic to\nworkplaces and other nonresidential locations has increased substantially, though transit use remains\nalmost 40 percent below where it was prior to the pandemic.\nTotal employment in Delaware is now about 14,000 jobs below where it was when the pandemic struck.\nJob openings were at a historic high in January, the quits rate remains elevated, and layoffs are very low.\nEmployment in financial services is where it was prior to COVID-19’s arrival, while leisure and hospitality\nemployment remain somewhat depressed.\nA persistent problem in getting more people back into the labor force is the high cost and low\navailability of child care. The problems are acute here. To cite just one statistic, Delaware families spend\nabout 20 percent of the median household’s income to care for one child, an unsustainable burden.\nMany of you are probably aware of the work that the Philadelphia Fed and the Delaware Chamber have\nbeen doing on this important issue, and I’d be happy to discuss this further during our Q&A.\nInflation\nInflation is running far too high, and I am acutely concerned about this. The consumer price index (CPI)\nwas up 10 percent annualized in February, led by another significant increase in energy prices. Over the\npast year, CPI is up 7.9 percent.\n2\n\nPUBLIC/OFFICIAL RELEASE // EXTERNAL\nCore CPI, stripping out energy and other volatile indicators, remains very high as well, with 6.2 percent\nannualized growth in February. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will add to inflation pressure, not only hiking\noil and gas prices but other commodities, like wheat and fertilizer, as well.\nDelivery times remain elevated, and while there are some signs in the data, and in what we hear from\nour contacts, that supply chain constraints are finally easing, we are not out of the woods yet. In\nresponse to a new COVID-19 wave, China is instituting hard lockdowns in major manufacturing hubs,\nfurther choking supply.\nInflation is widespread. It is showing up throughout a vast array of goods that comprise the CPI “basket”\n— and among some of those that aren’t in the basket.\nThe bottom line is that generous fiscal policies, supply chain disruptions, and accommodative monetary\npolicy have pushed inflation far higher than I — and my colleagues on the FOMC — are comfortable\nwith. I’m also worried that inflation expectations could become unmoored.\nThat is why last month we announced we were raising the federal funds rate for the first time since\n2018. We raised our target by 25 basis points, and I expect a series of deliberate, methodical hikes as\nthe year continues and the data evolve. I also anticipate that we will begin to reduce our holdings of\nTreasury securities, agency debt, and mortgage-backed securities soon.\nWith the runoff of pandemic support, tightening monetary conditions, and the war in Ukraine pressuring\ncommodity prices, I think growth will moderate this year. We can probably expect 3 percent to 3.5\npercent GDP growth this year before falling to trend growth of 2 percent to 2.5 percent during the next\ncouple of years.\nI do see the potential for a significant uptick in the service sector in many large cities that are only now\nwaking up after a two-year pandemic-induced hibernation. Central business districts in cities like New\nYork, San Francisco, and Philadelphia should get a boost as more workers return to their offices — the\nstaff of the Philadelphia Fed included. The rise of hybrid work may moderate the potential for a huge\nboom, however. There is a big question mark hanging over the future of commercial real estate.\nInflation should begin to taper this year too — but remain elevated, probably around 4 percent for 2022.\nThe following two years should bring it back to our target of 2 percent.\nAll of these forecasts, of course, are freighted with uncertainty.\n3\n\nPUBLIC/OFFICIAL RELEASE // EXTERNAL\nHousing\nNow, before we move to the open discussion, I’d like to turn to housing, which comprises a huge and\nvitally important sector of the U.S. economy. With a fairly weak public social safety net, for Americans,\nhouses are not only their shelters — they are a significant source of their household wealth and\nretirement savings as well.\nIn general, the housing market is largely healthy; if anything, it’s not keeping up with demand.\nHousing starts are robust, but inventories are low and price growth is strong. Policies that make\nconstruction arduous in certain states and municipalities continue to impede efforts to meet demand.\nThat degrades overall economic performance, because in many places, people cannot afford to live\nwhere the jobs are.\nNow I’d like to turn specifically to mortgage forbearance, a subject of important research from the staff\nof the Philadelphia Fed.\nAs many of you will recall, at the outset of the pandemic, the CARES Act mandated that borrowers of\nfederally insured mortgages be granted forbearances. To ensure widespread take-up, the law said\nborrowers could be granted forbearances by simply requesting it; they did not even need to prove\nhardship. The upshot was that homeowners could temporarily pause their mortgage payments without\npenalty and stay in their homes, without negatively affecting their credit scores.\nThe CARES Act also put into place a foreclosure moratorium, followed by temporary protections against\nforeclosure. Private sector lenders adopted the same practices.\nPerhaps not surprisingly, as the pandemic began and the economy was shut down, Americans took this\nopportunity in droves. More than 8.5 million borrowers entered forbearance at some point during the\npandemic — more than 15 percent of the total mortgage market.\nThat was then, though.\nAs of last month, the number of loans in forbearance had declined by more than 90 percent, down to\naround 680,000 mortgages.\nSo, what has become of the nearly 8 million households that entered forbearance and have since come\nout of it? Our researchers at the Philadelphia Fed have been tracking this and have made some\nimportant findings.\n4\n\nPUBLIC/OFFICIAL RELEASE // EXTERNAL\nI’ll begin with the positive news.\nNearly three-quarters of those who have exited forbearance have voluntarily paid off or are current,\nmany making use of payment deferrals or loan modifications.\nFor borrowers able to resume timely payments, a deferral creates a no-interest subordinated lien out of\ntheir missed payments not due until loan payoff. Meanwhile, loan modifications offer lower interest\nrates and extend loan terms up to 40 years while offering payment reductions of 20 percent or more.\nMoreover, our exceptionally strong housing market has kept home prices elevated.\nWhile this has had undeniably negative impacts on those seeking to enter the housing market, it does\nensure that borrowers can avoid losing their homes and that banks won’t suffer losses large enough to\nmeaningfully affect their capital positions. Homeowners are sitting on more than $10 trillion of tappable\nequity — a record. The contrast with the Great Recession is remarkable; you’ll recall back then that\nnearly half of all distressed borrowers were “underwater.”\nStill, nearly 1 million mortgages are seriously delinquent, split evenly between those classified by\nservicers in loss mitigation and those not in loss mitigation. Most borrowers who remain seriously\ndelinquent and not in loss mitigation never entered forbearance at all. Many were in nonpayment\nbefore the pandemic struck.\nAnd of the borrowers classified as being in loss mitigation, three-quarters are still in process and have\nnot, as of yet, resumed timely payments on their mortgages. Black and Hispanic borrowers have much\nhigher shares of nonpayment — either being in forbearance or delinquency. Interestingly, just as the\nunemployment rate has returned to pre-pandemic levels, the number of delinquent mortgages has also\nreturned to pre-pandemic rates.\nLenders may want to consider solutions that limit the costs of modification while providing more\npayment relief to borrowers. One such solution is for the Federal Housing Administration to offer 40-\nyear modifications. This will lower the cost relative to the 30-year option and provide more relief to\nborrowers. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has proposed a 40-year mortgage\nmodification for FHA loans, and we are currently in the midst of a 60-day comment period.\nIt’s worth noting now that protections against foreclosure expired on December 31, 2021, and\nforeclosure starts are back to their pre-pandemic levels too.\n5\n\nPUBLIC/OFFICIAL RELEASE // EXTERNAL\nI would like to say a couple of words about some research on mortgage refinances as well.\nRefinance mortgage originations grew remarkably in 2020 in Delaware, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania —\nin fact, they vastly outpaced the growth in mortgages for new home purchases. A lot of that we owe, of\ncourse, to the extraordinary circumstances we found ourselves in that year: Mortgage interest rates fell\nto historic lows as the economy was shuttered, keeping people where they were.\nBut my colleagues at the Philadelphia Fed have found, while refinances were popular during this period,\nthe growth rate for refinanced mortgages for Black and low- and moderate-income borrowers was only\nabout half to three-quarters of the growth rate for borrowers overall.\nWhat’s instructive is that the lower rate of refinances was not solely because of higher denial rates,\nthough historically those communities have been denied at higher rates.\nRather, our Bank researchers found refinance applications from Black and low- and moderate-income\nborrowers grew at a much slower rate than applicants overall. That suggests a need for improved\ncommunication from banks to Black and low- and moderate-income households. Unfortunately, many\nhomeowners missed out on some significant savings they could have enjoyed if they had refinanced. We\nshould think of ways to make sure these communication breakdowns do not happen again.\nSo, thanks again for having me. I’m sure the next time we convene, more progress will have been made.\nNow let’s open things up for discussion.\n6",

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nPUBLIC/OFFICIAL RELEASE // EXTERNAL\nHealth Care as an Economic Driver\nStern Future Healthcare Workforce Summit\nUniversity of Delaware\nNewark, DE (virtual and in-person)\nMay 17, 2022\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood morning! It’s really great to be back at the University of Delaware for this terrific event. It was\nwonderful to see so many old friends and to make some new ones at dinner last night. And also, thank\nyou for the lavish breakfast spread this morning. Although since so many of you are health-care workers,\nI have to admit I was a little self-conscious when I was filling my plate; I hid my two — OK, three — slices\nof bacon under my fruit, hoping you all wouldn’t notice.\nBut seriously, thanks so much for having me back in Delaware. It’s always a treat to be on campus\nbecause it allows to me to slip back into professor mode. And that’s what I intend to do this morning,\nthough if I recall correctly, the 9:00 a.m. slot was always a little challenging to navigate as a professor.\nBut I’ll do my best to keep you all awake — and if not, well, the coffee station is over there.\nI’m going to spend the next few minutes discussing health care as an economic driver. Then, I’ll be\nhappy to take some questions. But before I do, I need to give you what we call the standard Fed\ndisclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on\nthe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\nThe Changing Economy\nI had a chance to walk around the STAR campus yesterday and — quite frankly — was amazed at what I\nsaw. Like some of you, I remember when there used to be a Chrysler factory here. I also remember —\n\nPUBLIC/OFFICIAL RELEASE // EXTERNAL\npainfully — when after the 2008 financial crisis, there was a shuttered Chrysler factory here. That was a\nterrible time.\nI was president of UD when the Chrysler plant closed, and I was intimately involved in the university’s\ndecision to purchase the land. But I have to say, what I saw yesterday surpassed even my own optimistic\nexpectations for what would happen to the ground I am standing on. This is now a thriving, mixed-use\ncommunity where academia, industry, and government are collaborating to perform pathbreaking\nresearch focused on clean energy, biotechnology, and, of course, health sciences, among other fields.\nInstead of Durangos, this area now produces innovations in health care. The “phoenix rising from the\nashes” may be an overused metaphor in our culture, but I think it describes best what has happened\nhere.\nIn a way, I would argue, the STAR campus serves as a metaphor for transitions occurring across our\nentire country. Traditional manufacturing remains an important component of our economy, but its\nrelative share of employment is declining. This is an extraordinarily painful transition for millions of our\nfellow Americans and for communities across the country. More must be done to support workers, their\nfamilies, and their communities as the economy changes.\nAnd change it most certainly has, with the growth of the health-care economy leading the way. In 1960,\ntotal national expenditure on health care represented about 5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP).\nBy 1990, that figure was up to 12 percent. Today, about a fifth of our GDP is composed of health-care\nspending. Health-care outlays are also the federal government’s number one category of spending.\nThe growth of the health-care sector is evident in employment data as well. In 1990, about 8 million\nAmericans worked in health care; that figure has since doubled to 16 million. That’s the largest single\nemployment segment in our economy.\nIn other words, the tragic experience of the last two years demonstrated not only how important the\nhealth-care sector is to our national fabric, it is extraordinarily important to our economy as well.\nA number of factors account for health care’s growing share of national spending. Some are salutary.\nMore Americans have health insurance and thus are able to access — and spend on — care. Life-saving\ntechnologies and therapies have been developed. And the country’s population is aging, a reflection, in\npart, of longer life spans. As people get older, they tend to spend more on health care. That is something\nI can personally attest to, as I’ve had a number of foot surgeries over the past couple of years as a result\nof football injuries I suffered decades ago. Moreover, if other products become cheaper, then the\n\nPUBLIC/OFFICIAL RELEASE // EXTERNAL\nnational share of health-care spending will, naturally, rise. That is to say, as agriculture became more\nproductive, the relative percent of spending on health care has risen.\nBut other cost drivers are less desirable. The extremely tight supply of physicians in the United States\nkeeps costs high, for instance. As a Fed president, I stay studiously neutral on political matters, and as a\nformer UD president, I remain neutral on the fact that Delaware is one of only four states without a\nmedical school. But it is a fact that Delaware has relatively few doctors to serve its population, and it is\nan iron law of economics that when supply is constrained, prices rise. Delaware has a relatively old\npopulation, too, which drives demand for health-care services.\nAnchor Institutions\nWith all this said, there can be no doubt that what we call eds and meds — colleges, universities, and\nnonprofit medical institutions — drive economic activity. These institutions are often referred to as\nanchor institutions because of the multiple ways they are tied to a place. Unlike corporate headquarters,\nmanufacturing facilities, or sports franchises that can pick up and move — sorry Raiders fans — higher-\neducation institutions and hospitals may sometimes close, but they aren’t going anywhere. As we have\nseen, health care is labor intensive, making medical institutions some of the largest employers in their\nregions. And they are generally recession resistant. This part is crucial, too: The research and\ndevelopment functions of higher-education institutions and medical institutions generate new\nbusinesses through innovation, technology transfer, and commercialization. In fact, we are seeing that\nall over the Philadelphia region right now.\nOK, now I’m going to break a little bit of news.\nIn the coming months, the Philadelphia Fed is going to launch what we are calling the Anchor Economy\nDashboard. I’m really excited about this. The Anchor Economy Dashboard will be a new, first-ever,\nnational data set that captures the importance of anchor institutions to their regional economies. For\nthe purposes of the dashboard, anchor institutions include higher-education institutions and hospitals.\nWhile the dashboard is not live yet, we have the data underlying it, and I’d like to share some with you\ntoday.\nThe State of Delaware has 38 anchor institutions, encompassing both eds and meds. Employment\nimpacts from Delaware eds and meds total 65,316 jobs. That’s the total number of jobs — direct,\nindirect, and induced — supported by higher education and hospitals in the state.\n\nPUBLIC/OFFICIAL RELEASE // EXTERNAL\nDirect jobs comprise those employed directly by anchor institutions; indirect are those working in fields\nthat directly support anchor institutions, for example, IT contractors supporting a hospital. And induced\njobs are those that are supported by the economic activity that anchor economies generate. The folks\nworking over at Klondike Kate’s have jobs that are induced by UD.\nOne thing that makes the Anchor Economy Dashboard so neat is that it also calculates a reliance score\nfor each region. The reliance score provides a summary measure of how dependent a regional economy\nis on anchor institutions. It adjusts economic impact by the size of the regional economy and\nincorporates measures of impact in terms of employment, income, and gross value added.\nFor Delaware, our data support what I suspect a lot of us know intuitively: This state is quite reliant on\nanchor institutions. So, while Delaware’s total employment in eds and meds ranks 46th out of 50 states\nand the District of Columbia, that is largely a result of the state having a small population. Delaware’s\nreliance score, we calculate, is 1.23. In other words, Delaware overindexes on eds and meds\nemployment, income and gross value added, compared with other regions. Delaware is 23 percent more\ndependent on eds and meds for jobs, income, and gross value added than the United States as a whole.\nBy comparison, Pennsylvania is ranked 15th in reliance at 1.19 and 863,974 total jobs attributable to eds\nand meds. New Jersey is ranked 25th in reliance at 1.05 and 569,467 total jobs attributable to eds and\nmeds. In other words, New Jersey is almost perfectly average, which pains me as a South Jersey boy to\nadmit. Montana has the highest reliance score at 1.53, with total employment impact from eds and\nmeds at 87,128 anchor institution jobs.\nAnd while I, again, remain neutral on the fact that the State of Delaware does not have a medical school,\nthe data clearly demonstrate how economically impactful having one can be for a region. Take Hershey,\nPennsylvania, which has hosted Penn State’s medical school since 1967. The Harrisburg metropolitan\nstatistical area (MSA), which encompasses Hershey, has a total population of 587,291, about half the\nsize of the State of Delaware. But the total employment impact of eds and meds for the Harrisburg MSA\nis 48,338 — 74 percent of the employment impact in Delaware. Not surprisingly, Harrisburg’s reliance\nscore is 1.45, indicating that the region overindexes on eds and meds jobs, income, and gross value\nadded compared with the rest of the country.\nThe Anchor Economy Dashboard will be launching on our website — philadelphiafed.org — in the\ncoming months, and if you’re anything like me, you’ll look forward to spending many hours delving into\nthe data.\n\nPUBLIC/OFFICIAL RELEASE // EXTERNAL\nThere is a lot to think about: Regions rich with anchor institutions have benefited from the way these\ninstitutions fortify the economy and support community development. But economic dependence on\nanchor institutions may increasingly come with risks as technology disrupts health care. The pandemic,\nfor instance, accelerated telehealth, creating opportunities for health-care institutions but also\nloosening the “anchor” that hospitals have traditionally represented. There’s a lot to ponder today —\nand in the weeks, months, and years ahead.\nSo, again, thanks so much for having me. Refill that coffee! And now I’m happy to take some questions.",

    "text": "The Benefits and Casualties of Trade\nGlobal Interdependence Center\nCentral Banking Series\nDublin, Ireland\nSeptember 29, 2016\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily\nthose of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\nThe Benefits and Casualties of Trade\nGlobal Interdependence Center\nCentral Banking Series\nDublin, Ireland\nSeptember 29, 2016\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThank you, it’s a pleasure to be here.\nI can definitively say that after the speculation about the Federal Open Market Committee’s\nSeptember meeting, I’m delighted to have a break from being asked about interest rates, which\nmeans I’ll take the opportunity to not talk about interest rates. And since I’m in Ireland, a\ncountry that knows well the benefits of global trade and cooperation, I thought I’d turn to the\nsubject of international trade.\nBefore I go any further, I should issue the disclaimer that the views expressed today are mine\nalone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\nInternational trade is a sensitive topic, particularly at the moment. You’ll know it’s a subject of\ndebate in the U.S. election, as it is in countries across the globe, from mature economies to\ndeveloping ones.\nAs a Federal Reserve president, I obviously have no say in making the policies that govern trade.\nAnd in general, Fed policymakers avoid opining on the state of fiscal or economic policy.\nBut the American economy has reached a point in which monetary policy has done what it can.\nAs everyone in this room knows, the reach and arsenal of monetary policymakers is limited. We\ncan move rates and that’s about it — the times that call for exceptional use of mechanisms, such\nas quantitative easing or forward guidance, are times of economic upheaval.\n1\n\nAt this juncture in the post-crisis recovery, at least in the U.S., it’s time for fiscal and other\npolicies to take the reins. We cannot foster growth without long-term approaches, legislation, and\ninvestments that are far outside the scope of the Fed’s reach.\nSo, while I offer neither advice nor prescriptions on the subject, in the context of how trade\naffects the economy — and therefore the decisions I and my colleagues make about monetary\npolicy — I feel comfortable calling for a more comprehensive and analytic review of its different\naspects. Discussing the pros and cons, and even the “winners” and “losers,” is well within my\npurview and, I believe, necessary when discussing the future path of monetary policy in the U.S.\nAnd perhaps, for the sake of my colleagues back home, I should reiterate that disclaimer about\nthese being my views and mine alone …\nClassical Gains from Trade\nIt’s clear from the media coverage, the political narrative, and the policy stances emerging\naround the globe that trade is experiencing a good deal of backlash from many corners.\nWhile resistance to international trade is not new, the central role it has taken in public\ndiscussion — and the animosity toward it — is something I haven’t seen for some time.\nIt is particularly acute when considering that, from a textbook standpoint, international trade\nmakes perfect economic sense — especially under the principle of “comparative advantage.”\nThat is, the idea that countries will import goods from abroad if they’re cheaper and export their\nown goods if they’re inexpensive to make at home.\nTrading countries can focus on producing and exporting goods that use their relatively more\nabundant resources, which cost less, to countries that want or need them. For goods that require\nresources that are relatively scarce, nations can import goods for less than they would cost to\nproduce at home. Scotland, obviously, would find it difficult to supply its own pineapples, while\nHawaii would struggle to cultivate a wool industry. International trade allows countries to focus\n2\n\non producing what they’re good at, rather than expending valuable time and resources attempting\nto produce every good they need.1\nWhile different geographies have different resources — and indeed, different quantities of\nresources — comparative advantage is a great democratizer in that everyone has one. And in a\nglobalized economy, this increased specialization allows, for the most part, nations of all sizes to\nbenefit from greater efficiencies in production. This ideally means that trade can make each\ncountry more productive and ultimately better off.\nInternational trade also allows participants to benefit from differing cycles. The creation of goods\nfluctuates, meaning nations can borrow and consume more in lean times and pay back debts\nwhen the output pendulum swings back to its high point. This ensures the stream of goods stays\nsteady and stable and protects average citizens from disruptions in both availability and the\nprices they pay.\nProduction Chains\nAnother aspect of the ever-more integrated global economy is that an increasing share of trade\ninvolves multiple contributions along the supply chain, often across borders. For example, Japan\nexports raw steel to Mexico, where it’s stamped and shipped to the United States, where it’s used\nto make farm equipment, some of which is then exported to buyers in other countries.\nThe classic term for this is vertical integration or fragmentation, although it’s more commonly\nreferred to as the dreaded outsourcing. Outsourcing obviously has negative connotations,\nfrequently seen as the force behind exporting domestic jobs, but this is another aspect. This\nmultiparty approach allows for more efficient organization of production and lets countries\nfocus, again, on those areas in which they have more abundant resources or better specialization.\nIt is an increasingly important facet of both production and international connectivity.2\nThis kind of global production is particularly sensitive to trade protection because every time a\ngood crosses a border, it exposes itself to a potential tariff. This is an area in which I will tread\n1 David Ricardo, On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation. John Murray, Albemarle-Street. 1817.\nPrint.\n2 David Hummels, Jun Ishii, and Kei-Mu Yi, “The Nature and Growth of Vertical Specialization in World Trade,”\nJournal of International Economics, 54:1 (June 2001), pp. 75–96.\n3\n\ncarefully — I’m not dispensing advice on trade policy for the U.S. or any other nation. But from\na purely economic perspective, it’s important to remember that the world has evolved to an\ninterconnected economy, and trade on this level is unlikely to disappear — rather, it’s likely to\nbe more and more a part of individual industries’ and nations’ economies. Even modest tariffs,\ntherefore, if they are applied several times to the same production chain, would be enough to\ndisrupt this type of trade.\nThe Relationship Between Trade and Growth and Trade and Income\nTrade can promote knowledge and expertise and, as a result, foster technical progress. A 10\npercent increase in trade is associated with a 5 percent increase in income per capita.3 Likewise,\nan increase in international trade has a positive impact on growth rates: Doubling a country’s\ntrade share can lead to an estimated 25 percent increase in gross domestic product (GDP) over\nthe span of a decade.\nHistory is also rife with examples of trade’s benefits. Looking at economic development from\n1800 to 1980, we see a steady rise in global inequality because, at the time, only developed\neconomies were open to trade. Conversely, when we look at previously closed economies that\nhave subsequently opened to trade, the trend is reversed.4 China is just one, but perhaps the most\ndiscussed, example of how trade allows countries to rapidly reverse their economic fates. Korea\nis another example, as are, increasingly, places such as Vietnam and the Philippines.\nA powerful illustration of trade’s influence is the steady drop in global poverty. Although the\nworld’s population grew by 1.6 billion between 1980 and 2000, the number of people living in\nextreme poverty actually declined by 200 million.5 While this phenomenon cannot be attributed\nto trade alone, it certainly played a role.6\n3 James Feyrer, “Trade and Income ― Exploiting Time Series in Geography,” National Bureau of Economic\nResearch Working Paper 14910 (2009).\n4 David Dollar and Aart Kraay, “Trade, Growth, and Poverty,” Economic Journal, 114:493 (February 2004), pp.\nF22–F49.\n5 “Poverty,” World Bank, n.d., http://data.worldbank.org/topic/poverty (accessed September 27, 2016).\n6 Matthias Busse and Jens Koeniger, “Trade and Economic Growth: A Re-examination of the Empirical Evidence,”\nEconomics Bulletin, 35:4 (2015), pp. 2862–2876.\n4\n\nCommon Myths\nIf trade’s benefits are so overwhelmingly positive, why has there been such animosity toward it?\nI believe the answer is twofold. First, there are common myths attached to trade and its effects.\nSecond, there are, in fact, losers in the trade game.\nFirst, the myths of trade. A frequent strain of the current narrative is that low-wage countries\nunfairly compete against mature economies, thereby having the double effect of exporting jobs\naway from developed countries such as the U.S. and creating scenarios in which advanced\neconomies exploit their less developed counterparts.\nA more accurate depiction is that low wages are associated with lower productivity, meaning less\ndeveloped economies do not, in fact, have an edge. Additionally, as trade in these goods shifts, it\nfrees up resources in more developed economies, allowing them to concentrate on more\nspecialized goods made by skilled workers, who, in turn, earn higher wages.\nAs for lower-wage countries, the simple math is that without trade, those wages would be even\nlower.\nDistributional Costs\nThat said, there are people who feel the downside of global trade more acutely than others.\nTrade, on the whole, is a benefit. It makes products cheaper, including necessities such as food,\nand countries tend to reap the rewards on a macro level.\nWhat makes the subject so heated, and so impassioned on one side, is that the many who benefit\ndon’t do so in a life-altering way; we aren’t moved by a price change of a few dollars or cents in\nour everyday purchases. In the case of the U.S., the relatively abundant supply of skilled workers\nbenefit, while the unskilled portion of the labor force can lose out to competition from abroad.\nThe rewards are reaped in breadth, spread among the 320-plus million people who live in the\nU.S. On the other hand, those who suffer do so on a catastrophic level — it affects entire\nindustries and the populations that depended on them. Its effects are felt in depth, shouldered by\na small fraction of America.\n5\n\nEven when jobs do not disappear, there is evidence to suggest that vertical integration —\nwherein different parts of supply chains originate in different countries — has impacted the\nincreasing wage gap between skilled and unskilled workers.7 In the U.S., the production chain\nsees more of its contributing goods imported than produced domestically, reducing demand for\nlow-wage workers, and pushing paychecks even further down. This is not the only source of the\nwage disparity in the U.S. over the past 30 years. There is also the displacement of workers\nbecause of automation, and other factors, which have muddied the waters regarding the exact\ncause.\nAdditionally, industries in international competitive markets are in a race with foreign firms.\nEven when they succeed, it’s often the case that gains are disproportionately realized by the\nowners of capital instead of those working to produce it. International competition puts particular\nstress on areas or industries that compete with the imported good — whether the value of land\nfor agricultural products or the return on capital for specialized workers.\nChina Shock\nChina, of course, has played the role of economic bogeyman in the trade debate. But is the fear\nbased on facts?\nA recent paper on the role of trade and its effect on wage disparity, called The China Shock, has\nbeen getting a lot of press lately.8 It assesses the losses in U.S. manufacturing jobs tied to\nincreased exposure to Chinese imports. It will come as no surprise that it is the lower end of the\npay and skill spectrum that has been most affected.\nThe extraordinarily rapid rise of China and its focus on manufacturing and exports have created\nsomething of an economic laboratory — a rare and exceptional one. Because China’s import\npenetration varies widely across manufactured goods, the authors could better assess its impact\n7 Robert Feenstra and Gordon Hanson, “Global Production Sharing and Rising Inequality: A Survey of Trade and\nWages,” National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper 8372 (2001).\n8 David Autor, David Dorn, and Gordon Hanson, “The China Shock: Learning from Labor Market Adjustment to\nLarge Changes in Trade,” Centre for Economic Policy Research Discussion Paper 11054 (2016).\n6\n\nby looking at industries and counties in which China has a stronger or weaker presence. That led\nto more detailed research and more specific findings than previous work.\nThe results do highlight a downside.\nThere were industries that were affected and unemployment followed. In many cases, contrary to\ngeneral assumption, when people lost their jobs, they didn’t move or look for new ones in new\nareas. Instead, people stayed where they were. The jobs they lost weren’t replaced by new ones\nin new industries and that had significant ripple effects. Instead of replacing one manufacturing\njob with another, they wound up in even lower paying jobs, if they managed to find one at all.\nAdding to the effects was that the decline in activity by manufacturers most exposed to imports\nfrom China had spillover effects for their suppliers as well. All in all, of the 5.8 million\nmanufacturing jobs lost in the U.S. from 1999 to 2011, about 985,000 can be attributed to trade.\nAs for wages, the most affected workers were those in the bottom 40 percent of the payscale. For\nevery additional $1,000 of imports per worker, wages were reduced by $213 a year.\nSo, there is some truth to the worry about outside competition. Then again, it is often difficult to\nuntangle the influence of trade from that of other factors affecting changes in wage distribution.\nThere are causes that have nothing to do with China, such as technological advances or the\nwaning share of specific industries — it’s worth remembering that U.S. manufacturing has been\nsteadily declining since the end of World War II, long before China opened its doors to the rest\nof the world. And while there have been job losses, the authors point out that post-war trade has\nonly had minimal influence on the wage stagnation for lower skilled workers and the overall\ndecline in American manufacturing.\nThis is where I circle back to my opening remarks about monetary policy having its limits.\nAddressing issues of unemployment from the decline in American manufacturing requires fiscal\npolicy and legislative action. What we haven’t done very well in the U.S. is to figure out a path\nfor people to absorb those changes. Whether it’s some form of wage insurance or retraining, we\nhave to find some way to help these communities, many of which have been all but abandoned,\nto transition to a new economic reality. I realize that’s easy to say when you’re not the one\nmaking the policy, but in my view, that sort of help is in the interest of the country as a whole.\n7\n\nConclusion\nSo, I can understand some of the animosity toward trade. I also see the need for policies to help\nalleviate the pain that those who bear the brunt of the downside encounter. But a connected\nworld is a better place and trade helps far more people than it hurts. We just need to find a way\nfor everyone to benefit from that free exchange.\n8",

    "text": "Welcome Remarks\nEighth Biennial Research Conference\nNew Perspectives on Consumer Behavior in Credit and Payments Markets\nCo-organized by the Research Department and Payment Cards Center\nof the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nOctober 2, 2015\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nWelcome to the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and to our eighth biennial research\nconference on consumer credit and payments, co-organized by the Bank’s Research\nDepartment and the Payment Cards Center.\nWe held the first event in this series in 2001. So much has changed since then.\nWhat hasn’t changed is the drive to understand the interaction between credit markets and the\nreal economy.\nOver the years, we have also gained greater access to data about consumer credit and\npayments, which has helped shape the research shared at this biennial conference.\nThe topics of this conference come from current events. In the wake of the financial crisis that\nbegan in the subprime housing market and expanded into the Great Recession, economists at\nthe Federal Reserve and many researchers returned to the subject of financial intermediation,\nan area of study that had almost faded away.\nThis conference has become one of the signature events on consumer credit and payments in\nthe United States.\nMany papers featured in our earlier conferences have been published in the highest tiers of\nacademic journals and have gone on to influence policy.\n1\n\nFor example, over the years, papers have addressed:\n The effects of information technology on loan markets and consumer defaults;\n The effects of securitization on the success of mortgage workouts;\n Models of predatory lending; and\n Incentive problems in payment networks that may contribute to identity theft,\n … to name just a few key topics.\nThis policy-oriented research is also reflected in the audience gathered here today. Participants\ninclude academic researchers, policymakers, and providers of financial services and data.\nThis year, the organizing committee received more than 140 high-quality submissions and\nselected seven excellent papers for presentation and discussion today. The selected papers\nrevisit four important issues:\n The design, and sometimes renegotiation, of financial contracts;\n The linkages between consumer credit and the real economy;\n The effects of government policy during the Great Recession; and\n The effect of timely disclosures about the cost of student loans on borrowing decisions.\nWe are excited to hear from our presenters and discussants, but let me just acknowledge the\nwork that this Bank does to advance the understanding of these important issues.\nIndeed, the Philadelphia Fed has one of the largest concentrations of expertise on household\nfinance, consumer payments, and the retail side of bank portfolios in the Federal Reserve\nSystem or anywhere.\nThe economists in our Research Department, led by Mike Dotsey, are known for pathbreaking\nstudies using new data and techniques. Seven of our 24 economists have the economics of\nconsumer behavior and regulation as either the primary focus or as a significant part of their\nresearch. Our research economists examine these issues from perspectives ranging from\n2\n\nsophisticated econometrics applied to terabytes of data to dynamic stochastic general\nequilibrium models.\nThe Payment Cards Center (PCC) is a unique interdisciplinary research group created here about\n15 years ago.\nBob Hunt and his 12-member team produce research that is accessible and relevant to a broad\naudience, including industry, consumers, policymakers, and academic researchers. Since it first\nbegan, the PCC has produced 130 studies and organized or co-organized more than 40\nconferences. Moreover, the PCC has been a major participant in regulatory initiatives within the\nFederal Reserve System and most recently in the Federal Reserve’s efforts to improve the\nspeed and security of the nation’s payments system.\nIn addition to the Research and the PCC departments that co-organized this event, the Bank has\ntwo important teams in the Supervision, Regulation, and Credit Department (SRC) that are\nrecognized centers of expertise in the quantitative supervision of banks’ consumer portfolios,\nrisk modeling, and stress testing. Paul Calem leads a team of 20, including Ph.D. s, in our Retail\nRisk Analysis and Financial Monitoring Group. In addition to its supervisory work, Paul’s team is\nhelping to advance the research frontier by producing and publishing academic studies.\nThe SRC Department is also the home of the System’s Risk Assessment, Data Analysis, and\nResearch (RADAR) unit, which manages a huge data warehouse of U.S. consumer credit\ndatabases and information about the asset-backed securities portfolios. Larry Cordell leads a\nstaff of 16 and has helped make RADAR an invaluable resource for the Federal Reserve System’s\nsupervisory and research activities around consumer credit. He and his team have also\npublished a number of important studies in academic journals.\nOur Community Development Studies & Education Department, led by Theresa Singleton, is\nalso actively engaged in data-driven research on consumer credit focusing on housing and\neconomic inclusion for low- and moderate-income communities. In addition, Theresa and her\nteam provide training, lesson plans, and other resources for teachers, who are educating our\nyoung people about consumer credit and payments.\n3\n\nSo, as you can see, the Philadelphia Fed has a multidisciplined, broad-based approach to\nconsumer credit and payments. All of these departments collaborate here in Philadelphia and\nwith colleagues around the Federal Reserve System.\nAn awareness of supervisory issues informs our academic research, and the rigor of our\nacademic research informs our supervisory work. At the same time, frequent interactions with\nmarket participants, policymakers, and consumer groups ― facilitated by the PCC ― creates\nopportunities for further understanding with the ultimate goal to influence future policy\ndecisions.\nYou can see the results in our research in just the past 12 months. The Philadelphia Fed has\npublished more than 25 new studies and articles on student loans, credit risk modeling, and\nsecuritization. The work has delved into the costs of foreclosures, information problems in the\nhome appraisal process, and the macroeconomics of the housing cycle. Topics also have\ncovered the functioning of private money, such as bitcoin, the collections process, and the role\nof consumer bankruptcy. Again, this just names a few.\nLet me conclude by telling you a little more about Philadelphia’s work on identity theft.\nLast year, five members of the PCC published two papers on this topic. In the first, the authors\nstudied the various types of “alerts” that consumers place in their credit bureau files for fraud\nprotection.\nThe authors found that the type of alert they choose often depends on initial conditions,\nincluding their credit scores. They also found that filers of “extended alerts,” which require the\nconsumer to submit a police report or similar record, are clearly victims of severe examples of\nidentity theft.\nIn their second paper, the authors reviewed these severe identity theft events based on the\nrecords in their credit bureau files. Let me emphasize that the data they used have been\ncompletely anonymized. The authors found there is a negative effect of identity theft on\nconsumers’ credit reports, but for consumers with prime credit scores, these effects are\n4\n\ntransitory. There is a drop and then a recovery in credit scores within three to six months of\nidentity theft being discovered.\nWhat is most intriguing is the pattern among consumers with subprime credit scores. These\nconsumers also experienced a negative shock ― their credit scores drop ― but they\nsubsequently experienced a rebound in their credit scores that is even larger and persistent. In\nother words, after experiencing a severe identity theft event, these subprime consumers have a\ncredit score that is systematically better than we would expect from a comparable group of\nsubprime borrowers who are not victims of identity theft.\nIn addition, these consumers apply for and obtain more revolving credit than their peers who\ndid not experience identity theft.\nThese consumers also perform better in terms of repayment on their debts, which is why their\ncredit scores remain elevated even after they gain access to more credit.\nThe authors conclude that for some consumers, identity theft is a “teachable moment,” in\nwhich consumers appreciate the significance of their credit reports on access to credit. They\nbegin to police mistakes in their credit reports, whether they are the result of crimes or honest\nmistakes by one of the credit reporting agencies. They may also become more diligent in their\nrepayment behavior, which is an extremely important component of credit scores.\nThat is just one example of the work our Bank is doing to advance the understanding of\nconsumer credit and payment markets.\nNow, let me turn the podium over to Bob Hunt, who will introduce our first panel.\n5",

    "text": "Economic Outlook and\nBuilding an Inclusive Recovery\nThe Center City Proprietors Association\nPhiladelphia, PA (virtual)\nJuly 15, 2020\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nEconomic Outlook and Building an Inclusive Recovery\nThe Center City Proprietors Association\nPhiladelphia, PA (virtual)\nJuly 15, 2020\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood afternoon, everybody, and thanks to Suzette for that very kind introduction. It’s great to be here\namong such an impressive group of people who care deeply about our city.\nGiven that today’s lunch is virtual, I won’t do the standard thing and urge you to try the salmon and tip\nthe waiters. But I still have to do another standard thing, which is to give you my usual Fed disclaimer:\nThe views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal\nOpen Market Committee or in the Federal Reserve System.\nThe New Abnormal\nWe’re now about four months into the coronavirus crisis and the onset of what I don’t want to call the\n“new normal.” None of this ― including the fact that we’re meeting virtually today ― is normal.\nOver that period, we went from enjoying strong economic growth, stable prices, and near-record low\nunemployment to a sharp contraction of economic activity and tens of millions of job losses. Meanwhile,\nmore than 130,000 of our fellow citizens across the country have lost their lives to COVID-19 ― and the\nnumber continues to rise each day.\nIt has been a heartbreaking period.\nI was trained as an engineer right here in Philadelphia, and one of my guiding principles has always been\nto trust the science. We’re learning that lesson anew during this period. Despite the enormous sacrifices\nmade by tens of millions of Americans, the country has still failed to control the virus.\n1\n\nThat is first and foremost a public health crisis. And it’s an economic one, too. A Fed president might like\nto think otherwise, but there is only so much policymakers can do right now to affect the economy. Our\ncountry’s economic performance in a large part depends on what happens with COVID-19.\nThe projections I’m about to share with you, in other words, come with a huge caveat: They’re\nconstantly changing along with the path of the virus. Still, doing a bit of averaging, I can tell you that\nforecasts are suggesting about a negative 20 percent real GDP growth in the first half of this year\nfollowed by a 13 percent growth in the second half. Growth in 2020 would end up at around minus 6\npercent. That’s a much sharper recession than we experienced during the financial crisis.\nNone of this is to suggest that policymakers sit on their hands until the virus passes, of course. Indeed,\nthe pandemic has brought forth a policy response commensurate to its gravity. Congress provided\nsignificant fiscal support for the economy, which has blunted the pain of the contraction.\nFed Actions\nAnd the Federal Reserve’s role in mitigating this crisis has been to use our lending powers to maintain\nour underlying economic infrastructure by making sure that every sector of the economy has access to\nliquidity. Our lending facilities are meant as backstops to the private sector. We don’t want to\ndisintermediate the private sector — we simply want to be there to support market functioning.\nWe’ve done this, first and foremost, by lowering our policy interest rate to near zero fast and early. We\nkept this stance unchanged at last month’s FOMC meeting. As shown by the Survey of Economic\nProjections, almost all my colleagues believe, as do I, that it will be appropriate to maintain the policy\nrate near zero if the economy evolves as expected. Using the discount window, we are also actively\nencouraging banks to borrow money from the Fed at ultra-low interest rates, to make sure they have\nthe funds they need to serve their customers at this critical time.\nIn order to keep markets functioning, beginning in March, we started buying large amounts of Treasury\nbonds and mortgage-backed securities. We have now purchased more than $2 trillion of these products.\nThe markets have largely stabilized, and we’ve slowed the rate of purchases. But we’re not stopping. We\nintend to keep buying about $120 billion worth of Treasury bonds and MBS each month. As a backstop,\nwe have also purchased some corporate debt, and as the economy and credit markets heal, we will\ndisengage from that market as prudently and as expeditiously as possible.\n2\n\nBacked by credit protection from the U.S. Treasury, we’ve also launched the Main Street Lending\nProgram, which provides support for small and mid-sized businesses that were in good financial standing\nbefore the COVID-19 pandemic. The program opened in June and offers a variety of five-year loans to\nU.S companies employing up to 15,000 workers or with revenues of up to $5 billion, while deferring\nprincipal payments for two years and interest payments for one year. In conjunction with the Treasury,\nwe are also considering ways to broaden the program to include nonprofit organizations, which play a\nvital role in our communities and local economies.\nThere has been somewhat limited interest in Main Street ― only about 400 banks have registered to\nparticipate in this program. But in a way, that’s actually a good sign for the economy because it means\nthat firms have access to capital without having to use the Fed. Because if you recall, in all of this, we are\nsimply a backstop. On the other hand, if there is another major downturn in the economy, these\nfacilities will still be in place to offer funding.\nAt the same time, we’re bolstering the heavily used Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection\nProgram (PPP) by supplying liquidity to financial institutions that are issuing loans to those businesses\nthat are receiving aid through the program. There has been a lot interest in PPP, with more than 4.5\nmillion loans issued to the tune of more than $520 billion.\nWe’ve also rolled out a program to help cash-strapped local governments. The Municipal Liquidity\nFacility, whereby we buy bonds from municipalities and states whose tax revenues have collapsed, is\ndesigned to provide essential liquidity as they navigate the twin crises of the pandemic and the\neconomic downturn. The State of Illinois has already tapped this, and we are also opening it to\nmultistate agencies like the Port Authority of New York and other transit authorities.\nAn Inclusive Recovery\nWe will recover from this period, and there are already small signs that a rebound is underway. But it\nwill take time. And as the recovery takes shape, I want to make sure that the coming growth is not only\nstrong, but inclusive. It’s worth noting that even though we went into the COVID-19 crisis with a very\nstrong economy, far too many Americans ― disproportionately Americans of color ― were not sharing\nin the country’s prosperity.\n3\n\nPersonally, I’m serving on the Greater Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce’s Regional Recharge and\nRecovery Task Force. Our goal there is to make sure that the recovery from the COVID-19 crisis is not\nonly stronger in terms of growth, but also that it includes more of our fellow citizens.\nThe next period of growth should be strong and more inclusive than the last.\nSo, how do we do ensure that? Our work could include doing things like improving access to credit for\nsmall businesses and especially microenterprises. I don’t need to tell you that small businesses are the\nlifeblood of our communities. In the City of Philadelphia, fully 99.5 percent of businesses have fewer\nthan 500 workers. And of those, 54 percent employ fewer than five workers ― these are\nmicroenterprises.\nMany of these microenterprises don’t have the benefit of established banking relationships ― many\nhave never banked at all. That leaves them at a huge disadvantage, as we saw when many were unable\nto obtain PPP loans. And this is a problem that has disproportionately affected racial minorities and\ncommunities of color.\nTo be sure, there are many historical and structural reasons why so many of our microenterprises\nremain unbanked. But that doesn’t mean this is a status quo we have to accept. As we work toward\nrecovery, we should be thinking about how to tear down the impediments to those microenterprises\nhaving access to the banking system.\nCreating economic and professional mobility is also going to be key in making sure all segments of the\ncountry benefit from the recovery that is coming. Last month, the Philadelphia Fed released a paper that\nprovides an encouraging roadmap for how that might take place, and I’d like to share some of our\nfindings with you.\nFed researchers looked at the skill sets of people in 33 metro areas across the country, including the\nPhiladelphia area, who are holding those jobs that are most at risk of disappearing. They then matched\nthose skills to jobs that would pay at least 10 percent more than their current wage and that don’t\nrequire a traditional four-year degree.\nThe bottom line is this: We don’t have to accept that those in at-risk, low-wage jobs will remain so\nforever. Researchers found that nearly half of lower-wage employment can be paired with at least one\nhigher-paying occupation requiring similar skills. And the pay differences are significant, with an average\nbump in wages of almost $15,000 ― a 49 percent increase in salary ― for transitions connecting the\n4\n\nmost similar occupations identified in the study. Transitioning people into the right new job can mean\nthe difference between a life of poverty and a solid, middle-class standard of living.\nThe possibilities for creative public–private partnerships are very exciting. Transitioning low-wage\nworkers into higher-paying jobs not only helps companies themselves, insofar as they are tapping\nunderutilized human capital, but it also helps redress structural inequities. Communities of color stand\nto benefit because they have for far too long and far too often been shut out of higher wage work.\nAt the Philadelphia Fed, we’ve helped launch just such a program, working in partnership with Comcast\nand Philadelphia Works, our local workforce investment board. Philadelphia Works provides upfront\ninvestment in a pilot job-training program for Comcast. Comcast then pays for outcomes once they are\nachieved, such as staying on the job for over six months. It’s a tremendous example of what thoughtful\npublic–private partnerships can accomplish. We can’t push this all on the public sector, which, especially\nnow, doesn’t have the bandwidth or the money. But intelligent public–private partnerships could be a\nvery promising way forward.\nRather than staying stuck in this new normal or moving back to the old normal, I am confident that\ntogether we can forge a better future ― a better normal, perhaps ― for all of us. Thank you.\nAnd now, I’m happy to take some questions.\n5",

    "text": "The Fed’s Balance Sheet\nThe 37th Annual Monetary and Trade Conference\nGlobal Interdependence Center\nPhiladelphia, PA\nMay 6, 2019\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nThe Fed’s Balance Sheet\nThe 37th Annual Monetary and Trade Conference\nGlobal Interdependence Center\nPhiladelphia, PA\nMay 6, 2019\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood morning and thank you; it’s a pleasure to be here.\nThe tagline of this conference is Global Trade: Darkening Clouds or New Beginnings? And I want\nyou to know that I valiantly resisted the temptation to make a bad joke — or worse, a pun —\ninvolving Churchill’s “beginning of the end” or “end of the beginning.” But there are some\nechoes of its essence in the subject of my remarks today. Life — and policy — is full of endings\nand beginnings that are part of a larger whole. So I’d like to talk today about the continuing\nprocess of normalizing monetary policy, and the unwinding of the Fed’s balance sheet. If I were\ngoing to give in to the urge to make that joke, I might call it the beginning of the end of the\nmiddle of the end of the almost end of our road to normal. … But, of course, I would never do\nthat.\nI will, however, add to my remarks a brief outlook on how I see the economy unfolding and\nwhat that means for my policy views. I’m approaching my four-year anniversary as a Fed\npresident, and one of the first lessons I learned on taking that seat was to always give an\neconomic outlook. Another was to always preface any remarks with the standard Fed\ndisclaimer: The views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of\nanyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n1\n\nOutlook\nStarting with GDP, the initial readings of Q1 were a pleasant surprise, particularly as first\nquarters have tended to be slow in recent years. However, there are a few caveats. A good\nchunk of that boost came from inventories and net exports, which are unlikely to carry into the\nrest of the year. It’s possible that the drag we usually see in first quarters will show up in Q2 this\nyear, as inventories in particular tend to counter large boosts today with a drag tomorrow.\nConsumer spending, which has been the primary driver of growth, showed a slowdown from\nlast year, as did business investment.\nThe net result of these components means my outlook for growth this year remains the same\nfor now: a little above 2 percent. I also continue to see next year returning to trend, at about 2\npercent.\nThe labor market continues to show remarkable strength, with strong job creation and\ncontinued low unemployment. I think the unemployment rate could move down even further,\nto 3.5 percent before edging back up a few tenths of a percentage point.\nInflation has softened in recent months, and it’s an area I’m focusing my attention on. I haven’t\nyet revised my medium-term inflation forecast, because I suspect some of the recent weakness\nis transitory. So I still see it running slightly above our 2 percent target for the medium term,\nbut that projection is nowhere near written in stone; more like a dry-erase board.\nIf any component of the outlook were to affect my view on the appropriate path of monetary\npolicy, it would be inflation. However, we’re not there yet, and it would take more data to\nconvince me. I therefore continue to see one increase at most this year; possibly one, at most,\nnext.\nUnwinding the Balance Sheet\nTurning to the crux of my remarks today, as you know, the FOMC has made further moves\nregarding the balance sheet, which were laid out in its updates to the “normalization principles\nand plans” after our January and March meetings. There are three interrelated components to\nthis. First, continued implementation of monetary policy in a regime of ample reserves. Second,\n2\n\nour intent to stop asset redemptions in September. And third, the anticipation that the size of\nthe balance sheet will be constant for some time after that, letting the supply of reserves\ndecline, very gradually, as currency and other non-reserve liabilities grow.\nTo clarify the Fed-speak, “monetary policy in a regime of ample reserves” means that policy will\nbe executed as it is in normal times, with the federal funds rate acting as our primary tool. The\nfed funds, along with other short-term rates, will be managed mainly via administered rates,\nsuch as interest on reserves.\n“Amplitude,” of course, can sound quite nebulous, but in the case of the fed funds market, “an\nample supply of reserves” has a specific meaning: a level of aggregate reserves that can\ncomfortably accommodate demand within our target range through all the volatility associated\nwith seasonal demand and autonomous factors, without requiring active management. This\nmeans that, as long as economic and financial conditions unfold more or less as we expect\nthem to, the balance sheet will remain largely on autopilot, left in the background, as boring as\never. While the current state of reserves certainly falls within that definition, the Committee\nhas also made clear that we ultimately intend to hold no more reserves than necessary for\nefficient and effective monetary policy. I’m going to revisit that expression quite a few times, so\nit’s probably best if everyone adds mental quotation marks around “no more than necessary”\nand “efficient and effective” — I promise it reflects my adherence to careful policy wording,\nrather than a lack of imagination. Or a thesaurus.\nAs we’ve announced, our plan is to end the balance sheet runoff in September. Starting this\nmonth, the cap on Treasury redemptions will be lowered from $30 billion a month to $15\nbillion, to put a modest damper on the pace of redemptions.\nWhen the runoff ends, reserves will likely still be somewhat more than necessary for that\n“efficient and effective” execution, rather than no more than necessary. Therefore, we intend\nto hold the size of the balance sheet roughly constant for a time. By doing so, we will let the\nsupply of reserves decline gradually with growth in currency and other non-reserve liabilities.\nFor me, a key issue is that we only have estimates of the demand for reserves, and that\nuncertainty calls for a cautious approach. It may be that “ample” is more than we thought, and\n3\n\nreserve levels can’t really drop much further without inflicting interest rate volatility and\ncreating liquidity-management issues for financial institutions.\nAdditionally, the supply of reserves is notoriously volatile. Autonomous factors, such as the\nTreasury General Account and repo facilities, can move the aggregate supply of reserves by as\nmuch as $90 billion in either direction in a single week. We have a good track record of\nforecasting these swings, and they do tend to reverse themselves. But those factors do inflict a\nsubstantial fluctuation in the supply of reserves to depository institutions.\nSo in metaphorical terms, it is a dark and stormy night, to quote Peanuts, and we are walking in\nthe direction of a wall. In that situation, most of us would give the advice of “walk, don’t run,”\nand keep a bit of distance from where we think the wall is.\nWalk, Don’t Run\nSo we intend to walk toward the “efficient and effective” level, rather than charging at full\nspeed.\nThe plan is to slow down the pace of decline in average reserves. We’ll do that by keeping the\nsize of our aggregate securities holdings constant for a time. During this period, we will see a\nvery — and I do stress “very” — gradual decrease in average reserves as currency and other\nnon-reserve liabilities grow over time. Average currency growth rarely exceeds $10 billion per\nmonth, while asset redemptions have averaged more than $30 billion a month. That said, more\nthan half of the decline realized to date was unrelated to asset redemptions, and reserves have\ndeclined by more than $1 trillion since their peak of $2.8 trillion.\nThis slow and steady approach, which is based on work by the Philadelphia staff,1 is not only\nthe safer option, it has the additional advantage of reducing uncertainty about the evolution of\nasset redemptions. In fact, it effectively decouples asset and liability policies as we make our\nway to “no more than necessary.” It also gives us additional time for monitoring and analysis,\n1 I would like to thank Roc Armenter for his research and insight.\n4\n\nand may even foster changes to how financial institutions manage liquidity. These factors both\nmeet the FOMC’s stated objective to proceed in a “gradual and predictable manner.”\nKeeping the Distance\nWe also want to keep a comfortable distance to avoid a collision with the wall. As I said, we\nonly have estimates of the demand for reserves, and the parameters of “ample” may be closer\nthan we think. Those autonomous factors I mentioned add something of a howling wind to our\nmetaphorical late-night excursion, because their volatile effect makes it similarly difficult to\nnavigate a narrow path for aggregate reserves. Both considerations call for additional aggregate\nreserves, creating a buffer zone to account for margins of error in our estimates and protect\nagainst large swings in autonomous factors.\nA Little More Normalizing\nAs reserves continue to decline, they will eventually reach their efficient and effective level, at\nwhich point we’ll resume asset purchases to maintain that level, keeping up with nominal\ngrowth.\nEven at that point, though, we will not be “normalization accomplished” — though we will be\nnormalization adjacent.\nBecause the next natural step in the balance sheet discussion is its composition.\nOnce the balance sheet’s holdings do not exceed the need, they’re unlikely to meet the want —\nat least not that of the long run. The FOMC has made clear that the portfolio will consist\nprimarily of Treasuries, but currently, MBS account for more than 40 percent. There are no\nTreasury bills, and our Treasury holdings have a substantially longer remaining maturity than\noutstanding Treasury securities. While a significant number of Treasuries will reach maturity in\nthe coming years, a sizable share has a remaining lifetime of 20 years or more.\nAs we discuss the question of composition, it’s worth returning to the Rosetta Stone of\npolicyspeak, particularly when we talk about the “longer run.” The transition could easily take\nclose to a decade, even if economic and financial conditions unfold as expected. Balance sheet\n5\n\npolicies are inherently asymmetrical — that is, they are deployed when we need more\naccommodation than rates alone can deliver, never the other way around — so the portfolio\ncomposition will never average “normal” nor, in fact, will it be “normal” on anything like a\nregular basis.\nWhile the longer run can be something of an amorphous concept, the near term is more\nconcrete, and poses pressing questions. There will need to be decisions about how to distribute\nreinvestments and, eventually, outright asset purchases. Importantly, those decisions can have\nan immediate impact, and will need to be communicated clearly, as they will almost certainly\nbe the subject of intense market attention.\nI’m not going to weigh in on the functions, but I will say something about the philosophy.\nFor me, any discussion of composition has to be predicated on a set of grounding principles.\nWhile there are certainly more than just these two to consider, I would start with the doctrines\nof neutrality and flexibility.\nNeutrality is grounded in the monetary policymaker’s Hippocratic Oath of doing no harm. In this\ncase, our plans should avoid market disruptions. One way to do that is ensuring we spread\nholdings and purchases across maturities in proportion to their amount outstanding, avoiding\ncornering any one particular issue. In particular, recently issued Treasuries — often referred to\nas “on the run” — are vital to market functioning.\nFlexibility involves the crucial ability to dip into our arsenal of balance sheet policies if the need\narises. I want to stress that we would only revisit those options if we again found ourselves in a\nsituation that called for more accommodation than the federal funds rate could provide on its\nown. But it is important to maintain that ability. One way to increase flexibility is by changing\nthe maturity of the balance sheet’s composition. The shorter the duration of the portfolio, the\nlarger the flow of maturing proceeds at any given time. That flow can be redirected, allowing\nfor a swift change in the composition without expanding the balance sheet or having to sell\nassets outright.\n6\n\nOne option, therefore, would be tilting the Treasury portfolio toward a somewhat shorter term.\nThat could be done by simply increasing our holdings of Treasury bills, which have a maturity of\na year or less.\nIt’s important to note that there are many discussions still to be had, and that these principles\nare but two of many. Important ones, but in good company.\nFinally, it is worth repeating that the normalization process, while an important policy decision,\nis not indicative of our monetary policy stance.\nConclusion\nAnd so I come to the beginning of the end of my remarks.\nWe are on the path to normalization, though when this next step is complete, there will still be\nmore to take. The conversations will continue, particularly about composition, and for me, the\nprinciples of neutrality and flexibility will be key.\nWith that, the end of my remarks and the beginning of the Q&A.\n7",

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nEconomic Outlook and the Anchor Economy Initiative\n2023 Lyons Center for Economic Education and Entrepreneurship\nUniversity of Delaware\nNewark, DE\nJanuary 18, 2023\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood afternoon! It’s great to be back at UD. I had many very happy years as president here, though I did\nrecall the one downside to working here as I made my way down I-95 this afternoon: the traffic.\nIn all seriousness, it’s really an honor to be here for today’s event. I plan to speak a bit about the\nnational economy, monetary policy, and an exciting new initiative from the Federal Reserve Bank of\nPhiladelphia. And then we can get to the discussion, which I’m really looking forward to.\nBut before I can do any of that, I need to give you my standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today\nare my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\nHow We Got Here\nYou know, the last time I was here for this event was almost exactly three years ago in February 2020.\nAnd if we take a step back and think about it, it’s quite remarkable how much has transpired since we\nwere last together. First and foremost, of course, is the humanitarian tragedy that our country — and\nour world — has endured because of the COVID-19 virus over the past three years. More than 7.5\nmillion people globally have perished from the virus, including more than 1 million of our fellow\nAmericans. This is a public health catastrophe on a global scale that is unprecedented in any of our\nlifetimes.\n1\n\nThe tribulations of the U.S. economy over this period have been startling as well. During the early part of\nthe pandemic, the national economy suffered its largest contraction in recorded history as the virus\nspread and state and local governments shuttered businesses that they deemed nonessential. Tens of\nmillions of Americans were thrown into joblessness in one of the sharpest recessions in American\nhistory.\nThat downturn was followed by a period of extraordinary economic growth as states loosened\nrestrictions and, with astonishing rapidity, highly effective vaccines against COVID-19 were developed\nand deployed.\nBut even as the economy came roaring back to health, scars were visible. Many older Americans had\nopted to retire at the onset of the pandemic, leaving labor force participation below where it was before\nCOVID-19 arrived on our shores. Supply chains were badly damaged by the virus itself as workers fell ill,\nand by government lockdowns, which shuttered factories for extended periods. This left crucial items\nlike computer chips in short supply. Meanwhile, large doses of fiscal spending from the federal\ngovernment and accommodative monetary policy from the Federal Reserve stoked demand. This led to\na phenomenon known colloquially as “too much money chasing too few goods” and the highest inflation\nin four decades.\nWhere We Are Nationally\nHigh inflation is a scourge, leading to economic inefficiencies and hurting Americans of limited means\ndisproportionately. I find it particularly disturbing that life’s true essentials like groceries, fuel, and\nshelter have skyrocketed in price.\nThe Federal Reserve is absolutely committed to bringing inflation back to our 2 percent target.\nAnd we’re doing that by adjusting our monetary policy. Last year, we raised the target for the federal\nfunds rate to between 4.25 percent and 4.5 percent. That was a significant move, and a very fast one,\ngiven that we started the year at about 0 percent. I expect that we will raise rates a few more times this\nyear, though, to my mind, the days of us raising them 75 basis points at a time have surely passed. In my\nview, hikes of 25 basis points will be appropriate going forward.\n2\n\nAt some point this year, I expect that the policy rate will be restrictive enough that we will hold rates in\nplace to let monetary policy do its work. We are also shrinking our balance sheet, which is removing a\nsignificant amount of accommodation in and of itself.\nOur goal is to slow the economy modestly and to bring demand more in line with supply. The Federal\nReserve obviously can’t fix problems like supply chain issues, or an endemic shortage of workers, though\nit does seem like these problems are finally easing a bit. But we can affect demand by making it more\nexpensive to borrow money. And that’s clearly already happening: We’re seeing unmistakable signs of a\nslowdown in the most interest-rate sensitive parts of the economy, like housing.\nWhat’s encouraging is that even as we are raising rates, and seeing some signs that inflation is cooling,\nthe national economy remains relatively healthy overall. In parts of 2022, the economy grew modestly\neven as we were tightening monetary policy substantially. Although inflation is biting, many Americans\nare still spending — even if they dip into their savings to do so.\nWe’re seeing a healthy recovery in those sectors that suffered most during the pandemic, like leisure\nand hospitality, while some sectors that built up healthy order books like manufacturing are cooling\nsomewhat. I do remain concerned about commercial real estate, as the embrace of remote and hybrid\nwork is clearly dampening demand for office space in central business districts and suburban office\nparks.\nI’m most pleased that the labor market remains in excellent shape. Last year, the U.S. economy created\n4.5 million jobs, and while we are seeing scattered layoffs in certain segments like tech, there is little\nevidence of a major downturn in the job market. In fact, a record number of Americans are employed.\nAnd indeed, the national unemployment rate is exceptionally low at 3.5 percent.\nWhere We Are Going\nBut there’s more good news: We are starting to see inflation come down across a spectrum of goods.\nAnd so, with monetary policy doing its work, supply chains healing, and excess demand running off, I\nforecast core inflation to come in at around 3.5 percent this year. I want to be clear: This is well over our\n2 percent target. But it is suggestive of clear movement in the right direction. Core inflation should fall\nto 2.5 percent in 2024 and then back down to 2 percent in 2025.\n3\n\nGDP growth will be modest, but I’m not forecasting a recession. The labor markets are simply too hot to\nindicate a significant downturn at this point. I expect real GDP growth of about 1 percent this year\nbefore climbing back up to trend growth of about 2 percent in 2024 and 2025.\nLastly, I do think we will see a very slight uptick in unemployment, probably topping out at about 4.5\npercent this year, before falling back toward 4 percent over the next two years. It’s an underrated\nadvantage that the Federal Reserve is taking on inflation from a position of such labor market strength.\nThe Anchor Economy Initiative\nNow, in the remaining few minutes, I’d like to talk a little bit about an exciting new initiative from the\nPhiladelphia Fed called the Anchor Economy Initiative. It’s fitting that we are convening here on the\nSTAR Campus today because this place exemplifies the Anchor Economy Initiative perfectly.\nThe Anchor Economy Initiative seeks to quantify the economic impact of higher education institutions\nand hospitals — eds and meds — that we call the anchor institutions in their communities.\nThis is vital work. Anchor institutions are often the largest employers in regions, they’re the producers of\ntalent that other businesses need, and they lay the foundation for durable economic growth.\nThey also have characteristics that other institutions just don’t. For one, even though they’ve made\nsizable leaps in their use of technology in recent years — especially during the COVID-19 pandemic —\nhigher education institutions and hospitals are physically embedded in their communities. In fact, that’s\none of the reasons we call them anchor institutions. Unlike corporate headquarters, manufacturing\nfacilities, or sports teams that can pick up and move, higher education institutions and hospitals tend to\nstay where they are. Hospitals and higher education also tend to be labor intensive, meaning they are\noften among the largest employers in their regions.\nEds and meds also serve as bulwarks against the ups and downs of the business cycle. Enrollment in\ncolleges and universities, for instance, is countercyclical, meaning that when the economy slows,\nusually more people go to school, boosting anchor institutions. Hospitals are also recession resistant;\nafter all, people require medical care no matter how the local economy is faring. All of which suggests\nthat regions with strong anchor institutions may have more durable economies than those without.\n4\n\nAnd in recent years, we’ve also seen anchor institutions take an increasing interest in building up the\nareas they serve. They are typically critical partners in community development initiatives. We’ve seen\nmore hospitals and universities invest in neighborhood economic development, boosting local\ncommercial corridors, seeding residential real estate development, and building neighborhood\namenities.\nAnchor institutions’ impact goes beyond the immediate. This is a key point that I really want to stress.\nFundamentally, anchor institutions stimulate growth through innovation, commercialization, new\nventure formation, and talent attraction. In that sense, they can drive long-term economic development\nand growth.\nLet’s not sugarcoat things, though. Eds and meds are both being radically disrupted by technology,\ndemographic shifts, and increasing costs. As I alluded to earlier, the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated\nboth telehealth and remote learning. This has certainly created opportunities for health systems and\nuniversities to expand their markets, but it also loosened the place-based nature of their services.\nSuddenly, these anchors are, frankly, a little less anchored.\nDemographics are another downside risk, though with disparate impacts for universities and hospitals.\nWith falling birth rates, fewer 18-year-olds are heading to college and even fewer will enroll in the\nfuture, especially if immigration rates remain depressed, as they are now. This demographic shift is most\napparent in the Northeast and Midwest, which also happen to have higher concentrations of colleges\nand universities. That raises real questions about the viability of many of these institutions in the future\n— and the impact that will have on communities.\nOn the other hand, an aging population is one that will require more health care, boosting hospitals.\nEven here, however, the picture is mixed, as many hospitals have closed over the past several years.\nMeanwhile, the ever-rising cost of education and health care means that more people may be priced\nout of accessing eds and meds altogether, which is both a humanitarian concern and an economic one.\nThat’s why, at the Philadelphia Fed, we’ve developed what we call the Anchor Economy Dashboard, a\nnew tool that quantifies the impact of higher education institutions and hospitals on more than 500\nregions across the country.\n5\n\nFor each of these regions, the dashboard calculates the total number of jobs — direct, indirect, or\ninduced — supported by local eds and meds institutions. Direct jobs comprise those employed directly\nby anchor institutions, like doctors, nurses, and college professors. Indirect are those working in fields\nthat directly support anchor institutions, like IT contractors supporting a hospital. And induced jobs are\nthose that are supported by the economic activity that anchor economies generate.\nOne thing that makes the Anchor Economy Dashboard so neat is that it also calculates a reliance\nindex for each region. The reliance index provides a summary measure of how dependent a regional\neconomy is on anchor institutions. It adjusts economic impact by the size of the regional economy and\nincorporates measures of impact in terms of employment, income, and gross value added. A reliance\nindex of 1 means a region’s reliance on anchor institutions is at the national average — below that\nmeans it’s less reliant, and above that means it’s more reliant.\nOn a national scale, the dashboard clearly shows what I’ve been talking about: The economic impact of\nanchor institutions is massive; 9 percent of total U.S. employment, 6.3 percent of total U.S. income, and\n8.1 percent of total U.S. gross value added comes from higher education institutions and hospitals. That\ntranslates to 18.2 million jobs, $1.1 trillion in income, and $1.7 trillion in gross value added to the\neconomy.\nFor Delaware, our data support what I suspect a lot of us know intuitively: This state is quite reliant on\nanchor institutions. So, while Delaware’s total employment in eds and meds ranks 46th out of 50 states\nand the District of Columbia, that is largely a result of the state having a small population. Delaware’s\nreliance index, we calculate, is 1.23. In other words, Delaware overindexes on eds and meds\nemployment, income, and gross value added, compared with other regions. Delaware is 23 percent\nmore dependent on eds and meds for jobs, income, and gross value added than the United States as a\nwhole.\nConclusion\nI urge you all — after today’s program — to head over to philadelphiafed.org to delve into the\ndashboard. We have data for 524 regions across the U.S. — truly a treasure trove. I think you’ll find the\ninformation there useful and important.\n6\n\nIn closing, I’d like to reiterate my thanks to you for attending, and the Federal Reserve’s strong\ncommitment to bringing down inflation. Now let’s get on to the discussion.\n7",

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nOutlook for Economic and Banking Conditions\nRisk Management Association, Philadelphia Chapter\nThe National Constitution Center\nPhiladelphia, PA\nOctober 20, 2023\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood morning, everyone.\nThank you to my Philadelphia Fed colleague, Ivy Washington, for that welcome and introduction. I must\nalso acknowledge the efforts of one of my other colleagues from across the street, Robin Myers, for\nputting this program together.\nAnd I also wish to recognize Senior Vice President and Lending Officer Bill Spaniel, who will be\nmoderating the discussion portion of this morning’s program.\nI’m also thankful for each of you for taking the time to join us here this morning, especially the morning\nafter a Phillies playoff game.\nNow certainly, I can stand up here and speak, but that would only make this a one-way discussion. I\nwant to hear your questions, to engage on the issues that matter to you, and to ensure we make the\nmost of this time. So, allow me to briefly give you my economic outlook and a brief overview of current\nbanking conditions in the Third Federal Reserve District as our launching off point for this discussion.\nBut before we do anything, I must get the first piece of business out of the way, and that is the usual\nFederal Reserve disclaimer: The views I express this morning are my own and do not necessarily reflect\nthose of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\n1\n\nSo, I will begin with the following: I remain rooted in my opinion that we are at the point where holding\nthe policy rate steady is the prudent position to take. I arrived at this decision after carefully reviewing\nboth the hard data and what I’ve been hearing directly from contacts throughout the Third District.\nFurther, economic and financial conditions are continuing to evolve as I have been expecting, though I\nam keeping a close eye on the latest data. There has not been the abrupt shift in data that would lead\nme to change my current position.\nThe available data for September have mostly come out stronger than I expected. The latest on retail\nsales confirms that households retained spending power and did not seem shy to use it over the\nsummer. A resilient consumer is not a problem. Indeed, perhaps the key tenet of a soft landing is that\nhouseholds get to adjust their plan for when and how it best serves them — as opposed to the kind of\ndrastic, unavoidable adjustments that come with, say, suddenly losing their job.\nTruthfully, the momentum in consumer spending is a bit of a head-scratcher. Contacts talk of a more\ncautious, price-sensitive consumer. Major surveys also show a steady drop in consumer confidence since\nthe summer. But there could have been some specific factors at play over the summer that we have yet\nto fully parse out, or we could be right at a turning point, or perhaps the fundamentals are even\nstronger for households.\nLet me stop here to state three things. First, we are not going to tolerate a reacceleration in prices.\nSecond, while I stand ready to revise my views and act accordingly if I see signs of reinflation, I am also\nnot going to overreact to the normal month-to-month variability in data.\nAnd third, we must remain data dependent, and that includes making sure we separate that which could\njust be noise from that which could be an actual signal. But to make that differentiation — and make it\nwith certainty, as we must — we will need several months of data that we can average.\nAnd this also includes data from the impacts of lingering uncertainties to which we must remain\nattuned. Prolonged labor strikes, the restart of student loan payments, and international events each\ncome with their own set of economic effects. But we won’t necessarily know their extent for some time.\nWe will need to see the data.\n2\n\nThe mechanics of the economy cannot be rushed. We raised the policy rate by more than 5 percentage\npoints in the span of a little more than a year. That’s a lot of change in not a lot of time. We know that\nthe full impacts of those increases may not yet be fully absorbed across the economy. We also turned\naround our balance sheet with near equal speed. We put ourselves in restrictive territory very quickly.\nBut the speed with which we worked then is also part of my argument for holding steady now. As I\nnoted, policy rates are restrictive, and holding them steady now will keep us in restrictive territory and\nsteadily pressing down on inflation. This is a time where doing nothing is doing something, and, in fact,\nI’d argue that it equates to doing quite a lot.\nSo, allow me to quickly give you my projections based on this stance.\nFirst, on inflation: While headline PCE inflation remains elevated above target, it is almost half of what it\nwas last year on a year-over-year basis. And August’s monthly reading was the smallest month-over-\nmonth increase since 2020. The data I see, and all that I hear, point to a steady disinflation that is\nalready under way and sustained, if slow. My projections have inflation dropping below 3 percent in\n2024 and leveling out at our 2 percent target thereafter.\nI expect GDP growth, which has been outperforming estimates from earlier this year, to continue\nthrough the end of 2023, before pulling back slightly in 2024. But while I anticipate the rate of GDP\ngrowth to moderate, I do not anticipate a contraction. I do not project a recession.\nAnd looking at jobs, I anticipate unemployment to end the year at about 4 percent — just slightly above\nwhat the unemployment rate is now — and to increase slowly over the next year to peak at around 4.5\npercent before heading back toward 4 percent in 2025. This path would put the unemployment figure in\nline with the natural rate of unemployment, or that theoretical level where labor market conditions\nsupport stable 2 percent inflation.\nNow, this does not mean that I expect mass layoffs. I do not. There are multiple factors that can all\ninfluence unemployment rates, including technological changes in the workplace, more workers\n3\n\nreentering the labor force, or other public policy choices that may impact workers’ decisions regarding\ntheir own jobs. And sometimes these forces simultaneously exert their push and pull.\nSo, when we look at all of this, my view is that we need to exhale, allow the policy actions we’ve taken\nto continue to work, and closely watch the data before making any decisions on moving the policy rate\nin either direction. A resolute, but patient, stance on monetary policy will allow us to achieve the soft\nlanding that we all wish for our economy.\nNow, as for when I anticipate rates coming back down? That is a question to which I don’t yet have an\nanswer. My forecasts are based on what I know as of now. And as time goes by, as adjustments are\ncompleted, as new data emerge, and as we gain additional insight on the underlying trends, I may need\nto adjust my forecasts, and with them, my time frames. Suffice it to say, rates will need to stay high for a\nwhile.\nNow, let me briefly turn our attention to banking and financial conditions as we currently see them in\nthe Third District. Bill and I will be able to dive more deeply into this area with you during our discussion.\nBut here are the broad strokes.\nI’ll start by recognizing that, overall, current capital levels remain adequate as institutions across the\nDistrict continue to have sufficient liquidity. Thankfully, banks throughout the District have not\nexperienced widespread drop-offs in deposits, and deposit levels have been on a return upward toward\nhistorical levels. Earnings remain strong, though an increase in interest expense remains a concern.\nBusiness lending has continued, though it was reported to me by contacts that many borrowers have\nbeen turning their focus to their “must haves,” not their “like to haves.” The decrease in mortgage\nactivity has been notable, as has been widely reported — and certainly this is true both here in our\nregion and nationwide. Asset quality throughout lending portfolios has remained favorable.\nThirty-day delinquency rates among all active loans, while trending higher, remain below their historical\nand prepandemic levels.\n4\n\nHowever, with all of this comes both interest rate and liquidity risks as deposits return to their\nprepandemic levels, the funding gap that it is creating, and the balance sheet impacts of the increases in\npolicy rates.\nOne of the largest concerns to me, at least in the immediate Philadelphia area, remains the commercial\nreal estate (CRE) sector. Office vacancy rates remain above their prepandemic levels, while office net\nabsorption rates remain stubbornly negative. The placement of the Wanamaker Building, arguably one\nof this city’s premier addresses, into receivership looms large.\nHowever, District-wide, it has been reported through contacts that CRE portfolios aren’t necessarily\nfacing the same risks as here in Philadelphia. As one contact relayed, the local dentist offices aren’t\ngoing to remote work. So, overall, CRE lending and loan performance remains sound.\nOn the operational side, we have continued to urge our contacts to remain vigilant to cyberattacks and\nto carefully monitor any novel tech-driven activities with which they may become engaged, including in\ncrypto and partnerships with nonbanks to deliver financial services to customers.\nBut, again, throughout the District, the banking sector remains strong and not broadly impacted by the\nspring’s banking turmoil. Customers can have faith in their deposits and in their financial institutions.\nLook, overall, we continue to be in a sound region of the country. Earlier this week, at a prior event, I\nwas asked about our region’s economic health. My response was the following: Philadelphia doesn’t\nseem to ride the highs or lows that other regional economies do; we seem to always just keep going.\nAnd that is where I would put us at this moment. Our region continues to move along. We see positive\nsigns for our economy and our collective future.\nI think that’s good point for me to end. I am sure you have questions, and I am eager to get to them.\n5",

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nEconomic Outlook: Cautious Optimism\nA Virtual Conversation with Philadelphia Federal Reserve President Patrick T. Harker\nRisk Management Association\nPhiladelphia Chapter\nPhiladelphia, PA (virtual)\nSeptember 29, 2021\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood morning! It’s great to be back with this group, though given that we’re meeting virtually, we\nunfortunately had to make it a BYOB — bring your own breakfast, I mean, of course.\nI note that the title of this event is “A Virtual Conversation with Philadelphia Federal Reserve President\nPatrick T. Harker,” and I’m really looking forward to that part of the morning. But before we get to the\nQ&A, I’d like to sketch out just a few brief remarks about the state of the national economy and the path\nof Federal Reserve policy.\nBut before I can even do that, there is another bit of Fed policy I must adhere to. And that is the\nstandard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of\nanyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or in the Federal Reserve System.\nFor the past 18 months, the U.S. economy has moved in tandem with the waxing and waning of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. During periods when case rates and hospitalizations have declined, the economy\nhas surged as American consumers have voted with their feet — and their wallets. When COVID-19 risks\nabate, more Americans dine out at restaurants, check in to hotels, and — much to the chagrin of their\nfellow passengers who were hoping to stuff their luggage in the overhead compartment — fill up\nairplanes. Those are important categories of spending in a country where consumption makes up about\n70 percent of total economic activity. In the second quarter of this year, for instance, GDP grew at a very\nhealthy annualized rate of around 6.5 percent as case rates plummeted.\n1\n\nAnd, of course, the opposite occurs during periods when the virus spikes. When the Delta variant of\nCOVID-19 erupted, fomenting the country’s fourth major wave of the pandemic, things started moving\nsideways. Consumer confidence tanked, and large industries like hospitality and leisure stagnated at\nbest. So for this quarter, we can expect growth to come in at an annualized rate of between 3 and 4\npercent, a sharp slowdown from earlier this year.\nBut there are reasons to be sanguine that the country’s recovery from this wave of COVID-19 may prove\nmore durable than in the past. You’re a group of risk management professionals, so I probably don’t\nneed to tell you this, but vaccines are by far the most effective way to mitigate the risks of both catching\n— and also getting seriously ill — from the virus.\nThe good news here is that more than half the country is fully vaccinated. In our tri-state region,\nmeanwhile, vaccination rates are above the national average. Getting more shots into arms will save\nlives and aid the recovery by reducing the size and severity of future COVID-19 waves. The Delta variant\nhas also concentrated minds: It seems to have not only persuaded more Americans to get shots on their\nown, but it also pushed more corporations and institutions to mandate their employees to get\nvaccinated. That is cause for optimism.\nStill, headwinds remain. Supply chain constraints are a powerful one, as shortages of crucial parts like\ncomputer chips have hobbled not only the production of cars and trucks, but also comparatively smaller\ndurable goods like home appliances. (Yes, there are computer chips in your washing machine; we’ve\ncome a long way since the days of the washboard.) One of our business contacts, a major homebuilder,\ntells us he’s now selling new homes with used appliances in them with the promise that he’ll replace\nthem as soon as he can. Manufacturers in our region are also reporting being hamstrung by supply chain\nissues. Unfortunately, there are indications that these constraints could persist for the next couple of\nyears.\nThere’s another input lacking in supply as well: labor. Job openings are at record highs, hitting nearly 11\nmillion at the end of July. Meanwhile, more people are quitting their jobs, and the rate at which open\npositions are being filled is continuing to slow. The upshot, of course, is better pay for those who are\nworking: Wages are up more than 4 percent year over year.\nIt’s clear that a combination of factors — trouble accessing childcare or eldercare, lingering fears about\nthe virus, the rise in equities and home values spurring people to retire, and perhaps a general\nrevaluation of life choices — is persuading a lot of Americans to stay on the sidelines even as the\n2\n\neconomy has reopened. And notably, the elimination of extra federal unemployment benefits has not\nnoticeably — at least not yet — appeared to nudge people back into the workforce.\nSo, where does all of this leave us? For 2021, I would expect GDP growth to come in at around 6.5\npercent. It will then moderate to about 3.5 percent in 2022, and 2.5 percent in 2023. Inflation,\nmeanwhile, should come in around 4 percent for 2021 — we’re already seeing some moderation there,\nas prices of used cars finally stabilize. After that, we can expect inflation of a bit over 2 percent for 2022\nand right at 2 percent in 2023. Unemployment should fall steadily during this period as well.\nDownside risks include persistent supply chain issues or yet another resurgence of the virus. And in the\nshort term, a failure by Congress to raise the debt ceiling could harm economic growth significantly.\nIn terms of monetary policy, I am in the camp that believes it will soon be time to begin slowly and\nmethodically — frankly, boringly — tapering our $120 billion in monthly purchases of Treasury bills and\nmortgage-backed securities. Those purchases were necessary to keep markets functioning during the\nacute phase of the crisis. But to the extent that we are still dealing with a labor force issue, the problem\nlies on the supply side, not with demand. You can’t go into a restaurant or drive down a commercial\nstrip without noticing a sea of “Help Wanted” signs. Asset purchases aren’t doing much — or anything\n— to ameliorate that.\nAfter we taper our asset purchases, we can begin to think about raising the federal funds rate. But I\nwouldn’t expect any hikes to interest rates until late next year or early 2023.\nNow, before we move to our Q&A, I’d like to share just a little bit of information from our most recent\nCFI COVID-19 Survey of Consumers. One of the pleasures of this job is sharing some of the research we\ndo with audiences like you.\nSince April 2020, the Philadelphia Fed has been conducting a series of national surveys that focus on\nchanges in job status, income levels, and personal financial security. The economic data we have access\nto at the Fed — and believe me, we look at a ton of data — are an extraordinary resource. But it’s\nimportant, too, to understand how people’s economic realities are playing out on the ground. Our\nCOVID-19 surveys have been instrumental in allowing us to do that.\nI’d encourage all of you to take a look at our series of surveys on our website — philadelphiafed.org —\nbut I’d like to point out just a few important data points from the latest survey, which was done this\nsummer as Delta surged.\n3\n\nFirst, more people were feeling more confident about their personal finances this summer than they\nwere in the spring. More were working normal hours, and more were working onsite, rather than\nremotely; 10.9 percent of respondents reported being currently laid off or furloughed, down from 17.9\npercent last fall.\nBut when it came to expectations about the future, the survey found wide disparities across groups.\nWomen, people making less than $40,000 a year, and people under the age of 36 were much more\npessimistic about their earnings over the next year than men and older people, for instance. The good\nnews is, across all survey respondents, the number of people reporting they are having trouble making\nends meet has been declining.\nThe headline of this iteration of the survey is “Cautious Optimism Reigns,” which I’d say captures my\nsentiment regarding the economy as well.\nSo, thanks again so much for having me. And now, let’s move on to questions.\n4",

    "text": "Fintech: Revolution or Evolution?\nUniversity of Pennsylvania School of Engineering\nand Applied Science\nPhiladelphia, PA\nApril 3, 2017\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nFintech: Revolution or Evolution?\nUniversity of Pennsylvania School of Engineering and Applied Science\nPhiladelphia, PA\nApril 3, 2017\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood afternoon. It’s a pleasure to be back on Penn’s campus and an even bigger\npleasure to return to my postgraduate days at the Engineering School.\nSo, why am I here? What’s a Fed president doing talking to a bunch of engineers? I\nsuppose it’s all in the title of this lecture series: Technology, Business, and Government.\nThere is so much overlap in that it makes sense to look at the ways they’re intertwined.\nIt’s like a three-legged stool of modern commerce that you’ll all undoubtedly encounter\nin whatever profession you pursue. I started out as an engineer, so I suppose I’m living\nproof of that.\nI’ve actually found that some theoretical insights from systems engineering are easily\napplicable to commerce. So, the principles I learned right here come in handy, from\ncomplex adaptive systems to robust control to the Lucas critique. Although while\nengineers focus on the comfort of 95 percent accuracy, I’ve noticed that economics earns\nthe term “the dismal science.” Central bankers focus on that errant 5 percent and seem\nto always be looking for black swans.\nSince I’ve mentioned my colleagues, now’s a good time to deliver the standard Fed\ndisclaimer that I’m speaking for myself today and my views do not necessarily represent\nthose of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal\nOpen Market Committee (FOMC).\nSo, today I’d like to briefly outline what it is I do, give a quick economic update and\noutlook, and then talk about an area of increasing discussion these days: fintech. This is\n1\n\nsomething that touches all three legs of the stool — technology, business, and\ngovernment — and is an area some of you might find yourselves working in or alongside.\nFederal Reserve Overview\nBefore I start, just a very brief overview of the Federal Reserve System for the\nuninitiated. The Fed is set up in a uniquely American way: It’s a decentralized central\nbank. We have 12 regional Banks around the country and a Board of Governors in\nWashington, D.C. We vote on policy roughly every six weeks, which now mostly consists\nof decisions on whether or not to raise interest rates.\nWe make monetary policy, which shouldn’t be confused with fiscal or other policy. We\nfocus on a dual mandate given to us by Congress, which is maximum employment and\nprice stability. We don’t make decisions about things like debts and deficits, spending,\nand entitlements.\nIn general, you don’t hear too much about us unless we’ve done something, so you\nprobably know that we raised rates at this last FOMC meeting. It was only the third time\nwe’ve done that since we lowered them to near zero more than eight years ago, so it\nattracted some attention.\nEconomic Outlook\nFrom my perspective, it made sense given the data we’ve seen.\nThe labor market has shown steady improvement, and the 4.7 percent\nunemployment rate is at, or near, what I consider to be the natural rate of\nunemployment. We created 235,000 jobs in February, and we’re averaging about\n200,000 jobs a month over the past 12 months.\nWage growth has ticked up, which is something I’ve been looking for. Average hourly\nearnings increased 2.8 percent over the past 12 months.\nJob openings remain high, layoffs remain at almost historical lows, and more people are\nquitting their jobs. This is one of those quirky measures we focus on. It’s a good\n2\n\nindication of how people view the economy: They’re more likely to quit when they have\nconfidence they can find a new job quickly.\nOn the inflation side of things, the momentum continues to be in the right direction.\nInflation has been persistently below our target rate of 2 percent, but it’s been moving\nslowly but surely upward. We’re on the right track to reach our goal by the end of this\nyear or the beginning of next, in my estimation. Recently, GDP (gross domestic product)\ngrowth has been driven largely by consumption, and I continue to forecast just above 2\npercent growth for the year.\nI’m on record as saying that I view three rate hikes as appropriate in 2017, assuming\nthings stay on track, and I still think that’s the right call. I continue to believe they\nshould be gradual, both in pace and increments. I don’t want to get behind the curve,\nbut I don’t think we need to rush, either. I consider every meeting to be live and that\ngives us plenty of opportunity over the course of the rest of the year.\nWe say all the time that our decisions are data dependent. So, I’ll be looking at the\ninformation as it comes in, but right now that’s the trajectory I see for policy.\nFintech: The Technology Leg\nSo, what does all this have to do with fintech? The obvious answer is that we deal with\nthe banking system. The other is that we deal with money. And a big area of interest for\na lot of people is digital currency. What impact might digital currency have? And how do\nI, as a monetary policymaker, view it in the context of my responsibilities? Before I get\ninto that, I want to take a step back and first consider what, exactly, currency is and how\n— or rather, why — it works.\nThe underpinning of currency, like the financial system itself, is trust. A fiat currency\nlike that in the United States, which is issued by a central bank in a secure and stable\neconomy, works because we trust it. A dollar is a dollar. We all agree that it is and\nthere’s not much that can undermine that faith. We experience inflation, sure, but not\noften in dramatic or abrupt ways.\n3\n\nOn the other hand, one of the things you’ll see with digital currency is how wildly the\nvalue swings. The question is will there ever be a digital currency that is stable enough to\nbecome as widely used as a government one.\nResearch by my staff indicates that privately issued currencies can lead to unstable\nmoney supply and depreciation of the currency. Why? Because there’s no fundamental\nguarantee of its value in the same way that there is with currency issued by the central\nbank of a credible and stable government.1 So, unless a government issues it, the answer\nis likely that no, digital currencies won’t drive out our own any time soon. And while\nsome governments are exploring the possibility of producing their own digital\ncurrencies, several hurdles remain, as my colleague, Governor Powell, outlined recently.\nThose include technical challenges, the unprecedented risk of cyberattacks, potential for\ncriminal activity like money laundering, and threats to privacy.2\nThen there’s blockchain. Blockchain has tremendous potential and banks can use it to\nfurther manage risk. From my perspective, however, its real value is in authentication,\nnot on distributing a virtual currency. And the implications of having a distributed\nledger that offers virtually failsafe data storage are huge on the risk management side for\nany business.\nSo, there’s definitely some very interesting and potentially game-changing innovation\ncoming out of fintech. But fintech overall is actually just natural market evolution and\nthe assumptions about disruption — or indeed, creative destruction — are, with\napologies to Schumpeter, probably out of proportion.\nPart of the reason things can look like a revolution instead of an evolution is that we’re\nviewing them in isolation. If you look along the broad history of an industry, you put\nthings into context. You see the way banking evolved its products and appendages just\nlike the first single-cell organisms evolved fins and gills and eventually feet and legs.\nSecuritization, credit scoring, prepaid cards — which my team had already done\n1 Daniel Sanches, “On the Inherent Instability of Private Money,” Review of Economic Dynamics, 20 (2016), pp.\n198–214.\n2 Jerome Powell, “Innovation, Technology, and the Payments System,” speech given at Blockchain: The Future of\nFinance and Capital Markets? The Yale Law School Center for the Study of Corporate Law, New Haven, CT,\nMarch 3, 2017.\n4\n\nabout 20 studies on before anyone was paying much attention to them — don’t look\nrevolutionary on the scale of fintech. But neither does the Commodore 64 when you\nstand it next to a MacBook Air. Yet we’d never overlook the effect of widely available in-\nhome computers.\nSo, while much of this is exciting and the technology is very, very cool, I always warn\nagainst overstating its overall effect. This is, by and large, the same kind of evolution the\nbanking system has seen for the past 40 years; it’s just a different delivery system.\nMy favorite analogy is peer-to-peer lending. When I was growing up in New Jersey, we\nhad the same thing. Only in our case, Frankie asked Jimmy at the local bar to loan him a\n20.The big difference was Jimmy knew where Frankie lived, so there was a lower rate of\ndefault. But overall, we’re talking about the same concept; we’ve just applied new\ntechnology to it.\nIn fact, what underpins the Frankie and Jimmy scenario, and banking and lending in\ngeneral, is the fundamental principle of trust. In the grand scheme of things, as\ninnovations enter and leave markets, the ones that survive — in any good business, but\nespecially banking — are the ones that engender trust.\nWe trust that the cash we take out of an ATM is U.S. currency that has an agreed-upon\nvalue. We trust that when we want to access our bank accounts, the funds will be\navailable. We trust that when we access credit that the terms and conditions we agree to\nwill be followed by both parties.\nFintech may be a major player, but people have to be able to put their trust in it, and it\nhas to prove its value to markets and the consumer.\nWe’re hosting a conference in September that’s going to focus on exactly that subject:\nWhat’s the end result in the efficient functioning of markets and in benefits to the\nconsumer? What’s the benefit in consumer surplus that any of these innovations\ncreates?\nMore research from my Bank indicates in its initial findings that for the same risk of\ndefault, consumers pay smaller spreads on loans from fintech companies than from\n5\n\ntraditional lenders. That’s something that can add value to a lot of people.3 The question\nof trust and value, of course, is a basic business principle.\nFintech: The Business Leg\nWhich leads me to the next leg of the stool: What do these developments mean for\nbusiness? If fintech is wildly successful, if we all abandon tellers and ATMs, are banks\ngoing away?\nPolicymakers don’t like to make predictions, because the future has a funny way of\ndefying expectations. But in this instance, I’ll go out on a limb and say no. Banks aren’t\ngoing anywhere.\nIt’s true that out of every innovation, a little disintermediation must fall. And sure, some\nroles and functions will be made obsolete. But that happens with all progress. The\nchanges in the banking system over the past 40 years have continually pushed some\nplayers out at the same time that it’s steadily brought others in.\nWith banks, I think it’s more a case of the real estate agent than the travel agent. Here’s\nthe analogy: With the advent of e-commerce, both the travel and housing markets were\naffected. But only one of them saw the demise of one set of intermediaries. Travel agents\nlargely disappeared because we all know what we want out of a flight, a hotel, or a\nvacation. It’s something we do often enough and are familiar enough with to trust our\nown instincts. The risks are small. Buying a plane ticket isn’t inexpensive, but it’s a low-\nrisk proposition in the grand scheme of things. And the value that travel agents brought\ncan be largely replaced by our own Internet research. In this case, the web did replace\nthe travel agent as our intermediary.\nWe still have real estate agents, however, even though I can get a 360-degree view of a\nhouse that’s five states away from the comfort of my living room. Why? Because real\nestate agents still add value. They perform a fundamental service that we can’t provide\nourselves and can’t be found online — at least not as well. People don’t buy houses that\n3 Cathy Lemieux and Julapa Jagtiani, “Promise and Peril: Managing the Uncertainty of Rapid Innovation and a\nChanging Economy,” unpublished findings presented at Promise and Peril: Managing the Uncertainty of Rapid\nInnovation and a Changing Economy, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Chicago, March 29–30, 2017.\n6\n\noften. I personally don’t want to take on the risk of doing it all myself. I want a\nprofessional who knows what papers to file, what zoning laws have to be followed, what\nsurveys should be done, and what market expectations are. Even though the technology\nhas evolved, we still need those intermediaries.\nLikewise, no matter what happens in the world of fintech, you still need a trusted broker\nof money. The roles may change and adapt, but someone needs to be the source of funds\nand credit.\nThere’s always going to be a place for maturity transformation, for instance. When\npeople make longer-term loans, it creates a maturity mismatch on the balance sheet of\nthe lender. This is because the liability side of the balance sheet can evaporate much\nmore rapidly than the asset side, making the lender either illiquid or insolvent.\nOne of the key economic contributions of banks is that they manage that risk. A fintech\nfirm is unlikely to have that scope and long-term trust, at least not for a while. Similarly,\nyou and I wouldn’t make good credit card lenders, even if we had the right coding and\nsoftware. So, those won’t completely disappear, either.\nThere will be some disintermediation, but that’s been the case in banking since\nderegulation started in the 1980s. At the end of the day, we still rely on those\ninstitutions to manage risk and provide a safe haven.\nThis is where I return to the core principle: The benefit a business or technology creates\nfor markets and the consumer. Banks know they have to focus on the functions that add\nvalue. It’s easy for a well-capitalized bank to fund a start-up, let it take the risks, and\nthen adopt the successful technology. Fintech may fully permeate the banking industry,\nbut it will likely be in a way that sees many of the old players adapting new technologies\nrather than being put out of business by them.\nFintech: The Government Leg\nThat relates directly to the government part because a large portion of government’s\nrole in fintech will be regulation. Regulators have to think about how to create oversight\n7\n\nthat doesn’t stifle innovation while simultaneously protecting markets and consumers.\nThe fintech industry has to think about what regulation means for them.\nI want to say here that regulation isn’t a bad thing. It’s necessary for a functioning\nsystem, and it’s one of the ways to confer the trust that is so essential. And in the case of\nfintech, it’s in fintech firms’ best interest to know what’s expected from them from the\nbeginning. Otherwise, they may have to play catch-up or retrofit their business model to\ncomply with oversight that comes later. Not to mention, building the trust in the system\nthat regulation can offer makes their businesses more resilient.\nMost fintech firms are relatively new. They haven’t been through the downside of a\ncredit cycle. And the unfortunate reality of modernity is that there will be a down cycle.\nFor those companies that are getting to a scale where negative events could have a major\nimpact on their business, regulation is especially important because it acts as a safety\nnet.\nMore important, regulation that comes in after a crisis almost always fights the last war.\nThat kind of oversight is generally more restrictive and would likely put far more burden\non fintech firms than starting out sooner.\nI want regulation that safeguards the consumer, the market, and the emerging fintech\nindustry itself. I like innovation; I like responsible innovation more.\nConclusion\nThat’s about the long and the short of it. Fintech touches many sectors and it offers\nsome exciting ways to modernize the banking industry. It’s not a radical departure in the\nsense that the industry has been evolving over the past several decades, but it’s new and\ninteresting in the sense of the technology it offers. I hope the value is equal to the\ntechnology, and I think it will be because that’s the story at the end. At the end of the\nday, it’s about efficient market function and protecting the consumer.\nThank you.\n8",

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nAnchor Reliance in Regions\nResearch and Practice 2024 Anchor Economy Conference\nPhiladelphia\nMay 16, 2024\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood morning, everyone, and welcome once again to Day 2 of this inaugural Anchor Economy Conference.\nMy thanks to Deborah Diamond for that introduction — and more on her later! My thanks, as well, to the\nHealthcare Anchor Network for cosponsoring this conference with the Philadelphia Fed.\nI also thank my friend and former colleague among higher education leaders, Johns Hopkins University\nPresident Ron Daniels, for joining me onstage for this morning’s discussion.\nAnd, of course, my thanks to each and every one of you with us today for bringing your ideas, your\nquestions, and your spirit of partnership to these proceedings.\nBefore I go any further, I do need to stop for just a few seconds of official business — the official Fed\ndisclaimer! The views I express this morning are mine alone and do not necessarily represent those of\nanyone else in the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\nI am eager to get to our conversation, so allow me to keep my remarks relatively brief. There will be plenty\nof time for us to get more granular.\nOne month ago, I spoke before a gathering of regional college and university administrators. I noted how\nwe at the Philadelphia Fed take great pride in our research acumen — but we take even more pride in the\npartnerships that take that research to the next level. We are not conducting research just to engage in\nacademic discourse or draw visitors to our website. We also take our research directly into our\ncommunities, engaging with organizations and stakeholders working on their own plans for expanding\nlocal and regional economic opportunities.\nThe Philadelphia Fed’s Anchor Economy Initiative is a remarkable example of this concept of research in\naction.\nWhat Deborah Diamond and her team have undertaken can only be described as groundbreaking. Never\nbefore has the national and regional economic impact of eds and meds anchor institutions been so fully\ncaptured. This is research that truly matters to the economic futures of hundreds of communities.\n2\n\nAs you may know, prior to coming to the Philadelphia Fed, I served as president of the University of\nDelaware. I knew through my first-hand experiences that the university had an outsized economic and\nsocial impact that reached far beyond its Newark campus. Yet, I never knew just how large that impact was\nin terms of concrete metrics, and how much of an additive effect the university had to the impact of all the\nother anchors located throughout the greater Philadelphia statistical region.\nWell, now I know. And even nearly 10 years removed from the president’s office, I am in awe of not only\njust how big that impact is but how important the entire anchor economy is to the region’s overall\neconomic health and vitality.\nMoreover, I know I’m not alone in this sentiment.\nThis is the real function of the Anchor Economy Initiative. It is not about research for the sake of research.\nIt is about spurring the imagination of leaders throughout the anchor economy to envision how their\nimpacts can be multiplied by working with other anchor institutions in their own backyards.\nIt is about spurring engagement to collaboratively tackle long-standing economic and social issues in the\ncommunities we all serve.\nAt the center of this effort lays the Anchor Economy Dashboard, where all these data live, and the bullseye\nis the dashboard’s Anchor Reliance Index, which boils down numerous economic metrics into one score. It\ntells us how dependent a given region is on anchor institutions relative to the U.S. as a whole. In other\nwords, the dashboard is a wealth of data, and the Anchor Reliance Index puts that data into perspective\nand allows us to easily compare one region to another.\nAnd this brings me to the heart of my remarks today.\nWhen created, the dashboard and reliance index gave us a snapshot of the nation’s anchor economy as of\n2019, the most recent year unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic. But we recently expanded the\nunderlying data to now provide a direct comparison and contrast to 2004, the furthest back we could go\nand still maintain consistency with input data. This gives us the ability to now look at the 2019 data with\nfresh eyes and in greater perspective.\nAnd diving into the deeper data, we can draw several conclusions, but two, in particular, stand out.\nFirst, the data show that the economic impacts of, and reliance upon, eds and meds are unique to\nstatistical regions. We may certainly find many similarities among and between regions. But anchor\nreliance and anchor impact remain independent.\nAnd this leads us to the second major conclusion — any movement either up or down along the Anchor\nReliance Index must be taken within the greater context of broader regional economic trends.\nAllow me to speak to a few examples.\nIn some postindustrial cities, we saw some dramatic increases in Anchor Reliance Index scores between\n2004 and 2019. Over that 15-year span, these region’s eds and meds took on a greater burden and share\nof their local economies. However, this may not be the positive development we wish to presume it is.\n3\n\nIn these cases, this growth came in the context of slowdowns, or even shutdowns, in other sectors. In\nother words, while these eds and meds grew in terms of jobs and total GDP — a good thing — it was at a\ngreater rate than the rest of the region’s economy — a potentially not-so-good thing. This could mean that\nan increasing reliance on anchor institutions may actually signal an unsustainable over-reliance.\nAnd likewise, a decreasing reliance score could signal two things. One, a slowdown in the anchor economy\nand its related sectors — think of a local college or university facing a falloff in enrollments with\nsubsequent layoffs and budget tightening, or the closure of a regional medical center, or the movement of\na set of services away from a center to another located elsewhere. Both outcomes would have direct and\nindirect impacts on regional economic activity through the loss of jobs and incomes.\nBut, two, a decreasing Reliance Index score could also signal an increase in sectors of the regional economy\nthat are distinct from eds and meds. This is what we are seeing in some growing metro areas in the\nSouthwest and Mountain West, for example.\nThen there is the scenario in which both Philadelphia and Baltimore find ourselves. And this, I hope, can\nhelp seed my conversation with President Daniels, which we’re going to get to very soon, I promise!\nBetween 2004 and 2019, both Baltimore and Philadelphia saw an almost parallel increase in their\nrespective Anchor Reliance Index scores — Philadelphia increased from 1.31 to 1.39, while Baltimore rose\nfrom 1.28 to 1.35.\nBut what drove this? In both cities’ metro regions, anchor economy–based GDP rose significantly: 41\npercent in the Philly metro and 49 percent growth in Baltimore, outpacing the growth of other sectors,\nthereby increasing anchor reliance.\nIn both regions, the share of employment impacted by anchors — both direct and indirect — rose. In\nPhiladelphia the increase was by 2 percentage points to 13 percent and in Baltimore by one point, from 11\npercent to 12 percent.\nFive of Philadelphia’s top 10 employers fit into the eds and meds space, while in Baltimore it is 8 of the top\n10.\nSo, certainly, the anchor economy in both regions, and its impact, grew at a greater proportion than other\nsectors. But, in both of these scenarios, this increased reliance may not inherently be a bad thing.\nBoth Philadelphia and Baltimore can broadly be considered “college towns.” But instead of just one\ncampus, there are multiple institutions within each. These institutions are helping to seed the broader\ninnovation economy, with direct pipelines of talent and funding into the growing life-science and\ninnovation sectors, to name just two. Further, many of the higher education anchors also operate legacy\nhealth care anchors where cutting-edge research is being undertaken and commercialized and where\nhealth equity is being advanced.\nFor both Philadelphia and Baltimore, a growing eds and med reliance appears to be helping to offset, or\neven replace, the economic losses from the decline in the manufacturing sector.\nAs I have said, these are just a few examples. And if you haven’t been taking notes over the past several\nminutes, that’s fine, as I have recently published an essay covering these thoughts on the Philadelphia Fed\n4\n\nwebsite. This is also the topic of a research brief I coauthored with Deborah Diamond and our colleagues\nTheresa Dunne and Sisi Zhang.\nI hope that you will be interested in reading either or both.\nAt their cores, the Anchor Economy Dashboard and this subsequent research are powerful tools to\ncompare regions.\nBut even more, they are powerful tools that stakeholders in each region can have at their disposal to put\nchallenges in perspective and show a path for collaboration that can strengthen long-term economic\nprospects. As I wrote for our website, “The power of data is the power to make positive change.”\nAnd I certainly hope you will look at the data for your region, take it back to share with your stakeholders\n— both within your institution and within your broader community — to build that better economic\nfuture.\nThat all said, I don’t want to keep us away from our feature presentation any longer. Thank you all for\nbeing here and for allowing me these moments to speak with you, but now it’s time for me to step back,\nsit down, and bring President Daniels into our conversation.\n5",

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nOn the Flight Path to the Soft Landing\nPhiladelphia Business Journal’s State of the Economy\nPhiladelphia, PA\nAugust 8, 2023\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you, Sandy, for that welcome and introduction.\nMy thanks to the Philadelphia Business Journal for bringing us together, and I must give recognition in\nabsentia to Editor-in-Chief Ryan Sharrow for reaching out and inviting me to be with you.\nI also must give thanks to City Winery for hosting us this morning. I do note with some disappointment\nthat it is only 8:00 a.m., and we’re at a winery. I know while technically it may be 5:00 somewhere, this\nmay be a bit of a stretch.\nAnd I also thank you all for coming out this morning. It is always a pleasure to not only see so many\nfamiliar faces but also to get to know new ones.\nAnd no matter whether we are meeting today for the first time or just the latest of many, what excites\nme is that we’re all here for the same key reason. We care about Philadelphia. With its diversity of\npeoples and opportunities, Philadelphia remains an economic driver and leader.\nSo, I am happy to be here to give you my sense of where we are and where I see us heading, as well as\nto highlight a few things we have going on down Arch Street at the Philadelphia Fed, which you may find\nof interest.\nBefore I go any further, allow me to get a piece of business out of the way at the outset — and that’s the\nregular Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of\nanyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\nOr, in simple English, you can always say, “Pat said.” You just can’t say, “the Fed said.”\nNow, this year I sit as a voting member of the FOMC. At our meeting two weeks ago, I joined my\ncolleagues on the Committee in voting to raise the policy rate another 25 basis points, to a range of\n5¼ to 5½ percent — the 11th policy rate increase in the span of 12 meetings.\n1\n\nBut you knew that. I bet what you want to know is what we are going to do next. Unfortunately, I do not\nknow — it depends on what the data will tell us from now to our next meeting in September.\nWhat I can tell you is where we stand now given past actions, what I expect to see in the data going\nforward, and whether I believe that we need to do more, or not.\nTen days ago, the latest PCE inflation report showed continued disinflation year over year on the\nheadline measure and promise on the core measure. We are making progress against inflation. It has\nbeen slow progress, and I am watchful of any reemerging price pressures. We remain unwavering in our\ncommitment to bring inflation back to target.\nAnd this is indeed what I expect will happen. I expect core PCE inflation to decline to a rate perhaps just\nbelow 4 percent year over year by the end of 2023, before falling below 3 percent next year and leveling\nout at our 2 percent target in 2025.\nWhile this economy may not be hewing to traditional modeling and seems to bend some rules in one\nplace and make up its own in another, it continues to move along. I forecast unemployment to tick up\nslightly and better align with the natural unemployment rate as labor tightness continues to ease. And\nwhen it comes to GDP, I expect the rate of growth to be slightly lower than what we have seen so far\nthis year.\nIn sum, I expect only a modest slowdown in economic activity to go along with a slow but sure\ndisinflation. In other words, I do see us on the flight path to the soft landing we all hope for and that has\nproved quite elusive in the past.\nNow that you know what I expect, I can tell you what I believe: Absent any alarming new data between\nnow and mid-September, I believe we may be at the point where we can be patient and hold rates\nsteady and let the monetary policy actions we have taken do their work.\nI take my role seriously in achieving the Fed’s dual mandate of price stability and maximum\nemployment. And I remain focused on seeing us achieve these goals to support our long-term economic\nsuccess.\nAllow me to be clear about one thing, however. Should we be at that point where we can hold steady,\nwe will need to be there for a while. The pandemic taught us to never say never, but I do not foresee\nany likely circumstance for an immediate easing of the policy rate.\nBefore the Committee meets again, we will have a slew of new economic data to consider, with another\nPCE report, one more employment report, and two CPI reports among them. And I will continue to talk\nand listen to people from throughout the Third District. Together, these will provide the guidance I will\nneed in considering my ultimate stance heading into September’s Committee meeting.\n2\n\nThis slew of data is not just national in scope. I also closely consider what I see going on right here in the\nPhiladelphia region. So, allow me to take a couple of minutes to share with you my more localized view.\nOverall, the area’s economy reflects weakened conditions in business and interest-rate sensitive areas\nsuch as housing, but maintains strengths, particularly in the labor market. While survey responses from\nboth manufacturing and nonmanufacturing businesses reflect currently weakened business activity\nacross the region, responses have moved positive for future expectations. Inflationary pressures in the\nregion have also waned somewhat though — as it is across the nation — inflation generally remains\nabove target and wage pressures remain elevated.\nThat’s the snapshot. But let’s look a little deeper.\nPennsylvania’s Coincident Index, the Philadelphia Fed’s summary metric of economic activity, increased\n1.4 percent in the second quarter and 0.6 percent from May to June, reflecting positive conditions.\nThere was a rise in payroll employment, the unemployment rate fell during the three-month period, and\nthere was an increase in average hours worked in manufacturing. Overall, year to year, the index has\nrisen 3.6 percent.\nAnother positive indicator is business formation, which in Pennsylvania continues well above\nprepandemic levels, with more than 12,500 business applications as of June 2023, compared with\nroughly 8,600 in February 2020, seasonally adjusted.\nOn the jobs front, the Philadelphia MSA has not only fully recovered its pandemic-era losses but is\ncurrently running 96,000 jobs above February 2020. Notably, this includes the hospitality sector, which\nis at full recovery.\nAnd, speaking of hospitality, we know that restaurants and hotels are good indicators of consumer\nspending and local economic health. One of the data sets we look at in the Philadelphia Fed is the trend\ndata for seated diners, which currently shows restaurant activity more than 4.5 percent above this time\nlast year.\nThe hotel sector, however, remains slightly below where it was prepandemic, despite Taylor Swift’s best\nefforts.\nWhen it comes to housing, Philadelphia Fed researchers also recently looked at current, real-time asking\nrents region-wide. Like many areas of the country over the past three years, Philadelphia experienced\nsignificant rent inflation, but the data now show that tapering off, as asking rents on average slightly\ndecreased 0.14 percent from April to May and basically have not changed across a three-month span.\nLooking at residential sales, current market tightness continues. As mortgage rates have risen, it is\nunderstandable that current homeowners don’t want to put their houses on the market and step away\nfrom their current low-rate mortgages, diminishing inventory. And, certainly, a lack of inventory keeps\n3\n\nprices elevated, which further impacts the depth of the potential buyer pool. Both are understandable\noutcomes.\nI am also very sensitive to the state of the commercial real estate (CRE) sector, especially here in Center\nCity. And I am glad that part of the discussion that will follow me will be specifically dedicated to CRE.\nFirst, I recognize the potential impact on financial institutions heavily invested in CRE, should they get\npressed into ownership in the event of a loan default. But on a more street level, I have concerns about\nthe health of the businesses traditionally supported by now-remote workers or those only in their\noffices intermittently, especially in the restaurant and services industries.\nAs the Philadelphia Business Journal itself reported just a few weeks ago, it will take many months,\nperhaps a couple of years, for the commercial real estate market to shake itself out and rightsize, given\nthe shifts in working environments. We will be watching this carefully, I assure you.\nLooking ahead, I am also focused, as many are, on the potential impact of the October 1 resumption of\nfederal student loan payments. Even with new income-based payment plans set to reduce payments for\nmany borrowers, our contacts have expressed concern about their capacity to reintegrate these\nborrowers into the repayment system.\nSo, how this system is implemented, and how prepared borrowers are and where their repayment funds\nwill come from — whether from paychecks or savings — will be something we will be keeping a close\neye on.\nAs we’ve been tracking, credit card balances and loan delinquency rates have both been increasing in\nrecent months. Coinciding with this has been a decrease in bank balances, as consumers have drawn\nmore from their savings to pay their bills, even if this drawdown is of pandemic-era supports they’ve\nheld on to. This is not the ideal consumer finance backdrop in which one would necessarily want to add\npotentially hundreds of dollars in new monthly student loan payments.\nBut, overall, I believe that the resilience we’ve seen in our economy will continue, and I do believe we\nare poised to come out from under the pressure of inflation in good condition, both nationally and right\nhere in Philadelphia and the region.\nBut what the economy on the other side will look like is not set in stone and is something that we at the\nPhiladelphia Fed are working hard to help decipher. So, please allow me a couple of minutes to highlight\ntwo ongoing initiatives: the Anchor Economy Initiative and the Worker Voices Project.\nThe Philadelphia Fed established the Anchor Economy Initiative to dive deep into the economic impacts\nthat hospitals and institutions of higher education have on their home regions. While it’s long been\nassumed that there’s been a positive benefit, we lacked the data to capture the economic impacts of\n“eds and meds.”\n4\n\nOver the course of a year, the team at the Philadelphia Fed pulled together data from all 524 regions of\nthe United States to create the Anchor Economy Dashboard, which measures the direct, indirect, and\ninduced economic impacts these institutions have on their communities.\nThe dashboard also includes a reliance index to indicate how dependent a region is on higher eds and\nhospitals for economic activity. With 1 as a baseline average, Philadelphia came in at an index of 1.4.\nWhile an increased reliance on eds and meds can be a concern in places where institutions are\nvulnerable from challenges in health care and declining college enrollments, in Philadelphia, our eds and\nmeds are more likely a strength. In fact, if you break down the data, these anchor institutions support\nnearly 496,000 jobs and nearly $34 billion in employment income and benefits up and down the chain.\nFurther, they add more than $51 billion to our regional GDP — roughly 11.4 percent of the region’s\ntotal. Moreover, each job created in the anchor economy has a multiplier effect of creating roughly one\nother job elsewhere in our area.\nUltimately, the power of having data is the power to make positive change in communities. The\ndashboard is a tool for communities to use in their economic development planning. For instance, St.\nLouis and Chicago are both using the regional data as context for some deeper dives they’re doing on\nimpacts at the neighborhood level. And, here in Philadelphia, I recently sat down with institutional\nleaders to begin discussions of how we may all be able to augment each other’s efforts.\nThe basic recognition is that each institution comes with its own sets of priorities, opportunities, and\nchallenges. But if we pull back the layers, we’ll find the points from which collective strengths can be\nleveraged and strong partnerships can emerge for an even larger impact.\nThe Anchor Economy Initiative is just getting started, so there will be much more to report as time goes\non.\nThe Worker Voices Project is a more than year-long partnership between our colleagues at the Atlanta\nFed — and other Fed Banks — focused on meeting with and listening to workers in low-wage jobs and\nthose with a college degree to understand more fully what truly matters to them when deciding where,\nwhen, and whether to work, especially in this post-pandemic job market.\nI know we’ve all heard — and some have maybe even said — the phrase, “No one wants to work\nanymore.” But that’s an overly simplistic view. What we’ve learned is that there are a multitude of\nreasons why a worker may have exited the labor market at the onset of the pandemic only to reenter\nfrom an entirely different door on the other side of it or quit jobs at such a high rate.\nYes, workers want to be paid what they believe they are worth and bring to the table, but it’s not only\nabout wages. And, yes, they want to be somewhere they can be productive and contributing employees,\nbut not if they don’t believe their contributions are appreciated, let alone rewarded.\n5\n\nWhat we increasingly heard is that workers want something for which economists don’t yet have a\nmetric: to be treated with dignity.\nThe factors going into the decisions of where to work, or whether to go in an entirely different direction,\nare increasingly complex. And these complexities may make us rethink what we thought we knew about\nlabor markets.\nAllow me to provide two examples from earlier this summer, when I had the opportunity at the\nPhiladelphia Fed to engage with workers as part of the Worker Voices Project. One young woman, a\nsingle working mother, told me that she changed jobs because she needed a manager who understood\nhow last-minute schedule changes impacted her ability to find childcare. And we heard from a young\nman who left a job that required him to be on the road; yet, when diagnosed with a condition that left\nhim prone to severe seizures, his manager still wanted him spending his days driving, as opposed to\nsimilar work that could be done from a stationary location.\nAs one participant summed it up, “We’re looking for a place where we belong.”\nFor us as policymakers and employers, those words can point us in the direction for creating a strong,\ngrowing, and more inclusive economy.\nWhich, after all, is what we all want and is the reason why we’re all here today. We at the Federal\nReserve Bank of Philadelphia are just as committed to the economic health of our region and our\nresidents as you are. And we remain at the ready with the data and insights necessary to help you make\nthe decisions that will lead to your success.\nWith all that said — and I know it’s a lot — I’d be happy to step back and take some questions.\n6",

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nOpening Remarks\nWharton Initiative on Financial Policy & Regulation\nPhiladelphia\nApril 11, 2023\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nHello, everyone. Thanks so much for having me. It’s great to be here with all of you, and I’m eager to get to\nour conversation.\nBut with the Federal Reserve in the news a lot lately, I wanted to take a few minutes at the top to frame\nour discussion. What can I say, it’s the former professor in me.\nLet me start with the standard disclaimer: The views I express today are my own, and they don’t\nnecessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System or on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee.\nFirst, let me address the topic you’ve probably heard about the most recently: the failures of Silicon Valley\nBank and Signature Bank. One of the Fed’s most important jobs is supervising and regulating banks. So let\nme put your minds at ease: The U.S. banking system is sound and resilient.\nBut we’re not taking anything for granted. We know that problems in a few banks, if left unattended, can\nundermine confidence in healthy banks. That’s why the Federal Reserve is leading a thorough, transparent,\nand swift review of the events involving SVB so that we can learn from this experience.\nWith that being said, let’s talk a little about the Fed and its other important job: monetary policy. As many\nof you know, the Federal Reserve System consists of a Board of Governors, based in Washington, D.C., and\n12 regional banks around the country.\nEach regional bank has its own president and board of directors — a group of business, banking, and\ncommunity leaders who give us insight into the sectors and issues that make each region tick.\nMy District — the Third District — covers eastern Pennsylvania, South Jersey, and all of Delaware. It’s the\nsmallest District geographically, but I like to think we punch above our weight.\nThe decentralized nature of the Fed is, in my mind, our greatest strength.\nWe’re tasked with making national policy in service of our dual mandate — full employment and price\nstability. But we serve an enormous country made up of vastly different economic realities. If we looked at\ndata only from a 30,000-foot view, we’d miss a whole lot about what’s happening on the ground.\nSo, what have we been learning about the state of the economy from all of our inputs?\nOn the employment side of the dual mandate, we see that job gains are strong, and the unemployment\nrate remains low — 3.5 percent nationally last month. We are, effectively, at full employment.\n\nBut on the inflation side, we see a lot of room for improvement. Headline PCE inflation has come down\nfrom its peak of 7 percent last year (year over year, June 2022) but is still running, year over year, at 5\npercent — way above our 2 percent target. And recent readings show that disinflation is proceeding slowly\n— which is disappointing, to say the least.\nThis persistently high inflation comes with real costs for Americans — cutting into purchasing power and\nhousehold wealth. And, as is so often the case, the pain isn’t distributed equally. The toll is falling most\nheavily on those least able to bear it. I’m especially concerned about the rising costs of shelter, food, and\nhealth care — life’s true necessities.\nTo combat inflation, the Fed is working to slow the economy modestly and bring it more in line with\nsupply. To accomplish this, we have increased the federal funds rate — our primary monetary policy tool\n— by 475 basis points since March 2022. Balance sheet reduction is another way to tighten conditions.\nWe’re already seeing promising signs that these actions are working — for example, house price indexes\nare cooling.\nSince the full impact of monetary policy actions can take as much as 18 months to work its way through\nthe economy, we will continue to look closely at available data to determine what, if any, additional\nactions we may need to take. But make no mistake: We are fully committed to bringing inflation back\ndown to our 2 percent target.\nBefore we get to our Q&A, I’ll leave you with one final thought.\nWith all the attention our interest rate decisions get every six weeks, it might seem like the Fed is the\nprimary force driving what happens in the economy. But that’s just not the case.\nThe Fed implements monetary policy to achieve its dual mandate for an economy made up of countless\nworkers, businesses, investors, and institutions. An economy that you are, and will continue to be, an\nimportant part of — especially with your Wharton education backing you up.\nAs you think about the opportunities that await you beyond this place, one of the most powerful things\nyou can do is be intentional about how you want to contribute to the economy.\nWhether you head to Wall Street, become an entrepreneur, or pursue a career in public service, you have\na tremendous opportunity to help shape the world around you. I hope you take advantage of it.\nWith that, let’s get to your questions.",

    "text": "Fintech: Ask “What Next?” Not “What If?”\nThe Seventh Annual Fintech Conference\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nPhiladelphia, PA (virtual/in-person)\nSeptember 7, 2023\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nFintech: Ask “What Next?” Not “What If?”\nThe Seventh Annual Fintech Conference\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nPhiladelphia, PA (virtual/in-person)\nSeptember 7, 2023\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood morning, everyone, and welcome to this latest installment of what is quickly becoming not just\none of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s premier conferences but one of the premier\nconferences on fintech, period.\nEven though this one is a home game for me, so to speak, I still must preface my remarks with the\nstandard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of\nanyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\nOr, as I like to put it, when you are recounting my remarks, just say, “Pat said.” Don’t say, “the Fed\nsaid.”\nWe have a full house here at the Philadelphia Fed, and more than 1,000 others joining us virtually. While\nthis is only slightly fewer people than Taylor Swift and Beyoncé drew to Philadelphia, it is an incredible\nnumber that speaks to much more than the expanding interest in fintech but also to the efforts of those\nwho put this conference together.\nAnd with that, I must give my thanks to Julapa Jagtiani who leads this effort. She is so much more than\njust a terrific introductory speaker. Julapa truly is the heart of this conference and a valuable source of\ninformation and contacts on a wide range of fintech topics, concerns, and approaches.\nI also wish to thank our panelists and speakers, several of whom I am proud to call my colleagues within\nthe Federal Reserve System, along with all the organizing partners of this year’s conference. This truly is\na strong team.\n1\n\nAnd, of course, my thanks to each of you for joining us, whether in person or online.\nNow, this is a conference to which I always look forward to attending. After all, by education, I’m an\nengineer even more than I am an economist. So, any forum that stands at the nexus of these two\ndisciplines is enough to pique my interest.\nAs an economist, and especially as president and CEO of the Philadelphia Fed, my goal is to ensure a\nstable economy that provides opportunities for everyone to grow and succeed. As an engineer, and\nspecifically as a civil engineer, my goal is to ensure a safe, reliable, and stable infrastructure, which\nprovides opportunities for all communities to grow and succeed.\nAnd I am far from the first person to recognize this important interdisciplinary connection. In 1917, the\nthen-director of the College of Engineering at Northwestern University, John F. Hayford, wrote an essay\nin the Journal of Political Economy titled, fittingly enough, “The Relation of Engineering to Economics,”\nwhich contains the following:\nEconomics and engineering are closely related. Economics has been defined as the\nsocial science of earning a living. With the same appropriateness, engineering may be\ndefined to be physical science applied to helping groups … to make a better living.1\nIf you drill down below the surface of this statement, it becomes clear that both economists and\nengineers are looking for ways to make systems stronger, more equitable, and more efficient. And we\ncan see throughout history the advances in civil engineering which brought about both economic and\nsocietal advances.\nWe can chart the progress from the days of siting cities within sheltered harbors or along navigable\nrivers and lakes, to the digging of canals and the laying of railroad tracks, which allowed for the siting of\nnew cities; to the advent of the automobile and the airplane, which drastically shrunk distances; to the\n1 Hayford, John F. “The Relation of Engineering to Economics,” Journal of Political Economy 25:1 (1917).\n2\n\ncreation of the microchip, which enabled the birth of the Internet and e-commerce; and, yes, fintech,\nwhich render one’s location almost meaningless.\nWell, the same progress can be charted through our understanding and conceptualization of\nmoney. The barter system limited transactions to those in which two parties could come to agreement\n— I happen to have what you want at the moment you have what I want. The advent of cash, from\ncowry shells to paper notes, meant that anyone who held those commodities would be in equal\nstanding with the next person holding the same, making markets run more efficiently and fairly.\nBut now our concept of money is changing. We no longer need to hold actual notes when electronic\nbank statements tell us how much is in our accounts and any number of instant payment apps on our\nsmartphones allow us to move virtual money to practically anyone in any corner of the world, again,\nrendering our locations practically meaningless.\nYet, we still call a transaction made through code merely representing paper notes a cash transaction.\nLikewise, our e-wallets hold “credit cards” that aren’t cards at all, just graphical representations. And the\ndevelopment of cryptocurrencies and stablecoin is forcing us to further rethink our relationship with,\nand the nature and future of, cash.\nThese changes come in some ways for the better, and in some that should raise concerns. Everyone\nhere recognizes that fintech presents not just opportunities but also challenges, and that we will not\nultimately succeed if we only focus on the former and ignore the latter.\nSo, how do we view these innovations? How do we ensure adequate understanding of their risks and\nbenefits? And how should public policy and regulation address these as they pose both benefits and\nrisks to consumers and the economy at large?\nThese are just a few of the questions swirling around the topic of fintech, which bring us to today and\nthis conference.\n3\n\nBut the biggest question of all is not “what if” but “what next”? This is the big question that will be in\nthe background of every conversation over these two days. And my hope is that these conversations will\nkeep us moving toward the answer.\nWe are witnessing a technological revolution through AI, which holds tremendous promise for\nincreasing productivity and allowing for more decisions to be made in real time.\nAs an increasing number of institutions turn to AI-powered chatbots, the need for us to continue fine-\ntuning and securing this technology only increases. A recent story2 in the New York Times highlighted a\nLas Vegas conference at which white-hat hackers were asked to help uncover vulnerabilities in the\nsafeguards of AI chatbots. And many found ways to trick these chatbots into making misleading,\nunethical, and potentially dangerous statements.\nIt’s not hard to move from this situation to one of malicious hackers exposing security flaws to exploit\nunsuspecting customers at a financial institution into giving up sensitive identifying information. This is\nan instance where our ability to keep focused on what may be next will also ensure consumer\nconfidence.\nAnd we at the Federal Reserve, both here in Philadelphia and System-wide, are going to remain focused\non doing our part. For example, July saw the rollout of the new FedNow instant payment service\nplatform. With FedNow, we will have a more nimble and responsive banking system. Within the Third\nDistrict, we continue working with our banking partners to encourage their participation.\nCertainly, the Federal Reserve is not first past the post in creating an instant payment system — other\nsystems, whether operated by individual banks or through third parties, have been operational for some\ntime. But by allowing banks to interact with each other to ensure one customer’s payment quickly and\nefficiently becomes another’s deposit, the Federal Reserve is fulfilling its role to provide a fair and\nequitable payment system.\n2 Sarah Kessler and Tiffany Hsu, “When Hackers Descended to Test A.I., They Found Flaws Aplenty,” New York\nTimes, August 16, 2023.\n4\n\nAnother area where the Fed is providing thought leadership is in quantum computing, or QC. And I am\nespecially proud that this System-wide effort is being led from right here at the Philadelphia Fed.\nQuantum computing has the potential to revolutionize security and problem-solving methodologies\nthroughout the banking and financial services industry. Right now, individual institutions and other\ncentral banks globally are expanding their own research into QC. And just as these institutions look to\nthe Fed for economic leadership, so, too, are they looking to us for technological leadership.\nQC holds tremendous promise for expanding capabilities far beyond those that our current systems\nallow. But we also know QC could allow for nefarious actors to pose a truly global cybersecurity threat\n— such as by hacking encryption algorithms. And while there is noted progress in quantum-resilient\nencryption, as a banking regulator, ever-present technological change means we cannot take our eyes\noff the ball.\nThese examples are why the Fed will also continue its efforts to provide leadership in the areas of\nfinancial literacy and education — including the publications and materials we have made available for\neducators to take into their classrooms — to give consumers the tools they will need to navigate these\nnew waters, make smart decisions, and protect their own futures.\nThankfully, we are not alone in any of these efforts. Throughout the financial system are numerous\npartners — public and private sector alike, inside this room and watching online — who understand the\nimportance of making sure we get the correct answer to the question, “what next?”\nAnd, as it just so happens, one of these partners is the subject of our first Fireside Chat — Rohit Chopra,\ndirector of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).\nThroughout his tenure leading the CFPB, and before it as a member of the Federal Trade Commission,\nDirector Chopra has focused on issues of fraud prevention and economic and financial fairness.\nI am also honored to welcome him as he happens to be an alum of the Wharton School of the University\nof Pennsylvania, which is not only one of our conference’s organizing partners, but where I also hung my\nhat as dean for many years in my prior life in academia.\n5\n\nAnd leading the discussion will be the director of the Digital Assets Policy Project at Harvard University’s\nKennedy School of Government, Tim Massad.\nIn addition to authoring numerous articles on crypto and financial regulation, Tim served as chairman of\nthe U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission — a tenure that brought him front and center with\nnumerous fintech issues — and as assistant secretary for Financial Stability at the United States\nTreasury.\nWith that, it’s time to get this seventh Fintech Conference formally started.\nSo, what next?\nWell, at this microphone, it’s the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Rohit Chopra.\n6",

    "text": "Welcoming Remarks\nNew Perspectives on Consumer Behavior in Credit & Payments Conference\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nPhiladelphia, PA\nSeptember 8, 2017\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nWelcoming Remarks\nNew Perspectives on Consumer Behavior in Credit & Payments Conference\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nPhiladelphia, PA\nSeptember 8, 2017\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nHello and welcome; it’s great to have everyone here.\nI’m going to keep my remarks to a minimum today, but I do want to take some time to express what I\nthink is truly one of the most important areas of modern economic research. Which, being just one of the\nmany opinions I’m going to share in the next 10 minutes, is a good place to stop to deliver the standard\nFed disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of\nanyone else in the Federal Reserve System, including my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC).\nIn 2001, one of my predecessors stood on this very stage at the first Consumer Transactions and Credit\nconference, making the case for the newly launched Payment Cards Center (PCC). Today, I’ll be making\nthe case for that center’s evolution. In some ways, there may as well be a century and a half, rather than a\ndecade and a half, separating our two discussions. In others, some messages from that conference still\nresonate today.\nReading Anthony Santomero’s remarks with the benefit of 16 years’ perspective is a lesson in the power\nof research and, given the prescience of his case, something of an exercise in humility.\nHis view back then was that individuals’ use of consumer credit and payments had been relatively\nneglected in the research community. That was starting to change with the emergence of ever more\ncomplex financial vehicles, particularly relating to the mortgage market. But, by and large, he said we\nwere still a long way from a sophisticated model of household decisions on spending, saving, borrowing,\nand allocation of assets. He said that “In short, the detailed payoff patterns associated with the debt\ninstruments issued by the agent were entirely too mundane for the theorists’ consideration.”\nWhat a difference a few years would make and how much we all wish those instruments had actually\nbeen mundane.\nToday, the place of consumer credit and payments, and its attendant research, is markedly different than it\nwas in 2001. But the foundation of the Philadelphia Fed’s continued focus remains the same: The Third\nDistrict is home to the credit card industry, and we have years of research and expertise dedicated to the\nstudy of all things consumer.\n1\n\nSo today, I’m incredibly pleased to say that we’re building on that legacy and the work of the Payment\nCards Center by launching the Consumer Finance Institute (CFI).\nThis is an evolution rather than a rebranding or a new initiative. The Payment Cards Center will\ncontribute to the CFI, along with researchers in our Supervision, Regulation, and Credit; Community\nDevelopment Studies & Education; and Research departments. Our goal is to make the Consumer\nFinance Institute a primary source within the Federal Reserve System for consumer finance data and\nresearch.\nI hold the relatively straightforward belief that we should play to our strengths, and this expansion is an\nexpression not only of the importance of consumer finance but the skill and expertise of our staff.\nWe’ve built on the great work of Bob Hunt, Julia Cheney, and the team in the PCC and created a new\nconsumer finance section in our Economic Research group, led by Satyajit Chatterjee. Chatty will be\njoined by Wenli Li, and I’d like to take a moment to welcome Igor Livshits and Andrew Hertzberg. Just a\nplug for our fantastic research team, and a thanks for their work. I’d advise everyone to look out for\nAndrew’s upcoming article in The Journal of Finance. It’s a great example of how the close study of\nhousehold behavior — in this case, understanding that households are actually made up of interdependent\nindividuals — gives us valuable, and surprising, insights into consumption behavior. That’s important on\na number of levels but particularly from my perspective as a monetary policymaker.\nWhich leads me to something I find so surprising about Anthony Santomero’s words not too many years\nago. The absence of a fully developed field of robust research on consumer credit fundamentally indicates\nthat we didn’t acknowledge that it touches every aspect of the economy. Consumer issues are intertwined\nand interwoven, inextricable from virtually every economic issue. From entitlement programs to business\nformation to health care, as Nathan Blascak is going to present later today, there’s nothing in the\neconomy consumer credit doesn’t touch.\nPerhaps it’s simply more stark in the wake of the financial crisis and its aftermath, but it seems to me\nthere’s no way to look at the economy without factoring in the work and research you all are doing.\nSo I’m going to let you get on with that discussion, now that I’ve shamelessly plugged all the great work\nof the staff here at the Philadelphia Fed. I want to thank the conference organizers, who reviewed 140\nsubmissions this year, and Mike Dotsey, our director of Research, for his role in overseeing the CFI and\nrealigning some of his research team to work in such an important area.\nWith that, thanks for coming and enjoy the rest of your day.\n2",

    "text": "SEPTEMBER 20, 2024\nThe Federal\nReserve: It’s\nMore Than Just\nInterest Rates\nLecture at the A.B. Freeman School of\nBusiness at Tulane University\nNew Orleans\nThe views expressed\nPatrick T. Harker today are my own and not\nnecessarily those of the\nFederal Reserve System or\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nthe Federal Open Market\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia Committee (FOMC).\n\nThe following text is President Harker’s lecture delivered at Tulane University’s Freeman\nSchool of Business on Friday, September 20, 2024. President Harker may make additional\ncomments beyond what is reflected in his prepared remarks.\nThe Federal Reserve: It’s More Than Just Interest Rates\nTulane University, Freeman School of Business\nNew Orleans, LA\nSeptember 20, 2024\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThank you all for being here, it truly is a treat to be in the Big Easy.\nI must thank my old friend, and your current president, Mike Fitts, who helped set this event\nin motion. President Fitts and I go back a long way, when he was first Professor Fitts and\nthen Dean Fitts at the University of Pennsylvania’s Carey School of Law and I was a\nprofessor and then dean of the Wharton School. His first year as president of Tulane\noverlapped with my last year as president of the University of Delaware.\nThere are two things I must do at the outset.\nFirst, I must say the following: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily\nreflect those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC).\nThat’s the standard Fed disclaimer. But I always boil it down to the following — when you’re\nrecalling today’s discussion you can always say, “Pat said,” you cannot say “the Fed said.”\nAnd second, while we’re talking disclosure, I must admit that I’m not here in New Orleans\nonly to speak with you today. My son and I already booked our trip to watch our\nPhiladelphia Eagles take on the Saints at the Superdome. When I mentioned to President\nFitts that I was coming down, he invited me to campus, and I readily accepted.\nSo, while I recognize I may be in rival territory, I am certainly comforted by all the green I see\non campus. I also think Riptide and Swoop the Eagle would be good friends.\nSo don’t worry, I’ll be rooting for the Green Wave tomorrow against the Ragin’ Cajuns. And if\nanyone has a recommendation for a good place to watch the game, come see me after!\nNow, if you’ll allow, I have some prepared remarks, but then I do want to get out from\nbehind this podium to get to your questions.\n\nI have titled this talk “It’s More Than Just Interest Rates.” And that’s on purpose.\nI want to hopefully break the views that some of you may hold of what the Federal Reserve\nis, what it does, and, importantly, what it can offer in terms of career opportunities.\nCertainly, if you are an economics major focusing on the minutiae of monetary policy and\neconomic forecasting, there is a potential place for your talents in the Federal Reserve. The\nFed is, after all, the largest employer of economists in the nation.\nBut, that said, while I have been president and chief executive officer of the Philly Fed for\nnearly a decade, I am not an economist by training. I hold bachelor’s, master’s, and\ndoctoral degrees in civil engineering. I actually received my master’s in economics because\nI needed to understand the economic underpinnings of a project I was working on about\nrailroads.\nSo, take it from me, you don’t need to be a Ph.D. economist to make it at the Fed — you just\nneed to be driven by a desire to make our economy healthier, stronger, and more inclusive.\nAs I hope to lay out, the Fed is diverse and dynamic — both in terms of our work and in our\nworld views across the System. The Fed’s ability to build a more secure economic future\nthat benefits all Americans requires attracting and retaining a diverse and dynamic set of\nindividuals committed to service.\nWe work to improve the economies of our Districts and constituencies, and even more\nimportantly, improve the lives of the people we serve. And there are plenty of career\nopportunities across the Federal Reserve for those interested in doing just that.\nI would add here that we are committed to also being more diverse in our makeup. At the\nPhilly Fed, we take enormous pride in having not just one of the best thought leadership\nteams around, but also one that is diverse in its makeup of backgrounds, experiences, and\nworld views. To us, academic excellence is critical, however, lived experience can help\nmake sure we’re asking the right questions.\nBut perhaps I’m getting a bit ahead of myself. Let’s take a step back to what the Federal\nReserve is and why it was created. The Federal Reserve System is only roughly 111 years\nold. It was created in 1913 to provide centralized economic and financial leadership to a\nnation whose largely decentralized financial system had failed to protect the economy\nagainst financial shocks, panics, scams, and scandals.\nThe Federal Reserve System is made up of the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., and\n12 district banks — each with a specific geographic footprint, and each of which is an\nindependently chartered institution. While in many areas these district banks work in\n2\n\npartnership, each district bank also conducts its own research, oversees the operations of\nhundreds of banks, and undertakes projects across its own district.\nThe Philadelphia Fed oversees the Third District, which includes central and eastern\nPennsylvania, southern New Jersey, and Delaware. New Orleans is part of the Sixth District\nwhich is headquartered in Atlanta and covers much of the southern United States. There is\na branch of the Atlanta Fed just a few miles down St. Charles Ave across from Lafayette\nSquare.\nOver the past century plus, the Federal Reserve System has provided stability to financial\nmarkets, oversight to financial institutions, and confidence to the American people in both.\nThis has required a pragmatic approach to our work. Yes, we live in a political world. But we\ndo not, and cannot, allow our decisions to be made by politics.\nWe operate in accordance with the two explicit tasks, known as the “dual mandate,” which\nwere handed to us by Congress: one, to ensure stable prices for the American people, and\ntwo, to ensure maximum employment.\nThat first pillar — stable prices — is easy to define. That’s inflation. That’s where the\nmonetary policy tools available to us on the FOMC are our instruments, blunt instruments\nthough they may be. Through the policy interest rate, as well as our own balance sheet of\ninstitutional assets, we can influence the push and pull of the economy to maintain price\nstability and meet our inflation target.\nIt’s an overly simplistic model but think for a moment of the economy as a bus. If we sense\nthe bus is going too fast, that is, and the economy is at risk of overheating, the FOMC can\nincrease the policy rate, figuratively tapping “the brakes” on the economy to get inflation\nunder control by cooling consumers’ appetites and firms’ investment plans. If we sense\nthat the bus is traveling too slowly, the FOMC can give the economy a little more “gas” by\nsetting policy rates low to stimulate consumption and investment. And if we sense that\nwe’re traveling at an appropriate speed and we just need to keep things, we can choose to\ndo nothing.\nObviously, as with driving a bus, there are many subtleties to take into account. This is why\nwe’ve remained so dependent on surveying all the available data and, importantly, taking a\nlonger-look approach and not over- or under-reacting to one particular month or one\nparticular dataset. We’ve had to watch the entire “road,” and we indeed had quite an\n“inflation bump” in the first quarter of this year. If we were to press too hard on either the\ngas or brakes, we could lose control of the bus. If we weren’t paying close attention to the\nroad before us, we could hit a pothole, or worse.\n3\n\nOver the past 30 months, I believe we’ve proven ourselves to have been pretty good drivers\n— and I’m from New Jersey so we think we know a thing or two about good driving! But\nplease do not ask anyone from outside New Jersey about that.\nOK, so that covers one half of our mandate. Now, let’s get to the second: maximum\nemployment. Here is where I believe the breadth of our efforts has an impact.\nWhat Does “Maximum Employment” Mean?\n• I take a more nuanced view than many economists. To me, achieving maximum\nemployment is not just about promoting economic conditions through which\neveryone who wants a job can get a job. Yes, job growth is important but, to me, so is\npromoting a climate in which work isn’t just something to be rewarded but\nsomething that is truly rewarding.\n• Put another way, while the quantity of available jobs is important, so, too, is the\nquality of those jobs.\n• So much of life is wrapped up in this part of the equation. Where to work. Where to\nlive. How to travel to work. Whether to go to college. Whether consciously or not, we\nare making many of these decisions with our own individual concept of “maximum\nemployment” in mind. This is what we try to understand at the Philly Fed.\n• Recently, my colleagues at the Philly Fed, in partnership with the Atlanta Fed,\ncreated the Worker Voices Project, and spent more than a year speaking with\nworkers in low-wage positions about the job choices they made coming out of the\npandemic. What we learned from these conversations is that workers primarily\nwanted a job where they would be treated with respect and dignity.\n• Along with our colleagues at the Cleveland Fed, in 2000 we created an Occupational\nMobility Explorer, an online tool where workers in low-wage jobs can map their own\npotential journeys to higher-paying careers. A revamped version of the Explorer with\nmore resources is going to be launched in the coming days.\nResearch Beyond the Expected\n• Philly Fed economic research goes far beyond monetary policy and into areas that\ncan help us better understand the totality of life in our communities.\no Take just one example, transportation policy, which as a civil engineer is\nclose to my heart. From measuring the non-monetary costs to communities\ninvolved in building highways, to ways in which the location of mass transit\ncan impact the decisions made by commuters, our researchers are asking\nsome really probing questions.\n4\n\n• At the Philadelphia Fed, we also conduct surveys of contacts throughout the Third\nDistrict. Perhaps the most well-known are the Manufacturing Business Outlook\nSurvey — or MBOS — and the Nonmanufacturing Business Outlook Survey of\nservice industry contacts — or NBOS. Conducted monthly, each survey gives us a\nreal-time assessment of future outlooks and sentiments within these sectors.\n• The Philly Fed is also a leader in taking deep dives into consumer behavior through\nour Consumer Finance Institute (CFI).\no CFI researchers look at all levels of consumer activity, from credit cards to\nmortgages to rents to car loans. All of this helps create a fuller picture of the\neconomy from a consumer standpoint.\no We are conducting groundbreaking research into the impacts of student\nloans and the resumption over the past year of student loan payments on the\nbroader economy.\no Earlier in 2024 we launched the Labor, Income, Finances, and Expectations\n(LIFE) Survey to give us new and comprehensive perspectives on how people\nearn, spend, save, and invest their money while also allowing us a bigger\nwindow into how all of these factors affect the broader economy.\n• One area which I am very excited about is the new Center for the REstoration of\nEconomic Data, or CREED. Here, researchers are culling historical archives and\nbringing previously forgotten-to-time data back into the research fold where it can\nnow help us answer the question of “How did we get here?” Their work includes:\no Racial Covenants research, which has helped us understand how the\nPhiladelphia of today — the poorest large city in America and one of our\nnation’s most racially segregated — came to be and aims to help us undo\nthat harm by uncovering the relationship between historical housing\ndiscrimination and today’s racial wealth gap.\no Historical Housing Prices Project, which has compiled data from more than\n100 years of newspaper real estate listings to give us a more complete\npicture of housing markets, both rental and resale, across multiple\ngenerations.\nDirect Community Outreach\n• As you can imagine, I’m swimming in so-called “hard data” — official reports on\ninflation, unemployment, and so on. But I also place significant importance on “soft\ndata” — the real-time experiences and observations that we at the Philadelphia Fed\nget by talking to contacts and everyday residents.\n5\n\n• Balancing hard and soft data allows me to create a more dynamic approach to the\nissues. And it can sometimes lead me to change my mind on our course when it\ncomes to monetary policy.\n• Our Community Development and Regional Outreach Department (CDRO) helps\nbuild partnerships and kick-start local economic initiatives in cities throughout the\nThird District. Every year, I travel with my colleagues to these partners to check in,\nsee their progress on issues such as affordable housing and small business\ndevelopment, and to help these communities plan future next steps to keep their\nmomentum.\n• The Anchor Economy Initiative is measuring the economic impacts that hospitals\nand institutions of higher education, or “eds and meds,” have on their home regions.\nFor the first time, the Initiative captured these impacts in 524 statistical areas\nacross the nation.\no In New Orleans, the Anchor Economy Initiative calculated that eds and meds\ninstitutions impact more than 10 percent of all jobs, more than 7 percent of\nthe region’s income, and more than 9 percent of its GDP. This is captured in a\nReliance Index, of which New Orleans registers 1.16 — meaning this region is\nslightly more reliant on eds and meds than the national average.1\no The Anchor Economy Initiative is tying together individual institutional\nimpacts to show how important they are collectively to regions to spur\nactionable partnerships.\no By putting this impact into perspective, it can allow us to engage more deeply\nwith these institutions to tackle long-standing economic and social issues in\nthe communities we serve.\nSupervision\n• The Philly Fed oversees holding companies and state-chartered member banks\nthroughout the Third District, just as the other 11 regional banks oversee the\nfinancial institutions within their districts.\n• Our goal is to promote the safety and soundness of our institutions, ensure\ncustomers are treated fairly and their deposits are kept safely, and serve as a\nresource for our banks.\n• Our examiners maintain strong relationships throughout the financial sector.\n1 Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. Anchor Economy Dashboard, (2019).\nhttps://www.philadelphiafed.org/surveys-and-data/community-development-data/anchor-economy-\ndashboard/.\n6\n\n• We offer leadership, support, and expertise on matters concerning supervision,\ncompliance, financial reporting, and credit risk management to the financial\nservices industry.\n• We do act swiftly when needed; however, our overall goal is not to respond to a\nfinancial emergency but to prevent one from happening in the first place.\nA Leader in Information Technology\n• As a Fed president, I don’t just lead the Philadelphia Bank; I am also active in the\ngovernance structure that guides the Federal Reserve System. I currently serve as\nchair of the leadership committee that guides the strategic direction for System-\nwide information technology (IT) use and development. Circling back to my earlier\ncomments on career direction — my engineering background has served me well in\nthis capacity.\n• IT at the Fed involves much more than the computers used by our personnel; it\ntouches deep on the way funds move throughout our economy.\no Last summer, for example, we launched the FedNow® Service, a new system\nfor instant payments.\n• We are engaged in long looks at the future of artificial intelligence (AI) not only for its\npotential impacts on the banking sector, but also for our economy as a whole.\n• We are positioning ourselves as thought leaders in the emerging area of quantum\ncomputing, or QC, which holds the potential for completely revolutionizing security\nand problem-solving methodologies.\n• Technology systems are going to play an increasingly larger role in the future of the\nfinancial sector. We are putting together the teams needed to ensure that the\nsector’s future is safe and secure so that customers — and the global economy —\ncan have faith in it.\nConclusion\nSo, as you can see, the Federal Reserve is way more than just interest rates. You don’t need\nto have a Ph.D. in economics to consider a career at the Federal Reserve — just take me as\nan example!\nAs I noted, I’ve done this job for a little more than nine years now. Next year, I will hit the\nFed’s mandatory retirement age and have to leave this post. But what a way to go — to\nknow that the decisions I have had to make on the FOMC, and the work done by countless\n7\n\ndedicated individuals at the Philadelphia Fed and across the Federal Reserve System, have\nleft an indelible and, I hope, positive mark on our nation’s economic future.\nI hope my remarks have sparked an interest in the Federal Reserve as well as the personal\ndecisions you will make regarding your own economic futures.\nNow, I think I’ve gone on long enough and given you a taste of life at the Fed. Now I want to\nhear what’s been on your minds, and I am eager to start this Q&A.\n8",

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood morning and welcome. I’m a big fan of bridging conversations across disciplines, so I want\nto applaud Larry and the team at the Consumer Finance Institute for pulling together such an\neclectic — and esteemed — group of experts, including my old friend and former colleague,\nColin Camerer.\nEconomics may be the dismal science, but it’s far from an exact one. And despite the myriad\ntools and equations at our disposal, there’s one remarkably unpredictable variable that forever\ncomplicates the results: human behavior. Neuroeconomics is relatively new territory, but it’s\nimportant to seek out new insights — in fact, we could use a little more of it. Given humanity’s\ninherently capricious nature, the more expertise and angles of analysis, the better. The richness\nof context it adds is more important now than ever, as the U.S. economy ventures into new\nterritory: As AI and machine learning fundamentally alter the unfolding employment landscape;\nas a new economic normal takes hold, even as a record-long expansion continues; and as many\nof our traditional models and modes of assessment have begun to lose their predictive and\nevaluative prowess.\nI have a background in engineering, so it’s in my DNA to take a step back every once in a while\nand reassess structures: Do we have all the information we need? Are we still using the right\n1\n\nmodels? Is there new analysis or insight that could make them more effective? And, crucially,\ndo we know what we don’t know?\nI’m not saying we should throw out the old tools. But I do think we should contextualize them\nin the light of new information. And I do think it’s important to solicit information from outside\ntraditional bounds.\nThe economy is not a fixed structure; it’s an ecosystem — a living, breathing organism informed\nby the people and entities that comprise it. As a policymaker, my judgment is influenced by the\nbehaviors and patterns I see as much as by economic orthodoxy. And at a time when far more\nof the variables appear to be uncertain — or unruly — new insights are especially valuable to\nthe discipline and study of economics.\nSo I’m very pleased that we could host this discussion today, and with that, let me turn the\nfloor over to Bob Hunt.\n2",

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nThe Opportunities of a Tight Labor Market\n2020 Lyons CEEE Economic Forecast\nUniversity of Delaware\nNewark, DE\nFebruary 10, 2020\nPresident Patrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood afternoon, and it is a pleasure to be here with you and to also be back on my old stomping\ngrounds of the University of Delaware. Being here again feels like Groundhog Day — but without Sonny\nand Cher singing on the radio.\nAnother thing that feels like Groundhog Day is the usual disclaimer I say over and over again: The views I\nexpress today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee or across the Federal Reserve System.\nWith that out of the way, let me outline my remarks today. I will start with my outlook for the economy\n— which I know takes on greater significance since I am a voting member this year of the Federal Open\nMarket Committee. My outlook for the economy — specifically for the labor market — ties into the final\nsection of my speech: workforce development. In my view, with the labor market the tightest it has\nbeen in decades, now is the time to create new approaches to how companies hire, train, and retain\nemployees and how the U.S. can create career paths for all of its workers.\nEconomic Outlook\nLet’s start with the economy. Overall, I think the economy is in good shape.\nWe are in the longest economic expansion on record, and I see growth returning to trend of about 2\npercent this year, a view that is widely shared.\nFriday’s employment report showed the labor market began 2020 on the same positive trend it showed\nthrough 2019. We added 225,000 net new jobs in January — better than the monthly average of\n1\n\n175,000 for all of 2019. Hourly wages increased 3.1 percent from last January, and the unemployment\nrate stood at 3.6 percent.\nAt some point, we’ll return to a trend of creating about 100,000 net new jobs per month. That number\nsounds disappointing — compared with the stronger monthly gains we’ve seen in recent years. But it’s\nimportant to recognize that 100,000 jobs per month is more than enough to keep pace with the\nexpected growth in the U.S. labor force. That’s one reason why I expect that the unemployment rate will\nstay below 4 percent for the next couple of years.\nThe health of the labor market, especially when it comes to paychecks, is key to my economic outlook\nsince consumer spending accounts for about 70 percent of the U.S. economy. The news in general\ncontinues to be good for the consumer sector. Thanks to the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years and\ngrowth in wages, consumers are upbeat about the economy. Consumer confidence is high, and the\noptimism should support household spending this year.\nAnother support to consumer spending this year is the prospect of more homeowners refinancing their\nmortgages. Research done at the Philadelphia Fed’s Consumer Finance Institute1 shows that lower rates\nin 2019 resulted in a large number of borrowers who are in a position to refinance their residential\nmortgages. Mortgage refinancing fuels consumption in two ways: First, homeowners are able to lower\ntheir monthly house payment, freeing up money that can be spent elsewhere. Second, homeowners\nmay choose to extract some home equity by using a cash-out refinance. This also provides money for\nother consumer spending.\nOur research shows that in September 2019 — when the 30-year fixed mortgage rate averaged 3.61\npercent — about 19 percent of all active mortgages were refi candidates. The Bank’s research —\nsupported by industry analysis — suggests that with no change in mortgage rates, about 60 percent of\nborrowers will probably refinance this year, and over the next two years, we would expect an estimated\n$11.2 billion in added consumption from this refi activity. On an individual level, an average homeowner\nwould have about $2,000 to spend in extra consumption within the first year after refinancing — a nice\nlift to almost any budget.\nMy positive view about the consumer contrasts with concerns about business investment. Spending on\nnew plant and equipment and intellectual property is lagging, and the uncertainty attached to fiscal and\n1 The analysis is based on Black Knight McDash data and Equifax Credit Risk Insight Servicing data.\n2\n\nother policies has continued to hold spending back. So, too, have international developments, including\nthe global slowdown, trade uncertainty, and geopolitical tensions.\nIt’s too early to say what impact the spread of the coronavirus will have on the global economy, but the\nnegative effects on the Chinese economy and international travel are something to watch.\nThat’s my view on the labor markets and economic growth. Let me talk about the other side of the Fed’s\ndual mandate: inflation. We haven’t quite met our 2 percent inflation target, but we’re on track to get\nthere. While the process has been a slow one, I still believe that the inflation rate will rise to meet our\ngoal.\nAgainst this backdrop of a generally positive economic outlook and expectations that inflation will\neventually hit the Fed’s target, I come to the part that everyone really cares about: rates. As you know,\nat the January FOMC meeting, the Committee decided unanimously to hold the federal funds rate target\nstable at the range of 1½ to 1¾ percent.\nMy own view right now is that we should hold steady for a while and watch how developments and the\ndata unfold before taking any more action.\nThe Regional Economy\nTurning to Delaware and the Philadelphia region, the economic outlook is more mixed than the national\none. Over the past five years, Delaware employment grew less than 1 percent per year, which is lower\nthan the 1.5 percent posted for the nation. In the recent months, however, Delaware’s job growth has\npicked up to a rate similar to the national average. At a more granular level, northern parts of Delaware\nseem to be doing better than the southern parts.\nDelaware’s unemployment rate was 3.9 percent in December (slightly higher than the national figure).\nUnemployment in the southern areas tends to be higher.\nDelaware’s job growth has been reasonably broad based, with the usual suspects such as the financial\nindustry and education and health care — often referred to as “Eds and Meds” — leading the way. The\nprofessional and business services sector has seen a slight decline in the past year. But this could be due\nto a reduction in temporary-service jobs, which show up in the business services sector. With the local\nlabor market remaining tight, companies are shifting temporary and part-time workers into permanent,\nfull-time jobs, which results in a reduction of employment in the professional and business services\nsector.\n3\n\nIn the Philadelphia metro area, which, of course, encompasses parts of Delaware, Pennsylvania, New\nJersey, and Maryland, job growth had been running around 1.5 percent, until several years ago when it\nslowed to 1 percent annually. In general, the Philadelphia metro area’s job growth since the last\nrecession has outpaced that of the Pennsylvania average for the most part, but has been below that of\nthe nation during the same period.\nLike Delaware, the Philadelphia metro area’s job growth has been consistently broad based for the past\nseveral years, thanks to net new job gains in Eds and Meds and professional and business services. The\nlocal labor market is also feeling the direct impact of e-commerce versus brick-and-mortar stores. We\nhave had a decline in retail employment, but we are seeing continuous growth in transportation and\nwarehousing employment.\nAs for the jobless rate, the Philadelphia area’s rate stood at 4.1 percent in December. This is lower than\nthe state average but is higher than the national average. In recent months, we have seen a slight uptick\nin the region’s and the state’s unemployment rates. This is likely due to an increase in the labor force\nparticipation rate at the state level during the same period. As more people enter the labor force, the\nunemployment rate will temporarily increase until they find jobs.\nTight Labor Market Could Be a Workforce Development Opportunity\nThe very tight labor markets we are seeing locally and across the nation have put employers in a\nchallenging position that was not evident in the years following the Great Recession. Companies report\ndifficulty filling open positions, and many of those slots stay vacant for a long time. The difficult\nrecruiting environment is also one that is likely to stay with us for some time as demographic trends\nindicate that the workforce will continue to age and the labor force relative to the population will\ncontinue to decline.\nThis challenge may also be viewed as an opportunity, and those that successfully invent new ways to\nattract workers will enhance their chances of success. Now is a chance to rethink the same-old, same-\nold ways of building a productive workforce. This can perhaps be done by rethinking job requirements\nor additional ways of training.\nOne such innovative program has begun in Philadelphia. It is a public–private partnership to train\nworkers here in Philadelphia. This project was developed by the Bank’s Economic Growth & Mobility\nProject, in concert with Philadelphia Works and Comcast. It seeks to gain a better understanding of what\n4\n\nprograms and strategies expand opportunities for individuals who live in low- and moderate-income\ncommunities.\nThe pilot program, announced last fall, has Philadelphia Works providing the upfront investment for\ntraining workers to master the skills needed by Comcast. As part of this new financial model, Comcast is\ncommitted to paying for outcomes once they are achieved, such as staying on the job for over six\nmonths. Philadelphia Works provides the training. The model also creates a better feedback loop\nbetween employers and the workforce board to make the program more effective and responsive to\nchanging employer and employee needs.\nThe program is helping Comcast find workers in a tight labor market and let me assure you: The tight\nlabor market we hear about from most of you is not imagined. Economists at the Philadelphia Fed have\nbeen looking into the amount of time needed to fill positions in metro areas across the U.S. In our\nregion, it took 41 days, on average, to fill a position. That was longer than the national average of 37\ndays, and put Philly 47th out of the 50 largest metro areas.\nIt is hard to say exactly why it takes longer in Philadelphia than in other places, but one thing our\nresearchers noted is that job ads in the Philadelphia metro area tend to list slightly higher education\nrequirements than other metro areas. This underscores a need to switch gears and investigate if\nprograms such as the one I just mentioned could be adapted to the challenges you face.\nBut here’s another finding of the study that I found very interesting: The skills in highest demand in the\nPhiladelphia region, and across the U.S., are not those dependent on acquiring a four-year degree, but\ninstead are soft skills, such as communication, customer service, and teamwork. That could indicate that\na rethinking of job requirements could help counter the tight labor market conditions that are a\nprevalent feature of the current economy. Sometimes that means a college or graduate degree is\nneeded, but sometimes it doesn’t.\nThat leads to another issue about workforce development, an issue I have championed for a few years\nnow. And it might be strange to hear this from me — a former president here at the University of\nDelaware — but not every high school graduate needs to go to college. And that would be even truer if\nthere were greater innovation in recruiting and training. To reiterate, the difficulty of finding new\nemployees is likely to be a feature of the labor market for some time to come because demographic\ntrends are not short-run fluctuations. Innovation in attracting and retaining workers is likely to be one of\n5\n\nthe key aspects governing success. It expands the pool of workers, helping to create better matches and\na more productive workforce. And, importantly it opens pathways for workers.\nOpportunity Occupations\nOf course, workers without a college degree still need to find well-paying jobs. As I mentioned earlier,\nmy positive outlook for the U.S. economy rests on the consumer sector. We need everyone who wants a\njob to be able to find a well-paying and sustainable career path. Researchers within our Community\nDevelopment and Regional Outreach Department have identified several employment categories that\npay above the national annual median wage but do not require a four-year college degree. We call these\nopportunity occupations.\nMy colleague Keith Wardrip worked with researchers from the Cleveland Fed to catalogue these\noccupations by looking at education requirements in job postings and hourly wage data from the Labor\nDepartment. The list of opportunity occupations vary from registered nurses to truck drivers, retail sales\nsupervisors, carpenters, and patrol officers. So whether a person likes dealing with people or working\nwith their hands, and whether they are interested in a career in health care, construction,\ntransportation, or sales, one of the many opportunity occupations may fit their idea of a good job.\nTo be clear, many of these jobs require on-the-job experience or some type of training after high school,\nand some positions advertised online required a college degree. But nationally, Keith and his colleagues\ncalculated that 21.6 percent of jobs in 2017 could be classified as opportunity occupations. In the\nPhiladelphia–Camden–Wilmington metro area, the share was slightly lower, at 20.1 percent.\nThese occupations offer workers without college degrees the chance to be part of our growing economy\nand to become financially secure. Giving more people the opportunity to participate in the economy\nstrengthens our economy because more paychecks support increased consumer spending. It’s a win–\nwin situation for all of us.\nIndeed, emphasizing skills rather than degrees might help to reverse a troubling longer-run trend in the\nU.S. economy, and that is the high number of adults who are not in the labor force. The share of\nworking-age adults who are participating in the labor force — which includes those who are employed\nand those who are unemployed but actively looking for work — came in at just 63.1 percent in 2019,\ndown from 65.4 percent 10 years ago. What this says to me is that the U.S. is missing out on the\n6\n\npotential these adults could bring to the economy. This will, no doubt, require innovative thinking and\nnew ways of investing in the workforce, but the payoffs are likely to be substantial.\nI know the popular notion is that artificial intelligence and robots will make workforce development\nunnecessary. But let me return to our study about the time needed to fill job openings and mention that\nthe occupations that are hardest to fill include registered nurses, retail store managers, and physicians.\nThese are jobs that are least at risk for automation. They require uniquely human skills and can’t easily\nbe done by robots. Employers can’t expect these jobs to disappear any time soon, and that is why it is\nimperative for employers to invest in those unique humans who can develop the communication,\nteamwork, and service skills that will get the job done.\n7",

Harker today are my own and not\nnecessarily those of the\nFederal Reserve System or\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nthe Federal Open Market\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia Committee (FOMC).\n\nEconomic Education as Key to a Strong Economic Future\nNational Association of Economic Educators\n2025 Spring Professional Development Conference\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nPhiladelphia, PA\nMarch 6, 2025\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood morning, everyone, and welcome to the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. It\nis truly a pleasure for us to host this national convening.\nWhile I certainly anticipate that you will enjoy your time here in the Bank, I hope that you\nwill also be able to enjoy just a little bit of what makes the City of Philadelphia so special\n— and I don’t just mean the food.\nAs educators, I am certain you appreciate Philadelphia’s history and role as the\nbirthplace of the United States, as both the Declaration of Independence and\nConstitution were framed and signed just a few hundred yards away. But as economic\neducators, this is also the birthplace of American central banking. The first Bank of the\nUnited States is just a few blocks away on Third Street, and the Second Bank is over at\nFourth and Chestnut.\nAnd, of course, there’s the Philly Fed’s own exhibit downstairs in the atrium. But I’m\ngetting ahead of myself!\nBut in any case, standing before you, I see brought to life the statement from this city’s\nmost famous resident, Benjamin Franklin, who wrote, “An investment in knowledge pays\nthe best interest.” Of course, that only makes sense if you know how “interest” works.\nWe have the pleasure of spending the next 45 or so minutes together. And while I\ncertainly don’t mind speaking to you, I would much more enjoy speaking with you. So, I\nplan to keep these remarks brief so that I can take some questions and we can have a\nconversation. With that in mind, I should take a moment to just remind everyone,\nincluding myself, that the views I express this morning are mine alone and do not\nnecessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the\nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nWhile I would make the case that it is always a good time for young people to learn\nbasic economics, I would also make the case that there is no more pressing time for\neconomic education than right now.\n\nEconomics is front-and-center in the news. Whether it be online, on television, or\nelsewhere, it is imperative for young people to understand what the news around them\nmeans. They are reading, watching, and hearing about “inflation,” among numerous\nother economic terms. And I’ve heard of very few social media influencers filling this\nspace.\nThey need to be able to not just know what economic terms mean but to grasp, at least\nrudimentarily, the concepts and facts that underpin them.\nWe need our students — across all grade levels — to be able to know how our\neconomy works. It isn’t vital to have an educated society that merely understands what\neconomic words mean; it’s vital to have an educated society that understands how their\ndecisions, as individuals, play a direct role in our economy. The decision to spend or\nsave. The decision to go to college or enter the workforce. The decision to buy a new\ncar or keep the old one roadworthy. The decision to pay cash or to take out the credit\ncard.\nAnd the more young people learn about the impacts of these decisions, the better it is\nfor them as consumers and citizens, and the better it will be for our economy in the long\nrun.\nAnd this is where the “economics toolbox” that each of you can impart on your students\nbecomes critical.\nStudents need to understand how credit works and what “interest” means long before\nthey ever get access to a credit card, fill out a loan application for a first car, or to help\npay for a college education.\nThey need to learn how labor markets work long before they settle on their chosen\ncareers.\nThey need to understand how not just supply and demand, but also outside forces,\nimpacts the prices they pay at the store.\nThey need to appreciate how money works across the economy and to have a healthy\nrelationship with their own funds.\nAnd, yes, they need to learn about the role of the Federal Reserve and the work we\nundertake here, at the Reserve Banks around the nation and in Washington, to meet\nour dual mandate of stable prices and maximum employment for the American people.\nFor so many, economic education has only been presented in an abstract. But in your\nhands, it is delivered in a more meaningful and directly impactful way. We’re not\nnecessarily in the business of minting a whole new generation of PhD economists —\nthough from point of view of a Federal Reserve Bank president, you can never have\nenough working around you — but rather we need more economically savvy citizens.\n2\n\nAs president of the Philly Fed, I’ve spoken before numerous groups of students both\nformally and informally. One thing I’ve always tried to stress to them is that while what\nthey read may make it appear that the Fed is the economy, in reality we are not. We\nhave tools at our disposal to help guide the economy. That’s what monetary policy is for.\nBut I tell them that if they want to see the real economy, look at their neighbor and then\nlook in the mirror — it is them, as future consumers, who are the economy. It is their\ndecisions that will have the greatest impact on our collective economic direction. And\nthe more we can equip them with information to make smart decisions, our economic\nfuture will be better.\nAnd this is where you, as educators, come in. It can’t be left to a chance conversation\nwith the president of a Reserve Bank or the opportunity to visit us here and walk\nthrough that exhibit I mentioned a few moments ago.\nEconomic educators are an important part of this equation. It is each of you who are the\nforce multipliers making it possible for us to take scarce resources and reach as many\nstudents and teachers as possible. And so convenings like this allow you, as\nprofessionals, to receive additional training that enables economic knowledge and\ninformation to be taught more effectively, making it an integral part of the equation.\nThere’s a commercial on television where several adults are standing around a kitchen\nisland and one of them makes the comment about the product saving them money,\n“With the economy and all.” A child among them asks, “What’s the economy?” And the\nadults all hem and haw until the child walks away, mumbling, “I’ll go look it up.”\nI think that encapsulates, perfectly, why we’re all here.\nThanks to your continued efforts, that child will know — and if the commercial is to be\nremade it could be the child who educates the grown-ups.\nThe Philadelphia Fed will stand in support of those efforts, too. We’ll continue to\nproduce high-quality materials that you can take into your classrooms. We’ll continue to\nbe a resource you can rely upon.\nI thank you for coming to Philadelphia. I hope you have an excellent time, both here\nduring the conference and outside in the City of Brotherly Love and Sisterly Affection.\nAnd, finally, allow me to say, simply, “thank you” for all you do to move economic\neducation forward.\nThanks for allowing me these few minutes to kick off the day. I’ll be happy to take some\nquestions.\n3",

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nHigher Education: The Importance and Urgency of Reform\nSymposium on Institutions of Higher Education: Financial Viability and COVID-19\nPhiladelphia, PA (Virtual)\nMay 12, 2021\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nOpening Keynote\nGood morning! It’s great to be here. And a special thanks to our staff at the Philadelphia Fed who\norganized this symposium, our distinguished panelists, and, of course, all of you for taking the time to\njoin us.\nAs a recovering academic, I’m particularly excited about today’s program. The future of higher ed is\nobviously of personal importance to me … but it’s not just that. It’s also crucial to the future of our\ncountry. We’ve assembled a terrific assortment of panelists today, who will — I am sure — provide\nunparalleled insight into the challenges and opportunities facing the sector. How lucky we all are to be\nhere … in some form.\nBut now, before we begin, I have to say something I never needed to say in my lecture hall days. That’s\nwhat we call the standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily\nreflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or in the Federal Reserve System.\nHigher Ed’s Economic Footprint\nThe Philadelphia Fed has invested significantly in research in higher education and education finance\nover the past couple of decades. Our interdisciplinary, applied research group, the Consumer Finance\nInstitute, which is sponsoring this event, is just the most recent strategic initiative in this area.\n1\n\nOur Bank’s strong interest in the subject is partly geographic. Now, some may like to call the Boston area\nthe “Athens of America,” but here in Philadelphia, we are at least Alexandria. Some 80 colleges and\nuniversities populate the Greater Philadelphia area. The two largest employers in the region are\nuniversities and their associated health systems — the University of Pennsylvania and Thomas Jefferson\nUniversity. These anchor institutions — comprising both eds and meds — are of vital economic\nimportance to the District we serve at the Philadelphia Fed.\nBut that does not make us unique — far from it, in fact. And for all its civic virtues, higher education is\nalso an industry whose economic effects are felt coast to coast.\nIndeed, in the fall of 2019, there were approximately 4,000 postsecondary educational institutions in the\nU.S., counting both four-year and two-year institutions and nonprofits as well as for-profits.\nTheir economic impact is, quite obviously, sizable. The National Center for Education Statistics counts\nmore than 4 million people employed in higher education. Those employed in the higher education\nsector earn higher-than-median wages.\nNor can we forget the students and the value they bring to the communities where they study and\nsocialize. As of last fall, 19.7 million students were enrolled in America’s colleges and universities, 12\nmillion of whom were attending full-time. Right around now, as the academic year draws to a close,\ncolleges and universities are getting ready to confer 1,988,000 bachelor’s degrees, 983,000 associate’s\ndegrees, 833,000 master’s degrees, and 187,000 doctorates. That’s a whole lot of people entering the\nworkforce better prepared than they were before.\nAnd then there are the millions of Americans whose livelihood depends indirectly on higher education.\nThink of the restaurants, coffee shops — and, let’s be honest, grungy bars — that cluster near campuses,\nas well as the legions of suppliers of books, accommodations, transportation, furniture, utilities,\ntechnology services, and so much more, that depend on colleges and universities. There’s a reason the\nnotion of the “college town” evokes thriving small businesses and vibrant communities. Colleges and\nuniversities have a serious multiplier effect.\nAll of which is to say, the economic impact of the higher education sector is felt by far more than the\nalready massive numbers of people who are employed or enrolled in it. The entire country is touched by\nit.\n2\n\nFurthermore, for all its problems — many of which we will delve into today — higher education, in all its\nforms, remains a critical rung on the ladder to the middle class in this country.\nA bachelor’s degree is worth $2.8 million on average in career earnings, according to Georgetown\nUniversity’s Center on Education and the Workforce. Bachelor’s degree holders earn 31 percent more\nthan those with an associate’s degree and 84 percent more than those with a high school diploma.\nMoreover, this so-called college premium has risen in recent decades. In 1999, bachelor’s degree\nholders earned just 75 percent more than those with a high school diploma. The earnings gap between\nthose with degrees and those without is only rising.\nAnd that is precisely why today’s symposium on the financial viability of the higher education industry is\nso important. The financial health and stability of these institutions is of the greatest import not just to\neducators and students, but to all of us.\nI can’t wait to hear from our panels of state education leaders, researchers, and college and university\npresidents. I only wish we could be serving lunch. And I’ll be back later to speak more on today’s topic\nand open up the Q&A.\nSo again, thanks so much for joining us and a warm welcome on behalf of the Philadelphia Fed. And\nnow, I’d like to turn things over to Rajeev Darolia of the University of Kentucky, who will lead our first\npanel.\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n3\n\nClosing Keynote\nHello again! What a great program this has been. I want to say thank you, again, to the organizers of this\nsymposium, the panelists, and all of you for joining us.\nAlso, I’m not sure if I want to say this, but I know I have to. It’s a rerun of what I said this morning: The\nviews I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal\nOpen Market Committee or in the Federal Reserve System.\nToday’s presentations have underlined two fundamental facts about the higher education sector that\nindicate why we are approaching a crisis point. One: Higher education is, as I sketched out a bit this\nmorning, deeply important to the civic and economic life of our country. And two: That very system is in\nperil.\nTrends Before the Pandemic\nEven before the pandemic, long-standing secular trends were threatening the industry. One was the\never-increasing cost of a college education, whose persistent rise in tuition and fees has been outpacing\ninflation for decades. Low productivity growth has been a primary driver of this phenomenon.\nClosely related has been the explosion of student debt. The more expensive education has become —\nand the less support the public sector has offered to students — the more they have had to borrow to\nfinance their education. Americans now owe more than $1.7 trillion in student loans, far outpacing\ncredit card debt and second only to mortgages in total borrowing.\nDemographics threaten the industry, too. The traditional college-age segment is actually in decline.\nThose enrolled in higher education institutions now tend to be older and have lower incomes than\nbefore. It’s something to marvel at: College education has become more expensive at a time when the\ncustomer base has become less able to afford it.\nTechnological advances, meanwhile, have brought forth increased competition to the traditional higher\ned sector. Low-cost, easily accessible online education represents a severe threat to an industry with\nhigh fixed costs. This is especially worrisome when, as we heard from one of our panelists today, the\nquality of online education as a complete substitute for in-person learning remains questionable.\n4\n\nThere were bright spots like health care. As the country ages and medical technology advances,\nuniversities with medical campuses attached have prospered. But for the most part, the trends were\ngrim.\nThe COVID-19 Effect\nAnd as we’ve learned today, COVID-19 has only served to strengthen those forces that are threatening\nthe higher education industry as we know it. Cost pressures are intensifying at campuses from coast to\ncoast. Online distance learning brought on by the pandemic may have only served to further undermine\nthe value proposition of expensive traditional institutions. And unlike in prior downturns, enrollment at\ncommunity colleges has actually fallen during the pandemic as people have had to juggle family and job\nresponsibilities under unprecedented strain.\nMore pain is, unfortunately, almost certainly on the way. My colleagues at the Philadelphia Fed, using\nhistorical data on how states responded to previous economic downturns and contemporaneous\nmeasures of the severity of the pandemic and its economic effects, have projected revenue shortfalls of\nbetween $70 billion and $115 billion over the coming five-year period across the sector. Our researchers\nforecast that 80 percent of all institutions will face revenue shortfalls, with HBCUs, public colleges, and\ninstitutions with fewer than 1,000 students facing the heaviest fiscal burdens.\nThe truth is, far from being the “unkindest cut,” state governments have shown little hesitance to cut\nspending on higher education. Nor are the cuts precisely aligned with revenue declines. To take a\nhypothetical situation: A fall of 10 percent in tax revenues could lead to a 15 percent slash in higher\neducation spending, for instance. Unlike K‒12 education or roads and bridges, higher ed makes an easy\ntarget.\nI recall vividly learning this firsthand when I was president of the University of Delaware (UD). A\npowerful state legislator had called me into this office in Dover to let me know our appropriation would\nbe slashed even though that would mean, by necessity, a hike in tuition. A little later on that same day, I\nsat in a public hearing while that very same legislator attacked me for … raising tuition.\nSo there’s your poli-sci lesson for the day.\n5\n\nA Call for Action\nAs we emerge from this pandemic, I want to call on federal and state governments — and American\nsociety — to recommit to public postsecondary education, which remains the indispensable tool for\neconomic and social mobility and to educating our citizenry. Higher education is, as I stated earlier, an\nindustry. But it is also a public good.\nI am not — and I stress not — calling for blank checks. Colleges and universities need to meet the public\nsector halfway. They must urgently bend the cost curve. For society to recommit to them, it is\nincumbent on them to change.\nI also want to stress that this commitment must extend beyond traditional four-year colleges — and\ntheir football programs. Many state legislators seem more concerned with sports than anything else in\neducation.\nThe country should be investing in the totality of post-high school training and education.\nNew Models\nIndeed, there are now many exciting alternatives to traditional four-year colleges or even community\ncolleges. Coming from a former university president, this probably sounds like Ronald McDonald\nadmonishing you to lay off the french fries. But the truth is that many Americans don’t need a\ntraditional four-year college degree to enjoy a prosperous life. What they need are the skills that will\npropel them into middle-class jobs. For my dad, my uncles, and my brother, that was pipefitting. And for\nmany, that’s still a great option. For others, it will be something else.\nMany skills today are gained through a variety of short-term programs that do not lead to degrees but\ncan provide marketable new skills. These courses can be as short as two months, and workers — many\nof whom are in their midcareer and are looking to retool, stand to benefit. (The quality of these\nprograms can vary widely, however.)\nAccording to a recent Georgetown University study, these can make a meaningful difference in\nenrollees’ careers: Certificates in engineering technologies can lead to high earnings, as do those in\nfields like information technology and legal studies. Indeed, the study found some certificates can yield\nearnings that rival those of bachelor’s degrees in other fields. My electrician happens to live in my\nneighborhood, and he owns his own business and makes a great living without a four-year degree.\n6\n\nShort-term credentials can be gained in many venues, from traditional community colleges, to private\nacademies like computer-coding boot camps. The training can be done both online and at brick-and-\nmortar institutions.\nOf course, even as we look for creative ways to employ short-term programs as an alternative to\ntraditional degrees, we must ensure equal opportunity to all types of degree and non-degree programs.\nWe must not allow for a two-tiered system of higher education to flourish, with low income and\nminority students funneled into experimental programs while facing barriers to obtaining traditional\ndegrees. There are also public‒private partnerships designed to provide pipelines of talent to the private\nsector. The way the latter works is that companies essentially outsource a portion of their employee\ntraining to outside vendors, using a “pay for success” model. That means the company reimburses the\nentity that paid for the training in the first place — say, the local publicly funded job board — if the new\nhire hits certain benchmarks, like staying on the job for six months. It can be an effective way to entice\ncorporations to hire from populations they may find too risky or for which they lack sufficient familiarity,\nparticularly those in underserved communities. The workers will benefit, of course, but so will the\ncompanies that will have access to an undertapped pool of talent.\nFour-Year Schools\nFor many others, a four-year degree is still going to be the best option. But these institutions require a\nradical overhaul.\nBegin by asking: What value proposition do universities offer? Fundamentally, they are offering\nsomething quite profound. Rather than a certain set of skills or a discrete body of facts, universities\ninstead are pitching the promise of critical skills to learn how to learn for a lifetime.\nA few years ago, I authored a paper examining the systems that universities use to deliver this\neducation.\nOn most campuses, I recounted, classes are scheduled three days a week for an hour each day, twice a\nweek for one-and-a-half hours, or once a week in three-hour blocks. Room assignments are optimized to\nfit these scheduled slots, and classes are scheduled to meet student demand — although often class\ntimes are more likely to reflect faculty preference. Classrooms are designed to meet the schedule, which\nin turn is derived from optimizing the use of classrooms.\n7\n\nIn sum, the entire system on a college campus is designed to optimize teaching, where teaching is\ndefined as being in a classroom, for example, twice a week for one-and-a-half hours at a time. Over the\ndecades, we have built optimized teaching factories.\nBut what if, I asked, rather than design teaching factories, universities instead focused on creating\nlearning-centric institutions? Institutions that are efficient — and by definition — affordable.\nIt could mean replacing vestigial general education requirements — which are too often in place to\nprotect privileged fiefdoms in various academic departments — with intelligently designed common\ncore programs like those in place at some of our country’s most prestigious universities and colleges.\nIt could mean the selective and intelligent use of technology to achieve economies of scale as Arizona\nState University, Georgia Tech, and others are doing with quite impressive results. But universities must\nkeep in mind that online education is a means, not an end in and of itself.\nIt could mean mergers and acquisitions. Here in Philadelphia, Saint Joseph’s University and the\nUniversity of the Sciences are proposing to merge, a move that will promote efficiency and bolster the\ncombined schools’ presence in health sciences, a major growth industry.\nIt could mean rethinking the structure of university faculty and contemplating, rather than simply\nloading up on teachers’ assistants, the use of full-time nontenured faculty to reduce labor costs.\nThe health-care industry is an interesting example: It has successfully reduced costs using nurse\npractitioners in the place of physicians for many routine tasks. It has also embraced telemedicine,\nparticularly during the pandemic.\nIt could — and should — mean all of the above, and much more that I haven’t even contemplated,\nbecause time is of the essence and the pressures are very real and only set to worsen.\nThere are also great opportunities to more closely integrate four-year and community colleges in ways\nthat promote efficiency and better serve students. Everyone in higher education knows that far too\nmany students, through no fault of their own, enter demanding institutions without adequate\npreparation.\nMany of these students have unfortunately attended high schools that left them ill prepared for college-\nlevel work or have had life challenges that have left them unprepared for the demands of a selective\n8\n\ncollege or university. That can be disastrous, because once a student falls behind academically, it’s very,\nvery difficult to catch up.\nAt UD, the Associate in Arts Program not only provides a pipeline of students into the university, but it\nalso makes sure they are poised to succeed once they get there.\nThe way the Associate in Arts Program works is this: UD courses are taught by UD faculty in small classes\nin Delaware Tech buildings throughout the state. (Delaware Tech is the state’s public community\ncollege.)\nStudents receive an associate’s degree in University Studies by earning credits in the core courses that\nare required of all undergraduates, and then, they transition to UD’s main campus to earn their\nbachelor’s degree. Most full-time students receive money from the state to cover their tuition,\ndemonstrating the potential for meaningful state support for well-designed programs. The program is\nhigh touch, with small class sizes and lots of interaction between faculty and students.\nI’m thrilled to report that 64 percent of students in the program graduate with their associate’s degree\nwithin three years — well above the national average of around 33 percent. Of those, 88 percent go\nonto the main campus at UD, and nearly 80 percent of those graduate with a bachelor’s degree.\nBecause the program is taught by UD faculty, the transition from an associate’s to bachelor’s degree\nbecomes something approaching seamless. A member of the English faculty who is teaching in the\nAssociate in Arts Program knows exactly what her students are prepared for once they enter an English\ncourse on the main campus.\nWhy We Learn\nYou know, a long time ago, when people used to ask me what they should study, I would tell them to\nfollow their passion. I realize now that this was precisely the wrong answer.\nNow I say, pick a subject you find really difficult. And study that.\nBecause ultimately, the purpose of education is not simply to learn what you need to know, but more\nfundamentally how to think. That’s just as true for somebody earning an electrical engineering\ncertificate as it is for another person pursuing a philosophy doctorate.\n9\n\nIt’s also true for me: I benefited from a great education in engineering and economics at the University\nof Pennsylvania, and now I’m a central banker, formulating monetary policy. My education didn’t just\nteach me how to build roads and bridges, it taught me how to reason.\nA society where people know how to reason — how to think — strikes me as one that is bound to be a\nsuccessful one. Higher education’s value is not just the economic boost it provides to our country,\nthough that is incredibly important. Its value also lies in teaching our fellow Americans how to think.\nSo again, thank you everyone for being here today. And now I’m happy to take a few questions.\n10",

    "text": "An Economic Outlook\nJewish Business Network Luncheon\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nPhiladelphia, PA\nFebruary 13, 2019\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nAn Economic Outlook\nJewish Business Network Luncheon\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nPhiladelphia, PA\nFebruary 13, 2019\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood afternoon, welcome, and shalom. It’s a pleasure to have everyone here. Given the\nunpredictability of February weather in Philadelphia, it’s an even bigger pleasure to have such a\nshort commute — so we’re particularly happy to be hosting you today.\nI’m going to start this afternoon with an economic outlook — where we are, where we’re likely\nheaded, and what I’m watching as we make our way there — and then discuss something that’s a\nfocus of ours here at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia: the labor market, skills, and the\nfuture of work.\nBefore I start, let me issue the standard disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone\nand do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\nGrowth\nStarting with GDP, I see growth a bit above 2 percent for this year, returning to trend of around 2\npercent some time in 2020. While some may view that growth rate as disappointing, it reflects\nstructural, slow-moving forces — like demographics, muted growth in the labor force, and lower\nproductivity growth — rather than any temporary headwind. So I still see the outlook as\npositive: The U.S. economy continues to grow in what is on pace to be the longest economic\nexpansion in our history.\nI should also deliver the caveat that those projections are for the year as a whole. I expect Q1 of\nthis year to come in closer to 1.5 percent; there are multiple contributing factors here, not least\nbeing that first quarters have seen low or negative growth for several years running, enough to\nhave essentially become the norm. That should balance out as growth picks up in the following\nquarters.\n1\n\nPCE remains the primary driver of real GDP growth, and household spending continues at a\nstrong, sustained pace.\nBusinesses, on the other hand, have reported an increase in uncertainty and a decrease in\nconfidence. Coupled with tighter financial conditions, the investment outlook is not quite as rosy\nas last year. It’s certainly not a dire one, but the specter of uncertainty does cast a shadow, and\nthe ambiguity of the current climate appears to be having a dampening effect.\nI am also monitoring international influences, including the outlook for growth abroad and trade\ndevelopments.\nOn balance, the potential risks tilt very slightly to the downside, but I emphasize the word\n“slight.” It’s a gradient measured by a protractor rather than one apparent to the naked eye.\nOverall, the economy remains in good shape.\nEmployment\nOne clear example is the continued strength of the labor market. Employment data continue to\nshow remarkable health and, in fact, have surprised many of the experts. Job creation continues\nat a strong pace, quits are still high, and the slight upticks in the unemployment rate over the past\ncouple of months reflect more people coming off the sidelines to join the labor market.\nIn fact, the primary concern we’re hearing anecdotally is not the lack of jobs but the dearth of\nskilled workers.\nInflation\nInflation is running around our preferred 2 percent target. For several years, it was persistently\nlow, finally moving up to our goal last year. I see inflation running slightly higher than 2 percent\nfor this year and next.\nAs Fed watchers well know, when we say our goal is 2 percent inflation, we don’t mean the\nsweet spot is exactly 2 percent all the time; it’s our medium-term average. While I would be\nconcerned if it rose significantly above that marker, running slightly above, as I predict we will\nthis year and next, is not something that provokes concern, particularly after a sustained period\nof underperformance.\n2\n\nImportantly, I’m focused on core inflation, which strips out volatile elements like food and\nenergy, giving a better understanding of the fundamentals. Headline inflation is likely to suffer\nwith fluctuations in energy prices, but those are transient and do not have a marked effect on the\nunderlying measure.\nWhat I’m watching most closely is inflation’s trajectory: what direction it’s headed and how fast.\nRight now, we’re not seeing significant upward pressure, and it’s not on an accelerated path; if\nanything, it’s edging slightly downward. If that scenario changes, the data will guide my views.\nRates\nWith a temperate climate for inflation; continued strength in the labor market; very slight\ndownside risks; solid, but moderate growth projections for the next couple of years; and, of\ncourse, a climate of uncertainty, I continue to be in wait-and-see mode. Or, to use the word of the\nmoment, I see patience as a virtue. My own view is that one rate hike for 2019 and one for 2020\nare appropriate.\nAs ever, that’s my current stance, and my views will be guided by data as they come in and\nevents as they unfold. I know some people wish that Fed officials would retire the metaphorical\npencil we use in our forecasts and be more forceful in our estimates. And I’m happy to use a pen\n… so long as it’s filled with erasable ink. We have to make policy decisions in context, and I’ve\nshared my outlook given the landscape on February 13, 2019. If we had a perfectly functioning\ncrystal ball, those predictions would be infallible – and I’d be playing the lottery a lot more.\nSkills and the Workforce\nOf course, while we can’t prognosticate with absolute certainty, we can make educated guesses\nabout a host of issues.\nOne that’s of particular interest here at the Philadelphia Fed is the future of work, and how cities\nand regions across the country are preparing for the changes that are already well underway.\nThere have been two discussions about the labor market that have taken center stage of late, the\nfirst being the skills shortage and the difficulty employers report in finding qualified workers.\nThe other is the effect of artificial intelligence and automation on the current and future\nemployment landscape. The two obviously go hand in hand.\n3\n\nWhile both have received an abundance of attention, the discussions are decidedly nuanced, and\nit’s important to understand both the risks and the opportunities these issues present.\nThe opportunity is that we can see change coming and not only prepare for it, but rise to meet it.\nThis is in the economic interests of both individual businesses and the cities and regions in which\nthey operate. The risk, of course, is in ignoring the change and failing to prepare for it.\nAutomation is coming; in fact, it’s already here. But much of the popular conversation veers\nfrom practicalities. Rather than look at the jobs that have already been, or are on the precipice of\nbeing, automated, speculation runs to the entirety of human capabilities somehow being\nmechanized.\nWhat the current trend in automation has actually done is thrown into stark relief the importance\nof uniquely human attributes, what we tend to refer to as “soft skills.” These are as in demand\namong employers as technical skills, if not more so.\nThe truth is that the scope of artificial intelligence is limited to our input; that is, machines are\nonly as smart as we make them. The important conversation, in my view, is not whether robots\nmay someday write the great American novel but what the current capabilities of automation\nmean for the people in our workforce now and how it will shape the near future.\nWe recently published research on the likely effect of automation, both within the Federal\nReserve’s Third District and in the U.S. We not only identified jobs that are in danger of\nautomating, we assigned degrees of likelihood to their eventual demise. We also looked at who’s\ndoing those jobs, who would be hardest hit, and whether and where new jobs might be created.\nWe concluded that almost one in five jobs in our District have a 95 percent or better chance of\nbecoming automated and that the people doing them are some of the economy’s most vulnerable\nworkers. While some people will be absorbed into new jobs, others won’t.\nInstead of leaving the disruption of various industries to fate, we have an opportunity to think\nabout how to train the workers whose jobs will likely disappear to do jobs that are more secure\nfrom the ones that have yet to be created to the ones that are standing empty right now.\n4\n\nAs I mentioned, one of the most frequent complaints we’ve heard from business is the shortage\nof skilled workers. While there has been some debate about the skills shortage, our research\ncertainly points to a gap and the JOLTS data in particular support it.\nWe also have research underway. Our economists took a very large data set — more than 90\npercent of all online postings — to analyze what factors impact the length of time a job stays\nopen or, in their parlance, the “time to fill.” They looked over a two-year span, from 2015 to\n2017, for the 50 largest metropolitan statistical areas to see, among other things, what factors\ninfluenced the time-to-fill stretch and whether requirements for certain levels of experience and\neducational attainment affect that metric.\nTheir preliminary findings confirm what we’ve been hearing anecdotally and what we’ve seen in\nother research — that there is a gap between the skills employers want and need and those in the\navailable workforce.\nThey found that the easiest jobs to fill are those that are generally routine, manual positions —\nthe same ones that are at the highest risk of automation.\nThe most difficult to fill are those that require specific cognitive, and uniquely human, skills:\nteachers, for instance, or psychologists.\nThe more skill required, the longer a job takes to fill; likewise, the higher the bar for educational\nattainment and years’ experience, the more time the position will remain open.\nWhile the research is as yet unpublished, the early findings pose questions for the labor market.\nShould, for instance, employers consider hiring candidates who are good, rather than ideal, and\nfocus on in-house training to make up the difference? Considering the combined losses\nassociated with unfilled positions and the expense of a candidate search, it is likely more cost-\neffective for many organizations.\nThis is something we’ve been discussing with employers across the region. In fact, the\nPhiladelphia Fed has formed a partnership with Philadelphia Works, Social Finance, and a local\ncompany to change the way we prepare the local workforce for the future of work. The pilot is a\nunique public-private partnership, in which the public sector will provide customized training\nand the employer will repay the cost of that training once the outcomes are realized.\n5\n\nThe reality of the tight labor market means that employers have to start thinking creatively and\nlong term about how they’re going to address the gap between the skills they want and need and\nthose available in the labor pool. What makes this project stand out is just that: The employer\nisn’t funding it through their foundation; it’s coming right out of the HR budget. It’s a business\ndecision. And not only will they get an agile, trained workforce, but it adds to the city’s labor\npool overall.\nIt’s my hope that more businesses in the region — and across the country — will begin to take\nanother look at how they’re approaching training and hiring. This will be especially important as\nthe baby boom generation continues its march into retirement and the importance of succession\nplanning takes on new urgency across the professional spectrum.\nConclusion\nTo sum up: The economy continues to do well. I continue to be happily patient in my outlook on\nraising rates and will monitor the data as they come in. And importantly, I hope that this point in\nthe labor market’s history will prove to be the catalyst for employers to reconsider their approach\nto training, and what role they can play in arming people with the skills both employers and\nemployees need.\nThank you.\n6",

    "text": "Inflation: What Caused It and\nWhat to Do About It\nGreater Vineland Chamber of Commerce\nVineland, NJ\nOctober 20, 2022\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nInflation: What Caused It and What to Do About It\nGreater Vineland Chamber of Commerce\nVineland, NJ\nOctober 20, 2022\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nHello! It’s great to be back in Vineland. The last time I was here three years ago, I began my talk by\nposing an extraordinarily controversial question: Is this the dandelion capital or egg capital of the\ncountry? Given the controversy this engendered, I think it’s better if I stick to safer subjects this time:\nthe country’s economic outlook, as well as my thinking on monetary policy. Then we can get to our\nQ&A, but please, nothing about dandelions or eggs.\nI also said something else three years ago: my standard Fed disclaimer. That, I do intend to repeat: The\nviews I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal\nOpen Market Committee or in the Federal Reserve System.\nInflation\nAs you all know, inflation is far too high. The Federal Reserve’s long-range target is 2 percent annualized\ninflation — and annualized inflation came in at 8.2 percent in September. Prices were up 0.4 percent in\nSeptember, from just a month before.\nThis is a period of tremendous hardship for Americans, particularly those with low or moderate income.\nWe’re seeing a huge demand at food banks — and it’s coming, in many cases, from people who are\nworking full-time. Our contacts in the banking industry are telling us that more families are taking on\nunsecured debt to meet daily expenses.\nInflation is widespread throughout the economy. While price hikes were limited initially to just a few\nitems like used cars, we’re now experiencing rapid rises in prices on everything from new vehicles and\ndishwashers to life’s staples, like food, gasoline, and rent. Health-care inflation continues to be\ntroublesome, too, and, unfortunately, shows no signs of abating. In fact, I expect hefty rises in health-\n1\n\ncare premiums next year as health-care systems renegotiate reimbursements with their insurers after\nsuffering large losses this year.\nBecause of high inflation, household wealth is declining. That’s partially because purchasing power is\ndecreasing and Americans are spending their savings. It’s also because the stock market, where tens of\nmillions of Americans stash hefty portions of their retirement savings, is down on inflation fears and rate\nhikes. All of this is making it harder for Americans to save and to plan for retirement.\nMore broadly, we can’t have a well-functioning economy with high inflation, particularly if high inflation\nexpectations get embedded. To make the economy as efficient as we can in the long run, we have to get\non top of inflation.\nAnd that is precisely what the Federal Reserve is doing. Inflation is a problem that must be solved. We\nneed to see continued movement toward 2 percent core inflation. We also need to pay attention to the\ndistribution of inflation, making sure it’s falling across a wide spectrum of goods and services throughout\nthe economy.\nTo solve our inflation problem, we need to understand what has caused it. In this case, there is no\nsingular cause. It has instead been a confluence of events, essentially, a “perfect storm.”\nA global pandemic, a war in Europe, and, yes, fiscal and monetary policy decisions have combined to\nlimit supply and boost demand. The result has been inflation running at 40-year highs.\nLet’s begin with constraints on supply.\nThe events of the last few years have revealed the extraordinary fragility of global supply chains. If one\nship, stuck in one canal, could ground global logistics to a halt for days, imagine the effect of a multiyear\nglobal pandemic.\nIn fact, we don’t need to imagine it: COVID-19 lockdowns have badly damaged supply chains.\nSemiconductors, present in everything from automobiles to washing machines, have been in short\nsupply for the better part of three years as factories have shuttered for extended periods and\ninternational ports have clogged. Issues here persist, with China — “the world’s factory” — continuing\nto pursue a Zero-COVID policy. Even today, China continues to impose lockdowns, though there is some\nspeculation that these policies may now begin to be relaxed with Xi Jinping having secured a third term\nas Chinese president.\n2\n\nRussia’s tragic, horrific invasion of Ukraine further choked supply.\nShipments of grain and fertilizer fell, pushing up food prices. So did Russia’s energy exports. Europe and\nthe U.K. are in the middle of a full-blown energy crisis. Gasoline prices spiked here, fell a bit, and are\nnow back up again. The Saudis have further compounded our problems by announcing they will cut\nproduction, even in the face of elevated prices.\nCertain U.S. government policies have contributed to our supply-side issues. While I remain neutral on\nthe overall wisdom of each of these policies, their effect on supply is undeniable. The federal\ngovernment applies tariffs on everything from Chinese-made televisions to Canadian lumber, spiking\nprices. A more than two-year pause in legal immigration has contributed to labor shortages — we have\nabout 2 ½ million fewer workers than we would have had, had we remained on trend.\nAnd housing costs are up — though moderating slightly in recent months — not just because of pricier\nmaterials and labor, but also because we are not building enough houses to keep up with demand. This\nis often a result of local government policies, like restrictive zoning, that stymie construction.\nAll of these supply constraints have been accompanied by extraordinarily robust demand. For one, our\nlabor market remains hot. That means Americans are earning paychecks, even if their relative value is\ndeclining because of inflation. Employment in manufacturing, financial services, and other industries has\nlong since recovered from the pandemic-induced recession, and now pent-up demand within the leisure\nand hospitality industry is driving employment growth as well.\nWith some large employers like Comcast calling workers back into the office three days a week last\nmonth, I think we are starting to see a significant recovery in central business districts. Employment has\nbeen particularly down in those areas, as restaurants, bars, dry cleaners, and local shops have been\nbereft of office workers for more than two years. But I must say, Center City Philadelphia is noticeably\nmore vibrant now than it was just a couple of months ago.\nThe national unemployment rate is at a very robust 3.5 percent. In New Jersey, the unemployment rate\nis 4 percent. The national rate is actually lower than what economists generally consider to be the\nnatural unemployment rate. And indeed, there are still more job openings than there are available\nworkers.\n3\n\nNot surprisingly, this has resulted in significant upward pressure on wages. In many regions, smaller\nemployers with thin margins are having a hard time filling entry-level positions. We’ve heard from\ncommunity bankers that they can’t compete with larger banks for jobs like tellers. Near us, on the Jersey\nShore, local businesses had a great summer in terms of sales, but they had a very hard time staying\nstaffed. That’s partially because of higher salary demands but also because housing has become so\nexpensive in that area that workers can’t afford to live there.\nThe labor force participation rate is also ticking up, a particularly welcome trend. Still, prime age women\nlag prime age men in workforce participation. To tackle that, we need to begin to address the cost of\nchildcare, which has pushed far too many women out of work.\nFiscal policy has added to demand. The federal government pumped around $6 trillion into American\nhouseholds during the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, the amount of fiscal support\nprovided by the federal government was significantly larger than the aggregate decline in GDP triggered\nby the pandemic in the first place.\nThe government’s aid was dispersed in a largely untargeted fashion. Mortgage forbearance and student\nloan forbearance — both offered to any borrowers, no questions asked, and, in the case of student\nloans, applied automatically — and direct stimulus payments to tens of millions of households were\nboons to Americans’ bank accounts. Importantly, they were policy decisions taken during a frightening\nand uncertain time. But they have certainly contributed to the high levels of demand we are still seeing.\nMonetary Policy\nAnd finally, expansive monetary policy — that’s us — kept the cost of capital low for long.\nThroughout most of the COVID-19 pandemic, we kept rates near zero and enacted a major asset-buying\nprogram. These policies stoked demand, which they were designed to do.\nAs a central bank, the Federal Reserve can do little to affect the supply constraints pushing up inflation.\nAnd as I have indicated, those problems, unfortunately, will take time to resolve.\nBut the Federal Reserve can absolutely affect demand, and that is what we are doing. We want to see\ninflation coming down steadily and consistently, and we also want to see it abating across a wide array\nof goods and services. The goal is to adjust conditions so that demand better matches supply.\n4\n\nWe have two primary tools for implementing monetary policy: the federal funds rate — usually just\nthought of as interest rates — and our balance sheet.\nSince last fall, we have been tightening financial conditions. That process, at least as the market\ninterpreted it, started last September, even before we began to move the federal funds rate or taper\nour asset purchases. Instead, simply announcing that we would soon begin to taper our asset purchases\ncaused two-year Treasury yields to rise.\nThe taper began in earnest last November and is now complete. In fact, we are now reducing our\nbalance sheet. We are shedding $60 billion in Treasuries and $35 billion in agency debt and mortgage-\nbacked securities each month. Which is to say, we are removing a significant amount of financial\naccommodation quite rapidly.\nWe have also raised the federal funds rate 300 basis points since the start of 2022. That means the Fed\nis actively trying to slow the economy. But we are going to keep raising rates for a while. Given our\nfrankly disappointing lack of progress on curtailing inflation, I expect we will be well above 4 percent by\nthe end of the year.\nSometime next year, we are going to stop hiking rates. At that point, I think we should hold at a\nrestrictive rate for a while to let monetary policy do its work. It will take a while for the higher cost of\ncapital to work its way through the economy.\nAfter that, if we have to, we can tighten further, based on the data. But we should let the system work\nitself out. And we also need to recognize that this will take time: Inflation is known to shoot up like a\nrocket and then come down like a feather.\nAbove all, I want to stress that we must remain data dependent and flexible on policy. What we really\nneed to see is a sustained decline in a number of inflation indicators before we let up on tightening\nmonetary policy.\nAnd again, we need to make sure inflation expectations don’t become unanchored. One hopeful sign is\nthat our banker contacts have been telling us that many customers are opting for adjustable-rate\nmortgages. Another lender, who issues mortgages for properties at the Jersey Shore, told us that even\nwealthier buyers are starting to balk and are waiting for rates to come down before buying a new home.\n5\n\nThat’s good news because it means borrowers expect inflation — and rates — to come down in the\nrelatively near future.\nSo, what does all this mean for the economy? I expect that economic growth will moderate this year as\nboth inflation and tightening financial conditions begin to crimp consumption. Overall, I forecast flat\nGDP growth for 2022, 1.5 percent growth in 2023, and around 2 percent growth in 2024.\nInflation will come down, but it will take some time to get to our target. I expect PCE inflation to come in\nat around 6 percent in 2022, around 4 percent next year, and 2.5 percent in 2024.\nTurning to the job market, the unemployment rate should peak next year at 4.5 percent as financial\nconditions bite. It should then fall to 4 percent in 2024, which suggests that even as we tighten\nmonetary policy, labor markets will stay quite healthy.\nIn sum, the Federal Reserve is taking on inflation from a position of relative economic strength. Our goal\nof stable prices and maximum employment is achievable, and our resolve is strong.\nThank you very much for having me. Let’s get to your questions.\n6",

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood morning and welcome! Thank you so much for joining us today for this absolutely crucial series of\ndiscussions. And, by the way, it was great to be introduced by my old friend Art and to see him after so\nlong … well, sort of “see” him.\nAs you probably have noticed, we’re meeting under unorthodox circumstances today. But some things\nnever change. One of those is my standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do\nnot necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or in the Federal\nReserve System.\nOur Unequal Economy\nWe’re gathered here today to discuss a topic that simply could not be more urgent: building an\nequitable workforce recovery.\nBefore the COVID-19 pandemic struck, the U.S. economy was, in many respects, very healthy.\nUnemployment was low, and GDP growth was humming along steadily. But even then, stresses were\nmounting, inequality was widening, and racial disparities dating back to the founding of our country\npersisted. That has been painfully obvious here in Philadelphia, America’s poorest big city and its largest\nplurality-Black major city.\nEven before the COVID-19 crisis, racial minorities – particularly Black Americans – had higher\nunemployment rates, lower wealth, and poorer health outcomes than White Americans. That was just\nas true across the country as it was here in Philadelphia.\n1\n\nAnd just as the virus itself attacks those with preexisting conditions most viciously, the economic effect\nof COVID-19 has been to further accentuate the preexisting conditions that existed in the American\neconomy even before the crisis.\nThe Philadelphia Fed has been conducting extensive research into the economic effects of the\npandemic. The results have been sobering ― if depressingly predictable.\nOur researchers have found that those who have lost their jobs are disproportionately Black and Latino,\ndisproportionately younger, and less likely to have a college degree than other workers.\nAnd even among those who have kept their jobs during this period, those same historically\ndisadvantaged groups are also more likely to work in fields that may put them in harm’s way. Our\nresearchers have also found that workers of color disproportionately hold jobs that one cannot perform\nfrom home, for instance.\nIt’s often said that our current circumstances are the new normal. I refuse to accept that ― a raging\npandemic that is displacing millions of workers and killing around 1,000 Americans a day is anything but\nnormal.\nBut as we begin to map out what our recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic is going to look like, I also\nwant to make sure that we don’t simply return to the old normal. We need to keep laser focused on\nbuilding a better normal ― one in which growth is shared more equitably and all Americans have an\nopportunity to participate fully in the economy.\nPathways Forward\nSo, how do we do that?\nGiven that I am a Fed president, you probably guessed that I might say monetary policy. And I do think\nthat’s part of the solution. That’s why I’m pleased that, in late August, following a nearly two-year\nreview, the Fed announced a shift in our approach to fulfill our dual mandate of providing for maximum\nemployment and stable prices.\nNo longer will we head off higher inflation by preemptively raising interest rates before we have\nachieved full employment. Moreover, after long periods of sub-2 percent inflation (as we now find\nourselves in), we will accept periods of above-2 percent inflation. Tolerating the risk of slightly higher\ninflation, in our view, is worth it if it helps us achieve our employment goals. That’s important because\n2\n\none of the salutary trends of the pre-COVID economy was that economic gains, at least on a limited\nbasis, were finally being enjoyed by lower-wage workers, a disproportionate percentage of whom are\nracial minorities. We still had a very, very long way to go, of course. But it’s clear that we must achieve\nfull employment to have any hope of beginning to narrow the yawning gaps that bedevil our society.\nAt the local level, we also need to do a better job of transitioning workers into careers that offer solid\npay and strong future prospects. Here at the Philadelphia Fed, we’ve been thinking hard about how to\nget workers into what we call opportunity occupations ― that is, jobs that pay the median wage or\nbetter, and that don’t require a college degree.\nI’d like to share the results of just one study we’ve done because I think the results are truly exciting.\nThe study began when Philadelphia Fed researchers, in partnership with the Cleveland Fed, asked a\nquestion: How do we transition workers now in jobs into stable, higher-wage positions?\nThey came up with an ingenious idea: They looked at the skill sets of people who are holding those jobs\nand are most at risk of disappearing. They then matched those skills to jobs that would pay at least 10\npercent more than their current wage and that don’t require a traditional four-year degree.\nThe findings were incredibly encouraging. Looking at 33 metro areas nationwide, they found that nearly\nhalf of lower-wage employment can be paired with at least one higher-paying occupation requiring\nsimilar skills. For transitions connecting the most similar occupations identified in the study, the pay\ndifferences are significant, with an average bump in wages of almost $15,000 — a 49 percent increase in\nsalary.\nThe opportunities for public‒private partnerships to initiate these kinds of transitions are obvious, and\nI’m proud to say that the Philadelphia Fed helped launch one with Comcast and Philadelphia Works,\nwhich you will hear more about later today.\nThe workers themselves will benefit from these transitions, of course, but so will the employers, who\nwill have access to a vast, untapped pool of human capital. All too often, incredible talent is being\noverlooked because employers are hiring for credentials, like a four-year college degree, over skills. And\nyes, I realize there is irony in a former college president saying this.\nThere are, of course, myriad other barriers to break down. Structural impediments like a lack of access\nto childcare ― another problem only heightened by the pandemic ― or an inability to access broadband\n3\n\nInternet stand in the way of far too many of our fellow Americans reaching their full economic potential.\nWe need to think hard about how to tear down those walls.\nThere are also large segments of our economy that are starved for capital. Minority-owned small\nbusinesses, for instance, received far fewer emergency loans through the Paycheck Protection Program,\ninitiated at the start of the crisis, than White-owned small businesses. This happened in many cases\nbecause those minority-owned enterprises lacked relationships with banks. We need to think hard\nabout ways to break down those barriers as well.\nBuilding an equitable workforce recovery is not just ― in my view ― a moral necessity, but an economic\none as well. The International Monetary Fund has found that when an additional 1 percent of income\ngoes to the top 20 percent of income earners, GDP falls. But when the same gains are made by the\nbottom 20 percent, GDP rises.\nThat makes sense, of course: Those who earn less money are likely to spend it, whereas high earners\nsave. That’s crucial because consumer spending accounts for about 70 percent of our country’s total\nGDP. And so, the basic idea is this: Get money into the hands of people most likely to spend it, and you’ll\nsee a multiplier effect throughout the broader economy. And that’s why ensuring an equitable recovery\nfrom the COVID-19 crisis is critical in making sure the next expansion is not only fair ― but also strong\nand durable.\nToday, we are excited to officially launch our Equitable Workforce Recovery strategy. As many of you\nknow, three years ago, the Philadelphia Fed launched the Economic Growth & Mobility Project to create\npathways to opportunity across the Third District. Our goal? Leverage our partnerships throughout the\nDistrict to bring research into action. Now, as we look to the country’s coming economic recovery, we\nintend to double down on our work to create equitable growth that benefits all.\nOver the course of the next year, we will be focusing on the issues I outlined here: investing in small\nbusinesses, creating upward mobility for workers, and addressing structural barriers like the digital\ndivide and access to childcare. We are looking forward to continued partnerships across the District\nthrough our Research in Action Labs and conversations like the ones we are having today.\nOur recent research on automation has emphasized the importance of this moment to invest in\nworkers. Many jobs will not be coming back, and preparing workers for the jobs of the future is critical\nto our economic health and recovery. This is why I am excited about the panel that you will hear from\n4\n\nnext, which could not be timelier. The topic of this discussion will be Building the Jobs of the Future, and\nwe are delighted to be joined by the moderator of this discussion, Uva Coles.\nUva is an expert on issues of workforce diversity and inclusion. She is the founder, president, and CEO of\nInclusiva, LLC, a boutique consulting firm specializing in the development of inclusive workforce\nstrategies. Uva was formerly the assistant vice president of civic and global engagement at Widener\nUniversity in Chester, PA. We will also hear from business leaders on how they are tackling issues of\nequity and opportunity in their respective workplaces.\nSo, without further ado, please welcome Uva Coles and the rest of our esteemed panelists. Thank you.\n5",

    "text": "Welcoming Address\nThe Philadelphia Fed Policy Forum\nThe College of Physicians of Philadelphia\nDecember 1, 2017\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nWelcoming Remarks\nThe Philadelphia Fed Policy Forum\nThe College of Physicians of Philadelphia\nPhiladelphia, PA\nDecember 1, 2017\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood morning and welcome. I am pleased to be here at the 12th Philadelphia Fed Policy Forum,\nmy second since joining the Bank as president and CEO in 2015. I am excited to continue the\nbiennial tradition that brings together some of the world’s most renowned economic thought\nleaders to discuss emerging research and its implications for economic policy.\nThis year, we’ve shifted locations. While normally this event is held at the Philadelphia Fed, we\nhave brought it here to the College of Physicians of Philadelphia to accommodate an expanded\naudience for this year’s forum.\nWhile you are here, I encourage you to visit the Mütter Museum. The College of Physicians has\ngraciously offered free entrance today to its museum of medical history to all our attendees. If\nyou have not been, it’s really a can’t-miss, quintessential Philadelphia experience. I must say,\nthe Philadelphia Fed’s headquarters has many charms, but we really can’t compete with the\nSoap Lady or Albert Einstein’s brain.\nBefore I begin, let me give the standard disclaimer: The views I express today are mine alone\nand do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System, including my\ncolleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n1\n\nPromoting Inclusive Economic Growth\nThe shift for the Policy Forum is more than just geographic. This year, our theme is People,\nPlace, Prosperity: Revitalizing Our Cities. This may seem off-topic for the Fed, from a focus on\nmonetary policy and interest rates, to a focus on how the economy can develop in a way that\nreduces poverty and inequality. But it really isn’t. It’s merely a different way of looking at the\nsame issues. And the high turnout for this event really speaks to the level of interest among\nyou, one of our key audiences, to find ways to better understand and address these issues.\nThe Fed has a dual mandate: price stability and maximum employment. When you think about\nwhat that means, our mission is really about creating an environment that promotes economic\ngrowth that is sustainable in the long term and that provides economic opportunity for\neveryone. That second goal — economic opportunity — means we want growth that is inclusive\nand accessible across all income groups and communities.\nThat’s because when we talk about the economy, we are really talking about people. People\nacquiring the right skills to find stable, family-sustaining jobs. People getting the best education\nfor their children so that they can succeed. And it’s about the neighborhoods where people live\nand about the best way to ensure that their communities thrive.\nThat’s where the Fed’s community development function comes in, something that is near and\ndear to my heart.\nFor the past year, we at the Philadelphia Fed have been working on our Economic Growth &\nMobility Project, or EGMP. This new initiative looks for practical applications for research in the\narea of inclusive economic growth. For instance, the Philadelphia Fed is involved in efforts in\nnortheastern Pennsylvania to create an equitable transit system. We have provided regional-\nfocused research and convened stakeholders to start the process of devising a transit system in\nthe Scranton area that gets people to jobs and the other places they need to go.\nEGMP is about looking at the economy as a whole, looking beyond the data. Which isn’t to say\nnumbers and data aren’t important. I am an engineer by training, so believe me when I say I\nlove numbers. But numbers don’t tell the whole story. Overall, the U.S. economy is doing pretty\n2\n\nwell. Real GDP grew at a strong annual rate of 3 percent or better in the second and third\nquarters of this year. The unemployment rate, at 4.1 percent in October, is at the lowest since\nthe year 2000. But when we look across the country, there are people and places that don’t\nshare in that good fortune.\nRevitalizing Our Cities\nIt is fitting that we host you here in the City of Philadelphia. According to a recent study by The\nPew Charitable Trusts, the city has the highest percentage of residents living in deep poverty.1\nThe region’s poor are concentrated mainly in the city rather than in the counties that surround\nit. Philadelphia has only 26 percent of the region’s residents, but it is home to 51 percent of the\npoor.2 So, this is a good place to be having a discussion about revitalizing cities. Philadelphia\nmay have the dubious distinction as the “poorest,” but it is by no means alone in the problems\nit faces or in its aspirations for the future.\nI travel frequently around the Third Federal Reserve District — which comprises eastern\nPennsylvania, southern New Jersey, and Delaware — and my monetary policy work takes me all\nover the world. These firsthand experiences really frame how I look at today’s agenda. Because\neverywhere I go, I meet people who are grappling with the same questions at the intersection\nof people, place, and prosperity. How do we build wealth in our communities without\ndisplacing residents? How do we plan for the coming technological innovations and make sure\nworkers have the requisite skills to succeed? How do we promote not just economic growth but\nequitable growth for all? These are the questions we’ll be exploring here today.\nAs always with the Policy Forum, we are fortunate to have a truly all-star lineup to lead our\ndiscussion.\n1 The Pew Charitable Trusts, Philadelphia’s Poor: Who they are, where they live, and how that has changed, The\nPew Charitable Trusts (2017).\n2 The Pew Charitable Trusts.\n3\n\nResearch Focusing on People, Place, and Prosperity\nFor those of you who have been with us before, the structure of this year’s event will be a bit\ndifferent. We’ll be opening with two academic panels. First, Gilles Duranton of the Wharton\nSchool of the University of Pennsylvania, Edward Glaeser of Harvard University, and Henry\nOverman of the London School of Economics will kick us off with a presentation of research\nfocusing on place — specifically, on urban growth and revitalization. Gerald Carlino,\nPhiladelphia Fed emeritus economist, will moderate.\nSecond, we will focus on people by exploring the link between education and economic\nmobility. This panel will feature Will Dobbie of Princeton University and a visiting scholar at the\nPhiladelphia Fed and Ingrid Gould Ellen of New York University. Phoebe Haddon, chancellor of\nRutgers University–Camden and a member of the Philadelphia Fed’s board of directors, will\nmoderate.\nLast, but not least, John Fry, president of Drexel University and a member of the Philadelphia\nFed’s Economic and Community Advisory Council, will introduce our last session that will focus\non the connection between people and place and how we promote prosperity. Michael Nutter,\nformer mayor of Philadelphia and a member of our Economic and Community Advisory Council,\nwill join Dennis Lower of Cortex Innovation Community in St. Louis in a discussion. Amy Liu,\ndirector of the Brookings Institution’s Metropolitan Policy Program, will moderate.\nThe speakers are not only some of the most prominent scholars in their fields, but you may\nhave noticed that some of them are among the Philadelphia Fed’s most valued partners. Their\nparticipation should tell you how seriously we take these issues.\nI also want to note that the shift in the Policy Forum is the result of the leadership of Mike\nDotsey, the Philadelphia Fed’s director of research. Mike wanted to use the event as a platform\nfor applying the same high-level, rigorous discussion of research that has always been the\nhallmark of the Policy Forum to advance the goals of the EGMP. I’d like to applaud Mike and his\nteam for their hard work in organizing this event. And I’d also like to give a special shout out to\n4\n\nTheresa Singleton and her staff, who lead the Philadelphia Fed’s community development\nefforts and the work of the EGMP.\nA special thank you as well to the members of our board, advisory councils, and our visiting\nscholars who are with us today. Will, Phoebe, John, and Mike, thank you for joining us. We are\nso grateful for your participation as leaders who care deeply about the subjects we’ll examine\nduring this forum.\nDuring the day, there will be many opportunities for you, our guests, to ask questions and\nengage with our speakers and with each other. As you can see, audience participation is written\ninto the agenda. I look forward to the discussions you’ll have here, and I thank you for being a\npart of this year’s event. If you happen to use Twitter, please join the conversation using the\nhashtag #PhilFedForum.\nA 230-year-old medical college may not seem an apt location for this policy forum. But the\nmission statement of this august establishment reads “to advance the science of medicine and\nto thereby lessen human misery.” It is that same sense of purpose and concern for humankind\nthat bring us together today to address some of our society’s biggest challenges.\nThank you. And, remember, if you have time, Einstein’s brain.\n5",

Harker today are my own and not\nnecessarily those of the\nFederal Reserve System or\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nthe Federal Open Market\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia Committee (FOMC).\n\n“Fed 101”: A Broad Look at the Federal Reserve and Its Role\nVillanova School of Business\nVillanova, PA\nApril 14, 2025\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood afternoon. It is an honor and a pleasure to be here.\nThank you, Adam, for that wonderful introduction.\nAnd thank you, as well, to Dr. Mary Kelly for the invitation to speak this evening.\nThis is the second year in a row that I’ve been asked to come out to Villanova and\nspeak and I cannot say how much I appreciated the return invite. As president and CEO\nof the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, I get to speak before and meet with a\ntremendous variety of people. And I'm lucky that includes getting back to my roots in\nacademia — as president of the University of Delaware, and before that as dean and\nprofessor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania — and interacting\nwith students.\nSo, because of this, I want to make sure I leave plenty of time for us to interact. So, I’ll\nget on with my prepared remarks and then we can have a conversation.\nRight at the top, I must do away with a little piece of official business, and that is the\nstandard disclaimer that I must make before every public appearance: The views I\nexpress this evening are my own and do not necessarily represent those of anyone else\nin the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC).\nBy the end of this evening, I hope I will have provided some insight into how I view my\nwork with the Federal Reserve and, in particular, the Philadelphia Fed.\nPerhaps most important, I hope I may say something that might inspire you to consider\nthe Federal Reserve System as a place in which you can envision yourself for your\ncareer. For those of you who are studying economics, specifically, the Federal Reserve\nis arguably the largest employer of economists in the United States.\nEven for those of you who are not on track to become economists, there may be a\nfuture for you at the Fed, as well. And I say this from experience. Full disclosure, I didn’t\nmajor in economics. I majored in engineering, specifically civil engineering. Further,\nengineering is what I hold my doctorate in! I am what you could call an “accidental\neconomist.” Some years ago, I was working on an engineering problem related to\n\nrailroads and I realized that to truly appreciate the impacts of the project, I needed to\nunderstand the economics of the project, as well. So, back to school I went!\nIn the end, it all makes sense, because both engineering and economics are disciplines\nin which the end goal is to understand how systems work so that we can improve them\nand make them more efficient and effective.\nBut I am getting way ahead of myself.\nAllow me to provide, briefly, what I like to call “Fed 101.” Because I know, through my\nexperience, that the Federal Reserve is seen by some to be a bit of a mystery.\nSince its creation in 1913 — in response to a series of financial panics which rattled the\nnational economy as well as destroyed the savings of many Americans — the main role\nof the Federal Reserve, as the nation’s central bank, has been to utilize the tools of\nmonetary policy available to us to help the economy stay on an even, forward course.\nBut to fully understand what the Fed is, one first needs to understand what the Fed is\nnot. The Fed is not “the economy.” If you want to see the real economy, look at those\nsitting next to you and then look in the mirror. It is each of you, as consumers, as\npotential employees, or as potential business owners and employers, who are the\neconomy.\nIt is your decisions that ultimately have the greatest impact on our collective economic\ndirection. The monetary policy work of the Fed can influence those decisions in an effort\nto guide long-term economic growth or respond to emergent trends — think of how we\nraised the policy interest rate to try to slow overheated demand to alleviate inflation —\nbut we cannot and do not control the decisions you make. While we can project what we\nthink the economy may do in the coming weeks, months, or years, we have to act\nbased on what it actually does.\nWe are also independent within the government. The Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System is appointed by the president of the United States with the advice and\nconsent of the Senate. But the 12 Federal Reserve District Banks are independently\nchartered institutions. Certainly, the Board of Governors retains some purview over our\nwork and operations, but by and large, I and my 11 colleagues at the District Bank level\nreport not to Washington but to our own boards of directors and, by extension, our home\ncommunities.\nThe Fed was set up to be a decentralized central bank. And, because of this, the\nFederal Reserve is able to operate in a space that I can only call radically nonpartisan.\nSurely, we operate within the fiscal and economic conditions fostered, or constraints\nimposed, by the decisions of elected policymakers. But we do not step explicitly into the\npartisan arena. This is a vital design feature as it allows for the Fed’s decisions to be\nmade by looking across all the available data and responding to those scenarios alone.\n2\n\nThe North Star for all of our work is the Fed’s dual mandate. This is the charge handed\nto us by Congress to focus our work on two key goals: ensuring stable prices and\nachieving maximum employment. The research we undertake informs far-reaching\neconomic and monetary policy decisions as we fulfill this charge. This is where all those\neconomists I mentioned a moment ago are of great importance.\nStable prices, as it sounds, are just that — it’s inflation. At the Fed, as with many other\ncentral banks around the world, we set a goal that annual inflation should be targeted at\n2 percent annually, as measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, or\nPCE. That’s our preferred measure over the more well-known Consumer Price Index,\nthe CPI, because we believe it better captures the ways consumers act in the economy.\nNot that we don’t look at that CPI — trust me, we do.\nMaximum employment, strictly speaking, is the highest level of employment that the\neconomy can sustain to maintain inflation at our 2 percent annual target. However, I\nprefer to take a more nuanced view. To me, achieving maximum employment does not\nmean simply getting to a condition where every employer can find a worker.\nAs I have said to multiple audiences before, while job growth is important, I believe we\nmust be promoting a climate in which workers can find jobs that are truly rewarding. In\nother words, I prefer that we don’t see a trade-off between job quality and job quantity.\nLooking around this room, I am concerned with creating economic conditions where\neach and every one of you will be able to find a job. But, more important to me, I want it\nto be a job where you are able to take full advantage of your education and skills, and\nwhere you can truly feel productive. I do not think you would consider anything less as\nhaving achieved your own “maximum employment” — and neither would I.\nNow, take that personal consideration and transpose it to the full economy. That’s my\ndefinition of maximum employment.\nSo, now I hear some of you thinking, “OK, Pat, that’s great and all, but how do you get\nto the decisions you make?” That’s a really good question. And the truth is I don’t come\nto these decisions by myself. I truly rely upon the work of the entire staff of the\nPhiladelphia Fed.\nFor you economics majors, yes, this is where you come in, and in a big way. The raw\neconomic data and its analysis forms the basis of many decisions. But to say that we’re\nonly, in essence, an economic think tank looking at and charting numbers could not be\nfurther from the truth.\nThose numbers — inflation reports, employment reports, and more — are “hard data.”\nThese data points are critical for us to build the long-term trend models crucial to setting\npolicy. Yes, they are vital data points. But hard data has also its limits. For starters, each\nof these reports tells me what has already happened. They are a snapshot into a prior\n3\n\ntime. They tell what has already happened and may not necessarily tell what is\nhappening.\nSo, equally important to me is “soft data” — the real-time and on-the-ground information\ngleaned through survey research, the daily operations of the Philly Fed, and individual\nconversations I and many others have with contacts across Pennsylvania, Delaware,\nand New Jersey. Those interactions tell us how the economy is impacting families and\nbusinesses where it matters most, in the communities we serve and around kitchen\ntables.\nMoreover, soft data allows me to speak more directly when I’m joining my FOMC\ncolleagues at our regular meetings in Washington. We all have access to the same\nnumbers. The reports I can bring in from the field help add vital color to the black-and-\nwhite on the printed page.\nAnd this is where those who may not necessarily end up with an economics degree\ncome in.\nOur supervisory and regulatory function works directly with community banks across the\nDistrict to ensure trust in the financial institutions where millions of customers hold their\nsavings. Their reports back to us really provide a good look into community financial\nconditions which can be a harbinger for conditions elsewhere.\nOur Cash Services team works every day to, quite literally, connect people with their\nmoney. Now, I recognize I’m speaking to the Smartphone Generation, and you each\nprobably have one app or another on your phone to send and receive money. But if you\nhave stopped at an ATM recently, that cash you withdrew, at some point, spent time in a\nFederal Reserve Bank. Those bank orders and the demand for cash give us a broad\nlook inside whether, how much, and how often consumers are spending their money.\nBut let’s dig a little deeper beyond just the financial side. We house a busy and\nimpactful Community Development & Regional Outreach team which works directly with\nlocal officials, community bankers and business leaders, and nonprofit organizations,\namong others, to create plans, informed by Fed research, to enhance the economic\nlives of countless residents. This allows us an opportunity to have meaningful kitchen-\ntable discussions.\nWe have economic educators whose role is to inform students and consumers not just\nabout the Fed but about the critical role they, as individual consumers, play in our\neconomy. For example, consumers may make better decisions about using credit, for\nexample, if they fully understand how credit works.\nOur communications team makes our work more visible and more easily\nunderstandable for the public. I know that many of us in the field tend to have our own\nlingo — don’t get me started about all the acronyms! — and it is crucial that all\nAmericans can understand what we at the Fed do.\n4\n\nWe also have IT teams focused on emerging tech issues, including AI and machine\nlearning and even quantum computing. The financial technology revolution is changing\nthe very way people view and interact with money — think of those payment apps I just\nmentioned. Moreover, there are numerous issues related to financial security — both in\nenhancement and in the threats from hackers — we must understand.\nAnd on and on. So, suffice it to say that if you think that I’m just sitting in my office in\nPhiladelphia waiting for official data reports to come across my desk you’d be mistaken.\nIn fact, if I’m not in my office talking or meeting with people to gain the soft data I need,\nI’m most likely traveling around the Third District meeting people where they are. And if\nI’m not the one doing it, there’s a good chance someone else from the Philly Fed is.\nThis willingness to be open to many voices is something that has not only shaped my\ndecisions at the Philadelphia Fed but, in fact, helped shape my career. Remember, I’m\nnot a trained economist, but a trained engineer! But almost every day I encounter an\ninstance where the fields of engineering and economics intersect.\nBefore I step out from behind this lectern and to hear from you, I want to leave one last\npiece of advice — just in case my advice to come work for the Federal Reserve wasn’t\nenough.\nI am soon going to reach the age and service limit to serve as president of the Philly\nFed. On June 30, I’ll be retiring. So, tonight not only marks one of the last times I’ll be\nspeaking before an audience, but you are also the last audience of students I will have\nthe privilege to stand among. So, allow me to impart one of the lessons that has helped\nguide my career and which, I hope, will help you in yours.\nIt is our nature to want to seek stability and certainty. And surely, that’s part of my job at\nthe Fed, to help secure a stable and certain course for the economy. But the economy,\nlike life, doesn’t always react in the ways we think it will or should, and so sometimes\nwe’re challenged to rethink some of the assumptions we previously thought were\nmaxims.\nLeaning into those situations with an open and calm mind — following what you see and\nnot necessarily want you want to see — is how we tackle these challenges. It’s how we\nfocus on the now and doing what’s best for the given moment. It is how we can seek to\nimprove both the world around us and ourselves.\nSo, once again, I thank you for being here and for allowing me to be a Wildcat for the\nnight. I hope I have achieved my initial aim — to not just open the Fed a little bit but\nhopefully to open up your minds to the numerous career paths the Fed may offer you.\nI also wish you — and your professors — all the best as you work toward the end of the\nsemester and the academic year. Let’s have a discussion.\n5",

    "text": "An Economic Outlook\n2019 Inquirer Influencers of Finance\nPhiladelphia, PA\nFebruary 28, 2019\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nAn Economic Outlook\n2019 Inquirer Influencers of Finance\nPhiladelphia, PA\nFebruary 28, 2019\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nNote: President Harker presented similar remarks on February 13, 2019, at the Jewish Business\nNetwork Luncheon in Philadelphia.\nGood afternoon. It’s a pleasure to be here. Before I start today, I want to take a moment to\nacknowledge the organization that brings us here today: The Philadelphia Inquirer. Right now,\njournalism as a whole seems to find itself increasingly in peril and subject to disruption — by\nwhich I mean the old-school definition of almost daily change and turmoil, rather than the tech-\nworld application of the word. So it’s more important than ever to recognize the truly\nirreplaceable service it provides, and its essential role in American life and democracy.\nWhile I consider the Inquirer to be a national outlet, like its counterparts in L.A. or Chicago,\nthese all provide the truly essential — and ever more endangered — function of local reporting\nas well.\nI’m sure I speak for everyone here, and residents of Philadelphia and beyond, when I say we are\ndeeply grateful for the gift Gerry Lenfest gave the Inquirer family of outlets and the city of\nPhiladelphia in preserving them with his generous donation.\nGood journalism is both an art and a public good, so thank you to everyone involved in the\nInquirer and its sister publications.\nI’m going to start this afternoon with an economic outlook — where we are, where we’re likely\nheaded, and what I’m watching as we make our way there — and then discuss something that’s\na focus of ours at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia: the labor market, skills, and the\nfuture of work.\n1\n\nBefore I start, let me issue the standard disclaimer that the views I express today are mine\nalone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\nGrowth\nStarting with GDP, I see growth a bit above 2 percent for this year, returning to trend of around\n2 percent some time in 2020. While some may view that growth rate as disappointing, it\nreflects structural, slow-moving forces — like demographics, muted growth in the labor force,\nand lower productivity growth — rather than any temporary headwind. So I still see the outlook\nas positive: The U.S. economy continues to grow in what is on pace to be the longest economic\nexpansion in our history.\nI should also deliver the caveat that those projections are for the year as a whole. I expect Q1 of\nthis year to come in closer to 1.5 percent; there are multiple contributing factors here, not least\nbeing that first quarters have seen low or negative growth for several years running, enough to\nhave essentially become the norm. That should balance out as growth picks up in the following\nquarters.\nPCE remains the primary driver of real GDP growth, and household spending continues at a\nstrong, sustained pace.\nBusinesses, on the other hand, have reported an increase in uncertainty and a decrease in\nconfidence. Coupled with tighter financial conditions, the investment outlook is not quite as\nrosy as last year. It’s certainly not a dire one, but the specter of uncertainty does cast a shadow,\nand the ambiguity of the current climate appears to be having a dampening effect.\nI am also monitoring international influences, including the outlook for growth abroad and\ntrade developments.\nOn balance, the potential risks tilt very slightly to the downside, but I emphasize the word\n“slight.” It’s a gradient measured by a protractor rather than one apparent to the naked eye.\nOverall, the economy remains in good shape.\n2\n\nEmployment\nOne clear example is the continued strength of the labor market. Employment data continue to\nshow remarkable health and, in fact, have surprised many of the experts. Job creation\ncontinues at a strong pace, quits are still high, and the slight upticks in the unemployment rate\nover the past couple of months reflect more people coming off the sidelines to join the labor\nmarket.\nIn fact, the primary concern we’re hearing anecdotally is not the lack of jobs but the dearth of\nskilled workers.\nInflation\nInflation is running around our preferred 2 percent target. For several years, it was persistently\nlow, finally moving up to our goal last year. I see inflation running slightly higher than 2 percent\nfor this year and next.\nAs Fed watchers well know, when we say our goal is 2 percent inflation, we don’t mean the\nsweet spot is exactly 2 percent all the time; it’s our medium-term average. While I would be\nconcerned if it rose significantly above that marker, running slightly above, as I predict we will\nthis year and next, is not something that provokes concern, particularly after a sustained period\nof underperformance.\nImportantly, I’m focused on core inflation, which strips out volatile elements like food and\nenergy, giving a better understanding of the fundamentals. Headline inflation is likely to suffer\nwith fluctuations in energy prices, but those are transient and do not have a marked effect on\nthe underlying measure.\nWhat I’m watching most closely is inflation’s trajectory: what direction it’s headed and how\nfast. Right now, we’re not seeing significant upward pressure, and it’s not on an accelerated\npath; if anything, it’s edging slightly downward. If that scenario changes, the data will guide my\nviews.\n3\n\nRates\nWith a temperate climate for inflation; continued strength in the labor market; very slight\ndownside risks; solid, but moderate growth projections for the next couple of years; and, of\ncourse, a climate of uncertainty, I continue to be in wait-and-see mode. Or, to use the word of\nthe moment, I see patience as a virtue. My own view is that one rate hike for 2019 and one for\n2020 are appropriate.\nAs ever, that’s my current stance, and my views will be guided by data as they come in and\nevents as they unfold. I know some people wish that Fed officials would retire the metaphorical\npencil we use in our forecasts and be more forceful in our estimates. And I’m happy to use a\npen … so long as it’s filled with erasable ink. We have to make policy decisions in context, and\nI’ve shared my outlook given the landscape on February 28, 2019. If we had a perfectly\nfunctioning crystal ball, those predictions would be infallible – and I’d be playing the lottery a\nlot more.\nSkills and the Workforce\nOf course, while we can’t prognosticate with absolute certainty, we can make educated guesses\nabout a host of issues.\nOne that’s of particular interest at the Philadelphia Fed is the future of work, and how cities and\nregions across the country are preparing for the changes that are already well underway.\nThere have been two discussions about the labor market that have taken center stage of late,\nthe first being the skills shortage and the difficulty employers report in finding qualified\nworkers. The other is the effect of artificial intelligence and automation on the current and\nfuture employment landscape. The two obviously go hand in hand.\nWhile both have received an abundance of attention, the discussions are decidedly nuanced,\nand it’s important to understand both the risks and the opportunities these issues present.\nThe opportunity is that we can see change coming and not only prepare for it, but rise to meet\nit. This is in the economic interests of both individual businesses and the cities and regions in\nwhich they operate. The risk, of course, is in ignoring the change and failing to prepare for it.\n4\n\nAutomation is coming; in fact, it’s already here. But much of the popular conversation veers\nfrom practicalities. Rather than look at the jobs that have already been, or are on the precipice\nof being, automated, speculation runs to the entirety of human capabilities somehow being\nmechanized.\nWhat the current trend in automation has actually done is thrown into stark relief the\nimportance of uniquely human attributes, what we tend to refer to as “soft skills.” These are as\nin demand among employers as technical skills, if not more so.\nThe truth is that the scope of artificial intelligence is limited to our input; that is, machines are\nonly as smart as we make them. The important conversation, in my view, is not whether robots\nmay someday write the great American novel, but what the current capabilities of automation\nmean for the people in our workforce now and how it will shape the near future.\nWe recently published research on the likely effect of automation, both within the Federal\nReserve’s Third District and in the U.S. We not only identified jobs that are in danger of\nautomating, we assigned degrees of likelihood to their eventual demise. We also looked at\nwho’s doing those jobs, who would be hardest hit, and whether and where new jobs might be\ncreated.\nWe concluded that almost one in five jobs in our District have a 95 percent or better chance of\nbecoming automated, and that the people doing them are some of the economy’s most\nvulnerable workers. While some people will be absorbed into new jobs, others won’t.\nInstead of leaving the disruption of various industries to fate, we have an opportunity to think\nabout how to train the workers whose jobs will likely disappear. That’s everything from the jobs\nthat have yet to be created to the ones that are standing empty right now.\nAs I mentioned, one of the most frequent complaints we’ve heard from business is the shortage\nof skilled workers. While there has been some debate about the skills shortage, our research\ncertainly points to a gap and the JOLTS data in particular support it.\nWe also have research underway. Our economists took a very large data set — more than 90\npercent of all online postings — to analyze what factors impact the length of time a job stays\n5\n\nopen or, in their parlance, the “time to fill.” They looked over a two-year span, from 2015 to\n2017, for the 50 largest metropolitan statistical areas to see, among other things, what factors\ninfluenced the time-to-fill stretch and whether requirements for certain levels of experience\nand educational attainment affect that metric.\nTheir preliminary findings confirm what we’ve been hearing anecdotally and what we’ve seen\nin other research — that there is a gap between the skills employers want and need and those\nin the available workforce.\nThey found that the easiest jobs to fill are those that are generally routine, manual positions —\nthe same ones that are at the highest risk of automation.\nThe most difficult to fill are those that require specific cognitive, and uniquely human, skills:\nteachers, for instance, or psychologists.\nThe more skill required, the longer a job takes to fill; likewise, the higher the bar for educational\nattainment and years’ experience, the more time the position will remain open.\nWhile the research is as yet unpublished, the early findings pose questions for the labor market.\nShould, for instance, employers consider hiring candidates who are good, rather than ideal, and\nfocus on in-house training to make up the difference? Considering the combined losses\nassociated with unfilled positions and the expense of a candidate search, it is likely more cost-\neffective for many organizations.\nThis is something we’ve been discussing with employers across the region. In fact, the\nPhiladelphia Fed has formed a partnership with Philadelphia Works, Social Finance, and a local\ncompany to change the way we prepare the local workforce for the future of work. The pilot is\na unique public-private partnership, in which the public sector will provide customized training\nand the employer will repay the cost of that training once the outcomes are realized.\nThe reality of the tight labor market means that employers have to start thinking creatively and\nlong term about how they’re going to address the gap between the skills they want and need\nand those available in the labor pool. What makes this project stand out is just that: The\n6\n\nemployer isn’t funding it through their foundation; it’s coming right out of the HR budget. It’s a\nbusiness decision. And not only will they get an agile, trained workforce, but it adds to the city’s\nlabor pool overall.\nIt’s my hope that more businesses in the region — and across the country — will begin to take\nanother look at how they’re approaching training and hiring. This will be especially important as\nthe baby boom generation continues its march into retirement and the importance of\nsuccession planning takes on new urgency across the professional spectrum.\nConclusion\nTo sum up: The economy continues to do well. I continue to be happily patient in my outlook\non raising rates and will monitor the data as they come in. And importantly, I hope that this\npoint in the labor market’s history will prove to be the catalyst for employers to reconsider\ntheir approach to training, and what role they can play in arming people with the skills both\nemployers and employees need.\nThank you.\n7",

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nPutting Research to Work So Job Quality Equals Job Quantity\nWelcome Remarks\nPeople, Possibilities, Practice: Designing a Better Future for Workers\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nPhiladelphia, PA\nOctober 18, 2023\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Philadelphia Fed.\nThank you, Susie Kendis, for that introduction and to you and your colleagues at Deloitte for yesterday’s\nconference, which laid significant groundwork for these next two days of discussions.\nI also thank our friends at Working Nation, the City of Philadelphia, and Drexel University’s Lindy\nInstitute for helping us put together this series of events.\nNow, a quick reminder of the usual Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not\nnecessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the\nFederal Reserve System.\nThis is an exciting event for me as it gives me the opportunity to highlight some of the truly\ngroundbreaking research going on under this roof. It may be easy to think of the Federal Reserve only in\nterms of monetary policy and interest rates and such — and I honestly can’t blame you — but the work\nwe do here every day is varied, dynamic, and truly impactful as you will see.\nAs you may know, for nearly 50 years, the Federal Reserve has worked according to the dual mandate\nthat Congress handed down to us. One pillar of this dual mandate is price stability. That’s the one you\nread about most in the news as we continue our efforts to wrestle inflation back down to our 2 percent\nannual target. And as an aside, we are making steady progress, but more remains to be done.\n1\n\nThe other — equally important, if somewhat less reported — is to promote maximum employment. But\nwhat does that mean, maximum employment? Well, I look at it as a two-way proposition. It’s not just\npromoting economic conditions through which employers can open their doors for workers to come in.\nJob growth is important, but it’s not the end-all, be-all.\nFor me, maximum employment also means promoting a climate in which workers in those jobs are\ntreated with respect and dignity, and where work isn’t just something to be rewarded but something\nthat is truly rewarding. Put another way, while the quantity of available jobs is important, so, too, is the\nquality of those jobs.\nSo, it is upon the pillar of maximum employment in which we find the Worker Voices Project.\nYesterday, I published an article on the Philadelphia Fed’s website with my perspective on some of what\nthe Worker Voices Project tells us. If you have not yet done so, I do encourage you to read it — just\nmaybe not at this very moment. But allow me to give you a couple of spoilers.\nI opened my article with a direct quote from one of the many workers interviewed through the Worker\nVoices Project, who said, “I know that I can bring a lot to the table. Are you going to uphold your end of\nthe half as an employer?”\nAnd I closed the article by writing the following: “I am proud that our research is being put into action\ntoward innovations that can meet the needs of our workforce while forging the strong economy of\ntomorrow. And this research is not just going to benefit us as economists but, ultimately, more so as a\nsociety.”\nThis brings me to this event today and the further discussions that will take place tomorrow.\nAs economists, we have many tools and models through which we can study the forces that exert their\npush and pull on the labor market and those participating in it. Make no mistake, these hard data are\nimportant. Hard data give us — pun fully intended — concrete points, which, through time, we can\nidentify employment trends, identify precursors of labor force realignments, and support potential\nchanges in public policy.\n2\n\nFrom what I said a moment ago, the hard data tell us a lot about the quantity of jobs.\nBut even for all its strengths and directional guidance, the hard data cannot tell us what is going on at\nthe most micro level — the decisions individual workers are making about their own futures. These soft\ndata, the data reported through the Worker Voices Project, are a critically important supplement to the\nhard data. Actually, strike that, it’s not a supplement; it’s a full-fledged partner. We need to look at both,\nequally.\nAnd when looking at the Worker Voices Project, I see the means for us to coalesce around basic\nprinciples that classic economics cannot capture in a model or on a chart. This is what comes to my mind\nwhen I hear the phrase “research in action.”\nIf you don’t know, even though I sit as president and CEO of the Philadelphia Fed, economics wasn’t my\nfirst pursuit. By education, I’m an engineer. And if you know one thing about engineers, we cannot just\nlet things be, when we know, deep down, systems can be made more efficient, more effective, and even\nmore fair.\nThere’s nothing that an engineer enjoys more than lifting the cover and looking at what’s going on\nunderneath. And there’s nothing that an engineer enjoys less than hearing that something can’t be\nchanged because “that’s just the way we do things.”\nAnd this is what we’re doing here — we’re lifting the cover to see how we can make the labor market\nwork more efficiently, effectively, and fairly for workers. And, over the course of the next two days,\nwe’re not going to allow ourselves to be limited by the old ways of thinking.\nThat’s not being anti-employer. Far from it. As I have traveled across the Third District and talked with\nemployers, I hear directly how hard they’re working to find the employees their businesses need to be\nsuccessful — and once these employees are in, they don’t want to lose them.\n3\n\nYet, many of these employers are sticking only to the means through which they’ve attracted workers in\nthe past — namely, higher wages and more benefits. And not surprisingly, they are finding these tools\nalone aren’t as effective as they once were.\nThe Worker Voices Project, and the discussions and actionable research stemming from it, is a means\nthrough which we can provide these employers new and better tools to attract and retain workers.\nThese are the workers who can see their values reflected in those held by their employer and their value\nrewarded not just in terms of wages but in terms of being treated with dignity.\nNow, I could go on as my excitement for and belief in this transformational research is nearly\ninexhaustible — unlike attention spans. And every minute I give back is a minute we can spend hearing\nfrom the subject experts, who are doing the research, and those living it.\nSo, with that, I will yield the microphone. But, again, thank you all for coming this afternoon. I hope both\nthe rest of today’s forum and tomorrow’s working session are, like a good job, equally productive and\nrewarding.\n4",

Harker\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily\nthose of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\nUnrealized Gains: Investing in Our Region’s Economic and Human Capital Potential\nCapital for Communities: Pay for Success Financing\nOrganized by the Community Development Studies & Education Department\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nNovember 4, 2015\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nIntroduction\nThank you for attending this Capital for Communities event exploring pay for success financing.\nI would like to thank Inglis and Philanthropy Network Greater Philadelphia for their partnership\nin planning this event. I would also like to thank the talented speakers who have joined us from\nnear and far to share their insights on pay for success financing, a new tool that has the\npotential to generate societal cost savings through an evidence-based social investment\napproach.\nLastly, I thank the Community Development Studies & Education Department of the Federal\nReserve Bank of Philadelphia for organizing today’s event.\nAcross the Federal Reserve System, the Community Development function provides research\nand gathers stakeholders to explore emerging trends and issues in low-income areas\nthroughout the country. We are pleased that our colleagues from other Federal Reserve Banks\nand the Federal Reserve Board of Governors have joined us today.\nResearch-informed practice and practice-informed research are key goals of the Community\nDevelopment Studies & Education Department. Today’s event will highlight pay for success, an\n1\n\nemerging model that allows the public, private, and nonprofit sectors to work together to move\nfrom good intentions to good outcomes. This model uses metrics that not only track success\nbut also allow us to learn from potential failures. It is wonderful to see practitioners,\nresearchers, and policymakers here today as we explore strategies to support research-\ninformed public investments.\nOur Region’s Potential\nI believe this region has incredible potential. Greater Philadelphia is home to some of the\nworld’s most renowned centers for higher education and cutting-edge applied research. We are\nseeing connections emerge among these institutions with technology transfer centers,\nentrepreneurs, and investors working together to reshape our city into a center for innovation.\nOur region’s economy has been strengthening since the recession, with unemployment in\nPhiladelphia County down to 7.6 percent as of August 2015 from a January 2013 rate of 11.9\npercent.1 According to figures from the Economy League of Greater Philadelphia, from 2009 to\n2013, Philadelphia experienced new business growth of nearly 9 percent, equating to 2,700\nnew firms. Additionally, Greater Philadelphia has experienced a surge of 45 percent in\ninternational visitors over the past decade. Whether to see the Pope or to attend the upcoming\nDemocratic National Convention, people are coming to Philadelphia and taking advantage of\nthe wide variety of local restaurants, shops, and cultural attractions.\nDespite this, not everything in Philadelphia is rosy. We have our share of challenges, too.\nPhiladelphia is the second poorest large city in America, with a poverty rate of 26.5 percent,\naccording to the latest U.S. Census figures. Philadelphia also has the highest deep poverty rate\nof the nation’s 10 most populous cities; that is, people with an income below half of the\npoverty line. While Philadelphia has experienced recent job growth, the rate of growth has\nbeen slower than that of other U.S. cities, and the jobs are predominantly low-wage jobs that\nperpetuate rather than reverse the cycle of poverty.\n1 Bureau of Labor Statistics Local Area Unemployment Statistics (LAUS) Unemployment Rate:\nPhiladelphia County/City; http://beta.bls.gov/dataViewer/view/timeseries/LAUCN421010000000003.\n2\n\nDespite the Philadelphia area being home to a number of leading colleges and universities, only\n24 percent of city residents have a bachelor’s degree or higher, and nearly 20 percent of the\nadult population does not have a high school diploma, according to the latest U.S. Census\nfigures. Other significant human capital issues plague our region as well. More than 106,000\nyouths and young adults aged 16 to 24 in Greater Philadelphia are not in school and not\nworking. Philadelphia has one of the highest incarceration rates of any large U.S. city, with\n8,300 individuals in the Philadelphia Prison System. Further, these individuals face significant\nchallenges when reentering society, contributing to a costly recidivism problem. A recent report\nby the Pew Charitable Trusts showed that the City of Philadelphia spends 7 cents out of every\ntax dollar on holding people in its jails, which is more than it spends on the streets and health\ndepartments combined.2 Nearly 60 percent of these prison inmates return to the Philadelphia\nPrison System within three years of their release. How do we combat this problem? Experts cite\nsupportive housing, mental health and substance abuse services, and workforce reentry as\nservice gaps that directly relate to recidivism.3 As the cost figures in this example show, there is\na strong economic case for delivering successful preventative social interventions.\nTargeted investments in preventative social services could help our region capture unrealized\neconomic gains by unleashing the full potential of human capital improvements. However,\ntraditional sources of capital to address these problems are limited. We know this capital is\nunlikely to come from the public sector. Municipal governments are under stress: Revenues are\ninsufficient to cover basic expenditures; the costs associated with debt service, pensions, and\nother post-employment benefits are consuming a substantial share of scarce resources. And for\nmany cities, the unreserved balance in the general fund provides little financial cushion for the\n2 Claire Shubik-Richards, Philadelphia’s Crowded, Costly Jails: The Search for Safe Solutions, The Pew Charitable\nTrusts Philadelphia Research Initiative, 2012, available at http://ow.ly/PXqS2.\n3 Anna Fogel, Jeff Shumway, and Anant Udpa, Roadmap for Pay for Success in Philadelphia, Social Finance, 2015,\navailable at http://ow.ly/PXrpy.\n3\n\nfuture.4 At the same time, federal government programs are not growing, and the philanthropic\nsector can only do so much.\nPay for success offers a new potential source of investment capital, but as with any proposed\nsolution or program, we need to better understand the nature of our challenges. We also need\nto assess how this tool can contribute to a vision that is sustainable and inclusive, bringing\nopportunity to every neighborhood of our city and every city in our region.\nA Potential Solution: Pay for Success Finance\nThe strength of our economy greatly depends on the skills, ability, and financial stability of our\nworkforce. Investing in human capital is a strategy that can ultimately lead to both improved\nquality of life and economic growth.\nWe are here today to explore a new financing tool that allows for that investment in human\ncapital. This new social finance tool, known as pay for success financing or social impact bonds,\nhas been applied to reducing recidivism and homelessness and improving educational\nperformance and public health. These are all endeavors that, if successful, could lead to higher\nlabor market participation and lower unemployment, and thus promote economic growth.\nAfter years of seemingly stagnant results in addressing certain social problems, many people\nare optimistic that pay for success financing will bring solutions in the form of new capital to\nsupport program delivery, improve accountability, and increase rigor in performance\nmeasurement. Pay for success financing shifts the risk of a preventative social service from\ntaxpayers to investors who finance these programs and who receive government repayments if,\nand only if, the agreed-upon performance metrics are achieved. Third-party evaluators measure\na program’s success, which encourages research-informed practice that can deliver measurable\nresults.\n4 Keith Wardrip, Fiscal Stress in the Small Postindustrial City: Causes, Consequences, and Implications for\nCommunity Development, Special Report, Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, May 2014, available at\nhttps://www.philadelphiafed.org/community-development/fiscalstress.\n4\n\nLast year, Fed Chair Janet Yellen cited research on the importance of early childhood education\nas a building block to opportunity that could reduce rampant inequality. She noted that, and I\nquote, “Research shows that children from lower-income households who get good-quality pre-\nKindergarten education are more likely to graduate from high school and attend college as well\nas hold a job and have higher earnings, and they are less likely to be incarcerated or receive\npublic assistance.”5\nChair Yellen also explained that gains in early childhood education enrollment have stalled since\n2010; only 41 percent of children were enrolled in state or federally supported programs in\n2013. Access to these programs, most of which are specifically designated for lower-income\nfamilies, is limited by the available state or local funding, and since the Great Recession, many\nprograms have sustained budget cuts.\nPay for success financing is a potential strategy to preserve these important investments in\nsocial programs by leveraging private capital during times of fiscal stress. Taxpayer dollars are\nonly deployed once cost savings through social outcomes have been realized.\nAlthough only eight pay for success projects have been structured nationwide to date, nearly 50\nare currently in development. Throughout the Third District, stakeholders are beginning to\nexplore applications of this investment model. For example:\n• In Philadelphia, a group is working to secure investments in housing for persons with\ndisabilities to give them the opportunity to live in integrated community settings while\ndelivering cost savings by shifting from institutional-based care toward home and\ncommunity-based services.\n• In the Lehigh Valley, a task force was assembled to promote investments in early\nchildhood education aimed at improving educational performance outcomes over time.\n5 Yellen, Janet. “Perspectives on Inequality and Opportunity from the Survey of Consumer Finances,” speech given\nOctober 17, 2014, available at http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/yellen20141017a.htm.\n5\n\n• In Camden, a collaborative effort is underway to provide investments in supportive\nhousing to decrease homelessness and generate societal cost savings from reductions in\nemergency room visits from those considered high-utilizers of the health-care system.\nThere has been widespread enthusiasm about the potential of this innovative model, but at this\nearly stage, important questions still need to be explored, including:\n• What is an appropriate investment term that will also allow enough time for a program\nto yield results, and how are successful programs sustained after the investment period\nends?\n• Could there be unintended consequences from this approach?\n• And lastly, how can projects be best structured to allow for learning from potential\nfailures as well as sharing of best practices from successes?\nOur Event\nPreventing problems such as homelessness, educational underperformance, recidivism, and\npoor public health is critical for the long-term economic health and prosperity of our region and\nour nation. Philadelphia native Benjamin Franklin, a father of American innovation, said, “An\nounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.” The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia is\nhosting this meeting because it makes economic sense to explore new ways to prevent the\nsocial problems that plague our society today. And, we know that successful social investments\nwill contribute to a stronger economic future. The presence of both local and national leaders\nhere today is a testimony to the broad interest we share in exploring innovative ways to work\ntogether toward these goals.\nToday’s discussion will provide opportunities to understand and to focus on different\nperspectives about the purpose, appropriate uses, challenges, and risks of pay for success\nfinancing. The goal of this event is to create a community of interest around the development\nof social impact bonds and to identify opportunities for government officials, potential\n6\n\ninvestors, and service providers to leverage pay for success financing to implement or scale\nsocial innovations.\nConclusion\nOver the past few weeks, I have been traveling across the District, and I have been struck by a\nnumber of things: How different our economies are from community to community and how\nhard our residents, community organizations, and the public sector are working to effect\nchange. One exchange in Allentown, however, really stood out for me.\nWe met with a private developer who has made various investments to revitalize the\ndowntown area. He was celebrating the successes and envisioning the future for a new and\nimproved Allentown. In mid-conversation, he voiced his concern that the low- and moderate-\nincome residents of Allentown were not seeing themselves in the bright economic future of the\ncity. They were not applying for the new jobs that were available. They were not shopping in\nthe new stores. And they were not eating in the new restaurants. He asked some folks\nrepresenting the local nonprofit community what he needed to do to make sure that this\nchanged – that the Allentown of the future was an Allentown for all residents. I mention this\nbecause it highlights a critical component for today’s meeting. There is interest from the private\nsector to find solutions, and this interest can be leveraged to bring about transformative\nchange. For real change to occur, however, conversations have to begin, which brings us back\nto the purpose of our event today.\nThis meeting highlights the importance of connecting a diverse group of stakeholders and\ncreating a dialogue that encourages a collective approach to local issues and opportunities. This\nchallenging work requires an approach that is at once creative and forward looking. The\nstrategies you will learn about today exemplify how social finance innovations can unite public,\nprivate, and nonprofit stakeholders by allowing risk, return, and impact to be allocated so that\neveryone’s needs are met while delivering social outcomes that cannot be achieved by one\nparty alone.\n7\n\nA shift toward evidence-based public investment will not be made without significant effort,\nand it would be easier to stick with the status quo and hope for the best. But let’s not let the\nfact that there is no handbook on how to do this stop us from innovating in ways that could\npotentially improve the lives of some of our most vulnerable neighbors while also saving scarce\npublic resources. After all, the handbook on innovation is not read; it is created.\nThank you.\n8",

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nThe Importance of Infrastructure\nUrban Economic Policy Conference\nDrexel University\nPhiladelphia, PA\nMay 12, 2017\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood afternoon. It’s a pleasure to be here.\nWhile I’m tempted to launch into the subject of the day immediately, Fed presidents are all but\nrequired to give an economic update when we speak. So, with your indulgence, I’ll start with a\nbrief overview and outlook for the U.S. economy, and then speak a little about the importance of\ninfrastructure to economic health.\nAnother requirement of Fed presidents is that we all give the standard disclaimer: The views I\nexpress today are mine alone and do not necessarily represent those of anyone else in the Federal\nReserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\nWith that out of the way, time for the economic rundown.\nOutlook\nThe advance estimate of GDP growth in the first quarter is 0.7 percent, which pales in\ncomparison to the previous quarter’s 2.1 percent. But weak first quarters have been constant\nenough in the past several years to make them effectively the norm. This year’s slowdown was\ndue — as in years past — to a combination of residual seasonality, weather effects, and modest\ninventory investment. These drags are likely temporary, and I expect a rebound in the second\nquarter.\nOverall, I see growth for 2017 at about 2.3 percent. That’s a very slight downward revision of\nmy previous estimate — only 0.1 percentage point, which reflects that slow first quarter growth.\n1\n\nOn the inflation side of our mandate, things are looking good. Inflation has been persistently low\nover the past several years, but it’s on track to stabilize at our 2 percent goal by the end of this\nyear.\nOn the other side, we’re looking at the lowest unemployment rate in a decade. We created\n211,000 jobs in April, and unemployment is at or below its natural rate at 4.4 percent. Quits are\nup, and labor force participation is higher than a year ago, despite demographic trends that are\npulling in the other direction. All in all, we’re looking at a labor market more or less at full\nhealth, with very little slack.\nI see the unemployment rate falling as low as 4.2 percent at the end of next year and average job\ngrowth of about 200,000 a month for 2017. That pace should ease down to about 100,000 jobs a\nmonth by the end of 2019.\nThis isn’t a bad thing. In a well-functioning labor market, we don’t need the kind of job growth\nwe’ve seen over the past couple of years. In fact, to sustain a healthy economy, estimates of the\nideal number range from about 70,000 to 100,000 a month to keep up with population growth.1\nSo overall, things are looking good. We’re essentially at normal now, and based on the strength\nof the economy, I continue to see two more rate hikes as appropriate this year.\nEconomic Growth and Mobility\nOf course, that’s the macro view of the American economy. I’m not blind to the areas that\nhaven’t made the same comebacks as their neighbors. I know there are people across our District\nwho feel left behind. One of the benefits to the regional Fed System is that Fed presidents get an\non-the-ground view of their local economies. Another is that we have programs to help those\ncommunities. We don’t invest money or give grants because that’s not what we’re tasked to do,\nbut we do have education and outreach programs; we get the right people in a room together; and\nwe conduct research — something we are, in my totally unbiased opinion, exceptionally good at.\nResearch matters. I know we sometimes seem like we’re all just fusty old academics, sitting\naround pondering the minutiae of data and maybe even missing the forest for the trees. But the\n1 See, for example, Daniel Aaronson, Scott A. Brave, and David Kelley, “Is There Still Slack in the Labor Market,”\nChicago Fed Letter, 359, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago (2016).\n2\n\nwork we do — everyone here — forms the basis of real, demonstrable change. It has the\npotential to move people and families and towns and cities along the path from poverty to\nprosperity, and that’s powerful. It also allows us to sit around being fusty academics, poring over\nthe minutiae of data, but that’s beside the point.\nWe recently launched an Economic Growth & Mobility Project at the Philadelphia Fed that will\ntake that work to its natural next step. We’re establishing research and action labs that will bring\ntogether experts and stakeholders to find ways to attack persistent problems at their roots. We’re\nlooking at everything from workforce development — like apprenticeships and skills training —\nto work on the subject we’re here for today, urban infrastructure, including affordable housing\nand equitable transit.\nWhich is my awkward way of both plugging the excellent work by my Community Development\nteam and pivoting to a new topic: infrastructure, the ebb and flow of urban patterns, and building\ninclusive economic growth.\nInfrastructure\nAs a Fed president, one of my aims is better economic prospects for the people in the Third\nDistrict and around the country. One of the ways to accomplish that, of course, is urban\nrevitalization — everything we’re talking about today: housing, transportation, competitiveness.\nInfrastructure is crucial. Humanity is naturally pulled toward what sustains us, be that practical\nor amenable. Real infrastructure is essential to modern living, whether that’s transportation or\nhousing. So is soft infrastructure that promotes a better quality of life, from entertainment to\nquality and choice in education.\nAnd all of those are necessary for economic well-being, which I view as the sum of many parts,\nsome of which sound tangential at best to a lot of people. Not anyone here, I’m sure, but to\nmany. Affordable housing, strong education, transportation, and even physical health are all\nfundamental components of a thriving economy.\nIf people can’t afford to live near jobs — or if there’s no transportation to get them there —\nunemployment becomes a problem. If businesses can’t fill positions, they can’t expand.\n3\n\nLikewise, the quality of life and ease of access in cities makes them competitive. High-value\nemployees who can go anywhere are guided not just by salary but by amenities. That’s part of\nwhat compels businesses to establish a presence in one location over another. But if you can’t,\nfor instance, fly internationally with ease, the city starts to look less desirable to a company that\ndoes business across the globe.\nSo yes, infrastructure of all kinds plays a central role in any city, region, state, or country’s\nsuccess.\nInfrastructure and the Movement of People\nInfrastructure, both real and soft, has also played a role in where we live since we first built cities\nand towns across the colonies. Philadelphia itself is a perfect example.\nIn the mid-18th century, when we were a major trading center, not to mention the New World’s\nfinancial capital,2 everything was located by the river. On the commercial side, obviously\nanything related to shipping was drawn to the banks of the Delaware. But so were businesses that\nrelied on trade, from tanneries to carriage shops to breweries.3 With that kind of concentration, it\nmade sense for financial services to set up shop nearby.4\nTransportation options were limited, so most people lived within a few blocks of the river. Sure,\nthe wealthy had country estates, but in the city, even they lived in the center of the action.\nUltimately, people of all statuses lived in the central port area because of the concentration of\nindustry and the high cost — and limited means — of travel.\nIn the 19th century, things started to change. New York usurped our role as the country’s\nfinancial capital, and manufacturing became Philadelphia’s economic engine. Factories were\nbuilt farther west, toward Broad Street and Manayunk. Newer, faster modes of transportation\n2 Joseph Gyourko et al., “Looking Back to Look Forward: Learning from Philadelphia’s 350 Years of Urban\nDevelopment,” Brookings-Wharton Papers on Urban Affairs (2005), pp. 1–58. Gary Burtless and Janet Rothenberg\nPack, eds., Brookings-Wharton Papers on Urban Affairs (2005) as cited in Jeffrey Lin, “Understanding\nGentrification’s Causes,” Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia Economic Insights, forthcoming.\n3 Theodore Thayer, in Philadelphia: A 300-Year History, Russell F. Weigley, ed. New York: W.W. Norton &\nCompany (1982), pp. 75–76.\n4 Gyourko.\n4\n\nwere developed, and people started to live farther away from work, in the more comfortable —\nand quieter — suburbs.\nIn the 20th century, of course, the same kinds of forces affected migration. Transportation\nevolved even further, became even cheaper, and got people farther in less time. People owned\ncars, and we invested in the Interstate Highway System; research shows that highways caused a\nfull 25 percent decline in central city living across the U.S. from 1950 to 1990.5 The suburbs\noffered more space and amenities at the same time that diminishing public financing and city\nservices made urban Philadelphia less inviting.6 Manufacturing jobs also started to move out of\nthe city.\nNow, of course, we’re witnessing the reversal of the mid-20th century suburbanization trend.\nThis time, it’s partly motivated by the preference of higher-income households for conveniences\nlike restaurants and theaters.7 Amenities have improved, and crime has gone down. As any\nPhiladelphian can tell you, the city looks a lot different now than even 10 years ago, much less\n20 or 30.\nSo, what does all this mean?\nFor one, it means that infrastructure plays a central role in where and how we choose to live.\nMore importantly, it means we have to think not just about how to equip our cities to handle the\ndemands of a changing population but how to essentially reengineer the infrastructure that\nsupported the needs of a different time. How, for instance, do we modernize commuter systems\nto serve changing commuting patterns?\nAnd finally, it means that we have to look more broadly at how regions — not just cities and\nstates — work together to make systems more effective.\n5 Nathaniel Baum-Snow, “Did Highways Cause Suburbanization?” The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 122:2\n(2007), pp. 775–805.

We cover about two-thirds of Pennsylvania,\nstarting around Johnstown and going east; Delaware; and southern New Jersey. But it’s really a\nmicrocosm of America: We have urban centers, suburban expanse, postindustrial towns, and\nrural areas.\nWhich means I can see the effect and influence of infrastructure on pretty much every economic\nprofile.\nThere are three points I think are important when we talk about economic revitalization. First,\nthat it should be inclusive. Second, that it can’t be one-size-fits-all. Third, that our neighbors’\nfates are tied to our own.\nTaking those in turn:\nFirst, while economic strength and sustainability are important, we need to ensure they’re\ninclusive. That means balancing the risks of growth, particularly the displacement of a city’s\nlong-term residents when good economic fortune sweeps in.\nWe’ve been watching and talking about gentrification for a long time. We know the patterns, and\nwe know a lot about what drives movement into one neighborhood or another. With so many\nexamples of booming cities across the country, cities should be able to plan ahead, whether that’s\nensuring mixed-income housing or transit-oriented development.\nSecond, we have to acknowledge that the needs of Allentown aren’t the same as the needs of\nPhiladelphia. My Community Development team is working with the city of Scranton on\nequitable transit, and we’ll have a summit in October to share some of the findings that can be\nadopted by other small cities around the country. Infrastructure — real and soft — is an issue for\nbig cities, but it’s also important to smaller cities and towns, although they’re obviously\naddressing different concerns.\nFinally, as the president of a District that encompasses parts of three states, we have got to start\nseeing beyond traditional borders. I-95 doesn’t stop at the Philadelphia city limits. We’re a\n6\n\nregion as well as individual states and cities; working together on infrastructure projects is in\neveryone’s interest.\nConclusion\nI realize that I’ve made these proclamations as though fixes are easily found. As ever, just\nbecause we have the data or the experience doesn’t mean we have the solutions. If solving\nproblems of economic expansion and sustainability were easy; if infrastructure came in an\nIKEA-like flat-pack, ready to be assembled; or if working across bureaucratic lines were simple,\nwe’d have done it already. And a lot of economists would be out of jobs.\nIt takes work, I understand that. And much of that work has to be done outside the scope of my\nown professional reach.\nWhat we can do, however, is contribute to the body of research and offer ideas. That’s what\nwe’re hoping to accomplish at the Philadelphia Fed, and that’s what conferences like this, and\nresearch like you’re undertaking, can help deliver as well.\nThank you.\n7",

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nHanging a Question Mark\nManagement Science’s 65th Anniversary Conference:\nInnovations in the Science and Practice of Management\nBoston University\nMay 20, 2019\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nSeeing the Forest for the Trees\nIt’s always a pleasure to be in Boston — such a pleasure, in fact, that I can even forget it’s\nPatriots territory. As an Eagles fan, I learned an interesting equation last year: The joy of\nwinning is inversely proportionate to the frequency of winning. So it’s comforting to think that\nwhile Pats fans have probably already forgotten this year’s win, we’ll still be celebrating well\ninto our 90s …\nSpeaking of celebrating, I want to wish a happy anniversary to Management Science for its 65\nyears. I was honored that David asked me to speak on the occasion, and very happy to oblige.\nWhat caught my attention in particular was the emphasis on integrating theory and practice,\nbecause they live on opposite ends of the spectrum far too often, and there’s not much use for\na seemingly perfect model that crumbles under real-world conditions.\nI speak from experience. It’s happened to me more times than I care to remember. As a young\ncivil engineer, designing what I thought was an indestructible bridge, only to see it collapse in\nthe testing lab. As a not-so-young university president, watching the economy plummet in the\nwake of the financial crisis, taking our sublime three-year strategic plan with it. In a host of\nmanagement positions, introducing structural change, only to find that the organism most\nresistant to change is an organization’s culture.\n1\n\nSo I’m very pleased to have the opportunity to compare notes, and war stories, of theory gone\nwrong in practice.\nBefore I do, however, I’ll issue the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today do not\nnecessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\nAny time you’re dealing with complex structures — in engineering, in operations, in policy —\nit’s important to take a step back every once in a while to be sure you’re seeing the forest for\nthe trees. And the more intricate the machine, the more necessary that reevaluation is.\nBecause with so many interdependent parts — built on top of, or intertwined with, each other\n— there’s risk to the whole structure if one of those pieces isn’t working.\nSo it makes sense to kick the tires every now and again.\nOr, in the words of Bertrand Russell, “to hang a question mark on the things you have long\ntaken for granted.”\nIn the case of management science and operations research, I think the first principles we have\nto revisit are whether we’re using the right tools for the right jobs, and whether we’ve designed\nthem with the right users in mind.\nThe Fallibility of Models\nThere are incredible opportunities from the advances we’re seeing in management decision-\nmaking — particularly when it’s enabled by technology — but there are downsides as well.\nThat’s the case with any complex system, especially ones that are programmatic.\nTake fintech, where streamlined processes have expanded the opportunities for smaller loans,\nfaster approvals, and greater market reach and penetration. But there’s a downside to\nalgorithmic lending. Even in its early stages, we’re seeing discrimination in selection.\nI think the overall risk to any complex system, whether it’s technology based or not, lies in\nmoving too far toward process and away from critical thinking.\nIn my experience, you run into trouble when you start thinking your model can do all the work.\n2\n\nTo give a non-tech-based example: Every once in a while, a discussion pops up about shifting\nmonetary policy to a rules-based regime, essentially advocating for the automation of the\nFOMC. That regime would put decisions on autopilot, without human intervention or judgment\nfactoring into the equation. And while those rules are important, and inform a lot of our\ndecisions, they shouldn’t be followed robotically.\nIt’s important to know what you don’t know. Complete control only works in a system where all\nthe variables are known entities. One of my first engineering jobs was designing control\nsystems for trains. That’s an operation that can be set on autopilot. We can control the trains.\nWe can see the layout of the tracks. We know where they’ll be and when they’ll be there.\nIn other words, we know everything we need to know to keep them from running into each\nother.\nMonetary policy isn’t that precise. Despite some of the smartest thinkers and the best models,\nwe can’t assign a degree of certainty to any of the variables.\nWe’re not 100 percent sure what inflation is. We can only estimate the natural rate of\nunemployment when it’s in the rearview mirror — and even then, we don’t universally agree.\nProductivity is notoriously difficult to measure, and that affects our understanding of GDP\ngrowth.\nTo operate monetary policy mechanically, we’d need a level of accuracy that just isn’t possible.\nWe’d need a lot more data, a lot more frequently, with a lot more precision than the laws of\neconomics allow.\nThe Taylor rule is an extraordinary contribution to the economics profession. But I wouldn’t get\non a train that’s run by it.\nHumanity’s Competitive Edge\nMonetary policy should be more like a suspension bridge, with flexibility built into the design. It\nhas a core structure, but it can bend to account for real-world events.\n3\n\nOne of the reasons monetary policy can’t just be mechanized is that decisions have to be\ninformed by human experience and past behavior — as in any discipline, models may work in\ntheory, but not necessarily under the messy complication of real-life conditions.\nIf the Fed had followed the regime that some advocate, interest rates would have risen by\nseveral percentage points in the years following the Great Recession. Instead, models provided\nguidance, but people made the judgment — and wherever you place yourself on the ideological\npolicy spectrum, I don’t think anyone would argue for high rates in a slow recovery.\nAt the heart of this is what can and can’t be mechanized. Some things just require human\ninsight.\nAutomation in general has been the subject of a lot of conversation recently, particularly in the\ncontext of how it’s affecting the employment landscape. Whether it’s policy decisions,\nmanagement models, or the workplace, the underlying lesson is the same: There are some\nthings technology can’t do. The things that make us quintessentially human can’t be replicated\nor automated, because machines can’t think. Artificial intelligence is only as smart as the data\nwe input. Models are only as effective as we make them.\nSo looking at the future of management science, I think success lies in approaches that\nemphasize the human component as much as, if not more than, the programmatic.\nThat’s actually grounded in the profession’s genesis.\nOperations research was born of World War II, when the British and U.S. militaries tapped the\nscientific community for their expertise in processes, models, and analysis. There’s no question\nthat deploying data analytics to the battlefield contributed to the Allied victory, whether\nthrough strategically allocating weaponry and resources, breaking codes, or building networks.\nIf there’s any area that’s subject to the unexpected, it’s the theater of war. And while adding\nthe scientific, algorithmic component was crucial to success, so was human judgment.\n4\n\nWhen the war ended, it seemed clear to researchers that the techniques could be beneficial in\nthe civilian world, as companies and organizations grew larger and more complex, and the\nadvent of the computer age was ushered in.\nWhen the journal launched 65 years ago, the discipline was still in its infancy, but it had\nundergone incredibly rapid development in the years after the war.\nThat era is often characterized by the popular culture of the time. And, in fact, 1954 was the\nyear that Elvis recorded his debut album, On the Waterfront was in theaters, and families\nacross the country tuned in to Father Knows Best. At its scheduled time — there were no\ncommercial-free streaming plans — and on an actual television — which was roughly the size\nand weight of a small rhinoceros.\nThat all looks especially quaint from the vantage of 2019. But it was, in fact, a time of incredible\nchange — socially, economically, and technologically — and the post-War boom fundamentally\nchanged the business landscape. Which is likely what sped the development of management\nscience as a discipline.\nOvercorrecting the Pendulum Swings\nWe’re in a similar situation now, as innovation in all sectors hits a rapid pace.\nAs a species, we tend to overreact to pendulum swings — sometimes to correct for them, and\nsometimes to keep pace with them. Technology has evolved so quickly that it’s become the\ndefault mode to digitize it if we can, without considering if we should.\nThe all-robot hotel in Japan comes to mind — not only could half the mechanized staff not\nperform their basic functions, the entire fleet was dependent on human assistance and\nmaintenance.\nI should make clear that this isn’t a cranky, get-off-my-lawn rant about technology. I am wholly\nin favor of technological advancement and innovation. It’s fundamental to the American\neconomy, and it’s something we do exceptionally well. It’s connected us to one another in a\n5\n\nway that would’ve been unimaginable even a decade or two ago. It’s made life easier, and\nbetter, for the vast majority of people.\nWhat I am saying is that we should put it to its best use.\nOperations research deals with incredibly complex systems populated by incredibly\ncomplicated entities: human beings. Both the theory and the practice should take a step back,\nkick the tires, and be sure they’re using the right tools — technological or otherwise — for the\nright jobs.\nNow is a good time for that, because the overall race forward in technological capability is\ngoing to complicate the workplace even more. And in an increasingly tight labor market, it’s\nmore important than ever to think about who, and how, organizations hire.\nAs technology advances, the underlying skills that make workers adaptable — the “soft skills”\nlike creativity, communication, critical thinking — are going to be more important than a\nchecklist. No single competence is going to survive that evolution.\nInstead, the best candidates will have a core set of skills that can evolve with the market, and\nwe’ll likely see an overall shift to constant training and continuing education.\nExisting professionals will need continual upskilling, whether it’s to keep up with industry\nstandards or just learn the office’s new software. People preparing for the workforce will need\nboth proficiency in current programs and to develop skills that will help them adapt with the\ntechnology as it evolves.\nFrom the employers’ end, that means investing in the workforce and committing to lifelong\nlearning. Simply replacing outdated skills with new ones just isn’t efficient or cost effective, and\nit may not even be enough — they’ll need workers who can adapt to a dynamic and regularly\nchanging environment, and that means investing in people.\nThe End … or the Beginning?\nEducation institutions will also need to consider new models, not just because technology is\nforcing it, but because they’ll be in a position to offer the lifelong learning that workers need.\n6\n\nThe changes happening in the workforce pose both opportunities and risks. On either side, it\nsignals very interesting times coming our way.\nI think this time of increasing automation and computerization will only emphasize the\nimportance of an array of skills, and add richness to the management science profession.\nAnd as we continue the research and execute the practice, I hope we’ll remember to take the\nodd step back, every once in a while, to hang that question mark on our assumptions. Just to be\nsure.\n7",

    "text": "Apprenticeships: Nobility and Necessity\nChemical Heritage Foundation\nPhiladelphia, PA\nJuly 11, 2017\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nApprenticeships: Nobility and Necessity\nChemical Heritage Foundation\nPhiladelphia, PA\nJuly 11, 2017\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood morning. It’s truly a pleasure to be here, and I want to extend my sincerest thanks to\neveryone who made today possible. This is an incredibly important topic, and the more people\nwe can bring to the table, the better. There’s been a growing interest in apprenticeships in the\narea — in everything from IT to health care to financial services — and their success is a\ntestament to the power of public-private partnerships.\nI’m going to do something a bit different today. Normally, the policymaker would get up and\nrecite key statistics, which, frankly, is our comfort zone. You notice no one ever calls a monetary\npolicymaker to host the Tonys.\nAnd while it’s not quite a Broadway number — the only one I’m qualified for is Hamilton, and\nbelieve me, you don’t want to hear me in a rap battle over central banking — I’m going to leave\nthe heavy data to today’s expert presenters. I will, of course, address workforce development\nfrom a policy perspective, but I’m also going to add a bit of the personal. Which counts as really\nshaking things up in Fed world.\nThat’s the segue to the reason I’m here: Why, exactly, does the Fed care about workforce\ndevelopment?\nI should note that the answer to that question — along with everything else I say today —\nreflects my thoughts alone and not necessarily anyone else’s in the Federal Reserve System,\nincluding my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nWith that duly noted, there are actually a few reasons I care about workforce development. For\none, it helps the Fed meet one of the goals set for us by Congress: maximum employment. For\nanother, a better educated and more skilled workforce benefits us all, whether it’s more\n1\n\ninnovation, better goods and services, or additional revenue flowing into the economy. But\nthere’s also my sincere belief that everyone should have a fair shot at success. That means\ndeveloping skills that can help them get there, and apprenticeships are a critical tool.\nI think all areas of training are important, but I’m especially focused on how we address the\nchanging landscape of the American workforce at a pivotal time in history. Now, to be fair,\n“pivotal time in history” is probably one of the most overused speech lines out there. But I\nhonestly believe we’re experiencing a confluence of events that makes the needs and challenges\nof the labor market unique to our time. We’ve endured the biggest crisis since the Great\nDepression, and we’re finally emerging from its shadow. We’re seeing demographic changes —\nlike the first wave of baby boom retirements — that are fundamentally altering the composition\nof the labor force. We’re in the midst of sustained technological change that has indeed disrupted\nmany industries, with apologies for using a buzzword. And we’re seeing a skills gap that’s\naffecting employers and job seekers alike.\nWhile there’s some debate over the extent of the gap, research by my staff shows it is a real\nissue, even in a labor market with very little slack left. And while data are not, I admit, the plural\nof anecdote, I’ve been hearing it from employers across the region as well. They have jobs but\ncan’t find people with the skills to fill them. Meanwhile, there are people who’d love the work\nbut don’t have the training to qualify.\nSkills training in general, and apprenticeships in particular, can help to address this gap. We need\nmore investment, and more involvement, to truly make a difference. And we need a cultural shift\nas well. That won’t necessarily be easy — as someone who spent a lifetime in academia, I can\nattest to the difficulty of cultural change — but it is definitely necessary.\nSomething that’s characterized America since our inception is that we’re incredibly creative. We\nexcel at industries as varied as the physical landscape of the country. We’ve revolutionized so\nmany sectors, and every day we see more examples of how we’re adapting our ways and\nmethods of working to keep up with that change. Yet at the same time, we’ve become more and\nmore rigid about the paths to success. We seem to be locked into the idea that the only way to\naccess and advance in a career is through a four-year degree.\nThat has to change.\n2\n\nThere are many ways to acquire skills. We know now more than ever that people learn in\ndifferent ways. Not everyone is programmed to pick up information in a classroom setting. Not\neveryone wants or needs or should get a traditional bachelor’s degree. And not everyone who\nwants one needs to do so immediately.\nAnd that’s OK. That’s good. We need to stack our workforce with people who think and solve\nand learn differently. Apprenticeships aren’t just an alternative; they’re a smart, first-choice path,\nand we should view them that way. They’ve stood the test of time for a reason.\nApprenticeships go back to ancient Egypt and Babylon; they were so important they were\nenshrined in the Code of Hammurabi back in the 18th century BC.\nFrom the late middle ages, apprenticeships guaranteed a path to employment and maintenance or\nrise in social status. They were a hallmark of the Renaissance and made an important economic\ncontribution during one of the great periods in human history.\nLeonardo da Vinci was an apprentice; so were George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, and Paul\nRevere. There is incredible nobility and history there, and we should celebrate that.\nApprenticeships have changed and adapted to the needs of shifting economic landscapes over\ntime. But some things have persisted, and they are important. First, apprenticeships can be a path\nto economic mobility. The road from apprenticeship to journeyman to artisan is as viable today\nas it was in da Vinci’s time. Second, the required concentration on skill not only maintains the\nquality of a trade, it fosters the kind of expertise that can lead to innovation.\nThe change in attitudes I’d like to see was evident when I visited Roxborough High School last\nyear. They have an Academies program that allows students to pick a course of concentration\nwhile they study the regular curriculum. It’s not an apprenticeship program but shares some of\nthe characteristics, including setting the students up to enter the workforce directly from high\nschool. They can earn a good salary if they want to work for a few years before returning to\nschool, they can work part-time while continuing their education, or they can just start their\nclimb up the professional ladder immediately. Programs like this are a great entryway to what\nmy staff has termed “opportunity occupations”: jobs that pay at or above the median wage but\n3\n\ndon’t require a college degree. They did research with the Cleveland and Atlanta Feds to identify\nnot just where this work is in terms of sector but actually where they are geographically.\nThe students at Roxborough know that the skills they’re getting give them a leg up in the job\nmarket, and I hope that their attitudes toward creative paths to education and training will soon\nbe the prevailing ones. We all have our own ways of getting to the endpoint, and, if we want our\nlabor market running on all cylinders, we need a workforce that is as innovative and creative as\nthe sectors they represent.\nOne of the great things about apprenticeships is that they’re useful at any stage in life. I visited\nPhilly Shipyard a few weeks ago, which has one of the most well-established programs in the\nregion, and met apprentices in their 20s and 30s. One of them was Samantha, who went to art\nschool and has a B.F.A. But she decided she wanted to go down a different path and joined the\napprenticeship program. She’s now one of the top welders. Her creative and innovative talents as\nan artist translated into incredible skill at welding. She loves what she does and, almost as\nimportantly, sees real growth potential and opportunity in the company.\nShe and the rest of the apprentices aren’t just getting the skills to become masters of their trade;\nthey’re getting the sanctuary of seeing a solid path to not just stability but success.\nI grew up in a blue-collar neighborhood in New Jersey, where my sister and I were the first in\nour family to go to college. I could tell you that back then, you could get a high school diploma,\nor go to community college, and still live a comfortable, middle-class life — and that was\ndefinitely true for some people. But it wasn’t true for everyone; some people never had the\naccess to that security or had to work twice as hard. And it’s frankly less achievable for most\npeople now. But I still think it should be a path available to everyone.\nIt’s probably more resonant coming off the July 4 holiday, but the core ethos of the American\ndream — that if you work hard, you can get ahead — is still something quite profound. We just\nneed better ways for people to get there. Skills training and apprenticeships can help.\nHere’s where I go back to being a typical policymaker by plugging my staff’s work: If anyone\nhere wants more information, the Philadelphia Fed has recently published a guide to\napprenticeships in our area to provide private sector organizations with information on how you\n4\n\ncan get involved. Copies are available to everyone, and, since Keith Rolland is responsible, you\ncan corner him and ask him all the questions you want in person. It’s good for the workforce, and\nit’s good for business.\nThank you.\n5",

    "text": "Fintech and Financial Inclusion\nThe Fifth Annual Fintech Conference\nPhiladelphia, PA (virtual)\nNovember 16, 2021\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nFintech and Financial Inclusion\nThe Fifth Annual Fintech Conference\nPhiladelphia, PA (virtual)\nNovember 16, 2021\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nHello! On behalf of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and our partner organizations, I’d like to\nadd my welcome to our Fifth Annual Fintech Conference. It’s great to be here today among such a great\ngroup of speakers and panelists as we discuss the latest developments in financial technologies, their\nimpacts, and the appropriate policy response. I’m particularly delighted to delve into how fintech can\npromote financial inclusion. I know these conversations are of much interest to you whether you\nhappen to be an academic, industry practitioner, regulator, economist ― or, well, a Federal Reserve\nBank president.\nWith that in mind, there is a bit of Federal Reserve policy I need to dispense with before I can continue.\nThat is the standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect\nthose of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or in the Federal Reserve System.\nHistorical Echoes\nWhile we are discussing cutting-edge technologies this week, in a way, many new fintech tools are in\nessence digitized versions of practices that existed in the past. Before the advent of the modern credit\nscore, for instance, lenders took the kind of expansive look at borrowers that open banking today makes\nsignificantly more technologically efficient.\nAnd versions of “buy now pay later” have been in widespread use across Latin America since long before\nwe all became tethered to our cell phones. Or, thought about another way, buy now pay later is actually\nan updated version of Kmart’s old layaway system ― with the main difference being you get the product\nat the beginning of the process rather than at the end.\nAnd yes, I realize I’m dating myself by referring to Kmart.\n1\n\nBut the point is that one of the reasons to be bullish about the widespread adoption of these\ntechnologies is that they have been used successfully in other, more analog, forms in the past. Fintech\nmakes them more efficient and easier to disseminate.\nChallenges and Opportunities\nThere are great opportunities here. New methods of assessing credit through open banking offer the\npossibility of promoting financial inclusion by, for example, expanding the scope of which data lenders\nconsider and how they are used in predicting risk. Why shouldn’t a history of on-time rent or utility\npayments serve to make someone creditworthy? While there are a few exceptions, these are not\nelements included in most credit scores used by most lenders today. Many consumers trying to get their\nfirst loan find themselves in the paradoxical situation of needing to have established credit already in\norder to obtain new credit.\nBut, of course, the level of access that open banking provides also comes with significant risks. Would a\nlender penalize would-be borrowers when he sees they spend money at a dollar store rather than at a\nfancy department store? (Or perhaps vice versa.) All sorts of implicitly biased cultural judgments could\ncome into play here, which would have the perverse effect of perpetuating, rather than mitigating, long-\nstanding patterns of unequal treatment.\nThere is significant historical precedence for this. In the pre-credit score era I alluded to earlier, lenders\nhad a much wider latitude when considering a person’s creditworthiness. But that meant all sorts of\npersonal biases could ― and often did ― play a huge role in allocating credit, with particularly unfair\noutcomes for minority communities.\nFintech in and of itself is value neutral, in other words. It is a tool. And it is a tool that can be used to\npromote financial inclusion, or a tool that can be used to perpetuate long-standing biases. And that is\nbecause, fundamentally, humans are responsible for the way financial technologies operate.\nConsider the question of fintech’s role in allocating credit.\nFintech and Loans\nFintech platforms are increasingly playing a role in issuing loans ― both new stand-alone platforms and\nestablished lenders are using artificial intelligence to make these decisions. But rather than remove\nhuman judgment from the process, these technologies have instead shifted where in the process human\n2\n\njudgment comes in. It used to be at the end: A lender would collect the information she deemed\nnecessary and then render a decision. Today, it comes at the beginning of the process when algorithms\nare being designed and trained.\nThink of all the human judgments that need to be made when training an algorithm.\nFirst, people must be aware of how the data being used to train the algorithm were collected and\ncleaned. And what were their original purposes, given that most of these data were collected for\npurposes other than how they are being used in this particular algorithm? That answer, after all, has\nimplications for the data themselves ― especially given inherent selection biases of commission or\nomission.\nThen there is the question of which determinations will be made by the algorithm. Is it offering a simple\nYes or No on issuing a loan? Or is it also deciding on the size of the credit line, including for an account\nthat already exists? Or is it determining the rate offered? Will it decide who to market loans to? Or what\nmessages to stress when doing that marketing? Does it decide the strategy for managing an existing\naccount that exhibits increasing risk or a departure from the consumer’s normal pattern of using the\naccount? Does it determine who is eligible for a work-out program and on what terms? Is it used to\ndetermine collection strategies for accounts in default? What information is communicated to the\nconsumer about the whys of a decision made by models that many of us view as a black box?\nThe humans in attendance today, in other words, can rest easy: We are not obsolete yet.\nConclusion\nWill fintech platforms promote financial inclusion? They certainly can ― and, in my view, absolutely\nshould. But whether they do this is up to all of us ― industry, academia, our elected leaders, and\nregulators.\nThat’s why this week’s series of conversations is so crucial. So thank you again for joining us.\nAnd now, it is my distinct honor to welcome our next guests, Anthony Eisen and Larry Summers.\nAnthony Eisen is cofounder and CEO of Afterpay. He has more than 25 years of experience in investing,\npublic company directorships, and providing corporate advice across a variety of sectors. Prior to\ncofounding Afterpay, Anthony was the chief investment officer at the Guinness Peat Group, where he\nwas actively involved in a number of financial services, software, and technology companies.\n3\n\nWe’re also thrilled to have Larry Summers with us today. Larry is the Charles W. Eliot University\nProfessor and President Emeritus at Harvard University. In addition to serving as 71st Secretary of the\nTreasury in the Clinton administration, he was director of the White House National Economic Council in\nthe Obama administration, president of Harvard University, and the chief economist of the World Bank.\nSo, thank you again. And now let’s continue with the conference.\n4",

    "text": "The Prosperity Forum:\nEconomic Mobility Research in Action\nPennsylvania Convention Center\nPhiladelphia, PA\nJanuary 18, 2019\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nThe Prosperity Forum: Economic Mobility Research in Action\nPennsylvania Convention Center\nPhiladelphia, PA\nJanuary 18, 2019\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood morning and thank you. It’s a pleasure to be here today for a discussion that’s near and\ndear to my heart: Philadelphia’s path to inclusive and equitable prosperity. It’s an even bigger\npleasure to be doing it in the company of Mayor Nutter, and if I can be even a fraction as\nengaging as he is in front of a crowd, I’ll consider it a job very well done.\nOne thing I can offer that Mayor Nutter won’t is the standard Fed disclaimer, delivered so you\ncan be sure to blame absolutely no one but me for anything I say this morning: The views I\nexpress today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal\nReserve System.\nThis next panel is on “Business, Equity, and the Future of Philadelphia,” which encompasses\nsomething that I think lies at the heart of the economic mobility conversation: The issues we’re\ndiscussing today are not issues that matter exclusively to the individuals, families, or\nneighborhoods they directly affect; they’re issues that matter to all of us, as a city, and they’re\nissues that affect our collective future.\nI was recently in Boston for a conference on economic mobility, and I referred to Philadelphia\nas “the city of champions,” which was brave, I know. Who says Fed officials don’t live on the\nedge? It was clearly an act of hubris anyway …\n1\n\nBut what I meant — and clarified pretty quickly — was the reality everyone here is all too\nfamiliar with: That once again, we outpace the big city competition in terms of deep economic\nneed.\nThat’s not a crown anyone wants to wear, but it’s a fact we have to acknowledge. I don’t,\nhowever, think we should let that reality convince us that nothing can be done to change it or\nthat changes haven’t already been made. And while we have to face the economic facts of the\nmatter, I’d argue that the focus of the discussion should be on the ways we can make a\ndifference, and the work that is already being done, including by the people here today.\nAnd I do mean “we,” because economic mobility in Philadelphia — or anywhere else, for that\nmatter — is something that affects everyone, whether they know it or not. Money may pay\ndeference to neighborhood borders or city limits, but economics doesn’t. We all have skin in\nthis game.\nCities thrive and grow when they attract investment, new businesses, and have a dynamic\nchurn. Influencing factors range from infrastructure like transport, housing, and education to\nquality-of-life considerations like restaurants and cultural events. A huge influence is the local\npool of talent, and when a significant portion of the population has been left behind — when\nthey don’t have access to the training or educational opportunities to participate in that\ndynamism — it affects us all.\nThat’s something that I’m going to keep coming back to: the indispensable element of “we.”\nEverything about the road to changing Philadelphia’s future is steeped in a holistic imperative.\nIt will take a multitude of people from a multitude of sectors taking a multitude of approaches\nto a multitude of issues to really move the needle. I don’t think that’s going to be easy and it\ndefinitely won’t fit on a bumper sticker ... but it is the ethos that underpins this conference and\nthe work that our exceptional partners, speakers, and attendees today are already doing.\nThe title of that panel in Boston was “What Are the Barriers to Economic Mobility and for\nWhom?” and for me, the answer was pretty simple: all of it. This is a vast and intricate and\nmessy economy, and there are too many ways for people to fall through its cracks. We can’t\n2\n\npick one factor and expect it to fix the whole; all those cogs have to move in unison. We need\nsystems change.\nThat change can be hard, because the more complex the machine, the more facets there are to\nbe tuned. Not to mention that the work is far too often siloed. So we need expertise from\nacross the spectrum and we need the kind of thinking that brought us here today; this is how\nwe figure out how to come together as a city to solve problems that affect us all.\nWe at the Philadelphia Fed have been lucky enough to work with partners not just across the\ncity but across our entire District to think about how we best fit into and contribute to that\nprocess. It was one of the driving principles that led us to launch our Economic Growth &\nMobility Project, or EGMP.\nEGMP focuses on the three foundational aspects of mobility: job creation — that is, stable,\nwell-paid jobs that lead to financial security; workforce development — that is, education and\ntraining for people to get those jobs; and infrastructure, which includes everything from\nhousing to transportation to broadband.\nThe Fed can’t make grants or finance projects; it’s not in our congressional remit. What we can\ndo is bring people together and offer sound research.\nSo with the EGMP, we’re forming partnerships around the District, including here in\nPhiladelphia, with communities that are engaged in addressing the systemic issues they face.\nThat community leadership is essential because we can have the best research in the world, but\nwe can’t replicate the knowledge that every community has of its own needs, character, and\nidiosyncrasies. What we contribute is getting the right people there — we call it “the convening\npower of the Fed” — and the research we’ve invested in and built over a sustained period of\ntime. We’re calling these Research in Action Labs, and the outcomes aren’t just good for that\none community; we can take those results, turn them into a toolkit, and hand it to the next city\nor town with a similar problem.\nIn northeastern Pennsylvania, for instance, we had one of the three foundational aspects: jobs\nat fulfillment centers. But we lacked another: infrastructure. The centers are located outside of\n3\n\ntown, and the region was built like most of America in the latter half of the 20th century,\nconstructed to bring commuters from the suburbs and outskirts into the city, not the other way\naround. So we gathered a group of partners, and they came up with a collective set of solutions\nthat worked for them — launching pilot programs, establishing a council on equitable transit,\nand making transit a priority in the area. The Fed can offer research, data, and support, but\ncommunities are the ones that understand their own unique needs. It was the all-hands-on-\ndeck approach that made it successful; we couldn’t have just come in and dictated solutions,\nand we couldn’t have done it with limited voices around the table. We needed community\nleaders, businesses, workers; everyone has a perspective that the rest of us probably didn’t\nthink about.\nThe result is that we’ve already had other areas with similar issues ask about how to replicate\nthe program in their area, and now we can hand them a blueprint.\nAs another example, right here in Philadelphia, we’ve partnered with Philadelphia Works, Social\nFinance, and a local company to change the way we prepare the local workforce for the future\nof work. The pilot is a unique public-private partnership, in which the public sector will provide\ncustomized training and the employer will repay the cost of that training once the outcomes\nare realized.\nOne of the recurring themes in these discussions is that the high-level economic data look really\ngood: low unemployment, high job creation. But that’s a national average that paves over the\nrealities that we see every day in this city. Overall, the economy is doing really well, but that’s\nnot a reality a lot of your clients and a lot of the people we meet with would recognize.\nThis partnership is really representative of the way those two perspectives on the same set of\ndata can come together for a solution that works for everyone. The reality of the tight labor\nmarket means that employers have to start thinking creatively and long term about how they’re\ngoing to address the gaps in their workforces. This is what makes this project stand out: The\nemployer isn’t funding it through its foundation; it’s coming right out of the HR budget. It’s a\nbusiness decision. It’s a clear endorsement of the value of investing in Philadelphia and our\npeople. Skills development is still too often seen as a social service, rather than an investment.\n4\n\nAnd to be clear: It is an investment. Not just for the companies that need an agile, trained\nworkforce, but for the city’s labor pool overall. And when those trainees become new hires,\nthey also become contributors to the Philadelphia economy.\nTo sum up: something of an ode to Philadelphia. This is a great city. But we do face multiple\nissues that need to be addressed, and we can’t do it in isolation. The spirit in which this event\nwas launched — the ethos underpinning much of the work we’re discussing today — is that we\nneed every sector to participate and every problem challenged in unison. It’s a lot of work. But\nif anyone can do it, Philadelphia can. Even if we couldn’t repeat a Super Bowl win this year.\nThere’s always next year …\nThank you.\n5",

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nHello, everybody, and thank you to Matuschka for that introduction. This is a very important discussion,\nand I’m thrilled to be joined by so many of you.\nBut before we begin that very important discussion, I need to give you my standard Fed disclaimer: The\nviews I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal\nOpen Market Committee or in the Federal Reserve System.\nSmall Businesses in the Economy and Our Communities\nIn one sense, it’s gratifying that there is so much interest in the Fed’s COVID-19 Community Impact\nSurvey and the economic effects of the virus more generally.\nBut the strong turnout today is also evidence that months after the coronavirus arrived on our shores\nand shut down vast swaths of the economy, we remain mired in a crisis the likes of which none of us has\never experienced.\nIndeed, even as the economy is reopening in fits and starts, the pandemic’s effects are proving not to be\njust a brief setback. We are in a downturn that is both exceptionally painful and stubbornly long-lasting.\nAmong those most affected by this crisis have been those small businesses across the country that are\nthe lifeblood of our economy ― and of so many of our own communities.\nSmall businesses define the landscape of our cities and towns. Small business owners and their\nemployees are our neighbors, our friends, and oftentimes our family members. They’re our plumbers,\nour grocers, and our barbers. (Though during the COVID-19 shutdown, some of us have become\namateur barbers ourselves.)\n1\n\nSmall businesses also define our economic landscape. The United States certainly boasts more than its\nfair share of corporate titans ― American companies make up for more than a fifth of the Fortune\nGlobal 500 ― but small businesses are integral to our economy and to the functioning of the labor force.\nAccording to the Small Business Administration, as of 2018, there were more than 30 million American\nsmall businesses, employing nearly 60 million people. That means that nearly half of the country’s\nprivate workforce is employed by small businesses. Small businesses are also an engine for building a\nmore racially equitable economy: More than 8 million small businesses are owned by racial minorities.\nAmong small businesses, microenterprises ― those employing fewer than five people ― predominate.\nNationally, some 59 percent of businesses are microenterprises. Here in the Third District, we are\nparticularly sensitive to the concerns of these vital businesses.\nIn the City of Philadelphia, fully 99.5 percent of businesses are small businesses, meaning they employ\nfewer than 500 people. And of those, 54 percent employ fewer than five.\nSmall Business and the Pandemic\nWhen the COVID-19 crisis hit, the economy was in quite good shape. But even then, many of our small\nbusinesses, especially those helmed by racial and ethnic minorities, faced a precarious existence.\nAccording to Fed research, at the end of 2019, smaller firms, younger firms, and firms owned by Blacks\nor Latinos were more likely to be classified as “at risk” or “distressed” than other businesses.\nAnd even those firms deemed financially healthy were often on a knife’s edge. Late last year, the Fed\nfound that only 1 in 5 healthy small businesses ― and of course, far fewer less-healthy firms ― had\nsufficient cash reserves to continue normal operations if they experienced a two-month revenue loss. A\nmajority of small businesses of any level of health would be likely to reduce their workforce and\noperations, or delay payments, we found. Many firms would rely on personal funds or debt to bridge the\ngap.\nAnd some said they would try to sell or close their businesses altogether.\nSo while it’s tragic news, it ultimately isn’t surprising that small businesses owned by minorities have\nbeen disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 crisis.\nWhen we think about the challenges these businesses have historically faced as a result of the racial\nwealth gap, it becomes more understandable why minority-owned businesses are in the most\n2\n\nprecarious financial situations. Just recently, the National Bureau of Economic Research found that the\nnumber of Black-owned small businesses nationwide has collapsed by a stunning 41 percent since the\nonset of the coronavirus crisis.\nAnd at the Philadelphia Fed, our research has found that the disproportionate impact does not just fall\non minorities who own small businesses, but among those who work for them as well.\nThose who have lost jobs within small businesses because of the COVID-19 pandemic have been\ndisproportionately young, disproportionately less educated, and are more likely to be a member of a\nracial or ethnic minority. Compounding the tragedy is the fact that racial minorities have also been\ndisproportionately affected by the disease itself, with Blacks and Latinos in particular suffering from\nhigher death rates than other groups.\nSmall Business and Banking\nBack in March, Congress passed the CARES Act, which included the Paycheck Protection Program, or\nPPP. PPP was designed so that small businesses could obtain largely forgivable loans if they kept workers\non their payroll through the crisis.\nThere is no doubt that PPP was an immense help to millions of businesses and that the employment\ncrisis would be far worse without it. PPP has proven to be something of a blunt instrument, however.\nFed researchers have found, for instance, no direct correlation between the disbursement of PPP loans\nand the level of infection in a given area. The State of Nebraska, for example, which has been left\nrelatively unscathed by the coronavirus, has a far higher rate of small businesses receiving PPP loans\nthan those in hard-hit New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.\nI think a big part of the problem is that the distribution of PPP loans was predicated on having existing\nbanking relationships. Basically, small businesses went to the bank they had borrowed from before in\norder to get a PPP loan.\nThe trouble is that many small businesses, especially those microenterprises we’ve been talking about,\ndon’t have those established banking relationships ― many have never banked at all. And so, when PPP\nloans became available, these business owners had no ability to access them. This is a problem that has\ndisproportionately affected racial minorities and communities of color.\nThere are many historical and structural reasons why so many of our microenterprises remain\nunbanked. But that doesn’t mean that this is a status quo we have to accept. This is why we launched a\n3\n\nseries on equity in recovery: identifying those who are most at risk and putting them at the center of our\nwork.\nAcross the System, something we should all be thinking about is this: How do we solve this problem?\nWhat are the existing impediments to those microenterprises having access to the banking system? How\ncan we harness our country’s CDFIs, large banks and community banks, and even microloan financiers\nand other financial institutions to serve our under-resourced communities and entrepreneurs?\nThis isn’t just a problem to be diagnosed ― it’s one to work together to solve.\nI’ve said many times that I refuse to call this current period of crisis “the new normal.” None of this is\nnormal. But that doesn’t mean that when the COVID-19 pandemic passes that we are destined to go\nback to the old normal. Together, we can chart our way to a “better normal” ― and discussions like\nthese are going to be a part of that important task.\nThank you, again, and now I’m happy to take some questions.\n4",

Harker\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily\nthose of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\nWelcoming Remarks\nEnergy Interdependence in the Western Hemisphere Conference\nHosted by the Global Interdependence Center\nBoehne Auditorium\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia Building\nNovember 5, 2015\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood morning and welcome to the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. The Philadelphia Fed\nstaff and colleagues throughout the Federal Reserve System have had a long relationship with\nthe Global Interdependence Center, or the GIC. For nearly 40 years, Fed policymakers have\nparticipated in GIC meetings around the world, sharing interests in many of the economic\ntopics that drive the world’s economy.\nWe are glad to have the GIC as good neighbors and as colleagues whose good work serves so\nmany around the world.\nWe are delighted to provide the venue today for the GIC’s conference on Energy\nInterdependence in the Western Hemisphere. I am particularly pleased to see a combination of\nengineering and economic perspectives, given my background prior to joining the Philadelphia\nFed in July.\nMy Ph.D. is in civil and urban engineering, with masters’ degrees in engineering and economics,\nso as you can imagine, today’s agenda piqued my interest on a number of fronts. Many of the\ntopics you will be discussing today are at the intersection of energy and the economy, and I\nwould have likely found them on my syllabus for courses in either academic discipline.\nThis topic of energy also is important to me because I am a native son of this region, and I have\nwatched as energy has become so important to economic growth here in the Third District. I\nhave served on the operating committee of Select Greater Philadelphia, the marketing arm of\n1\n\nour Chamber of Commerce, and I know that companies that want to locate here spend time\nthinking about the energy issues you will be discussing today.\nIn January 2015, the Philadelphia Fed asked manufacturers what effect lower energy prices had\non their businesses. Nearly two-thirds (63 percent) of the firms reported positive effects, while\n16 percent reported negative effects. A majority of manufacturers reported that falling energy\nprices were lowering the costs of production and increasing sales margins.\nI believe the Third District has a role to play in the interdependent world of energy in our\nWestern Hemisphere. Energy has influenced the regional economy in recent years, especially\nwith the Marcellus Shale natural gas fields in Pennsylvania. According to a 2014 Bureau of Labor\nStatistics report, Pennsylvania grew from being the tenth largest state for employment in oil\nand natural gas in 2007 to being the sixth largest state in 2012. It also has had the second-\nlargest employment increase over that same period, second only to Texas.1\nYet, we should not oversell its promise. The Philadelphia Fed’s regional economic team notes\nthat in our tristate economy, mining has experienced a 6.7 percent annualized job growth rate\nfrom December 2007 through December 2014, mostly attributable to the Marcellus Shale\nboom. But the sector still only represents 0.4 percent — less than one-half of 1 percent — of\ntotal employment.\nAnd through meetings and studies within our local areas, the Philadelphia Fed’s Community\nDevelopment Studies & Education Department has highlighted the challenges that Marcellus\nShale has had on local economies, including housing shortages during the boom years.2\n1 Bureau of Labor Statistics, Monthly Labor Review, February 2014. “The Marcellus Shale gas boom in Pennsylvania:\nemployment and wage trends” available at http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2014/article/the-marcellus-shale-gas-\nboom-in-pennsylvania.htm.\n2 Kelsey, Timothy W., and Thomas B. Murphy, “Economic Implications of Natural Gas Drilling in the Marcellus Shale\nRegion,” article in Cascade: No. 77, Spring/Summer 2011, available at\nhttps://www.philadelphiafed.org/community-development/publications/cascade/77/01_economic-implications-\nof-gas-drilling-in-marcellus-shale.\n2\n\nThe robust natural gas drilling that carried this region through the worst of the Great Recession\nhas likely plateaued in the past few years. Yet, with the energy currently in the ground, we\nknow it will be a factor for decades to come as we continue to tap known sources and build the\ninfrastructure to bring natural gas to market and eventually find new ways to use this energy to\ndrive our economy.\nWhile at the University of Delaware and before that as dean of the Wharton School of the\nUniversity of Pennsylvania, I sought opportunities to ensure that these institutions innovated\nwith their communities. At the University of Delaware, we launched several initiatives,\nincluding the development of a Science, Technology and Advanced Research (STAR) Campus\nthat has become a center of innovation, focused on research in areas such as health science,\ncybersecurity, and alternative energy. We also built an Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering\nLaboratory on campus. The 194,000-square-foot laboratory building, which was the first newly\nconstructed laboratory in nearly 20 years on the campus, brings together students and faculty\nfrom various disciplines to teach, learn, and conduct research in a collaborative environment\nabout real-world problems, including alternative energy. The building is also home to the\nUniversity of Delaware Energy Institute, the Delaware Environmental Institute, and the\nCatalysis Center for Energy Innovation.\nWhile not every institution can build a laboratory, I believe that organizations such as the GIC\nand the Philadelphia Fed can play important roles by convening the right expertise to discuss\nthese issues, to be the laboratory of ideas, if you will.\nToday’s program is just such an opportunity. You will have an exciting mix of speakers, including\nthe Honorable Carlos I. Giralt-Cabrales, Consul of Mexico in Philadelphia, who will speak this\nafternoon.\nThis morning, you are scheduled to hear from, among others, Philip Rinaldi, CEO of Philadelphia\nEnergy Solutions and chair of the Greater Philadelphia Energy Action Team; Dean Joseph\nHughes from the Drexel Institute for Energy and the Environment; and Mine Yücel, senior vice\n3\n\npresident and director of research for the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, who has written\nextensively about energy and the economy.\nThis is not the first, or the last, energy cycle for the region. Just remember Titusville, PA, where\nthe first oil well was drilled in 1896, or even earlier, the anthracite mines that fueled the\nrailroads, or even more recently, the refineries that operated in my lifetime along the Delaware\nRiver here in Philadelphia. The task for every era is to ensure that we all work together to drive\ninnovation by bringing together the right blend of science, technology, business, and\ncommunity leaders to foster growth and economic development to use the resources wisely.\nWith that, I will turn the podium over to our colleagues at the GIC and hope you enjoy the\ndiscussion that will follow. Thank you.\n4",

Harker\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily\nthose of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\nWelcoming Remarks: Camden Promise Zone Initiative Meeting\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, FDIC, City of Camden,\nand Camden Redevelopment Agency\nWaterfront Technology Center\nCamden, NJ\nApril 8, 2016\nPresident Patrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nIntroduction\nGood morning. Thank you for coming out today to discuss the Community Reinvestment Act\n(CRA) and the White House Promise Zone Initiative: Camden Promise Zone.\nI would like to thank our partners for helping to organize today’s gathering: the FDIC, the\nCamden Redevelopment Agency, and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.\nFinally, thank you, Mayor Dana Redd, and the City of Camden for welcoming us here to discuss\nthe exciting goals of the White House Promise Zone Initiative. We look forward to discussing\nhow locally developed plans can leverage private-sector investments that can create jobs and\nincrease long-standing economic health.\nThe Community Reinvestment Act\nI was born and raised right next door in Gloucester City, and my mother called North Camden\nher home as a child and young adult. Since I am a South Jersey native, it is wonderful to see all\nof the recent momentum and investment in the City of Camden.\nYou can see that anchor institutions, new businesses, and the city’s residents are all engaged in\nthe effort to revitalize and transform this great city. The bustle of the downtown area — and on\ncampus — tells us something new is happening.\n1\n\nI have spent most of my life in the Third District, so it is an honor to give back to the region via\nmy role at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.\nThe Federal Reserve Bank plays many roles throughout the Third District, which comprises\neastern Pennsylvania, South Jersey, and Delaware. But in all we do, we must follow the goals of\nour dual mandate and that is to maximize employment and stabilize prices.\nOne of the critical functions we play involves regulating banks and serving as a resource to\nthem in their ever-changing environment. Our cosponsor today ― the FDIC ― is also\nresponsible for regulating banks, as is the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which\nexamines national banks. Among our other responsibilities, we are all tasked with ensuring that\nour financial institutions are meeting their requirements under the Community Reinvestment\nAct or CRA.\nAs you all know, the CRA is an affirmative obligation for banks to lend, invest, and provide\nservices where they operate. This includes help to low- and moderate-income communities as\nwell as to low- and moderate-income individuals.\nThe CRA is both community focused and results oriented. Today, you will hear about some of\nthe programs that have leveraged CRA capital to help revitalize communities and provide\nopportunity to residents. To support economic transformation in underserved communities,\nbanks have used their CRA capital to partner with nonprofits and community development\nfinancial institutions.\nCamden\nToday, we will focus specifically on the impact of capital on building economically healthy and\nsustainable communities.\nThrough a small business loan, local entrepreneurs in Camden can provide for their families\nwhile increasing jobs for local residents. Such job creation can also revitalize the city.\nThrough an affordable mortgage, a young couple can fulfill their dream of becoming\nhomeowners. As they build equity in their homes, they are creating wealth they can rely on in\n2\n\nthe future. And ― through their purchase ― they are making an investment in the city that will\nhave a tremendous impact on the next generation of Camden residents.\nThrough a partnership with a community development financial institution, the creation of a\ngrocery store, a housing development, a child-care facility, or a federally qualified health clinic\ncan become a reality.\nAs you will hear from Mayor Redd and others, now is a critical time in Camden’s history. The\nfederal government, prominent corporations, and others are becoming more aware of the\ngreat opportunities for investment here.\nSo, how do financial institutions more effectively engage in efforts that can benefit current\nCamden residents? And how can this be done while investments continue to support major\nchanges going on in the city?\nOne way might be via the CRA. It is a tool that can ensure Camden has access to the resources it\nneeds. This capital can provide pathways to all kinds of opportunities benefiting families,\nneigborhoods, and the city as a whole.\nToday’s Event\nToday’s event will explore this option in more depth. We will also see where Camden is heading\nas the city begins to implement plans that have been developed through collaborative\nleadership.\nFinally, panel discussions will provide examples of programs and solutions that have leveraged\nCRA loans, both locally and throughout other regions.\nConclusion\nLater today, I will take a tour of the city and will meet with public, private, and nonprofit\nleaders to learn more about their work and future plans.\n3\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia looks forward to using what we learn today ― and\nworking with you ― to support the leaders of this city in their efforts to foster a strong, vibrant,\nand inclusive economy.\nSo, once again, I want to thank you for being here for this important conversation.\n4",

    "text": "Keynote Address: The Economic Outlook\nCentral Bucks Chamber of Commerce\nIvyland, PA\nJanuary 12, 2018\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nKeynote Address: The Economic Outlook\nCentral Bucks Chamber of Commerce\nIvyland, PA\nJanuary 12, 2018\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood afternoon and thank you. I have to say that I’m a native son of the Fed’s Third District, and\nI’m always pleased to travel around, especially to places like beautiful Bucks County. That said,\nthe winter months make me wonder what it’s like to be president of the Dallas Fed …\nWe’ve just exited the season of looking back — of year-end recaps, of “the best and worst of\n2017,” and enough top-ten lists to make your head spin. So, in the spirit of the new year, I’d like\nto take the opportunity to look forward instead.\nOf course, in giving my outlook, I’m aware that we’re standing in week two of 2018, and\nDecember — when the next round of “the year in review” commences — is very far away. Still,\nI have my forecast at least penciled in as well as some areas I’ll be watching for development.\nNow is the perfect time to note, with the standard Fed disclaimer, that the views I express today\nare mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\nWith that caveat firmly in place, I’ll start with the outlook.\nThe Outlook\nThat outlook is, by most measures, pretty good. We’re headed into the ninth year of the\nexpansion, and we’ve maintained a steady momentum.\nRegarding growth, I’ve revised my forecast up slightly for 2018. Factoring in fiscal policy, I see\nGDP growth averaging just under 2½ percent for the year, and then dropping a little lower, to 2.2\npercent, for 2019.\nOn the employment side of our mandate, things are looking robust. Unemployment stands at 4.1\npercent, the lowest in 17 years, and a variety of other indicators show a labor market with very\nlittle slack left.\nThe U6 measure of unemployment, which casts a wider net to include marginally attached\nworkers and people who are working part time for economic reasons, has also moved back down\nto prerecession lows at 8.1 percent.\n1\n\nQuits and job turnover rates are high, and the most common feedback I’m getting is that\nbusinesses are having a difficult time filling positions.\nIn fact, of the things to watch in 2018, it’s the shortage of workers, rather than jobs, that I’ll be\nkeeping an eye on.\nOf course, that’s the 30,000-foot view. I’m well aware that the numbers we analyze and debate\nare more nuanced in such a multifaceted country than the macro view would indicate. Though\nmy District is the smallest in the Federal Reserve System — covering about two-thirds of\nPennsylvania from Johnstown and east, southern New Jersey, and all of Delaware — it\nencompasses the spectrum of economic fortunes. There are some areas that are still struggling,\nand some areas that are booming.\nOn a local level, this is one of the areas that is doing well. Looking at the Montgomery-Bucks-\nChester County Metro Division, overall labor market conditions have been solid for some time,\nand the unemployment rate is below the state average. Job growth was driven largely by sectors\nsuch as Professional and Business Services, Financial Services, and Education and Health.\nTurning to inflation, that’s the one area of marginal concern in an otherwise solid economy as it\ncontinues to run below target, not just at home, but abroad. I often note that this is something that\nonly central bankers and policymakers seem to have an issue with. If you ask the average person\non the street, or the average business owner, he’s likely to think low inflation is great. But for the\npolicy wonks, we do want to see it rise. The Fed has a target of 2 percent average inflation, and\nit’s been a few years since we’ve hit that mark.\nI expect inflation in the U.S. to continue to run just under our mark this year, rise a bit above\ntarget in 2019, and then come back down to our 2 percent goal the following year. But\nprojections are only that — projections — and I’m more guarded in my view about the path of\ninflation than I am about economic activity.\nFor that reason — and this is the part people always care about the most — I see two rate\nincreases as the likely appropriate path for 2018. Of course, I’ll continue to monitor the data as\nthey roll in, but that’s the view in the first month of the new year.\nAs I noted, the beginning of the new year is a chance to look forward. And the beginning of 2018\nmarks something of a new point in the journey of modern economic history. We talk frequently\nabout the “new normal” when it comes to the economy and to monetary policy; it’s perhaps the\nmost overused phrase in this context. But just because something has become cliché doesn’t\nmean it’s not accurate. The truth is, things are unlikely to return to what we considered their\nrelative norms before the recession.\n2\n\nThere are, therefore, a few issues on the horizon that I’m keeping my eye on. None of them are\nlikely to cause disruption — to be frank, most of them would make for boring conversation —\nbut they are facets of what the landscape will likely look like.\nUnwinding the Balance Sheet\nThe first is that, as you know, we are unwinding the Fed’s balance sheet. You also likely know\nhow it got to its current size but as a quick reminder: In the aftermath of the financial crisis and\nsubsequent recession, the Fed turned to extraordinary monetary policy, the most well-known —\nand definitely the most discussed — being quantitative easing, or QE. During the three rounds\nwe engaged in, QE involved buying more and different assets than our usual practice of holding\nmostly short-term Treasuries. We purchased longer-term Treasuries and bought mortgage-\nbacked securities as well. That swelled the balance sheet to approximately $4.5 trillion,\nsignificantly larger than the roughly $900 billion before the crisis. Additionally, because of the\ninfusion of mortgage-backed securities, the balance sheet as a whole looks quite different now.\nOnce we ended the purchases, in late 2014, we simply reinvested the proceedings as they\nreached maturity to keep the balance sheet constant.\nLast October, we began to taper reinvestments in a step to further normalize monetary policy.\nWe will continue to let assets fall off, until the balance sheet reaches whatever the new normal is.\nThe first thing to note is that we are not yet sure what that eventual size will be. We are in a\ndifferent economy than the one before the crisis, so it won’t look the same as it did in, say, 2006.\nThe economy has grown since then, and the Fed’s balance sheet has always grown with the\nnominal economy. The second thing to note is that we haven’t faced exactly this type of\nnormalization before; no one has. The third thing to note is that this won’t be anywhere near as\ndramatic as the first two things might make it sound. This will be a slow, mechanical process,\nand we are essentially letting the balance sheet unwind in the background. We will, of course,\nkeep an eye on it, and if any shock to the economic system occurs, we’ll revisit our plans. But\nfundamentally, this is perhaps the most boring function of current monetary policy. Still, it is\nnew and will be an aspect of policy for this and the next few years or so.\nThe Yield Curve\nThe second issue I’m watching is the yield curve, and I’m sure I’m not alone in this room. My\nassessment is that the worries so far have been inflated. Again, for the uninitiated, the yield curve\ntraces the difference in the rates of return on shorter- versus longer-term securities. The closer\nthe rates get, the flatter the curve. A flattening yield curve can reflect the market’s assessment of\neconomic conditions, so a flattening is often thought to be a precursor to a downward shift in\noverall economic conditions. However, that’s not a law of economic nature by any means, and\nconsumer confidence is, in fact, high at the moment.\n3\n\nThe situation we’re in now is not the same as, for instance, the inversion of the yield curve\nassociated with the ’70s and ’80s, although it does bear some resemblance to the flattening in the\nmid-2000s. One concern may be that financial institutions lengthen terms of loans and\ninvestment in a search for yield. But I think the continued removal of accommodation will help\nsomewhat, and, overall, I don’t think it’s in need of more stringent monitoring than other\ndevelopments.\nLow R* and Policy Implications\nFinally, what I think is the most important issue right now is that the new economic world we’re\nentering may force policymakers to reevaluate our targets.\nThere has been a lot of research lately, including by my colleagues at the Board of Governors\nand other Reserve Banks, indicating that natural rates of interest may be lower than what’s been\ntypical in the past.\nWhile we talk about the Fed “raising interest rates,” what we actually mean is that the Federal\nReserve sets the federal funds rate — or, more specifically, the range of the fed funds rate. That’s\nthe rate that banks lend to each other for short periods, generally overnight. That rate tends to\ninfluence overall interest rates, which is why the shorthand is generally acceptable for\ndiscussion. Then there is the natural rate of interest, or r* (r-star). This is the short-term rate of\ninterest at which monetary policy neither inhibits nor encourages growth or inflation. R* is a\nfunction of economic variables and forces, such as, for instance, productivity, which is out of the\nFed’s control.\nMarket interest rates have been trending downward for years, starting long before the recession\nand appearing to have continued through the crisis and the current expansion. If it is the case that\nwe are in a low r* world right now — and are likely to stay there for some time — that puts us in\nsomething of a bind because it means we’re closer to what’s known as the zero lower bound.\nThat is, the Fed can’t lower the feds fund rate much further than zero. So, if the natural rate of\ninterest is lower, we have a smaller window in which to deploy rate moves, which is our primary\nmonetary policy tool. That, in turn, means we have less policy ammunition in the event of an\nunexpected turn of events or, worse, a full-blown crisis. We can only play the hand we’re dealt,\nand fed funds can only operate within the scope that the natural funds rate allows.\nIf it is the case that we’re in a low r* environment, and one that is likely to last for a decent\namount of time, it could be difficult to meet our inflation target. If that were to happen, it could\nimpact inflation expectations, further complicating the issue. Inflation can fall victim to a self-\nfulfilling prophecy: One of economics’ idiosyncrasies is that market expectations of low inflation\ncan actually contribute to making it happen.\n4\n\nIn that case, we at the Fed could be forced to rethink our policies. I am not — for the record and\nto be very clear — suggesting that we should. I am saying that if the possibilities we are\ncurrently debating turn out to be the new reality, then that is one option that is on the table.\nIn such a scenario, I have no particular option I’d prefer, but I would expect that the economics\nprofession in general, and the Fed in particular, would debate them fully and equally. Ultimately,\nit’s a question for the economics profession, and, if nothing else, I hope that the already\nsubstantial body of academic work gets even more robust.\nThat’s the list of things I’m watching in 2018. It’s a relatively short one, but it contains within it\na lot of possible discussions. In having those, I’ll give a final thought on what I see as important\nfor 2018, and that is how and when we have those discussions.\nOne of the lessons we’ve learned most acutely over the past decade is the importance of clear,\nconcise communication.\nAs an example, the taper tantrum of 2013 showed us very clearly that what we think we’re\ncommunicating as policymakers, and what markets hear, are sometimes two different things. By\ncontrast, our communications about unwinding the balance sheet came early, often, and almost\nvia bullhorn. The markets heard us and more or less yawned; they knew what to expect.\nSo, to wrap up: There’s a lot on the horizon for monetary policy in 2018. It will be a time of\ntransition and change, but one that I expect, overall, to go smoothly. We’ve learned the lessons\nof the past and are being thoughtful and watchful as the year unfolds. While it should be a year\nof developments, it should also be a boring one.\nThank you.\n5",

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nThe United States and the Global Economic Outlook\nAmerican Economic Association\n2018 ASSA Annual Meeting\nPhiladelphia, PA\nJanuary 5, 2018\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThank you, it’s a pleasure to be here, particularly in such good company. People start paying a\nlot less attention to Fed presidents when we roll off our voting positions, so maybe some of the\nlimelight from my esteemed fellow panelists will fall on me.\nI’ve been asked today to share my views on the U.S. economic outlook and the appropriate\nstance for monetary policy over the near term. That part about “my views” is an excellent segue\nto the standard Fed disclaimer that I’m sure you’ve already heard enough times to know by heart:\nThe views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in\nthe Federal Reserve System.\nJohn Kenneth Galbraith takes the honor of probably the most quoted — and some might say the\nmost accurate — line about economic forecasting, which is that it exists to make astrology look\nrespectable.\nJokes aside, we’re in a time and place in the arc of economic history — both domestically and\nglobally — that renders prediction slightly more difficult. I’m a firm believer in the Fed’s mantra\nof being data driven, and 2018 is, for me, a year to be in monitoring mode.\nSo, rather than go into a lengthy disquisition, and, in the spirit of the new year’s call to be more\nperfect people, I’m going to keep to my time today and just give a brief overview of where I\nthink we’re heading and what I’ll be watching.\nI see growth of a little under 2½ percent for the year.\n1\n\nI see a labor market with very little slack left. I expect the unemployment rate to stay low before\nticking back up a few tenths of a percentage point sometime after this year.\nJob creation will slow and should dip to around 100,000 a month by the end of 2019, but that’s\nto be expected, and it’s more than enough to keep pace with population growth.\nInflation continues to run below target, not just in the U.S. but in countries across the globe.\nDomestically, I expect inflation will run a bit above target in 2019 and come down to target the\nfollowing year, but I am more hesitant in this view than I am on economic activity. If soft\ninflation persists, it may pose a significant problem, which I’ll get to shortly.\nFor that reason, my own view is that two rate increases are likely to be appropriate for 2018.\nOf course, I’ll continue to monitor the data as they roll in, but that’s the view as we start out the\nnew year.\nAside from inflation having stayed persistently under target for longer than we forecast, there is a\nlot to watch generally, and much of it, in some form or another, is new territory. The phrase the\n“new normal” has become so common that it’s almost cliché, but that doesn’t mean it’s not an\naccurate assessment of the current situation. I don’t see any of it as particularly disruptive, but\nit’s new nonetheless.\nWe are unwinding the largest balance sheet in Fed history, and, largely because of the infusion of\nMBS during QE, it also looks different than it did before the recession. This normalization has,\nand will continue to be, one of the most boring functions of monetary policy — and aside from\nthose of us gathered here today, not a lot of people consider monetary policy a barn burner of a\nsubject in the first place. It will unwind mechanically in the background and, because it has been\nso well communicated, should have minimal effects going forward. Still, it’s new territory.\nI’m also keeping an eye on the yield curve. I think worries so far have been a little inflated, and I\ndon’t think the situation we’re in now is analogous to the inversion associated with the\nstagflation of the ’70s and ’80s. It does bear some resemblance to the flattening in the mid-\n2000s. Overall, I’m keeping the same watchful eye that I am on a lot of other developments, but\nI think the removal of accommodation will help somewhat, and I don’t think it warrants shouting\n“fire” in a crowded theater.\n2\n\nThe most important issue on the table right now is that we need to consider the possibility of a\nnew economic normal that forces us to reevaluate our targets. There has been a lot of research\nlately, including by my colleagues at the Board of Governors and other Reserve Banks,\nsuggesting that we may just be in a low r* (r-star) environment right now.\nMarket interest rates have been trending downward for years, starting long before the recession\nand appearing to have continued through the crisis and the current expansion. That obviously\npulls us closer to the zero lower bound and leaves us with less policy ammunition in an\nunexpected turn of events or, worse, a full-blown crisis. We can only play the hand we’re dealt,\nand fed funds can only operate within the scope that the natural funds rate allows.\nThe conundrum of central banking, and the Fed in particular, is that while monetary policy is an\nimportant tool, it’s a blunt one and is limited by the environment in which it’s conducted. When\npeople talk about the Fed being the most important body in the economy, I have to laugh a little;\nit’s important, absolutely. But we are a single factor in a massive machine with multiple moving\nparts.\nSo, if it is the case that we’re in a low r* environment and one that is likely to last for a decent\namount of time, will we have to start discussing other options? In such an environment, and with\na symmetric loss function, it may be difficult to meet our inflation objective. Relatively frequent\noccurrences of zero lower bound constraints may imply that inflation will, on average, run below\n2 percent rather than above it. In that scenario, inflation expectations could trend down, making\nit even more difficult to meet our target. It may, therefore, be time to reevaluate the way we\nconduct policy. I should be clear that I’m not pushing for any changes, nor do I have any\nparticular change I would prefer.\nBut it is a question for the profession itself, and we do need people thinking about this. I’d add\nthat if and when that discussion arises, we need to be seriously considering the various\nalternatives — whether it’s inflation targeting, price-level targeting, or asymmetric loss functions\n— and not fixating on one without serious academic debate about the others.\nThe last thing I’d add is that of the various lessons of the past decade, the importance of\ncommunication will apply here. One of the key lessons of the taper tantrum, which was\nconfirmed by the announcement that we’d be normalizing the balance sheet, is that the way we\n3\n\nsignal our intention to the markets and public is essential. I wasn’t a Fed president in 2013, but I\nwas on the board of directors at the Philadelphia Fed, and we were surprised by the market’s\nreaction. Consequently, we took pains to communicate early and often — we did everything\nshort of putting it in skywriting — that we were planning to start unwinding. When we did, the\nmarkets shrugged.\nThis is important because, as a colleague of mine points out, something like an asymmetric loss\nfunction is easy to explain in an economic research paper; it’s harder to communicate to markets\nand the public. Whatever steps we may ultimately take in the future, communication has to be\npart of it.\nIn keeping with my promise, I’m going to end it there. I think the areas to watch, discuss,\nresearch, and evaluate are a relatively short list in and of themselves. The conversations,\nhowever, are myriad.\n4",

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nI should start my remarks with the traditional “thank yous,” and first on that list has to be\nTheresa and her team ― Theresa is an outstanding voice and mind on community development\n― and I’m so proud to have all of them here at the Philadelphia Fed.\nI’d also like to thank our partners Susan Wachter and The Institute for Urban Research at the\nUniversity of Pennsylvania.\nThanks are also due to the Community Development teams at all the Federal Reserve Banks that\nhelped organize this event — Philadelphia, of course, and Atlanta, Boston, Cleveland,\nMinneapolis, New York, Richmond, and St. Louis. Thanks for all your hard work.\nAnd finally, thank you to everyone for coming. The Reinventing Our Communities conference is\nour signature Community Development event, and many of you have been attending for years.\nThis, however, is my first one. I’ve listened to some exceptional presenters and attendees and\nheard some great questions and even better answers.\nTransforming Our Economies\nI just want to take a few final minutes to talk about the past three days and share some thinking\nabout the Philadelphia Fed’s plans in this arena.\nCommunity development work is important for a number of reasons, not the least of which being\nthat what the Fed does and how we do it is a mystery to a lot of people. Despite what many\n1\n\npeople think, the Fed actually has a fairly limited set of tools, and the only policy we set is\nmonetary policy. We don’t deal with taxes or spending or debts or deficits — except to the extent\nthat they affect the overall economy.\nBut we do help banks meet their Community Reinvestment Act requirements, and we have a\nsingular role in brokering relationships between funders and organizations that can use the\nfinancial help. This sounds like an odd role for policy geeks, but it actually makes perfect sense.\nThe goal of the Fed is to create the conditions in which economic growth can thrive. One way to\nencourage that growth is by ensuring every part of the country — every community, every\nindividual — has a chance to become economically self-sustaining.\nSome people might question why this should matter, especially if they’re not directly affected by\npoverty. Or they may think the time and money these organizations are expending could be\nbetter used somewhere else. So, why should they care? Why should the Fed care?\nAside from my personal view that we have a moral imperative to ensure that everyone has a fair\nchance at success, there’s a practical argument as well. Regions are best off when all their\nconstituent areas do well. Our own economic fates are informed by our neighbors’. And the\ninvestments we make now to alleviate poverty — be they pre-K education or adult skills training\n— will come back to us all. That’s why we call it an investment. We’re helping to create the next\nworkforce, the next engine of the American economy, the next wave of educators and engineers.\nNot to mention the people who’ll be contributing to the economy — and our Social Security —\nwhen we’ve all retired. Making sure everyone has a level playing field just makes good\neconomic sense.\nAgenda on Poverty and Prosperity\nThat’s why I’m delighted to announce that the Philadelphia Fed will be leading an effort to bring\nnational attention to poverty and the ways in which it influences economic growth and\nprosperity.\nWe’re calling it the Agenda on Poverty and Prosperity, an intensive research initiative to better\nunderstand how poverty affects the economy, to inform policymakers, and to use our findings to\npromote economic mobility. We will sponsor work on inclusive growth, tapping the nation’s best\n2\n\neconomic minds and research and pairing them with lessons gleaned from practitioners’ on-the-\nground experience.\nWe’ll conduct and share research, host an online information and data tool for the public, and\ninform Federal Reserve System leadership about our findings.\nAdditionally, we’ll be encouraging investment in strategies that promote development and\ninclusion. Over the next three years, we will host a series of Economic Research in Action Labs.\nTop economic researchers will present their findings to leaders from the public, private,\nnonprofit, and philanthropic sectors in our District to help inform policy solutions.\nFinally, we will continue to reach out to private sector partners for their thoughts, and, of course,\ntheir resources, connecting them to practitioners who can put them to use.\nI want Philadelphia to be a leader in this work because I see it as a fundamental part of the long-\nterm economic health of the region and the country.\nConclusion\nEconomies evolve, and approaches to growth and stability have to change with them. We can’t\nwish for the resurgence of an economy long past; we have to adapt to new realities and use the\nlessons we’ve learned over time to usher in that new era — ideally one in which everybody can\nbenefit. Each of you here today has played a part in gathering the information, relating the\nlessons, and making the strides that have gotten us this far. I’m grateful for your work and hope\nthat we’ll see some of you in this room presenting your research at one of our labs.\nFor now, I thank everyone again — for attending, for providing thoughtful and enlightening\nconversation, and, of course, for putting it all together.\nThank you.\n3",

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nThe Opportunities of a Tight Labor Market\n2020 Lyons CEEE Economic Forecast\nUniversity of Delaware\nNewark, DE\nFebruary 10, 2020\nPresident Patrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood afternoon, and it is a pleasure to be here with you and to also be back on my old stomping\ngrounds of the University of Delaware. Being here again feels like Groundhog Day — but without Sonny\nand Cher singing on the radio.\nAnother thing that feels like Groundhog Day is the usual disclaimer I say over and over again: The views I\nexpress today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee or across the Federal Reserve System.\nWith that out of the way, let me outline my remarks today. I will start with my outlook for the economy\n— which I know takes on greater significance since I am a voting member this year of the Federal Open\nMarket Committee. My outlook for the economy — specifically for the labor market — ties into the final\nsection of my speech: workforce development. In my view, with the labor market the tightest it has\nbeen in decades, now is the time to create new approaches to how companies hire, train, and retain\nemployees and how the U.S. can create career paths for all of its workers.\nEconomic Outlook\nLet’s start with the economy. Overall, I think the economy is in good shape.\nWe are in the longest economic expansion on record, and I see growth returning to trend of about 2\npercent this year, a view that is widely shared.\nFriday’s employment report showed the labor market began 2020 on the same positive trend it showed\nthrough 2019. We added 225,000 net new jobs in January — better than the monthly average of\n1\n\n175,000 for all of 2019. Hourly wages increased 3.1 percent from last January, and the unemployment\nrate stood at 3.6 percent.\nAt some point, we’ll return to a trend of creating about 100,000 net new jobs per month. That number\nsounds disappointing — compared with the stronger monthly gains we’ve seen in recent years. But it’s\nimportant to recognize that 100,000 jobs per month is more than enough to keep pace with the\nexpected growth in the U.S. labor force. That’s one reason why I expect that the unemployment rate will\nstay below 4 percent for the next couple of years.\nThe health of the labor market, especially when it comes to paychecks, is key to my economic outlook\nsince consumer spending accounts for about 70 percent of the U.S. economy. The news in general\ncontinues to be good for the consumer sector. Thanks to the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years and\ngrowth in wages, consumers are upbeat about the economy. Consumer confidence is high, and the\noptimism should support household spending this year.\nAnother support to consumer spending this year is the prospect of more homeowners refinancing their\nmortgages. Research done at the Philadelphia Fed’s Consumer Finance Institute1 shows that lower rates\nin 2019 resulted in a large number of borrowers who are in a position to refinance their residential\nmortgages. Mortgage refinancing fuels consumption in two ways: First, homeowners are able to lower\ntheir monthly house payment, freeing up money that can be spent elsewhere. Second, homeowners\nmay choose to extract some home equity by using a cash-out refinance. This also provides money for\nother consumer spending.\nOur research shows that in September 2019 — when the 30-year fixed mortgage rate averaged 3.61\npercent — about 19 percent of all active mortgages were refi candidates. The Bank’s research —\nsupported by industry analysis — suggests that with no change in mortgage rates, about 60 percent of\nborrowers will probably refinance this year, and over the next two years, we would expect an estimated\n$11.2 billion in added consumption from this refi activity. On an individual level, an average homeowner\nwould have about $2,000 to spend in extra consumption within the first year after refinancing — a nice\nlift to almost any budget.\nMy positive view about the consumer contrasts with concerns about business investment. Spending on\nnew plant and equipment and intellectual property is lagging, and the uncertainty attached to fiscal and\n1 The analysis is based on Black Knight McDash data and Equifax Credit Risk Insight Servicing data.\n2\n\nother policies has continued to hold spending back. So, too, have international developments, including\nthe global slowdown, trade uncertainty, and geopolitical tensions.\nIt’s too early to say what impact the spread of the coronavirus will have on the global economy, but the\nnegative effects on the Chinese economy and international travel are something to watch.\nThat’s my view on the labor markets and economic growth. Let me talk about the other side of the Fed’s\ndual mandate: inflation. We haven’t quite met our 2 percent inflation target, but we’re on track to get\nthere. While the process has been a slow one, I still believe that the inflation rate will rise to meet our\ngoal.\nAgainst this backdrop of a generally positive economic outlook and expectations that inflation will\neventually hit the Fed’s target, I come to the part that everyone really cares about: rates. As you know,\nat the January FOMC meeting, the Committee decided unanimously to hold the federal funds rate target\nstable at the range of 1½ to 1¾ percent.\nMy own view right now is that we should hold steady for a while and watch how developments and the\ndata unfold before taking any more action.\nThe Regional Economy\nTurning to Delaware and the Philadelphia region, the economic outlook is more mixed than the national\none. Over the past five years, Delaware employment grew less than 1 percent per year, which is lower\nthan the 1.5 percent posted for the nation. In the recent months, however, Delaware’s job growth has\npicked up to a rate similar to the national average. At a more granular level, northern parts of Delaware\nseem to be doing better than the southern parts.\nDelaware’s unemployment rate was 3.9 percent in December (slightly higher than the national figure).\nUnemployment in the southern areas tends to be higher.\nDelaware’s job growth has been reasonably broad based, with the usual suspects such as the financial\nindustry and education and health care — often referred to as “Eds and Meds” — leading the way. The\nprofessional and business services sector has seen a slight decline in the past year. But this could be due\nto a reduction in temporary-service jobs, which show up in the business services sector. With the local\nlabor market remaining tight, companies are shifting temporary and part-time workers into permanent,\nfull-time jobs, which results in a reduction of employment in the professional and business services\nsector.\n3\n\nIn the Philadelphia metro area, which, of course, encompasses parts of Delaware, Pennsylvania, New\nJersey, and Maryland, job growth had been running around 1.5 percent, until several years ago when it\nslowed to 1 percent annually. In general, the Philadelphia metro area’s job growth since the last\nrecession has outpaced that of the Pennsylvania average for the most part, but has been below that of\nthe nation during the same period.\nLike Delaware, the Philadelphia metro area’s job growth has been consistently broad based for the past\nseveral years, thanks to net new job gains in Eds and Meds and professional and business services. The\nlocal labor market is also feeling the direct impact of e-commerce versus brick-and-mortar stores. We\nhave had a decline in retail employment, but we are seeing continuous growth in transportation and\nwarehousing employment.\nAs for the jobless rate, the Philadelphia area’s rate stood at 4.1 percent in December. This is lower than\nthe state average but is higher than the national average. In recent months, we have seen a slight uptick\nin the region’s and the state’s unemployment rates. This is likely due to an increase in the labor force\nparticipation rate at the state level during the same period. As more people enter the labor force, the\nunemployment rate will temporarily increase until they find jobs.\nTight Labor Market Could Be a Workforce Development Opportunity\nThe very tight labor markets we are seeing locally and across the nation have put employers in a\nchallenging position that was not evident in the years following the Great Recession. Companies report\ndifficulty filling open positions, and many of those slots stay vacant for a long time. The difficult\nrecruiting environment is also one that is likely to stay with us for some time as demographic trends\nindicate that the workforce will continue to age and the labor force relative to the population will\ncontinue to decline.\nThis challenge may also be viewed as an opportunity, and those that successfully invent new ways to\nattract workers will enhance their chances of success. Now is a chance to rethink the same-old, same-\nold ways of building a productive workforce. This can perhaps be done by rethinking job requirements\nor additional ways of training.\nOne such innovative program has begun in Philadelphia. It is a public–private partnership to train\nworkers here in Philadelphia. This project was developed by the Bank’s Economic Growth & Mobility\nProject, in concert with Philadelphia Works and Comcast. It seeks to gain a better understanding of what\n4\n\nprograms and strategies expand opportunities for individuals who live in low- and moderate-income\ncommunities.\nThe pilot program, announced last fall, has Philadelphia Works providing the upfront investment for\ntraining workers to master the skills needed by Comcast. As part of this new financial model, Comcast is\ncommitted to paying for outcomes once they are achieved, such as staying on the job for over six\nmonths. Philadelphia Works provides the training. The model also creates a better feedback loop\nbetween employers and the workforce board to make the program more effective and responsive to\nchanging employer and employee needs.\nThe program is helping Comcast find workers in a tight labor market and let me assure you: The tight\nlabor market we hear about from most of you is not imagined. Economists at the Philadelphia Fed have\nbeen looking into the amount of time needed to fill positions in metro areas across the U.S. In our\nregion, it took 41 days, on average, to fill a position. That was longer than the national average of 37\ndays, and put Philly 47th out of the 50 largest metro areas.\nIt is hard to say exactly why it takes longer in Philadelphia than in other places, but one thing our\nresearchers noted is that job ads in the Philadelphia metro area tend to list slightly higher education\nrequirements than other metro areas. This underscores a need to switch gears and investigate if\nprograms such as the one I just mentioned could be adapted to the challenges you face.\nBut here’s another finding of the study that I found very interesting: The skills in highest demand in the\nPhiladelphia region, and across the U.S., are not those dependent on acquiring a four-year degree, but\ninstead are soft skills, such as communication, customer service, and teamwork. That could indicate that\na rethinking of job requirements could help counter the tight labor market conditions that are a\nprevalent feature of the current economy. Sometimes that means a college or graduate degree is\nneeded, but sometimes it doesn’t.\nThat leads to another issue about workforce development, an issue I have championed for a few years\nnow. And it might be strange to hear this from me — a former president here at the University of\nDelaware — but not every high school graduate needs to go to college. And that would be even truer if\nthere were greater innovation in recruiting and training. To reiterate, the difficulty of finding new\nemployees is likely to be a feature of the labor market for some time to come because demographic\ntrends are not short-run fluctuations. Innovation in attracting and retaining workers is likely to be one of\n5\n\nthe key aspects governing success. It expands the pool of workers, helping to create better matches and\na more productive workforce. And, importantly it opens pathways for workers.\nOpportunity Occupations\nOf course, workers without a college degree still need to find well-paying jobs. As I mentioned earlier,\nmy positive outlook for the U.S. economy rests on the consumer sector. We need everyone who wants a\njob to be able to find a well-paying and sustainable career path. Researchers within our Community\nDevelopment and Regional Outreach Department have identified several employment categories that\npay above the national annual median wage but do not require a four-year college degree. We call these\nopportunity occupations.\nMy colleague Keith Wardrip worked with researchers from the Cleveland Fed to catalogue these\noccupations by looking at education requirements in job postings and hourly wage data from the Labor\nDepartment. The list of opportunity occupations vary from registered nurses to truck drivers, retail sales\nsupervisors, carpenters, and patrol officers. So whether a person likes dealing with people or working\nwith their hands, and whether they are interested in a career in health care, construction,\ntransportation, or sales, one of the many opportunity occupations may fit their idea of a good job.\nTo be clear, many of these jobs require on-the-job experience or some type of training after high school,\nand some positions advertised online required a college degree. But nationally, Keith and his colleagues\ncalculated that 21.6 percent of jobs in 2017 could be classified as opportunity occupations. In the\nPhiladelphia–Camden–Wilmington metro area, the share was slightly lower, at 20.1 percent.\nThese occupations offer workers without college degrees the chance to be part of our growing economy\nand to become financially secure. Giving more people the opportunity to participate in the economy\nstrengthens our economy because more paychecks support increased consumer spending. It’s a win–\nwin situation for all of us.\nIndeed, emphasizing skills rather than degrees might help to reverse a troubling longer-run trend in the\nU.S. economy, and that is the high number of adults who are not in the labor force. The share of\nworking-age adults who are participating in the labor force — which includes those who are employed\nand those who are unemployed but actively looking for work — came in at just 63.1 percent in 2019,\ndown from 65.4 percent 10 years ago. What this says to me is that the U.S. is missing out on the\n6\n\npotential these adults could bring to the economy. This will, no doubt, require innovative thinking and\nnew ways of investing in the workforce, but the payoffs are likely to be substantial.\nI know the popular notion is that artificial intelligence and robots will make workforce development\nunnecessary. But let me return to our study about the time needed to fill job openings and mention that\nthe occupations that are hardest to fill include registered nurses, retail store managers, and physicians.\nThese are jobs that are least at risk for automation. They require uniquely human skills and can’t easily\nbe done by robots. Employers can’t expect these jobs to disappear any time soon, and that is why it is\nimperative for employers to invest in those unique humans who can develop the communication,\nteamwork, and service skills that will get the job done.\n7",

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nThe Economic Recovery Continues\nCFA Society Philadelphia\nPhiladelphia, PA (Virtual)\nMay 11, 2021\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood afternoon! It’s great to be back with this group. I’m really looking forward to our discussion today\n— especially the Q&A portion. And given that you’re an audience of CFAs, I’ve come expecting some\nreally tough, forensic questions, such as … what on Earth is going on with the Phillies?\nToday I’d like to offer you a few thoughts on where we are economically. I also plan to talk a bit about\nhow we can build a more equitable and sustainable economy as we recover from the pandemic.\nBut before we do that, I need to give you my standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my\nown and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or in\nthe Federal Reserve System.\nEconomic Outlook\nSetting the Phillies aside, I’m pleased to note that there is a palpable sense of optimism as we convene.\nLast year and the early part of 2021 were really, really tough — and tragic for millions of Americans —\nbut things have noticeably begun to turn around in our area and across the country.\nEconomic data like employment, housing, and manufacturing figures came in stronger over the last\ncouple of months than many of us — myself included — expected. And recent spending data have once\nagain provided a reminder to never bet against the American consumer. In March alone, consumer\nspending — a component of GDP comprising around 70 percent of the nation’s total economic output —\nsurged 4.2 percent.\n1\n\nWe can credit increased vaccinations, falling COVID-19 case rates, and a huge dose of fiscal stimulus for\nthe reviving national economy. We’re digging out of a very deep hole — and we have a long way to go\n— but for now, I’m anticipating national GDP growth to come in around 7 percent for 2021, before\nmoderating to 3 percent growth next year.\nThere are, of course, downside risks, including vaccination hesitancy that precludes true herd immunity\nas well as the possibility of new COVID-19 variants that render the vaccines less efficacious. The tragic\nsituation in India is a reminder that even as the situation in the U.S. improves, much of the world is still\nin the worst throes of the pandemic.\nCloser to home, there is no doubt that the cash Congress appropriated to Americans through the\nPaycheck Protection Program and the more than $3,000 in direct payments to the majority of U.S.\nhouseholds has helped buoy consumer spending during the pandemic.\nIn some cases, that meant literal cash — one of our contacts who owns a network of gas stations and\nconvenience stores reported needing extra armored car runs during the week the latest round of\nstimulus checks arrived to keep up with demand at his ATMs. Here at the Fed, we’re also starting, once\nagain, to deal with increased demand for coins. So I hope there aren’t too many of you who need\nquarters to do your laundry; it could be challenging for a while to find them …\nOther Americans have squirreled away what they’ve received. The household savings rate is up sharply,\nand in March, it was at the second-highest rate on record — 27.6 percent. And others are paying down\ndebt at a rapid clip; bankers have told us that there are clearly some who are struggling with loans and\nforbearance, but that many of their clients are using this period to catch up on payments they may have\nfallen behind on.\nAll of this is setting the table for a recovery that could be long and durable.\nThe Labor Force Recovery\nIt’s important to note that the recovery in GDP has so far outpaced the rebound in the labor force. The\nlevel of employment is still more than 8 million below the prepandemic peak, and that doesn’t account\nfor the roughly 200,000 in monthly gains we probably would have seen without COVID-19. April’s jobs\nreport, which came in at only 266,000 new jobs, was extremely disappointing.\n2\n\nGiven that the underlying fundamentals of the economy look so strong, April’s numbers were probably\nan outlier, however, and I expect job creation to pick up in the coming months. At this point, I anticipate\nthe labor force returning to its prepandemic trend sometime next summer.\nThere are myriad reasons that the employment rebound is slightly lagging other indicators. Some are\nsalutary: During the pandemic, firms became more productive and learned to do more with less. A more\nproductive economy benefits all of us in the long run.\nBut other people may have some hesitancy about returning to the workplace until they get vaccinated,\nand they’re convinced their coworkers are vaccinated. There’s also great inconsistency across industries;\nin the service sector, hospitality and tourism jobs are still down significantly because their business has\nyet to return in significant numbers.\nAnother factor that has driven far too many talented people out of the workforce is a dearth of childcare\noptions.\nThere is a real economic cost that all of us incur when people — and let’s be frank, mostly mothers —\nleave the labor force because they can’t find an affordable option for taking care of their kids during the\nworkday.\nLike quality education, affordable childcare is not merely a “nice to have” — it’s an economic necessity.\nIn Delaware, for instance, it now costs the median-earning family 20 percent of their income to pay for\nthe care of a child under 5 years old. That’s a heavy burden — even before COVID-19 shuttered many\nschools and childcare centers, further straining families.\nMaking childcare more affordable is a complex issue but one that surely requires our attention. Already,\none of the most oft-cited reasons couples give for having fewer children than they say they want is the\ncost of raising them.\nMy colleagues at the Minneapolis Fed have found that, at the outset of the pandemic, many parents of\nyoung children left the labor force — 3.4 percent of fathers and 2.9 percent of mothers dropped out\naltogether. But in the ensuing year, most fathers have returned to the labor force, while the\nparticipation rate of mothers of young children is still down 2.8 percentage points from before the\npandemic. That is a lot of human capital lying untapped. The Philadelphia Fed, in partnership with the\nDelaware Chamber of Commerce, is piloting a Research in Action Lab focused on providing childcare\noptions precisely because of this issue.\n3\n\nFor now, Fed policy is going to hold steady.\nWe’ll keep the federal funds rate very low and continue making more than $100 billion in monthly\nTreasury bond and mortgage-backed securities purchases. While the economic situation is improving,\nrecovery is still a work in progress, and there’s no reason to withdraw support yet.\nWith so much fiscal support and monetary accommodation, there is some upside risk to increased\ninflation, and we will continue to monitor that closely. But for now, I’m forecasting 2.3 percent headline\ninflation for 2021 with core inflation at 2 percent.\nThe Occupational Mobility Explorer\nLastly, before we move to the Q&A, I’d like to take a moment to tell you a little bit about a new tool the\nPhiladelphia Fed recently launched that I think you will find very interesting — and important.\nOne of the ways we can ensure that the coming recovery is both equitable and durable is to get more\npeople into middle-class jobs. And so, the tool came out of the work done by researchers at the\nPhiladelphia Fed and the Cleveland Fed who began by asking a question: How do we transition workers\nin low-paying, unstable jobs into what we call opportunity occupations — jobs that pay above the\nmedian wage and that don’t require a college degree.\nThey came up with an ingenious idea: They looked at the skill sets of the people who currently hold\nthose low-opportunity jobs. They then matched those skills to jobs that would pay at least 10 percent\nmore than their current wage and that don’t require a traditional four-year degree.\nThe findings were incredibly encouraging. Looking at 33 metro areas nationwide, they found that nearly\nhalf of lower-wage employment can be paired with at least one higher-paying occupation requiring\nsimilar skills. For transitions connecting the most similar occupations identified in the study, the pay\ndifferences are significant, with an average bump in wages of almost $15,000 — a 49 percent increase in\nsalary.\nWe’ve recently launched an interactive online tool — the Occupational Mobility Explorer — to help\nworkers and employers make those transitions. Once you are in Explorer, you can select your\ngeographic location and current occupation, and you will find a variety of jobs that require similar skills\nand pay at least 10 percent more in wages.\n4\n\nFor example, receptionists here in the Philadelphia area will find that they possess many of the skills\nnecessary to become a medical secretary, a job that pays about 27 percent more — on average, a bump\nin salary from around $30,000 to $38,000.\nBill collectors in the Philadelphia area could boost their salary 45 percent, from an average of about\n$38,000 to nearly $55,000 by becoming a credit counselor — with the added bonus that people will\nactually want to answer the phone when you call.\nThe tool can also be used by workforce development practitioners, community colleges, and, of course,\nthe general public. It can help with reskilling programs, employee recruitment, and hiring practices as\nmillions of workers seek to reenter the job market as we emerge from the pandemic. There’s a lot of\ntalent out there that we as a society would be foolish to leave on the sidelines.\nSo, thanks so much again for having me. And now I’m happy to take some questions.\n5",

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the FOMC.\n\nBenjamin Franklin Birthday Celebration\nJanuary 13, 2017\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood morning and thank you. It’s a pleasure to be here.\nI’m going to keep my introductory remarks short, so we can get to the conversation more\nquickly. I’m following Ben Franklin’s advice that: “Silence is not always a sign of wisdom, but\nbabbling is ever a mark of folly.”\nI think it’s probably wise to start with an explanation of why I’m even here. Why is this policy\nwonk, who raises and lowers interest rates, interested in inequality and prosperity?\nThe Federal Reserve actually has a strong interest in the subject. This year marks the 40th\nanniversary of the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), which among other things, requires\nbanks to meet the credit needs of all communities, including those of lower income. Originally,\nthe Fed got involved to help banks fulfill their CRA requirements, and we still do. But our role\nhas also evolved to be a primary conduit and convener for community organizations and the\nfunders that can help. That’s everything from community investment funds to some of the\nworld’s largest financial institutions. We don’t fund projects or organizations ourselves, but we\ndo conduct research and help foster best practices.\nFor those of you who don’t know, the Federal Reserve System is divided into 12 regional banks\naround the country and a Board of Governors in Washington, D.C. Each District bank is\nindependent and operates as a representative and reporter of economic issues in their region. The\nPhiladelphia Fed District consists of Eastern Pennsylvania, Southern New Jersey, and Delaware.\nEach of the 12 regional banks has a community development and outreach function, and each\ndoes exceptional work. Obviously, I’m biased towards our bank, and I see Philadelphia as having\na unique position and ability to conduct research and find real, sustainable solutions for some of\nour most intractable problems.\nThe other banks oversee bigger Districts — San Francisco has the nine western states and covers\nmore than 20 percent of the country — but the Third District offers a microcosm of the issues\nand economics we see around much of the country: We have urban, rural, and postindustrial\nareas. We have small businesses and huge multinationals. We have industries using the cutting\nedge of technology and traditional manufacturing. In short, we have a perfect laboratory to study\nthe way programs aimed at economic mobility and self-sufficiency work.\nPage 2 of 5\n\nI’ll give you an example. The unemployment rate for Pennsylvania is higher than the national\naverage. But when I talk to employers and business owners, they say they can’t find qualified\napplicants. There are people out there who want jobs and employers who have them; the gap is in\nskills.\nMy staff recently conducted a study on what they call “opportunity occupations.” These are jobs\nthat pay at or above the national median income, but that don’t require a traditional four-year\ndegree. They make up close to 30 percent of the job market nationally.\nWe can help a lot of workers and a lot of businesses by emphasizing training and skills and\nlooking at practical ways to get people into not just jobs, but careers. I recently went with my\nteam to Roxborough High School, which is involved with the Philadelphia Academies project.\nStudents at the Academies study a core discipline — the ones I talked to were concentrating on\neverything from international entrepreneurship to biotech — and will come out of high school\nready to enter a profession, if they choose. Some may stay in that career for a long time, some\nwill go on to do a conventional bachelor’s degree, and some will get more technical training. But\nall of them will have the skills to find a path that leads them to a prosperous life.\nThis is just one example of the kind of work my team is studying and the research they’re\nundertaking. They also are examining everything from healthy communities to housing to\nconsumer credit. It’s a big job and the Third District has a lot to contend with. In 2004, only six\nof the 60 counties had poverty rates higher than the national average. By 2014, that number had\nrisen to 11.\nFrom a monetary policymaker’s perspective, the issues of poverty and economic mobility are\nobviously important. We tend to speak of the economy as a whole, using a broad brush to paint a\nsweeping portrait of America. And that’s important. But the national economy is made up of a\nmyriad of other economies — state, local, and community microeconomies. Each is like a single\nbrushstroke. Each microeconomy has its own cause and effect and contributes to the overall\npicture. No one of them operates in isolation, and we should all remember that our neighbors’\neconomic fortunes are tied to our own. Studies in community development add depth and\ncontour to what we see.\nI’ve always gone with the business mantra of “play to your strengths.” So, I look at the strengths\nof the District and the strengths of the Philadelphia Fed and see a way to make real change\nhappen.\nI truly believe that this District can be an innovation lab. We have the demographics, the\neconomic profile, and most importantly, extraordinary people with a strong sense of community.\nThe Fed has world-class research talent and exceptional partners in the public, private, and not-\nfor-profit sectors. Programs and solutions we find here can be adopted and adapted for towns and\ncities across the country.\nPage 3 of 5\n\nI know that’s a big challenge, but you can’t succeed if you don’t try, right?\nEconomic mobility happens when people have a level playing field. That’s what community\ndevelopment work fundamentally does: It tries to put everyone at the same point on the starting\nline and ensure each person has access to opportunity.\nWe know there is a cycle of poverty, and that poverty in one generation disproportionately leads\nto poverty in the next. It is a systemic hurdle to success. Raj Chetty, a leading economics\nprofessor, now at Stanford, is the go-to guy for this area of research. He and his coauthors found\nthat where a child grows up has an effect on his or her upward mobility later in life. The\nlikelihood of a child born into the bottom fifth of the income distribution reaching the top fifth\nvaries markedly across the United States, from a low of 4.4 percent in Charlotte, NC, to a high\nof 12.9 percent in San Jose, CA. Philadelphia falls in between at 7.4 percent. The San Jose odds\nare much better than either Charlotte or Philadelphia; but they’re still lower than we should\naccept.1\nEven here in our metro region, the data continue to illustrate inequality across geography. A\nchild who is raised in a low-income family in Bucks County will make over $4,000 more at age\n26 than a child in a similar family in Philadelphia County.2\nI’ve talked a lot about the pragmatic reasons behind the importance of this work. But I’d also add\nthat this is a moral imperative. We’re honoring Benjamin Franklin today, and that naturally\nevokes the philosophy and essence of what it means to be American. This is a country, perhaps\nmore than any other, whose fundamental ethos is that anyone can be anything they want if they\nwork hard. Ben Franklin himself is a testament to this. He left school at 10 to work full-time in\nhis father’s candle shop, yet went on to become one of our most revered founding fathers.\nFranklin saw the value of helping people and places in the future. In his will, he left trusts to\nBoston and Philadelphia that were intentionally invested in 100- and 200-year periods, so the\ninterest could compound. The money was then used to fund apprenticeship programs and civic\nprojects in each city, as Franklin’s will directed. Even today, Franklin’s legacy funds\nscholarships, helping students to move up the economic ladder.\nAt the heart of this push for economic mobility is the quintessentially American belief that\neveryone should have an equal chance at success. It is the soul of democracy and the foundation\nof any fair society.\n1 Chetty, Raj, Nathaniel Hendren, Patrick Kline, and Emmanuel Saez. “Where Is the Land of Opportunity? The\nGeography of Intergenerational Mobility in the United States,” Quarterly Journal of Economics, 129:4 (2014), pp.\n1553–1623.\n2 Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia calculations based on the Equality of Opportunity Local Area Rankings data\n(Equality of Opportunity Project, Harvard University), available at www.equality-of-opportunity.org/rankings/ (last\naccessed January 9, 2017).\nPage 4 of 5\n\nThere isn’t one single barrier to moving up the economic ladder, and those barriers don’t come\nfrom a single source. There are multiple, tangled factors — education, training, affordable\nhousing, child care, even basics like transportation. If you can’t get to work, you can’t work.\nFinding solutions to those problems takes a lot of sharp minds and hard work, and I think we can\nget there.\nMaybe someone as extraordinary as Ben Franklin would’ve succeeded anyway, if he’d been born\ntoday, despite having to leave school at such a young age. But what if the structural barriers\nwound up being too much? The next Ben Franklin could be out there, but barriers are preventing\nhim — or her — from succeeding. And wouldn’t we all be worse off for that?\nOur aim at the Philadelphia Fed is to make sure economic growth is inclusive and that every\nperson has access to the tools needed to achieve his or her fullest potential. We want to use our\nresearch and our convening abilities to find solutions that can be applied across the Third District\nand the country. To quote Ben again: “An investment in knowledge pays the best interest.”\nPage 5 of 5",

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nIn Character We Trust\nCommencement Address\nABA Stonier Graduate School of Banking\nPhiladelphia, PA\nJune 13, 2019\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nHello Stonier, and congratulations! It’s great to be in front of this group again. For those of you\nwho don’t remember, I delivered the welcome address when you started this program three\nyears ago. I certainly understand if you’ve forgotten because a lot has happened since June\n2016. A lot.\nIn the intervening years, we’ve all had an education — you’ve mastered the intricacies of high-\nlevel banking management; I learned from a crash course in monetary policymaking; and we all\nfinally, finally learned what it feels like to win a Super Bowl …\nSo I’m very pleased to bring this full circle and see you receive your diplomas.\nThe first order of business today is to give yourselves a round of applause. I like to do that\nbecause it’s important to recognize hard work, and because it guarantees people will clap at\nleast once while I’m on stage.\nThe second order of business is another round of applause to the people whose support helped\nmake this day happen … the friends, family, and faculty here today.\nFantastic! Now you’ve clapped twice while I was up here.\nThe third order of business is a few words about the importance of what you learned here at\nStonier, and what it means when you apply it in the professional world.\n1\n\nThe fourth is getting the actual diplomas, which is the most important, so I’ll keep the third part\nshortish.\nThe financial industry is only going to get more and more complicated and more and more\ncomplex, particularly in this current age of technological innovation. I say “current age” because\nof course, technology is always evolving and has already had several “ages,” as it will in the\nfuture.\nIn this iteration, financial institutions face challenges from cybersecurity to the rapid expansion\nof fintech.\nWe’re going to need people at the helm with an extraordinary set of skills, because financial\ninstitutions are important. And they’re always going to be important, because a financial\nsystem is fundamental to the human experience as we know it.\nI’m not saying that as some sort of consumerist rallying cry; it’s the simple fact of our existence.\nFinancial systems have existed in some form across human history.\nFrom the barter system to banking, societies spanning time and space have found ways to\nexecute the basic functions of payments, finance, and credit. It’s how we’ve amassed the things\nwe need to live and the things we crave for comfort.\nFrom the central agora to apps on our phones, whether it’s a creditor’s note or a series of 1s\nand 0s, the essentials of the system have stood the test of time. Each individual system, of\ncourse, has not necessarily been so lucky.\nBut that’s important, too. Because just as history illustrates that we’ll always find our way back\nto those systems, it shows what it takes for those systems to last.\nIt takes trust.\nA financial system can only exist if we collectively agree to it. That takes an act of faith. A\nsystem of savings, credit, exchange, and investment only survives because we have trust in\npeople we don’t know, currency we have no individual control over, payment systems with\n2\n\ninner workings we can’t see, and institutions we grant power to — both to execute and to\nregulate those systems.\nAnd since a strong and sound economy can only exist when it’s underpinned by a strong and\nsound financial system, the people who run those institutions have a unique responsibility.\nSo, you know, no pressure.\nThat responsibility extends to institutions of all sizes. Bigger organizations can have impacts\nthat resonate on a national or even global scale. Smaller ones, particularly community banks,\ncan be a lifeline for a community, and are a necessity for small, local economies’ survival.\nOf course, you already know all this — I mean, you’re Stonier graduates, after all. But it’s a\npoint worth repeating every once in a while, because that kind of responsibility doesn’t just\nrequire a mastery of balance sheets or investment acumen.\nIt calls for good leadership. And that’s something I know Stonier excels at.\nWhen I spoke to you three years ago, I mentioned the importance of character. A lot may have\nchanged in the intervening years, but that hasn’t. I don’t think it ever will.\nThere’s a narrative — and, yes, sometimes a culture — in financial services that says cutthroat\nis king. I’ve spent a lot of my time as a Fed president talking to the banking community, and\nwhat I’ve seen and heard from them is the same thing I’ve seen in every other aspect of my\ncareer: The most respected leaders are honest, authentic, and trustworthy.\nSure, there are outliers; bad people can thrive, and flashes in the pan can last longer than they\nshould. But eventually, those people get found out. And in the long run, the most important\nasset any of us has — and the one thing in life we can control — is our integrity.\nWe don’t usually have a say in what life throws at us, but we do decide how we handle it. Our\nfinancial system needs people at the top who can roll with those changes and make the right\ncalls, even when they’re the hard ones.\nIn the end, the financial system exists to perform some pretty basic functions: It keeps savings\nsafe; ensures that we can easily price, buy, and sell things; and helps us direct resources to their\n3\n\nbest advantage. But what that actually means in our day-to-day lives is pretty huge: It’s how we\nget an education, or put a roof over our families’ heads. It’s how we start a business, or invest\nin our kids’ future. It’s how we get sustenance and fulfillment. There’s a lot riding on it, and a\nlot riding on the people who run it.\nIt’s a big job. It’s going to take some Stonier grads to do it right.\nThank you, and congratulations to everyone again.\n4",

    "text": "The Economy, the Pandemic,\nand Machine Learning\nThe Economics of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning\nOfficial Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum\nPhiladelphia, PA (virtual)\nSeptember 29, 2020\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nThe Economy, the Pandemic, and Machine Learning\nThe Economics of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning\nOfficial Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum\nPhiladelphia, PA (virtual)\nSeptember 29, 2020\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood morning from the East Coast of the United States. I know we’re joined by an international\naudience today, so good … well, whatever time it happens to be wherever you are. On behalf of the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, I’m sincerely thrilled to welcome you all to this virtual conference.\nThe original plan was for me to greet you in person in our Bank in Philadelphia ― instead I’m in the\nmore cramped confines of my home office here in New Jersey. We’re still planning on having a full-scale\nconference in Philadelphia with our partners from the OMFIF around this time next year, which we’re all\nlooking forward to. So, stay tuned for details on that.\nNow, even though we’re meeting in strange circumstances today, many of the same old rules apply.\nHere is one of them: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of\nanyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\nWe’ve gathered today to hear a distinguished panel provide what I’m sure will be a fascinating\ndiscussion on developments in artificial intelligence and machine learning. But before we get to that, I\nwant to set the table by giving you a brief overview of where the economy has been and where it might\nbe heading, recent actions by the Federal Reserve, and a few of my own considerations on machine\nlearning.\n1\n\nThe State of the Virus\nAll of these topics, of course, have been deeply affected by the same scourge that has kept us physically\napart today: COVID-19.\nSo let’s begin, then, with where we are with the virus. As you well know, still less than a year after\nCOVID-19 first emerged, the virus has infected more than 30 million people around the world and killed\nnearly 1 million.\nThe United States has been particularly hard hit. Because of our country’s unique inability to control the\nvirus, we’ve suffered approximately 21 percent of the world’s deaths, despite housing only about 4\npercent of the world’s population. Infection rates have come down from the highs we saw in the spring\nand summer, but the virus is still circulating widely in large swaths of the country.\nAnd even within this disproportionately hard-hit country, certain communities have suffered more than\nothers. Racial minorities, particularly African Americans and Hispanics, have been sickened from the\ncoronavirus at a far higher rate than other groups. They have also died at a higher rate. And in the\nensuing economic contraction, they have lost their jobs at a higher rate.\nThe State of the Economy\nA virus as contagious, deadly, and frankly as mysterious as COVID-19 was bound to have a significant\neconomic impact. Even before state and local governments took action this spring, many Americans had\nstopped dining out, getting on airplanes, and checking in to hotels. State and local governments then\ncompounded the economic misery when ― and I want to stress, in a responsible attempt to protect\npublic health ― they shuttered many businesses deemed nonessential.\nThe upshot? In the second quarter of this year, the U.S. suffered its worst quarterly GDP drop in\nrecorded history when the economy contracted at an annualized rate of nearly 33 percent. Twenty-two\nmillion jobs evaporated. Those with low-wage jobs, particularly racial and ethnic minorities, were\nhardest hit.\nThe good news is, following that contraction, the economy has rebounded faster than many of us had\nprojected. Stay-at-home orders have been lifted, and though large segments of the economy remain\ndepressed, millions of Americans have returned to their jobs. Indeed, about half of those 22 million\nresidents who were suddenly out of work earlier this year are now back, enough to nudge the\nunemployment rate down from 10.2 percent to a still-catastrophic 8.4 percent.\n2\n\nFor now, I expect this recovery to continue, though not fast enough that, by the end of this year, GDP\nwill have returned to where it was before the pandemic struck. That will take more time. And segments\nlike tourism and hospitality will remain subdued for a long time to come, presenting an overall drag on\nGDP and employment growth. Employment, unfortunately, probably won’t be back to pre-pandemic\nlevels until 2023.\nI want to caution that this forecast is freighted with uncertainty because, once again, of COVID-19. The\nscenario of continued growth that I have presented depends on a sustained decline in the rate of new\ninfections ― probably a result of nearly universal mask-wearing, especially indoors ― that ensures only\nsporadic new outbreaks. We’re also assuming that a vaccine becomes widely available sometime mid to\nlate next year. But COVID-19, as the world has learned all too painfully, is difficult to control. And so the\npath of the economy largely depends on the path of the virus.\nIt depends in no small part, too, on the path that the federal government choses to take. When COVID-\n19 first struck, it brought forth a policy response that, in my view, was commensurate to its gravity. Early\non, Congress provided significant fiscal support for the economy through the CARES Act. That blunted\nthe pain of the contraction. Unfortunately, that relief has now expired, and I would urge lawmakers to\nconsider providing additional support soon.\nThe Role of the Fed\nFor our part, the Federal Reserve’s role in responding to the crisis has been robust. But our main power\nis lending. We cannot simply spend money or issue grants. That is Congress’s role.\nThe Fed’s role in mitigating this crisis has been to use those lending powers to maintain our underlying\neconomic infrastructure by making sure that every sector of the economy has access to liquidity.\nMoreover, our lending facilities are meant as backstops to the private sector. We don’t want to\ndisintermediate the private sector ― we simply want to be there to support market functioning.\nSo, what have we done?\nFirst and foremost, we lowered our policy interest rate to near zero fast and early. We kept this stance\nunchanged at this month’s FOMC meeting and indicated that we plan to keep those rates very low for a\nvery long time.\nIn August, we also announced a long-considered change to how we will balance inflation and\nemployment going forward. Following a nearly two-year review, the Fed announced we will no longer\n3\n\nhead off higher inflation by preemptively raising interest rates. Moreover, after long periods of sub-2\npercent inflation ― as we now find ourselves in ― we will accept periods of above-2 percent inflation.\nTolerating the risk of slightly higher inflation, in our view, is worth it if it helps us achieve our\nemployment goals.\nUsing the discount window, we are also actively encouraging banks to borrow money from the Fed at\nultralow interest rates, to make sure they have the funds they need to serve their customers at this\ncritical time.\nIn order to keep markets functioning, beginning in March, we started buying large amounts of Treasury\nbonds and mortgage-backed securities. We have now purchased more than $2 trillion of these products.\nThe markets have largely stabilized, and we’ve slowed the rate of purchases. As a backstop, we have\nalso purchased some corporate debt, and as the economy and credit markets heal, we will disengage\nfrom that market as prudently and as expeditiously as possible.\nBacked by credit protection from the U.S. Treasury, we’ve also launched the Main Street Lending\nProgram, which provides support for small and midsize businesses that were in good financial standing\nbefore the COVID-19 pandemic. The program was recently expanded to include nonprofit organizations,\nsuch as universities and nonprofit medical institutions, which tend to be very important anchor\ninstitutions in their communities.\nThere has been somewhat limited interest in Main Street ― only about 400 banks have registered to\nparticipate in this program. But in a way, that’s actually a good sign for the economy because it means\nthat firms have access to capital without having to use the Fed. Because if you recall, in all of this, we are\nsimply a backstop. On the other hand, if there is another major downturn in the economy, these\nfacilities will still be in place to offer funding.\nWe’re also bolstering the Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) by\nsupplying liquidity to financial institutions that are issuing loans to those businesses that are receiving\naid through the program.\nPPP is now closed to new applications. But when it was open, it drew a lot of interest. More than 5\nmillion loans were issued to the tune of more than $520 billion. Under our program, the Fed provided\nliquidity to institutions issuing about 17 percent of those loans. This is another positive sign for the\neconomy and the financial sector, as it shows the vast majority of banks have sufficient liquidity to\nextend credit.\n4\n\nWe’ve also rolled out a program to help cash-strapped local governments. The Municipal Liquidity\nFacility, whereby we buy bonds from municipalities and states whose tax revenues have collapsed, is\ndesigned to provide essential liquidity as they navigate the twin crises of the pandemic and the\neconomic downturn. The State of Illinois has already tapped this, and we are also opening it to\nmultistate agencies like the Port Authority of New York and other transit authorities. While so far only\nthe State of Illinois has tapped this facility, the Fed by merely announcing its existence did a lot of work\nin getting private markets functioning again.\nMachine Learning\nCOVID-19 has affected everything from health care to tax receipts to tourism. And so, of course, it has\nalso had an impact on the subject of today’s panel discussion: artificial intelligence and machine\nlearning.\nAlgorithms are built on precedent, and so it’s little surprise that as COVID-19 caught governments\nunawares, it also significantly affected the artificial intelligence that is increasingly used to power large\nsegments of our economy. The algorithms ― like all of us ― had simply never experienced the set of\ncircumstances that COVID-19 presented. And so many algorithms have seen a deterioration in their\nperformance during this period.\nTake credit scores. One would assume that in a time when 22 million Americans had lost their jobs and\nmillions more Americans had their hours cut that credit scores would have declined. But in fact, the\nopposite happened: Credit scores have, in the aggregate, risen during this period.\nOne reason for this is that even in this economic downturn, delinquencies are actually down because\nthe aforementioned CARES Act mandated loan forbearance. That was absolutely the right thing to do\nbut lead the currently used algorithms to the counterintuitive conclusion that default probabilities have\nin fact decreased.\nAnother consideration going forward will be to ensure that algorithms do not serve to perpetuate the\nkinds of discrimination that we have seen historically in our financial sector. Will machine learning\nperpetuate long-standing inequities in, for instance, the rate at which certain racial groups are turned\ndown for loans?\nThis issue will require a conversation spanning academic fields ― computer science, law, economics,\nand others. And it will also require action from not just regulators but probably lawmakers, too, given\n5\n\nthat many of the laws governing discrimination date back to 1961, when computers couldn’t even fit\ninside a single room. Conversations like the one we are hosting today hold important implications for\nthe future of our economy ― and making sure that we are building an equitable future for all of us.\nAnd in the meantime, we can be rest assured the development of artificial intelligence and machine\nlearning will continue ― though I hope it stops before they figure out a way to replace Fed presidents\nwith robots.\nThank you very much.\n6",

    "text": "The Dynamics of Dynamism\nNew York Association for Business Economics\nNew York, NY\nMarch 29, 2018\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nThe Dynamics of Dynamism\nNew York Association for Business Economics\nNew York, NY\nMarch 29, 2018\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood afternoon and thank you. It’s a pleasure to be here.\nI’m headed into my third year as a Fed president, and of all the lessons that stand out in the job,\ntwo are the most acute — Always include an outlook if the FOMC has just raised rates and\nalways issue the standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express here today are mine alone and do\nnot necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\nWith the disclaimer taken care of, today I will first address the outlook — this move was, after\nall, only the sixth one the FOMC has made since 2008. But then I want to discuss one of the\nmyriad factors affecting the U.S. economy and its trajectory. The headline issues — from jobs\nreports to market movements to policy decisions — are obviously important factors in\ndiscussions of the U.S. economy. But there are other factors — deeper, underpinning secular\ntrends — that play important roles and should also be examined. Today, therefore, I’d like to\ndiscuss the trends in U.S. dynamism.\nFirst, though, the promised outlook.\nThe Economic Outlook\nThe labor market continues to strengthen, with strong jobs gains in recent months and continued\nlow unemployment. I expect the unemployment rate to stay low and move down even further,\npossibly dipping as low as the 3.5 percent range in 2019, before ticking back up a few tenths of a\npercentage point.\n1\n\nWhile inflation continues to run below the Fed’s preferred 2 percent target this year, I see it as on\ntrack to meet or exceed that benchmark by the end of next year.\nTaking into account the effects of fiscal stimulus and recent strong economic activity, I continue\nto see above-trend growth of about 2.6 percent for 2018. That should edge down a bit to 2.4\npercent for 2019, then move further south to 2 percent. Overall, that’s a very slight upward\nrevision for my 2018 forecast but a stronger outlook over the medium term.\nOn the heels of a strengthening outlook, therefore, I see two additional rate hikes this year as\nappropriate. That projection continues to be written in pencil, as it is, like all things Fed related,\ndata driven, but overall, things are looking pretty good.\nBusiness Dynamism\nOne of the hallmarks of the U.S. economy is that it has historically been characterized by an\nelevated level of dynamism. And while the U.S. economy is classically “dynamic” in its\ncolloquial sense, characterized by the innovation and the imagination that drives it, I am\nspeaking today more specifically about the economic measure of dynamism that is defined by\nturnover: New businesses enter the market and others leave, workers move from job to job,\npeople come in and out of the workforce, and so on.\nThis perpetual churn makes resources more fluid, and they move around with relative ease. As\nlabor and capital are freed to flow from the least to the most productive firms, productivity,\nwages, and overall economic growth increase.\nThat’s the general dynamism recipe that we all know and that has characterized the U.S.\neconomy for most of the historical record.\nI suppose this wouldn’t be a policymaker’s speech if there weren’t a “however” coming, and\nhere it is: However, the data indicate that, over the past 30 years or so, dynamism has been on the\ndecline. Specifically, business start-up activity is lower than it used to be, and labor reallocation\nis also slowing, as is worker mobility. Over the past 20 years or so, we’ve seen a concurrent drop\nin productivity growth, which naturally poses the question of a causal relationship.\n2\n\nI’ll spare the suspense of that question’s answer and say from the start that we don’t have\ndefinitive answers. I believe the old joke is that if you laid all the economists in the world end to\nend, they would never reach a consensus …\nBut economic trends raise interesting possibilities and points for discussion, as do the factors\naffecting both their trajectories and our ability to manage them.\nSo I’d like to talk now about the trends in dynamism, the culprits in its retreat, and what can be\ndone to reverse it.\nDynamism in Decline\nThe decline in dynamism and entrepreneurship since the early 1980s is evinced by a variety of\nmeasures. On the firm side, the new start-up rate has deteriorated by close to 40 percent.1 At the\nsame time, the exit rate has been more or less flat — not just slowing the net start-up rate, but\nactually pushing it into negative territory.\nThe IPO rate is also falling, a measure that has been linked to encouraging entrepreneurship and\nstart-up activity. It is additionally the case that, over the past decade, M&A activity has been\nstrong. The end result is that industries are becoming more and more concentrated, and the\naverage listed company is bigger, older, and more profitable.2\nOn the worker side, people are now more likely to be employed at large, mature firms than was\npreviously the norm. The share of employment at smaller and medium-sized younger firms has\nfallen from about 20 percent to 10 percent in the past few decades, while the proportion of\nworkers at larger, older firms has risen from about 40 percent to 50 percent.3\nWe’re also seeing the rate of job reallocation falling — that is, the number of jobs added to and\nsubtracted from the economy. This is generally a substantial feature of the U.S. labor market —\n1 Ryan A. Decker, John Haltiwanger, Ron S. Jarmin, and Javier Miranda, “Declining Business Dynamism: Implications\nfor Productivity?” Hutchins Center Working Paper 23 (September 2016).\n2 Michael J. Mauboussin, Dan Callahan, and Darius Majd, “The Incredible Shrinking Universe of Stocks: The Causes\nand Consequences of Fewer U.S. Equities,” Global Financial Strategies, Credit Suisse (March 2017).\n3 John Haltiwanger, “Top Ten Signs of Declining Business Dynamism and Entrepreneurship in the U.S.,” a paper\npresented at the Kauffman Foundation New Entrepreneurial Growth Conference (June 2015).\n3\n\ncurrently, roughly 14 million jobs are reallocated over a typical quarter — but the rate of\nreallocation has fallen by about 22 percent since the early ’90s.4\nAnother factor of today’s labor force is that workers are much less mobile than they used to be.\nThis is something that’s frequently arisen in our examination of U.S. employment as we search\nout the “new normal” of the labor market in a post-recovery world. People aren’t moving for\nwork the way they used to, and when they do, they don’t go as far. The rate of people moving\nout of state has dropped to less than half its average level in the quarter century that followed the\nSecond World War.5\nThe Impact of Dynamism\nSo, the data clearly point to a decline in turnover and dynamism, but there’s a logical argument\nthat older, bigger, more profitable firms hiring people who stay around longer is a perfectly\nnatural state — a sort of settling into middle age for a mature economy. Is that the case? Why do\nwe ascribe such importance to dynamism? Why do we view it as a sign of a healthy economy?\nHistory is awash with quotes about history being awash with lessons — and clichés, very often,\nhave worked their way into the lexicon for a reason. So, the simple history of the role dynamism\nhas played in the U.S. economy might be enough. But we are the Fed, and we like research, so\nI’d prefer to offer an analysis of dynamism’s influence, rather than rest on the laurels of “it’s\nalways been that way.”\nThe first measure of importance to this inquiry is innovation intensity. Among those firms that\ninvent, revolutionize, or — in our overused parlance — “disrupt” industries, it is the younger,\nsmaller firms that spend more on R&D as a proportion of sales. Additionally, research shows\nthat the quality of innovation — as measured by patent citations — is inversely proportionate to\nfirm size, indicating that smaller firms have higher quality innovation.6 Older, more staid\n4 Haltiwanger.\n5 Tyler Cowen, The Complacent Class: The Self-Defeating Quest for the American Dream (New York, NY: St. Martin’s\nPress, 2017).\n6 Ufuk Akcigit, “Firm Size, Innovation Dynamics and Growth,” 2009 Meeting Papers 1267, Society for Economic\nDynamics (2009).\n4\n\norganizations achieve productivity growth from entry and exits to markets, or expansion and\ncontraction of offices or factories. Manufacturing, for instance, derives a significant portion of its\nindustry-level growth this way.\nAs we know from our days in undergraduate economics, high productivity firms grow faster than\nlow productivity ones and contribute to a country’s overall productivity growth.\nNew firms also provide job opportunities. That is not to say that older firms — through\ncontinued growth, acquisition, and consolidation across industries — wouldn’t continue to\nproduce jobs. But fast-growing businesses, which tend to be young, have historically accounted\nfor a substantial fraction of job creation, averaging about 70 percent of gross annual job creation\nin the decades spanning 1992–2011.7\nMore fluid labor markets ease the path up the job ladder, allow workers to find better matches for\ntheir skills, and can encourage attachment to the labor force. As the labor market continues to\ntighten, and we need every person possible participating in the workforce, that becomes\nincreasingly important. If a marginal worker’s job opportunities aren’t much more beneficial\nthan not working, we’ll still have people on the sidelines. The longer they stay there, the less\nlikely they are to be employed. With a more dynamic labor market, opportunities arise more\nfrequently and are often better, decreasing the likelihood of someone staying out of work for an\nextended period of time.\nBy contrast, a sluggish employment landscape offers infrequent opportunities, which makes\npeople ever more unemployable as they wait for something to come their way and\ndisproportionately affects lower skilled, less educated, and younger workers. As the market\nstagnates, employers can become more exclusive — and more exclusionary — in whom they\nwill hire, exacerbating the cycle for those who can’t meet the bar. They’ll stay out of work\nlonger, and their prospects will be dimmer when opportunities do arise.\n7 Ryan A. Decker, John Haltiwanger, Ron S. Jarmin, and Javier Miranda, “Declining Business Dynamism: Implications\nfor Productivity?” Hutchins Center Working Paper 23 (September 2016).\n5\n\nThe Culprits\nSo the research tells us that business dynamism in the United States is falling. Can it tell us why\nit has experienced a downturn?\nThere are, of course, many competing hypotheses, and it wouldn’t be the dismal science if there\nwere one definitive victor in the blame game. But the many potential contributing culprits are all\nworth exploring.\nThe fact that dynamism has slowed suggests that there has been some fundamental change in the\neconomy.\nIt could be that the business climate is changing in ways that impede the reallocation of labor and\ncapital. If costs in one area increase, that affects other margins, as businesses look to offset costs.\nThat, in turn, can hinder the flow of resources from the least productive to the most productive\nfirms. So, for example, if restrictions make it more difficult for existing firms to grow, new firms\nare less likely to enter the market because lifetime growth prospects are weaker. And if\nrestrictions hinder job destruction by existing firms, job creation rates will fall as competition\nwanes.8\nWe also hear a lot about regulatory burden — and uncertainty about future regulation — when\nwe talk about barriers to new business start-ups. And it is true that regulation has generally\nincreased in the U.S. But that pace has not been constant or consistent across industries. We can,\ntherefore, compare industry dynamism with industry regulation and get a sense of whether\nthere’s any correlation. The evidence so far indicates that, in fact, the case for correlation is fairly\nweak, and where it does exist, it goes in the wrong direction.9 The same holds true for start-up\nrates.\nIt is also the case that, if the fixed cost of starting a new business had risen, we would expect to\nsee that new firms are larger, on average, than in the past, but the data don’t bear that out\n8 Hugo Hopenhayn and Richard Rogerson, “Job Turnover and Policy Evaluation: A General Equilibrium Analysis,”\nJournal of Political Economy, 101:5 (1993), pp. 915–938.\n9 Nathan Goldschlag and Alexander Tabarrok, “Is Regulation to Blame for the Decline in American\nEntrepreneurship?” George Mason University Working Paper 15-11 (February 2015).\n6\n\neither.10 We can infer, then, that there hasn’t been any outsized growth in the amount of seed\nmoney necessary to get a new firm off the ground.\nIt may be — to steal a phrase from another economist — that the change in the U.S. business\nclimate is more akin to a “death by a thousand cuts” than a single blow of the regulatory axe,\nwith small changes and encumbrances combining to create a larger barrier.11\nZoning restrictions, for instance, and other inhibitors of local growth could be impeding the flow\nof workers and capital to high productivity uses. The cost of relocating to a place like San\nFrancisco or New York and attempting to start a new business is all but prohibitive, surely\naffecting the rate of new start-ups. By one estimate, lowering those kinds of constraints — for\ninstance, on housing supply — in such high productivity cities would significantly expand their\nworkforces and increase overall GDP by almost 10 percent.12\nThere has also been a marked increase in occupational licensing. The percentage of workers\nrequired to hold a government-issued license to do their jobs rose from less than 5 in the 1950s to\nalmost 30 in 2008.13 That’s a six-fold increase and has manifested a creep into areas far outside\nwhat most of us would consider standard, like braiding hair or teeth whitening.\nBoth of those examples, by the way, come from Planet Money, which has a couple of very\nentertaining podcasts on occupational licensing that are worth a listen. I use them in part because\nthey’re good examples and in part because it allows me to mention that at the beginning of the\nyear, Philadelphia beat Boston in not one but two extremely important contests. We didn’t just\ntake the Super Bowl; the Philadelphia Fed beat out the Boston Fed for first place in the “Beigie”\nawards, Planet Money’s ode to the Beige Book. I don’t think Bill Belichick is losing much sleep\nover that one, but we were pretty pleased.\n10 John Haltiwanger, Ron S. Jarmin, and Javier Miranda, “Who Creates Jobs? Small versus Large versus Young,”\nReview of Economics and Statistics, 95:2 (May 2013).\n11 Haltiwanger called the situation “a death by a thousand cuts.”\n12 Chang-Tai Hsieh and Enrico Moretti, “Why Do Cities Matter? Local Growth and Aggregate Growth,” Kreisman\nWorking Papers Series in Housing Law and Policy 30 (2015).\n13 Morris M. Kleiner and Alan B. Krueger, “Analyzing the Extent and Influence of Occupational Licensing on the\nLabor Market,” Journal of Labor Economics, 31:S1, Part 2 (April 2013).\n7\n\nIn any event, the bogeyman of big regulation does not appear to be the villain in this story,\nthough the smaller, seemingly more benign, regulations may be combining to create something\nmore malignant.\nThat said, the fact that the decline in business dynamism is not confined to the United States, but\nis occurring across OECD countries, suggests that broader, systemic forces are likely playing a\nrole in the phenomenon.14 These are the same factors that are currently affecting other aspects of\nthe economy: technological advancement, demographics, and measurement.\nTechnology has had a marked effect on the economy, and its various influences and effects are\nintertwined. In the labor market, it emerges in the automation of jobs and the increasing need for\nworker retraining to keep pace with change. In growth and productivity, it’s affecting the\nefficacy of measurement. In the case of business dynamism, technological advancements help\nlarger firms to manage production and distribution across businesses, making them more\nefficient. More and better data and analysis allow them to adapt to changes in customer demand.\nThis is a positive effect, but it would not show up in measures of dynamism.\nDemographic forces have been plaguing us as well. Our aging population is exerting downward\npressure on the labor force participation rate, and research by my staff indicates that will\ncontinue.15 This also has an effect on dynamism, as older workers are less mobile and more\nlikely to remain in jobs for longer periods of time. Population growth is also slowing, which is\nassociated with a decline in start-up rates.16 Growth in the labor force is decelerating, too, and\nwith fewer people entering the workforce, the churn of reallocation and worker mobility further\nsuffers.\nFinally, we have the measurement conundrum. Creative destruction at the firm level isn’t\ncaptured by dynamism statistics. Take, for example, IBM’s reinvention in the early 1990s, after\n14 Chiara Criscuolo, Peter N. Gal, and Carlo Menon, “The Dynamics of Employment Growth: New Evidence from 18\nCountries,” OECD Science, Technology and Industry Policy Papers (May 2014).\n15 Shigeru Fujita, “On the Causes of Declines in the Labor Force Participation Rate,” Research Rap Special Report,\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia (February 2014).\n16 Ian Hathaway and Robert E. Litan, “Declining Business Dynamism in the United States: A Look at States and\nMetros,” Economic Studies at Brookings, The Brookings Institution (May 2014).\n8\n\nthe collapse of the mainframe market. While it fundamentally remade itself into a different\ncompany, that shift wasn’t captured in the dynamism data on entry and exit. Dynamism doesn’t\nmeasure global activity very well either. In this case, Apple is the example. Apple constantly\nadds and drops suppliers as it continues its evolution in product development; in 2013, for\ninstance, it had about 750 suppliers, but almost 90 percent of them were in Asia. That activity\ndoesn’t show up in the U.S. dynamism statistics.\nWhat Can We Do About It?\nWhile we certainly have a measurement problem, it is still clear that dynamism is slowing and\nhas been doing so steadily, not just in the U.S., but across mature economies. It is also the case\nthat a number of factors are conspiring to keep it that way. So what, if anything, can be done?\nI should note here that dynamism, much like food or wine, should be taken in moderation, and an\nexcess could lead to something of an economic hangover. The downside of dynamism, and the\nrisk of overindulging in it, would be a glut of churn and all its attendant costs — frequent\nbankruptcies and business failures, high rates of firings and layoffs, too much job-hopping by\nworkers. But in an environment with the right amount, it has its intended effect: Resources are\nchanneled to more productive uses, workers are more engaged with the labor market, and\ninnovation is nurtured.\nThe first avenue of recourse is that trustiest of panaceas: education. Our future entrepreneurs and\ninventors are in school today, and investing in that human capital is essential. There’s a recent\npaper by Raj Chetty and others that considers what we’re missing out on in terms of what they\ncall “lost Einsteins” — the kids who could and should be patent holders later in life but aren’t\ngetting access to adequate education. As demographic trends continue to exert pressure on our\nlabor force, we’re going to need every contribution to the economy we can get. It’s an exercise in\nfolly to think we can succeed without significant attention to, and investment in, education at all\nlevels.\nWe also need to think about the future of that labor market and the role it plays in growth.\nGrowth, as we all know, is fundamentally growth in the labor force plus growth in productivity.\nWithout an increase in one of those variables, it will stagnate, and productivity growth, as I\nmentioned, has been low as well. It is neither my purview nor my desire to comment on\n9\n\nlegislation, but the economic fact is that we need more people in the workforce and that means in\nthe country. We simply do not have the population to keep growth at even its current rate over\nthe long term. I would also note that immigrants either founded or cofounded just over half of all\nU.S. start-ups valued at $1 billion or more, and immigrant founders have created an average of\n760 jobs per company.17\nSecond, innovation and entrepreneurship need encouragement. That’s everything from funding\nresearch to sensible regulation that considers the benefits of innovation and does not offer\nunearned advantage to incumbents at the expense of new entrants.\nFinally, with a reissuance of my previous caveat that I am not in the business of weighing in on\nanyone else’s area of policymaking, ease of trade is essential. Small and medium-sized firms\naccount for about 97 percent of American businesses that export goods and services and make up\naround 34 percent of the total value of U.S. exports.18 Access to foreign markets and competition\nfuels innovation and productivity, and trade relationships offer opportunities to adapt and adjust\nnew technologies developed outside our borders.\nConclusion\nDynamism is in decline. While the difficulties of measurement may play some part in our overall\nreading, they don’t account for its entirety and they don’t mitigate the broader secular trends.\nDynamism is also essential to U.S. growth and competitive edge, so it’s unwise to leave it\nunprotected from economic fates and furies. There are things we can do, measures we can take,\nand decisions we can make that will affect its trajectory. And in the interest of the American\neconomy, we should.\n17 Stuart Anderson, “Immigrants and Billion Dollar Startups,” NFAP Policy Brief, National Foundation for American\nPolicy (March 2016).\n18 Patrick Delehanty, “Small Businesses Key Players in International Trade,” Issue Brief 11, U.S. Small Business\nAdministration Office of Advocacy (2015).\n10",

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nUnderstanding Monetary Policy Through the Housing Channel\nSamuel Zell and Robert Lurie Real Estate Center Members’ Meeting\nThe Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania\nPhiladelphia, PA\nApril 20, 2023\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood evening, everyone! Any time I get to spend with the Wharton family is time well spent,\nand this is certainly no exception. Thank you for the invitation to join you tonight.\nWith the economy and the Federal Reserve in the news a lot lately, I thought we should spend\nour time together covering a few topics of interest. First, I’ll talk about current economic\nconditions and how they are affecting the Fed’s monetary policy actions. Then, I’ll take a deep\ndive into the effects that monetary policy can have on the housing market and how these\nimpacts transmit through the economy. After that, I plan to leave plenty of time at the end for\nyour questions and comments.\nBut before I do any of that, I have to issue the standard disclaimer: The views I express tonight\nare my own and don’t necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC) or within the Federal Reserve System.\nThe State of the Economy\nWith that out of the way … let’s talk about the state of the economy. In the wake of the\npandemic, one word has remained top of mind for the Federal Reserve: inflation.\n1\n\nWhile headline PCE inflation has come down from its peak of 7 percent last year, it is still\nrunning at 5 percent year over year — way above the Fed’s long-run target of 2 percent\nannually. Recent readings show that inflation is continuing to recede, but it’s doing so slowly.\nThis persistently high inflation comes with real costs for Americans — cutting into purchasing\npower and household wealth. And the pain isn’t being felt equally. The toll is falling most\nheavily on those least able to bear it. I’m especially concerned about the elevated costs of\nshelter, food, and health care — life’s true necessities.\nTo combat this inflation, the Fed has been working to slow the economy modestly and bring it\nmore in line with supply. We have increased the target range for the federal funds rate — our\nprimary monetary policy tool — by 475 basis points since March 2022. Balance sheet reduction\nis another way to tighten conditions.\nWe’re already seeing promising signs that these actions are working — for example, house\nprice indexes are cooling.\nWhat’s encouraging is that even as we have raised rates, the national economy remains\nrelatively healthy overall. Since January, we’ve experienced strong growth in economic activity.\nThere are also still a record number of Americans employed, with more than 1 million jobs\ncreated, on net, so far this year. While there are some signs that labor market tightness is\nbeginning to ease a bit, the unemployment rate remains near record lows — 3.5 percent in\nMarch.\nWe’re also paying close attention to the banking system. The recent failures of Silicon Valley\nBank and Signature Bank ignited an understandable wave of anxiety among banks, depositors,\nand investors. But I can assure you that the U.S. banking system remains sound and resilient.\n2\n\nWe know that problems in a few banks, if left unattended, can undermine confidence in healthy\nbanks. That’s why the Treasury, FDIC, and the Fed acted quickly to protect the U.S. economy\nand its banking interests. The Federal Reserve is also leading a thorough, transparent, and swift\nreview of the events surrounding Silicon Valley Bank so that we can learn what went wrong.\nTaking all of this into account, here’s my outlook for what you should expect from the Federal\nReserve and the economy in the near term.\nThe Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate: to promote full\nemployment and price stability. On the jobs front, things look quite good; we are, effectively, at\nfull employment. But when it comes to inflation, there is still significant room for improvement.\nIt will take some time to evaluate how recent events may impact overall economic activity and\ninflation. I expect to see tighter credit conditions for households and businesses that may slow\neconomic activity and hiring, but the full extent is still unclear.\nWhat is clear is that the Fed remains fully committed to its 2 percent inflation target. To achieve\nthat, I anticipate that some additional tightening may be needed to ensure policy is restrictive\nenough to support both pillars of our dual mandate. Once we reach that point, which should\nhappen this year, I expect that we will hold rates in place and let monetary policy do its work.\nAlong this path, I project that we will see modest growth this year, with real GDP coming in a bit\nbelow 1 percent. I expect inflation to continue declining, landing somewhere between 3\npercent and 3.5 percent this year, before falling to 2.5 percent in 2024, and leveling out at our 2\npercent target in 2025. Unemployment is also likely to tick up slightly, hitting around 4.4\npercent this year.\n3\n\nBut this is just a snapshot of what conditions look like today. We’re operating in a very\nuncertain environment, and I will be closely monitoring our dashboards of economic indicators\nand assessing their implications.\nThe Housing Channel\nI often get asked how the Fed measures the impact of its monetary policy decisions.\nUnfortunately, there’s no simple answer.\nMonetary policy has both immediate and lagging impacts, which affect sectors of the economy\nin different — and often interconnected — ways. To make better sense of it, economists sort\nthese impacts into “channels.”\nBut even within a channel, it can be difficult to get a clear picture of how monetary policy is\ntransmitting — something we can see by taking a closer look at one of our most studied and\nwell-known channels.\nAfter just about every FOMC meeting, you’ll see some version of the same headline pop up:\n“What does the Fed’s decision mean for home buyers?”\nSo, let’s focus our conversation there: on the housing channel. How do the Fed’s actions impact\nhome buyers?\nMortgage Rates\nAs you all know, the Fed doesn’t actually set mortgage rates. Our primary tool for conducting\nmonetary policy, as I mentioned, is the target range for the federal funds rate. But there is a\nclose relationship between this rate and the mortgage rates that are offered to consumers.\nFederal funds transactions are unsecured overnight loans, typically used by depository\ninstitutions to lend or borrow reserves. Of course, this isn’t how people finance home\n4\n\npurchases. They take out mortgages that are collateralized and spread out over multiple years,\nif not decades.\nMortgage lenders take this into account when setting interest rates. They’re not only looking at\nwhat the federal funds rate is today, but what they expect it to be 10 or more years down the\nline. They’re also considering a whole host of broader macroeconomic factors.\nYet there is a clear and fast pass-through from the federal funds rate to mortgage rates. For\nexample, a 30-year fixed rate mortgage could be found for as low as 2.7 percent at the end of\n2020, when our policy rate was effectively at zero. In the last 12 months, that same 30-year\nfixed rate mortgage has climbed to nearly 7 percent, with policy rates now close to 5 percent.\nNow, you might think this means that home buyers are the first stakeholders within the\nhousing channel to be impacted by the Fed’s monetary policy actions. But when rates are\nfalling, there’s another group that can feel it even sooner — and there isn’t even a real estate\ntransaction involved.\nRefinancers\nMortgage refinancing is a big business — if interest rates are going down. In fact, when the\nFOMC cut the federal funds rate to zero in response to the pandemic, refinancing rose to a\nstaggering $2.6 trillion in 2020 and 2021 — more than double the prepandemic value.\nAs homeowners refinanced their mortgages into lower-interest loans, it freed up monthly\nincome, boosting household consumption and savings. This, in turn, helped the economy better\nweather the uncertainty caused by the pandemic — one of the FOMC’s objectives for cutting\nrates at the time.\nThe situation looks quite different today. When mortgage rates increase, there’s little incentive\nto refinance — and we see this show up in recent data. Refinancing fell to $66 billion in the last\n5\n\nquarter of 2022. Other instruments that let owners tap into their home equity, like home equity\nlines of credit, have become more expensive as well.\nIt’s also worth noting that refinancing is history dependent when it comes to the potential\nimpact of monetary policy.1 What rates have been, and for how long, directly affect how much\nrefinancing will be triggered by accommodative monetary policy. With most mortgages today\nlocked in at very low rates, even bringing the federal funds rate all the way back to zero would\nbe unlikely to trigger much meaningful refinancing.\nHome Buyers and Sellers\nNow, let’s turn to our next group of stakeholders impacted by the Fed’s monetary policy\ndecisions: home buyers and sellers.\nHere, it’s time to state the obvious. A higher federal funds rate almost always leads to higher\nmortgage rates, which makes buying a house more expensive for prospective homeowners.\nHigher costs typically dampen demand on both sides of a potential transaction. Home buyers\nmay choose to wait for lower prices or lower rates to make a purchase. Homeowners,\nmeanwhile, may postpone selling to preserve a locked low-interest rate or wait for a higher\nprice. As home sales slow, house prices should eventually decrease, though this usually\nhappens with a lag.\nAfter a year of interest rate increases, we have started to see this process play out in the\ncurrent housing market. After sales of existing homes exceeded 6 million in 2021, we saw sales\nduring the last quarter of 2022 average 4 million at an annual rate. Sales of new homes were\nalso halved from their peak. Meanwhile, house prices have fallen each month since their peak\nin June, though they remain at similar levels to what we saw a year ago.\n6\n\nA drop in house prices can have notable effects within the broader economy. During the Great\nRecession, we saw a pronounced decrease in household consumption tied to declining home\nprices. More recent research has emphasized liquidity effects, which can play an important role\nin determining the strength and timing of monetary policy transmission in the housing channel.\nRonel Elul, from the Philadelphia Fed, and coauthors argue that once all credit constraints that\nhouseholds face are accounted for, there are negligible wealth effects.\nAs we look at the current situation, U.S. households have entered the tightening cycle with\nvery healthy balance sheets. Existing homeowners are also benefiting from low mortgage rates\nand elevated home equity. This gives a “cushion” for homeowners, making it unlikely that a\ncorrection in house prices would trigger widespread liquidity constraints and consumer\nspending reductions.\nIt’s also important to point out that there will never be a perfect relationship between interest\nrates and home-buying trends. The purchase of a home is often associated with other major life\nevents, like getting married. This means that a certain level of housing demand will always be\npresent, regardless of mortgage rates or house prices.\nRenters and Landlords\nThat brings us to our next group of stakeholders who will be most impacted by changes to\nmonetary policy: renters and landlords.\nThe rental market is where we start to see lags pile up as conflicting dynamics play out. As\npotential home buyers delay purchases because of higher rates, rental demand can increase,\nincentivizing landlords to raise rents.2 But their ability to do so immediately can be limited by\nleasing terms that range anywhere from six to 24 months. Landlords may also hesitate to raise\nrents on existing tenants in good standing, who may balk at significant increases and leave units\nempty for months. Striking the right balance is a juggling act.\n7\n\nWhat’s the end result from a monetary policy perspective? A very protracted and muted effect\non renters — who, we can’t forget, make up about a third of total U.S. households.\nBuilders and Investors\nThe impacts only get fainter as we branch out beyond the rental market and into a world many\nof you know well: the supply side. Both builders and investors in the housing channel also\nrespond to monetary policy actions, but long project lead times mean the lags here are\nsubstantial. They’re also more likely to be closely interrelated with other channels, like the cost\nof goods.\nWhere are we today? Housing starts have been slowing down compared with a year ago, but\nthey remain well above their average levels since the Great Recession and prior to the\npandemic. Starts for multiunit structures, which have even longer building lags, have yet to\nabate.\nBack to the Dual Mandate\nUp to this point, we have explored how monetary policy impacts the housing market. But the\nFed’s dual mandate is maximum employment and price stability overall. So, the next question\nbecomes: How much does housing matter for total employment and aggregate inflation?\nFor employment, the answer is: not too much. Employment in construction represents just\nabout 5 percent of total nonfarm payrolls, and only a fraction works with residential buildings.\nLags here confound the picture quite a bit. While employment in construction is still growing\nslightly year over year, declining residential investment has subtracted more than 1 percentage\npoint of GDP growth in the second half of last year.\nBut when it comes to inflation, housing matters. Home prices and rents are also major drivers\nof inflation. Housing makes up about a third of the basket of goods used by the Bureau of Labor\nStatistics to calculate the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Yet, even as home prices have fallen,\n8\n\nshelter inflation has steadily increased. In fact, more than 60 percent of the increase in the\nmost recent core CPI can be attributed to rising shelter costs.\nStructural Factors\nNow, I have mainly talked about housing through the narrow lens of monetary policy. But I’d be\nremiss if I also didn’t touch on the structural factors impacting housing — most notably, the\nlack of affordable housing.\nSince the Great Recession, the U.S. hasn’t built enough housing to keep price growth in check.\nBy most estimates, we are now several million homes short of where we need to be. This is a\nprimary driver of shelter inflation, which, as we discussed, is one of the key reasons core\ninflation remains so high.\nGetting shelter inflation under control is an urgent priority. Monetary policy has a role to play\nhere in broadly fighting inflation, bringing down the costs of goods and services related to the\nhousing channel. But to fully address the scope and scale of this problem, we also need action\nfrom federal, state, and local governments.\nWhat could this look like? Some of the ideas I’ve seen mentioned include changing zoning laws,\nrevising tax codes, building workforce housing, and creating housing subsidies.\nAs a Fed president, I’m neutral on the merits of any specific policy; that’s for other policymakers\nto decide. But I’m not neutral on the need to do something.\nShelter inflation is a macroeconomic drag. Money spent on housing is money that’s not being\nspent on education, services, and durable goods.\nThere are also already signs that our most vibrant metro areas aren’t achieving their full\neconomic potential, because millions of would-be participants simply can’t afford to live there.\n9\n\nThis has major implications for our long-term economic growth, something we should all be\nconcerned about.\nThe Economy Is People\nAs you can see, the housing channel is incredibly complex and interconnected. And it’s only one\nof the many channels we look at to determine how monetary policy is transmitting through the\neconomy. It’s a reminder of why I have always approached this job with humility.\nThe economy isn’t the Federal Reserve, or interest rates, or numbers in a data report. The\neconomy is people — living and working and making the best decisions they can with the\ninformation they have.\nThe only way we can make sound monetary policy decisions is to carefully consider all these\ndifferent perspectives — not only in what the data tell us, but in what we hear from people\ndirectly. Because if we only looked at the economy from a 30,000-foot view, we’d miss a whole\nlot about what’s happening on the ground.\nIt’s also why I love coming to events like this one. While my remarks tonight were confined to\nmonetary policy and the residential home market, I’m eager to hear from all of you about what\nyou’re seeing in the commercial real estate space. You’re on the frontlines of the future of\nwork, the future of retail, and the future of our cities — the very factors that will drive the\nfuture of our economy. Any insights you’d like to share tonight would be well considered and\nmuch appreciated.\nWith that, let’s get to your questions and comments.\nEndnotes\n1 Martin Eichenbaum, Sergio Rebelo, and Arlene Wong, “State Dependent Effects of Monetary Policy: The\nRefinancing Channel,” American Economic Review 112(3) (March 2022), pp. 721–761.\n2 Daniel Dias and João B.

    "text": "The Cost of College\nSaint Louis University\nSt. Louis, MO\nFebruary 21, 2018\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nThe Cost of College\nSaint Louis University\nSt. Louis, MO\nFebruary 21, 2018\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood morning and thank you. It’s a pleasure to be here.\nI’m going to start today with the expected: an overview of the economy and where I see\nmonetary policy headed. I’ll then segue into perhaps the less expected — but nonetheless\napropos — subject of the cost of college and how that relates to the American economy.\nBefore I start, I’ll issue the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone\nand do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\nThe Economic Outlook\nWith that out of the way, a brief overview of the economy, which is doing pretty well.\nOn the growth front, consumer spending remains the driving force as it has been for the past few\nyears. I see that contributing to above-trend real GDP growth in 2018, which I forecast will be\nabout 2.5 percent. After this year, I expect growth to move back down, hovering around the 2\npercent mark for 2019, and then edging further south.\nOn the employment side of our mandate, things are also strong. The labor market continues to\ntighten, and I see the unemployment rate continuing to drop, reaching as low as 3.6 percent by\nmid-2019. After that, I expect it to rise back up a few tenths of a percentage point.\nIn other signs of labor market conditions, I expect job creation to remain strong in 2018. I should\nnote that, as the market continues to tighten, we will eventually see job creation slow —\nultimately, if trends remain as they are, we won’t need much more than about 100,000 a month\n1\n\nto keep up with population growth. It’s something to remember on the first Friday of the month\nwhen commentators call, say, 160,000 jobs disappointing. It’s all a matter of context.\nThe inflation side of the Fed’s mandate is not quite where we want it to be, with inflation\ncontinuing to run below our 2 percent target. I do, however, forecast that it will reach, or exceed,\nthat benchmark by the end of 2019.\nBased on the relatively strong economy, but the continued stubbornness of inflation, I’ve\npenciled in two hikes for 2018. I use pencil because the data can change, and sometimes they\ndon’t accurately point to future events. Like when they predict a Patriots Super Bowl win. The\nFed’s mantra is data dependent, and for now, the data continue to tell me two is the likely\nappropriate path.\nThe other discussion about Fed policy is whether we will rethink our longer-run goals and\nmonetary policy strategy, which I am open to. I’m not advocating for a change, and I don’t have\nany particular favorite in the alternatives. If we do have that conversation, I would expect a full\nand healthy debate of all the alternatives and their pros and cons.\nThe Cost of College\nNow to shift gears a bit but only a bit. The headlines about the cost of college show it’s\nobviously pertinent to the national economy. But it goes deeper than the headlines, and I find that\nthe underlying, secular trends are more impactful. So I’d like to talk about the several ways\ncollege, and the cost of college, affect the overall economy.\nI want to make it clear from the start that when we talk about the price of college, we are\ncertainly talking about the cost to individuals, but we’re also talking about the financial\nconstraints on the colleges themselves. The instinct is often to blame the universities, but they,\ntoo, are facing financial strain that is unlikely to ease.\nI should interject here that I can come at this issue from a number of angles, with experience as a\nprofessor, as a business school dean, as a university president, and as the parent of three\nmillennial children, including one who’s just finished grad school. Each of those gives me a\ndifferent perspective. But I’m going to speak today from the viewpoint of a monetary\npolicymaker, with all the detached practicality that entails.\n2\n\nFirst and foremost, it’s important to be clear about the value of education itself. From pre–K to\npostgrad, the importance of education is almost impossible to overstate.\nIt is one of the constants of human history that, throughout cultures and epochs, the foundation of\nevery society has rested on the education of its people. From a policy perspective, education is\nthe heart that pumps the blood into every other organ in the economy. It trains our workforce, it\nemboldens our innovation, it sharpens our competitive edge.\nI am a great proponent of education for education’s sake, but I’m also a pragmatist in that much\nof the goal of postsecondary education is to prepare students for work. And we have a very\ndifferent labor landscape today than when I was in college. We live in a world that is rapidly\nchanging on both a demographic and technological level, and the old models aren’t necessarily\nkeeping up with the demand for change.\nSecular Trends\nFirst, the demographics.\nLabor force participation in the United States is significantly lower than a decade ago. This is\nlargely due to demographic factors and, according to research by my staff, is likely to continue to\ndecline. I know that millennials are tired of hearing that everything is their fault, tired of\nheadlines saying they’re buying too much avocado toast and not enough housing. So the younger\nof you in the audience will be delighted to hear that this one you can blame on the boomers. The\nboomers represent the largest generation in our history to head into retirement, and they’re living\nlonger as well. And while I’m delighted at the prospect of the extended cut of my own golden\nyears, this will put a strain on the economy.\nFor one, it means more people living on fixed retirement incomes, more people depending on\nMedicare and Social Security, and more people whose medical and general care expenses will be\nhigher than they are now. Much of that burden will fall on the generations behind them.\nIt also means experiencing the downside of a simple economic equation: Growth is,\nfundamentally, growth in the labor force plus growth in productivity. Without an increase in one\nof those variables, GDP is likely to suffer, and in recent years, productivity growth has proven to\nbe stubbornly low as well. Simply put, we need more people.\n3\n\nAnd while the millennial generation is actually larger than the boomers, millennials are both not\nyet in their prime earning years and not large enough in number to increase labor-force growth\nsufficiently. Additionally, the birth drop-off in the mid-’90s means that colleges are likely facing\nfewer occupants of classroom seats in the foreseeable future. This is an issue because the cost of\ncollege is, of course, affected by the numbers of people actually in college.\nI want to reiterate the caveat about the views I express as being my own, and I want to make it\nclear that I’m a monetary policymaker — I don’t add my two cents to fiscal, foreign, domestic,\nor any other policy. But people coming off the sidelines, as well as into the country, add much\nneeded numbers to our workforce. They’re also a component of financial success for colleges\nand universities. Students coming from abroad are an important revenue stream for colleges and\nuniversities because they pay higher tuition fees and contribute substantially to business and\nSTEM programs. If it becomes harder for them to come, or if increased competition from abroad\ngives them incentive to stay home or go elsewhere, institutions’ bottom lines suffer and our\neconomy overall misses out on U.S.-educated students in critical fields. This won’t be remedied\nby simply filling the void with American students; there are entire programs that just don’t have\nenough domestic candidates to survive.\nAnother aspect of the landscape that has changed significantly since my own college days is the\nway technology has affected all aspects of work. It’s no longer uncommon for people to have\nseveral careers in their working lifetime, and constant retraining is essential in virtually every\noccupation. And I’m not just talking about, say, doctors keeping up with the latest surgical\ninvention; I mean that being an auto mechanic today is as much about the computer as it is about\nthe chassis.\nSo, on this vast, macro level, we have the two irresistible forces of demographics and technology\naffecting the very movable object of the American workforce.\nFinancial Pressures and Barriers to Entry\nBut we also have myriad financial factors affecting the individuals who make up the nation’s\nstudent body and our current and future workers, not to mention the pressures on higher\n4\n\neducation institutions themselves. Those burdens may affect the decisions people make about\nwhether and how to pursue postsecondary education.\nBoth the sticker price of tuition and the discounted rate have risen faster than incomes over the\npast 20 years.\nAt the same time, state funding for higher education institutions has been steadily diminishing.\nDemographics are bound to impact this issue even further as an increasing share of budgets on\nthe local, state, and federal levels goes toward retirement benefits, pensions, and health care.\nThese factors contribute to the growing share of student loans, which now makes up the second-\nlargest slice of the consumer debt pie, surpassed only by mortgages. While the issue of tuition\nprices and decreased funding have fueled the market for student loans, I worry that mounting\nnumbers, combined with uncertainty about the future of repayment and forgiveness programs,\nmay deter some lower- and moderate-income students from entering higher education.\nAnd while the financial determinants have received a lot of attention, there are other, less\ntangible factors that either erect barriers to entering college or affect students’ success once\nthey’ve enrolled. There are more elements to the school experience than just tuition and books,\nand campuses around the country have done great work to address that fact. Whether it’s\nnavigating office hours or finding resources like free tutoring, programs that focus on\nunderserved students have been important factors in their success. There’s a good body of\nresearch to back that up, both qualitative and quantitative.1 In fact, one of the Philadelphia Fed’s\nresearch teams is currently working with Rutgers University–Camden to assess the outcomes in\none of its financial aid programs — in this case, one that offers financial relief to students well\ninto the middle-class cohort. Part of their goal is to clarify those additional support needs.\nWhen I was at the University of Delaware, we had a program for students who were the first in\ntheir families to attend college. We had them arrive in June so they could spend a few months\nfamiliarizing themselves with experiences their families just couldn’t give them firsthand advice\non. Some of it was academic, but a lot of it was soft skills, and it worked. Those students had\n1 James J. Heckman and Tim D. Kautz, “Hard Evidence on Soft Skills,” National Bureau of Economic Research\nWorking Paper 18121 (2012), http://www.nber.org/papers/w18121.pdf.\n5\n\nfirst-year GPAs equivalent to their classmates whose families had a history of college\nattendance.\nIncreased cost pressures on institutions may force them to cut or curtail those programs, which\nwould be a great loss, and disproportionately affect lower- and middle-income students.\nThe Resonating Impact\nThe overall issue of student debt is important because it doesn’t just affect individuals; it\nresonates across generational lines in families and spreads into the wider economy.\nResearch shows that in the decade leading up to 2015, the number of adults over 60 who took on\nstudent debt quadrupled, with roughly three-quarters of that being assumed on behalf of children\nor grandchildren.2 Given the same demographic shifts I mentioned earlier, that means debt is\nbeing held by a substantial number of people living on fixed incomes, while the extended\nduration of their lives leaves them more likely to encounter increased care costs, making default\na real threat.\nOn the national level, research by the Philadelphia Fed’s Consumer Finance Institute, along with\nothers, shows that student debt is affecting both small business formation and homeownership\nrates.3, 4\nThose obviously pose a risk far outside the confines of individual debt.\nFinancial uncertainty and cuts to programs that support underrepresented students could also\nexacerbate the achievement gap and increase income inequality. This isn’t just a social issue;\nresearch shows that inequality exacts a financial cost to the country as a whole.5 We are also\n2 CFPB Warns Student Loan Servicing Problems Can Jeopardize Long-Term Financial Security for Older\nBorrowers (2017), https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-warns-student-loan-servicing-\nproblems-can-jeopardize-long-term-financial-security-older-borrowers/.\n3 Brent Ambrose, Lawrence Cordell, and Shuwei Ma, “The Impact of Student Loan Debt on Small Business\nFormation,” Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia Working Paper 15-26 (2015).\n4 Zachary Bleemer, Meta Brown, Donghoon Lee, Katherine Strair, and Wilbert van der Klaauw, “Echoes of Rising\nTuition in Students’ Borrowing, Educational Attainment, and Homeownership in Post-Recession America,” Federal\nReserve Bank of New York Staff Report 820 (2017).\n5 Era Dabla-Norris, Kalpana Kochhar, Nujin Suphaphiphet, Frantisek Ricka, and Evridiki Tsounta, Causes and\nConsequences of Income Inequality: A Global Perspective, International Monetary Fund (2015).\n6\n\nmissing out on vast opportunities on a national scale if we’re not tapping all our resources. It\nmakes logical sense that if sharp minds are denied access to a good education, they won’t reach\ntheir full potential. It’s an old argument, but new research backs this theory up, investigating\nwhat the authors call our “lost Einsteins.” The researchers looked into the backgrounds of patent\nholders in the United States and found some common themes: People who scored well on\nelementary math tests made up the majority, which wasn’t a surprise. But they also came\noverwhelmingly from privileged backgrounds — low-income students who scored the highest on\nthe tests weren’t any more likely to hold a patent than wealthy kids with below-average math\nscores. There were similar results for women, minorities, and people who lived in the southeast\nportion of the country.6 Women alone make up more than half the population; the simple\nnumbers tell us we’re missing out on a lot of potential and productivity in a majority of the\npopulation.\nRethinking Old Models\nAs I said earlier, I come at this issue from a lot of different angles, and the one I’ve chosen —\nthe view of a policy wonk — can get away with bringing the doom and gloom and then leaving\nthe stage. But I’ve seen a lot of inventive thinking on campuses, both as a Fed president and in\nmy former academic life, so I’m going to step into the territory of opining about solutions.\nAgain, remember that disclaimer and send any angry emails directly to me … Changing some of\nthe conventional wisdom in higher education could help. It can’t solve the entire problem but\nthinking about the way we deliver postsecondary education, and the business models of the\ninstitutions, can make a difference.\nThe first question for colleges is, are we making the best use of all our resources? There are ways\nto use assets outside the standard models. Language departments can partner with other schools\nwith bigger budgets to provide career-based instruction, like nursing schools certifying health-\ncare-oriented Spanish or business schools offering business Mandarin. This isn’t a declared\nminor, it doesn’t require tenured faculty, and much of it can be done with supplementary\nsoftware and less time in the classroom. That might seem like common sense, especially to the\n6 Alex Bell, Raj Chetty, Xavier Jaravel, Neviana Petkova, and John Van Reenen, “Who Becomes an Inventor in\nAmerica? The Importance of Exposure to Innovation,” Institute for Economic Policy Research Working Paper 17-\n041 (2017).\n7\n\nstudents here, but academia can be almost intractably rooted in orthodoxy, and moving beyond\ncomfort zones — or thinking about education as a revenue stream — can make people\nuncomfortable. There is often a resistance to change, even when it’s in the best economic\ninterests of the institution. The call from many — and I count myself as one — is for more\ncreative approaches to maximizing an institution’s assets.\nSome of the most innovative thinking I’ve seen lately has come out of community colleges. As I\nsaid earlier, education for its own sake is important, and so is the range of learning that comes\nwith a four-year degree. But there are also gaps to be filled in a constantly evolving workforce\nand new careers and areas of research that schools can branch out into.\nI was recently touring Atlantic City and the wider Atlantic County, which are part of my District.\nLike a lot of places, when one industry drives the economy, it can be hard to diversify. Atlantic\nCounty is trying to optimize its assets beyond gambling to bring more growth to the area. I\nalways knew they had an airport out there, but I hadn’t realized the size and scope of it, even\nthough I’m a New Jersey native. It’s a hub of FAA research labs, they train U.S. Marshals, and\nthe Coast Guard and Air National Guard have facilities there. It’s got a 10,000-foot-runway that\nwas built so the space shuttle could land in case of emergency. As far as resources go, it’s a\npretty great asset. But it wasn’t being used as well as it could have been. So the county talked to\nthe airline industry, found out there’s a massive shortage of mechanics and other aviation\nspecialists, and are working in partnership with Atlantic Cape Community College to create an\ninstitute on-site.\nOr take Philadelphia, where YouthBuild Philadelphia Charter School, which serves students\nwho’ve previously dropped out of high school, has partnered with the local community college\non training and apprenticeships.\nPrograms like these can help students avoid debt, funnel people into well-paying, understaffed\noccupations, and develop new revenue streams without disrupting four-year programs.\nThe Value of Skills-Based Learning\nThey do something else important, which is that they stress the value of skills-based training and\nunconventional paths to education. Not everyone needs a four-year degree and not everyone\n8\n\nneeds to go college right away. A singular university experience isn’t right for everyone, and if\nwe can shift the thinking on the different ways people engage in higher education, we can shift\nthe thinking about the ways we provide it.\nMy staff has done research on what they call opportunity occupations, jobs that pay at or above\nthe median wage without a traditional four-year degree. They don’t just know what fields they’re\nin; they know where they are geographically, which could make it easier to create a pipeline.\nThese are good, solid careers that can support a middle-class life.\nApprenticeships can also be incredibly valuable, as can any “learn and earn” program. They are a\npath to a career, and people can save for school later on, go back for more training, or master a\nprofession.\nI’m not advocating that traditional four-year institutions change their models to practical\ntraining. I am saying that the pragmatic approaches these programs take to meeting the needs of\nbusiness and industry, while simultaneously being creative in how they educate students, can\nhelp us rethink some of the old ways of doing business.\nThis is the most inventive, diverse economy on the planet, and our approach to education should\nbe just as innovative. In the face of multiple forces applying financial pressure, it just makes\nsense to rethink some of the ways institutions operate.\nConclusion\nEducation, at all levels, is fundamental to the success of the American economy and takes on\neven greater importance in the face of a declining labor force participation rate. We need every\npossible person playing an active part, and access to the right education is crucial to their — and\nour — success. If we can be creative about how we deliver all aspects of postsecondary\neducation, we can increase institutions’ finances and better serve all students by preparing them\nfor work, adapting to their needs, and helping them reduce or avoid debt.\n9",

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nAdaptation: How Educators and Employers Evolve\nto Meet the Needs of a Changing Landscape\nGlobal Interdependence Center Conference:\nThe Role of Higher Education in Competitiveness and Global Productivity\nPhiladelphia, PA\nOctober 9, 2018\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood afternoon and thank you.\nWhen I saw the agenda for today, I noticed that it covers a lot of what I wanted to address, which both\nassures me that I won’t wander too far afield and runs the risk of boring you with repetition. On one\nthing I’m sure to be original, however, and that is in delivering the standard Fed disclaimer that the\nviews I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal\nReserve System.\nI have the privilege — or perhaps the curse — of a number of perspectives on higher education. I spent a\nlong time in academia, both in teaching and administration; I was a first-generation college graduate;\nand I am the parent of three millennial children, one of whom recently finished graduate school.\nAcknowledging that I likely have some unconscious biases informed by each of these experiences — and\nsome conscious ones that I’ll keep quiet — I’m going to speak today from the monetary policymaker’s\nperch and focus on the impact of higher education in the larger context of the American economy.\nToday I’d like to address the evolving nature of the labor market, the changing realities for higher\neducation and employers, and the implications of the sum of those parts.\nBefore that, however, I’d like to set some parameters for my remarks. Specifically, what I see as the\nfundamental purpose of higher education. I want to dispense with the debate over its aim being either\npreparation for work or the intellectual pursuit of a more examined life because it creates a false sense\n1\n\nof mutual exclusivity. Higher education should, absolutely, help prepare students for a career after\ngraduation, and as technology advances at a more and more rapid pace, rethinking how we do that is\nessential. But that doesn’t mean abandoning the arts and humanities. In fact, as I’ll expand on later, I\nthink it actually makes the case for their importance.\nAnd while the phrase “higher education” tends to elicit images of brick walls and ivy, it also consists of a\nrange of postsecondary options, from community colleges to technical schools to training programs,\nwhich are critically important and play a central role in an evolving labor market. All of these, whether\nthey lean toward the practical or the philosophical, help students develop life skills, accumulate\nknowledge, and appreciate learning for its own sake.\nThe Changing Landscape of Work — Demographics\nThere are two overwhelming factors influencing higher education’s future: demographics and\ntechnology.\nDemography has exerted force on a number of areas of the economy, including labor force\nparticipation. The current participation rate is significantly lower than it was a decade ago, and research\nby my staff indicates that the trend will likely continue. As the baby boomers head into retirement,\nthey’ll be the largest generation in history to do so. That will mean more people relying on Social\nSecurity and Medicare than ever before, and since they’re also living longer, they’ll be doing it for an\nextended period of time.\nThe millennial generation is actually a bit larger than the boomers, but even the oldest millennials are\nnot quite in their prime earning years. So the share of that population paying into those programs is\nweighted toward the less affluent end of the spectrum.\nWe are also not seeing a great boom in population. As we all know, economics is full of equations that\nutilize the entirety of the Greek alphabet. But one of the most important rules is a simple sum: Growth\nin the labor force plus growth in productivity equals economic growth. With productivity also running\nlow, the overall growth potential for the country is affected.\nI will make a note here that we could be miscalculating productivity. One of our economists, Leonard\nNakamura, has done extensive research on how technology has affected our understanding of\nproductivity, which is notoriously difficult to measure in the first place.\n2\n\nWhat is not as difficult to measure, however, is population growth, and without more people, it will be\nharder for the economy to expand.\nTrends in demographics affect the people who have a stake in higher education in different ways.\nFrom the business end, we have employers who say they can’t find the right skills, businesses that say a\ndearth of workers is affecting their ability to grow, and HR departments struggling to fill vacancies for\nlonger and longer periods of time.\nFor higher education, there are fewer people in seats due to the drop-off in the birth rate in the mid-\n1990s. A decrease in foreign students further impacts the bottom line, because they generally pay full\ntuition. They also make up a substantial portion of STEM and business study, and there are entire\nprograms that don’t have enough domestic candidates to survive. If it becomes harder for foreign\nstudents to come, or if increased competition from abroad gives them incentive to stay home or go\nelsewhere, schools’ bottom lines suffer, and our economy overall misses out on U.S.-educated students\nin critical fields.\nThe Changing Landscape of Work — Technology\nThe other outsized force remaking the landscape of work is technology. It’s changing how we work,\nwhere we work, and, most importantly, what kind of work we do.\nAs I delve into this conversation, I want to put it in context, because the threats and opportunities\ninherent to this subject are very easily, and very often, mischaracterized.\nI’m an engineer by training and that lens doesn’t just give me endless ways to bore people about fluid\nmechanics; it frames subjects as one function of a whole. In this case, it places today’s technology at one\npoint on a journey that humanity started when we first chiseled stone into tools.\nFrom ancient Egypt to the Internet Age, each advancement has laid the groundwork for the next,\ncreating not just more ingenious invention, but faster innovation. This isn’t new; it’s the natural\nprogression of humanity’s search to make life more comfortable and efficient. What is new is its pace.\nAlong this journey, jobs and industries have morphed and transformed, and they will continue to do so.\nOur challenge — and our opportunity — is how to train people to change with them. To do that, we\nhave to understand how and where those changes are taking place.\n3\n\nThe Philadelphia Fed just published research that shows the likely effect of automation in our District\nand in the U.S. In addition to identifying jobs that are in danger of automation, we assigned degrees of\nlikelihood to it happening. We also looked at the people doing those jobs, who would be hardest hit,\nand where new jobs would likely be created.\nWe found that almost one in five jobs in our District had a 95 percent or better chance of becoming\nautomated. We also found that the people most likely to be displaced are some of the economy’s most\nvulnerable workers — women, people of color, younger people, and workers in lower-skilled positions.\nSome people will be absorbed into new jobs, but there’s a risk that others will not. Armed with this\nknowledge, we can think about how to connect those workers to training and new job opportunities.\nThe underpinning of this and other research is that, while we haven’t seen this exact kind of innovation\nbefore, we’ve seen the pattern. Throughout history, as jobs change, they’ve produced other jobs. With\ninformation on how and where that will happen, we can create systems that help workers, employers,\nand educators adapt.\nThe Intersection of Employers’ and Higher Education’s Needs\nThe changing landscape of the labor market offers an opportunity to assess how we’re preparing today’s\nstudents for tomorrow’s jobs.\nAgain, I am looking through that big-picture lens, because while technological fluency is important, I\nwould caution against an overcorrection that disregards everything but the coding.\nAs we think about what skills will be necessary for the future, particularly in the context of technological\nadvancements, we shouldn’t forget the value of the skills honed by the arts and humanities.\nCommunication, critical thinking, interpretation of intent; the wide range of subjects in a classical liberal\narts education forces the mind to shift gears, and that adaptability is crucial in a time of constant\nchange.\nAs automation continues its march, it also lays bare the human capabilities that cannot be artificially\nreproduced. Much of what automation has already displaced — and the industries in which its impact\nwill continue to grow — are repetitive actions and rote knowledge that robots do better and more\nefficiently than us. Artificial intelligence in its current form is not akin to a self-aware Hal in 2001; its\noutput is limited to the things we input. Our comparative human advantages of creativity and\nindividuality cannot be duplicated. At least not yet. If that happens, disregard everything I just said …\n4\n\nI was preceded on the agenda by a panel on what higher education needs and wants from business and\ngovernment, and I’m followed by its counterpart, what business and government ask of higher ed.\nI actually think those wants and needs intersect.\nThe inevitability of continued technological evolution will necessitate two things: a core set of skills that\ncan evolve with the market and a shift to constant training and continuing education.\nProfessions will need continual upskilling, whether it’s to keep up with industry standards or just learn\nthe office’s new software, while those preparing for the workforce will need both proficiency in current\nprograms and to develop skills that will help them adapt with the technology as it evolves.\nFrom the employers’ end, that means investing in the workforce and committing to lifelong learning.\nSimply replacing outdated skills with new ones just isn’t efficient or cost-effective, and it may not even\nbe enough — they’ll need workers who can adapt to a dynamic and regularly changing environment,\nand that takes investment in people.\nEducators will also need to consider new models, not just because technology is forcing it, but because\nthey’ll be in a position to offer the lifelong learning that workers need.\nRethinking Models and Mindsets\nIn rethinking models, we should also rethink mindsets because there are some entrenched beliefs that\nwe need to change if we’re going to successfully adapt.\nI just made the case for the importance of the humanities, and I believe in their value. But I also think\nthat we place too great an emphasis on traditional, four-year education, particularly when it comes to\nemployment.\nThe other components of higher education I mentioned earlier — community colleges, technical\nschools, training programs — are equally valid sources of skilled workers and, in some instances, better\nsuited to employers’ needs. A bachelor’s is not the only educational path to the skills employers want,\nthough it’s too often a requirement.\nWhen my staff was researching “opportunity occupations” — jobs that pay at or above the median wage\nthat don’t require a four-year degree — they found something interesting. Despite not requiring a\ndegree, employers started asking for one during the slow recovery, when higher unemployment created\nmore competition. We’ve seen that in a lot of sectors, and, while it’s retreated to a large extent, the\n5\n\ndegree inflation still exists in some places. I’ve been shown website galleries of some of the more\negregious job ads: degree required, master’s preferred, previous experience … $7.50 an hour, no\nbenefits.\nThat misalignment of requirements and the actual needs of the job perpetuates the veneration of\npedigrees over skills, which is a mindset I think we need to change. But it also risks employers missing\nout on the right candidate.\nThis reconsideration of skills and degrees is more important than ever. We have a labor market with\nvery little slack left, and the most common refrain I hear from employers is that they can’t fill the jobs\nthey have. Those demographic and technological pressures are unlikely to recede.\nI was recently in Lancaster, PA, where a business owner told me they can’t get enough workers for\nassembly line work. It’s a straightforward job, just taking pretzels off the belt and putting them in boxes.\nThey’re paying $17 an hour. And those are the jobs that don’t require training.\nFor higher education, there is an opportunity to rethink new partnerships and models that could also\nbring in more revenue while, at the same time, better responding to the needs of business and industry.\nThis is important for many institutions as demographic forces are likely to shift an increasing share of\nlocal, state, and federal budgets toward retirement benefits, pensions, and health care. States’\nproposed budgets are generally calling for increased spending in fiscal 2019 and there is attention to\nhigher education. However, the overall growth is smaller than historical averages, and there are many\ncompeting interests.1\nAs higher education institutions of all types look at their balance sheets and as consolidations and\nmergers increase across the sector, there are both opportunities and risks.\nI know from experience that change can be a daunting proposal, especially at institutions that are\nhistorically or culturally resistant to it. And the suspicion is understandable, particularly if there’s a fear\nthat quality of education is being sacrificed for revenue streams, and when too much of the debate\nframes education’s focus as an either-or proposition.\n1 The National Association of State Budget Officers, “Summaries of Fiscal Year 2019 Proposed & Enacted Budgets,”\nWashington, D.C. (August 31, 2018).\n6\n\nThere are, however, new and creative ways to adapt to the needs of a changing landscape without\nsurrendering the essential characteristics that make all of our postsecondary paths of study exceptional.\nThere are great models that both employers and educators can consider. Some of the most innovative\nhave come out of community colleges. They range from working with individual businesses to give credit\nfor on-site work to competency-based bachelor’s degrees for experienced professionals.\nOur research on apprenticeships has also highlighted some exceptional models; we visited the Philly\nShipyard last year, and the participants we met ranged from a woman with an M.F.A. who’s become\ntheir star welder to a man in his 40s whose Facebook page is overwhelmed by friends angling for the\nnext opening. But just as importantly, we’ve seen apprenticeships emerge in finance, IT, and health care,\nareas we don’t traditionally associate with a model that dates back to the Code of Hammurabi.\nPeter Cappelli, who heads up the Center for Human Resources at Wharton, has done research on the\nmost important lines on a recent graduate’s résumé; number one is internships. Employers are looking\nfor experience. There are any number of partnerships that could occur both across and within sectors\nthat could benefit everyone involved. This is especially important when a good portion of internships are\nstill unpaid, which puts lower-income students at a disadvantage. While the share of paid internships\nhas been rising steadily over the past several years, in 2017, the unpaid ones still accounted for more\nthan 43 percent.2\nEducation’s Impact on the Economy\nThe pull of demographic forces doesn’t just affect labor force participation; it plays a role in dynamism\nas well. The U.S. economy has historically been dynamic. By that I mean the standard economics\ndefinition of turnover in businesses, jobs, and worker mobility, rather than innovative and energetic,\nthough that’s certainly apropos. Dynamism has been on the decline for the past 30 years or so. If we\nwant to keep the economy from stagnating, we need as many participants in the workforce as possible.3\nWe also need a workforce that is trained and adaptive to change.\n2 National Association of Colleges and Employers, “Trend Is Toward Paid Internships,” (February 15, 2018).\n3 Ryan A. Decker, John Haltiwanger, Ron S. Jarmin, and Javier Miranda, “Declining Business Dynamism: Implications\nfor Productivity?” Hutchins Center Working Paper 23 (September 2016).\n7\n\nThere are real consequences to the skills and labor shortage. We often talk about it in broad terms —\nthe economic reality that businesses can’t expand and overall dynamism falls. That, in itself, is obviously\na pressing issue, but zeroing in on specific sectors highlights the potential for ripple effects.\nTake health care as an example. I was recently in Wellsboro, in the far northeastern corner of\nPennsylvania, meeting with business and community leaders to discuss their approaches to economic\ngrowth. One of them runs a hospital, and despite offering higher salaries than Philadelphia does for\ndoctors and health-care workers, they’re struggling to recruit.\nMultiply that by cities and towns across the country facing similar skills shortages and add to that the\nretirement of the boomers that I mentioned earlier. Roughly 10,000 people turn 65 each day in the U.S.,\na trend that started in 2011 and is likely to continue for another decade.4 Consider additionally that\nhealth care currently accounts for almost 18 percent of the economy and is on track to make up 20\npercent by 2025.5 It puts the need for skilled workers in perspective.\nThe Opportunity (of a Lifetime)\nI actually think we have an incredible opportunity, one that doesn’t come around often. We have a labor\nforce with very little slack left, and there is a confluence of discussions about the future of higher\neducation, the importance of skills, and the impact of technology on our lives. It’s the perfect time to\nsee these all in the frame of the bigger picture and consider what it means for the next five, 10, 20\nyears. That can help us to structure our education, training, and workforce to adapt and evolve as the\nlandscape does.\nThank you.\n4 Russell Heimlich, “Baby Boomers Retire,” Pew Research Center (December 29, 2010).\n5 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, “Historical,” CMS.gov (last modified January 8, 2018).\n8",

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nDelaware’s Economic Recovery: A Work in Progress\nDelaware State Chamber 2021 Economic Outlook\nWilmington, DE (Virtual)\nApril 13, 2021\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood morning! It’s great to be back in Delaware. And thanks to the magic of virtual conferences, I didn’t\neven have to fight traffic on I-95 to be here with you.\nI’m really looking forward to our discussion today — especially the Q&A portion. But before we get to\nthat, I’d like to offer you a few thoughts on where we are economically, both nationally and in Delaware.\nI’d also like to talk a bit about how we can build a more equitable and sustainable economy as we\nrecover from the pandemic.\nBut before we do that, I need to give you my standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my\nown and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or in\nthe Federal Reserve System.\nThe State of the Economy\nI last addressed this group almost a year ago. At the time, this “new normal” we’ve all become\naccustomed to was still just that: new. Nonessential businesses were shuttered, COVID-19 cases were\nspiking, and vaccines still seemed only a distant hope.\nLike most first-year anniversaries, ours is a fairly happy one.\n1\n\nThat’s because, although last year and the early part of 2021 were really, really tough — and tragic for\nmillions of Americans — things have noticeably begun to turn around.\nEconomic data like employment and manufacturing figures came in stronger over the last couple of\nmonths than many of us expected. While I’m concerned about the downside risks from COVID-19\nvariants and the alarming virus spikes in states like Michigan, I still think that a combination of increased\nvaccinations, falling COVID-19 case rates, and a huge dose of fiscal stimulus should buoy the national\neconomy. For now, I’m expecting GDP growth to come in around 5 to 6 percent in 2021. I would expect\nthe labor market to parallel GDP growth and unemployment to fall throughout this year.\nFor now, Fed policy is going to hold steady. We’ll keep the federal funds rate very low and continue\nmaking more than $100 billion in monthly Treasury bond and mortgage-backed securities purchases.\nWhile the economic situation is improving, recovery is still in its early stages, and there’s no reason to\nwithdraw support yet.\nEconomic data for Delaware, meanwhile, indicate a real recovery is underway here as well. But it’s very\nmuch a work in progress.\nPayroll data show that the state has recovered more than 60 percent of the jobs lost at the beginning of\nthe pandemic — but we’re still around 24,500 jobs below where we were before COVID-19. That’s\nenough for the unemployment rate in the state to have fallen from 13.4 percent a year ago to 6.3\npercent now. That’s encouraging, of course, though in February 2020, the unemployment rate in\nDelaware was 4.5 percent. Labor force participation is similarly improving, but it’s still down from pre-\npandemic highs. It now sits at 61.3 percent, up from last April’s 60.1 percent, but down from last\nFebruary’s 62.7 percent.\nThose broad numbers mask vast disparities across different segments of the economy, of course.\nFinance and insurance — collectively responsible for nearly 30 percent of Delaware’s GDP — have\nremained basically unscathed, a remarkable development for those of us who recall the Great Recession\nof 2008 and 2009.\nThe same cannot be said for tourism and hospitality. Net revenue at Delaware’s small businesses in the\nleisure and hospitality sector continues to hover around 50 percent of prepandemic numbers. But even\nhere, there are hopeful signs. The Rehoboth Beach‒Dewey Beach area is reporting an uptick in demand\nfor weekend accommodations — demand now outstrips prepandemic times, likely a sign that people\n2\n\nwho may have traveled farther afield in other years are now sticking closer to home. And open job\npostings in hospitality and leisure have been climbing for months.\nManufacturing, collectively responsible for about 6 percent of the state’s economic production, is also\nshowing an increase in hiring, though it’s still just slightly below the prepandemic trend. In a sign of\nincreased productivity, the manufacturing of chemical products, as well as food, beverages, and tobacco\nproducts, are all up from 2019, despite a slightly smaller workforce.\nAnd lastly, it may be bad news if you happen to be a chicken, but good news for Delaware’s people:\nAgriculture has remained steady during this period. The number of operating farms in the state has not\nchanged during the pandemic.\nIntroducing the Occupational Mobility Explorer\nSo, a recovery is clearly underway. And with that comes a great opportunity for all of us. We can shape\nwhat’s coming to build a recovery that is equitable and durable.\nLet me tell you a little bit about a new tool the Philadelphia Fed recently launched that I think you will\nfind very interesting — and hopefully useful for your businesses.\nThe tool came out of work done by researchers at the Philadelphia Fed and the Cleveland Fed. They\nbegan by asking a question: How do we transition workers in low-paying, unstable jobs into what we call\nopportunity occupations — jobs that pay above the median wage and that don’t require a college\ndegree.\nThey came up with an ingenious idea: They looked at the skill sets of the people who currently hold\nthose low-opportunity jobs. They then matched those skills to jobs that would pay at least 10 percent\nmore than their current wage and that don’t require a traditional four-year degree.\nThe findings were incredibly encouraging. Looking at 33 metro areas nationwide, they found that nearly\nhalf of lower-wage employment can be paired with at least one higher-paying occupation requiring\nsimilar skills. For transitions connecting the most similar occupations identified in the study, the pay\ndifferences are significant, with an average bump in wages of almost $15,000 — a 49 percent increase in\nsalary.\n3\n\nWe’ve recently launched an interactive online tool — the Occupational Mobility Explorer — to help\nworkers and employers make those transitions. Once you are in Explorer, you can select your\ngeographic location and current occupation, and you will find a variety of jobs that require similar skills\nand pay at least 10 percent more in wages.\nFor example, receptionists here in the Philadelphia‒Wilmington area will find that they possess many of\nthe skills necessary to become a medical secretary, a job that pays about 26 percent more — on\naverage, a bump in salary from around $30,000 to $38,000. Bill collectors in the Wilmington area could\nbump their salary 45 percent, from an average of about $38,000 to nearly $55,000 by becoming a credit\ncounselor — with the added bonus that people will actually want to answer the phone when you call.\nThe tool can also be used by workforce development practitioners, community colleges, and, of course,\nall of you. The Explorer can help inform your reskilling programs, employee recruitment, and hiring\npractices as millions of workers seek to reenter the job market as we emerge from the pandemic.\nThere’s a lot of talent out there that we would be foolish to leave on the sidelines.\nAffordable Childcare\nAnother factor that has driven far too many talented people out of the workforce is a dearth of childcare\noptions. The Philadelphia Fed, in partnership with the Delaware Chamber, is piloting a Research in\nAction Lab focused on providing childcare options. I know we are planning a full briefing sometime this\nsummer, so I don’t want to play the spoiler.\nBut I do want to point out the economic cost that all of us incur when people — and let’s be frank,\nmostly mothers — leave the labor force because they can’t find an affordable option for taking care of\ntheir kids during the workday. Like quality education, affordable childcare is not merely a “nice to have”\n— it’s an economic necessity.\nAnd it’s an expensive one. Here in Delaware, it costs the median-earning family 20 percent of their\nincome to pay for the care of a child under 5 years old. That’s a heavy burden — even before COVID-19\nshuttered many schools and childcare centers, further straining families.\nMaking childcare more affordable is a complex issue, but one that surely requires our attention. Already,\none of the most oft-cited reasons couples give for having fewer children than they say they want is the\ncost of raising them.\n4\n\nMy colleagues at the Minneapolis Fed have found that, at the outset of the pandemic, many parents of\nyoung children left the labor force — 3.4 percent of fathers and 2.9 percent of mothers dropped out\naltogether. But in the ensuing year, most fathers have returned to the labor force, while the\nparticipation rate of mothers of young children is still down 2.8 percentage points from before the\npandemic. As with all those workers with skills languishing in low-opportunity jobs, too much human\ncapital is lying untapped.\nSo, again, thank you so much for having me here. Hopefully this fall I’ll see all of you when I’m cheering\nfor the Blue Hens — in person.\nAnd now, I’m happy to take questions.\n5",

    "text": "Working on Working:\nReimagining Training Models in a New Era\nBusiness Innovations for the Future of Work\nDrexel University\nPhiladelphia, PA\nNovember 6, 2019\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nWorking on Working: Reimagining Training Models in a New Era\nBusiness Innovations for the Future of Work\nDrexel University\nPhiladelphia, PA\nNovember 6, 2019\nPresented by Patrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood afternoon. It really is important to have this group assembled here to have these\nconversations, so I first want to thank everyone for coming.\nSecond, I want to deliver a disclaimer that’s familiar by now to our friends and partners: The\nviews I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the\nFederal Reserve System.\nThe agenda topics are so important because we’re addressing the future of work at a distinctive\npoint of history. No one here needs to be told that the landscape of work is changing. But I\nwould argue that that’s always been the case: From the Industrial Revolution to the rise of\nSilicon Valley, we have always found new and more efficient ways of doing things. It’s a\nfundamental part of the human story.\nThings are, however, a bit different this time around. For one, the change is coming a lot faster\nthan it used to. For another, the labor market itself is different. Together, they create a unique\nset of circumstances that pretty much gives us the chance of a lifetime.\nUnemployment is at a half-century low. Businesses are having trouble finding skilled workers.\nThis has, to some extent, forced us to view the workforce from a new perspective. In an\nemployers’ market, it’s easy to see jobs as individual vacancies; there’s a seemingly endless\nsupply of candidates, each one more credentialed than the last. But when the candidates are in\nshorter supply than the jobs, we have to think about how to solve the problem systemically —\n1\n\nnot just to fill the vacancies we have now, but to train, recruit, and upskill a workforce that can\nadapt to future needs. Because we know that future is coming at us fast.\nAn abundance of research, including from the Philadelphia Fed, has shown the effect\nautomation will have — and is already having — on work. There is no question that technology\nis altering or eliminating some jobs, just as it has throughout history. Research shows, however,\nthat other hallmarks of those previous cycles are also evident now: Where some jobs are\ndestroyed, others will emerge. The Luddites may have been right about how the mechanized\nloom would affect them individually, but it created a boom in the textile industry that required\na host of new workers. Today, too, we see new jobs arising from the exact machines that\nrendered the old ones obsolete: Even five years ago, who’d heard of a professional drone\noperator? Now employers can’t find enough of them.\nWhat’s crucial in the research on artificial intelligence is that we don’t just know what jobs are\nlikely to go, we know who’s likely to be most affected. It’s the people who are already\ndisproportionately represented among vulnerable workers — women, people of color, younger\npeople, and workers in lower-skilled positions. But this presents an opportunity. We can\npinpoint the people who’ll need support; the people businesses can view as the next wave of\nskilled workers. That allows businesses to create a pool of desperately needed talent, but more\nimportantly, it means we can create access to careers, instead of the soul-crushing cycle of\ntaking a job, losing it to a machine, finding a new one, and being automated out of that. This is\nan incredible opportunity, as long as we make that investment, and make it in the right way.\nWe have an abundance of research that points to the skills we’ll need in, and for, the future.\nPeople will need technological skills, of course — everything from your sandwich order at\nWawa to health care is being digitized. But one of the most important lessons of AI’s march\nforward is that it makes the advantage of distinctly human skills entirely clear. More than\nanything right now, employers are looking for those abilities, the “soft skills” that can’t be\nrobotized. Which means that as we look at the methods and programs we put into place to\ntrain people — whether they’re our existing staff, people who’ll be displaced by automation, or\npeople still on the sidelines — we know that technical skills are key, but they should be taught\n2\n\nwith an emphasis on adaptability and critical thinking. We need programs that arm people with\npractical knowledge, while honing those core, uniquely human skills that will allow them to not\njust perform well in one specific job, but to succeed as that job — and the next one — evolves.\nAnd, importantly, to move up the professional ladder.\nOne of the most important factors in this event’s discussions is that it convenes a multitude of\nplayers. Because none of this can be accomplished by a single group or sector.\nIt would be easy to frame this discussion in terms of outcomes — who benefits and why that\nshould motivate them. But the truth is, there’s no one discrete incentive for any particular\nsector; there are a thousand good reasons, all intertwined, that matter to all of us. A skilled,\nadaptable workforce is good for everyone. It gets business done, it draws investment to cities,\nand it lifts the local economy. It helps us build more inclusive growth and a more equitable\nsociety.\nAnd it stands to reason that if we all benefit, we should all play a part.\nEach of us, whether we come from a public, private, philanthropic, or academic organization,\nhas expertise that the rest of us need.\nIt’s a core tenet of management science that the most effective leaders assemble a team of\nexperts.\nIn our work at the Philadelphia Fed, we’ve gathered examples of this in our Research in Action\nLabs. Our academic research provides a host of evidence that we’re working to apply practically\nin communities around our District. But it obviously wouldn’t work if we just marched in and\ntold people what the academic paper says we should do. We have to have partners from all\ncorners — they’re the ones with the expertise. So when, for instance, we launched the first RIA\nLab in northeastern PA to improve transportation infrastructure, we had representatives from\nthe community, business, labor, city officials. Everyone played a role.\nWhat’s important about this is that we collectively found a way to address both the region’s\nand individual participants’ specific issues. For instance, Geisinger, the main health-care\nprovider in the region, is feeling the industry-wide pressure of rapidly increasing need coupled\n3\n\nwith a workforce in short supply. And like any other job, if your employees can’t get to you, you\ndon’t have a staff. But a light bulb went off during the process that they could solve a second\nproblem: They were losing money when people didn’t show up to their appointments. So they\nstarted an “appointment navigator” initiative to cover those last miles, whether by van, taxi, or\nride share, to ensure their patients could get there.\nThat’s the kind of creative thinking we need right now. And while each city and town is unique,\nwe now have a blueprint we can hand to other areas.\nSo this conversation between and across experts is vitally important, and that outside-the-box\nthinking is equally crucial. We hear from employers, for instance, that there’s a massive skills\nshortage. And there’s evidence to back that up. But we also hear from hiring experts — and our\nown research shows — that some of that might be mitigated by different attitudes and\napproaches to recruiting.\nOur economists analyzed a huge data set — more than 90 percent of all online postings — to\nlook at the factors affecting the length of time a job stays open. One of those researchers, Ryo\nTashiro, will discuss this study with you, so I’ll keep the spoilers to a minimum. But overall, they\nfound what we would expect, which is that routine, manual positions filled quickly and the ones\nrequiring cognitive skills stayed open longer. Or, the ones most likely to automate were most\neasily filled, while the ones requiring innately human skills were hardest. They also found that\nthe higher the bar for educational attainment or years’ experience, the more time the position\nwent unfilled.\nThe clear lesson is that it’s harder to hire a psychologist than an assembly-line worker. But\nthere may be something more, something we saw in a different area of research. “Opportunity\noccupations” are ones that pay at or above the median wage but don’t require a four-year\ndegree. And while, by definition, they don’t require a traditional degree, there was evidence\nthat employers began inflating degree and experience expectations in the years after the\nrecession. We saw this trend in other areas as well, and while it has largely reversed itself, it’s a\ngood reminder to think about what we’re really looking for. As someone who comes from\nacademia, it surprises people when I say we often assign too much power to that traditional\n4\n\ndegree. This moment requires thinking creatively, and that includes reassessing our\nassessment. Looking beyond degrees as the sole benchmark of skill can help mine those\nuntapped resources.\nAnd, finally, that shift in thinking has to extend to how we see workers — not as an expense,\nbut an investment; a core asset that’s essential to the business. That could be upskilling existing\nstaff or investing in local potential. All those people at risk of being automated out of a job\ncould go through the revolving doors of the traditional “train and pray” model, or we can\ninvest in them to give them, and Philadelphia, a better future.\nObviously, we can’t ask people to make an investment we’re not willing to make ourselves. In\n2018, the Philadelphia Fed brought on Social Finance to help us launch an innovative new\nfunding model for workforce investment — one that allows private sector firms to be investors,\nrather than simply serving on boards or allocating philanthropic dollars.\nOutside of this room, that might not sound radical. But in the world of public-private\npartnerships, it’s essentially turning the old model on its head. And we’re very pleased that two\nof those partners are with us today.\nThe first is Philadelphia Works, our local workforce investment board, which will be providing\nthe upfront investment in this pilot training program. The other is a company that is on the\nfrontline of technological and workforce change, and knows firsthand the skills that are vital to\nPhiladelphia: Comcast.\nAs part of this new financial model, Comcast is committed to paying for outcomes once they\nare achieved, such as staying on the job for over six months. The model also creates a better\nfeedback loop between employers and the workforce board to make it more effective.\nAt the heart of this partnership are the subjects we’re tackling here today: training that\ndevelops both technical and adaptive skills; a collaborative approach that brings in experts\nacross sectors; and a fundamental understanding that workforce development is an\ninvestment.\n5\n\nAnd now, I’m very pleased to introduce one of the people who made this pilot happen, the co-\nfounder and CEO of Social Finance, Tracy Palandjian.\nUnder Tracy’s direction, Social Finance is leading the field of Pay for Success financing and\nSocial Impact Bonds. She brings an unparalleled perspective to this conversation, so please help\nme welcome her to share some of those insights.\n6",

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nKeynote Address\nNortheast Pennsylvania Equitable Transit Summit\nScranton, PA\nOctober 17, 2017\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThank you. It’s a pleasure to be here today.\nSome speeches start with jokes. Fed speeches start with a disclaimer: The views I express here\ntoday are mine alone and do not necessarily represent those of anyone else in the Federal\nReserve System, including my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nWith that out of the way, I want to say how great it is to have such a diverse group of\nstakeholders here. The Fed brings a lot of research and talent to bear in the community\ndevelopment sphere, but we’re only as successful as our partners make us, so thank you.\nI think all of us have questions we’re asked regularly about our jobs. When I was in academia,\nthat was mostly, “Can I have an extension?” The ones I hear now, other than “When are you\nraising rates?” often fall into the category of “Why does the Fed care about equitable transit?\nWhy do you care about affordable housing? What does community development have to do with\nmonetary policy?”\nAnd I suppose on its face, it may not be evident. But the American economy is not a monolith;\nit’s a collection of regions and businesses and households that are themselves a series of micro-\neconomies making up the whole. We are stronger as a country when every link in that chain is\neconomically sound. Ensuring that all our communities are economically stable and sustainable\nis important to everyone.\nAs for the rest of it — things like housing and transportation — they are the factors that help turn\neconomic aspiration into reality.\n1\n\nWhich is why we’re here today. I’m an engineer by training, by the way, so I can talk about\ntransportation for hours. People already think Fed presidents are boring policy wonks. Imagine\ngetting stuck next to me at dinner parties, expounding on the wonders of bus routes … But I have\nactually managed to get people to listen because transit-related issues can affect so many other\neconomic factors.\nEconomic Growth & Mobility Project\nAs you all probably know, the Philadelphia Fed has launched an Economic Growth & Mobility\nProject that looks for practical applications for research. In fact, this summit on equitable transit\nis part of our first Research in Action project. I’d normally save the “thank yous” until the end of\nmy remarks, but we wouldn’t be here today without our partners. So, for making this possible, a\nquick note of thanks to our partners in forming the Equitable Transit Council, the Scranton Area\nCommunity Foundation, and Laura Ducceschi, its president and CEO. Thank you also to Teri\nOoms, executive director of The Institute for Public Policy and Economic Development at\nWilkes University. And thanks to all the members of the Equitable Transit Council for your\ncommitment to collaboration.\nBack to the Economic Growth & Mobility Project. The EGMP focuses on three key areas: job\ncreation, workforce development, and infrastructure.\nWe often refer to these as the three legs of the mobility stool, but we could also call them strands\nof DNA because they’re inextricably laced and are core parts of mobility’s being.\nWe can have the best workforce development in the world, and we can create jobs at lightning\npace. But if people can’t afford to live near the training, or find a way to get to the jobs, it won’t\ndo much good. We have to look at the whole picture, not just what we need to get the economy\nmoving, but how to make it happen. A central focus is, obviously, jobs, and we’re dealing with a\nfew different issues in the labor market right now.\nFirst, not everyone is looking at the same employment realities. On a national level, there’s very\nlittle slack left in the labor market. Unemployment is at 4.2 percent, and the other data — for\ninstance, job openings and quits — also point to a pretty tight market. But that’s a national\naverage, and there are areas around the country that don’t share that good fortune.\n2\n\nSecond, in a market that’s tight overall, we wind up with a different problem: Employers can’t\nfind workers with the right skills. If they can’t fill those positions, they can’t expand their\nbusinesses, and that affects growth.\nThird, we are dealing with a low labor force participation rate. And as the baby boomers\ncontinue their march into retirement — and continue to live longer, to which I say “Go,\nboomers!” — the United States will have more people needing more services for more time. And\nwhile the millennial generation is technically a bit bigger, they’re not all fully in the workforce\nyet, and even the oldest aren’t quite in their prime earning years. Research by my staff shows that\nthe labor force participation rate, which is currently just above 63 percent, will likely drop a\ncouple more tenths of a percentage point over the next few years. Since growth is fundamentally\ngrowth in productivity plus growth in the labor force, there’s a real incentive for us to get every\nlast person off the sidelines that we possibly can.\nWe need to get workers to jobs. We need to get potential workers to training. We need to reach\nas many of them as possible. And we need to do it in an equitable way. Which brings us back to\nthe subject of transportation.\nEquitable Transportation and Economic Health\nWhile transit is a central issue for everyone’s economic health, the issues with transit aren’t the\nsame for everyone. They vary by geography and size, by resources and need.\nNortheastern Pennsylvania, like the rest of the country, has a transportation system that grew in\nthe latter half of the 20th century. Those systems reflected the way we lived: We moved to the\nsuburbs and worked in the city and therefore, reasonably, designed systems to bring people into\nand out of the city center. Now that jobs are booming in distribution centers and office parks on\nthe outskirts of town, we need to rethink how those systems can get people to jobs.\nOf course, jobs aren’t the only issue. There are other ways transportation impacts people’s lives\nand their path to economic growth and mobility. Prosperity is more than a number on a balance\nsheet. To be fully economically healthy, we need to take into account all aspects of a person or\nfamily or community’s assets that aren’t numerically or monetarily defined. Things like access to\nquality health care and education affect our ability to move up the economic ladder as well. So\n3\n\nit’s important to get people to jobs but also to doctors’ appointments and school and the grocery\nstore.\nIf you live in a city with a large transportation system and lots of options, it’s easy to forget that\nin substantial portions of the country, if you don’t have a car, you’re out of luck. But even in\nlarger metro areas, equitable transit is an issue. There was an article in the New York Times a few\nmonths ago about the effect of skyrocketing real estate prices pushing people farther and farther\nfrom where they work. A woman they profiled in the Bay Area leaves home at 4:00 a.m. to start\nwork at 7:00. Another article this summer, about the New York metro area, was titled, “You\nHave a Bad Commute? Try Four Hours and Three Trains.”\nThe benefit in this region is that we have the ability to be nimble. We don’t have legacy\ninfrastructure to redesign and adapt on the scale a larger area does. I can tell you from\nexperience; I spent a summer in college working in the New York City subway. This was back in\n1980, and I lived down in the tunnels from 6:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. for the entire summer, running\nprototypes of upgraded subway cars. Even back then, we had to work to update an old network.\nSince the existing infrastructure here is not as broad, we have the opportunity to imagine a more\nperfect system without those constraints. We have the ability to build an equitable system that\nworks for everyone. We may have the challenge that most areas face of balancing budgets while\ntrying to meet user needs, but we also have the space to be creative and agile. And while the\nbudgetary issues are not insignificant, there are great examples of public-private partnerships out\nthere as well as investment opportunities for the private sector.\nThere’s also great potential in operating as a region. This is something I think is important,\nparticularly in the context of infrastructure development. We don’t all live and work in the same\nplace; our lives and economic fates cross city and county and state lines all the time. With a\nregion comprising three principal cities — Scranton, Wilkes-Barre, and Hazleton — as well as\nmany boroughs and towns in between, that connection and collaboration is even more critical.\nSo, as we look to use our assets to build a better system, what are users’ needs? We’ve been\nworking with a range of partners to figure out how to best serve the people of northeastern\nPennsylvania, including running focus groups in partnership with Wilkes University. The\nfeedback was important to understanding what and where the needs are.\n4\n\nWe heard that users’ top destinations are health care and shopping and that the inability to get\nout to the industrial parks and distribution centers is hurting job prospects. We also heard that\nschedules are an issue, which makes sense. Not everyone works 9 to 5.\nAs we develop new systems in response to those needs, we have an opportunity to be a model for\nother areas. In such a large and diverse country, we can’t always use the same approaches —\nScranton and San Francisco have very different requirements. But Scranton and Stockton might\nnot. There are areas across the map that can learn from our future successes.\nResearch in Action\nThat’s one reason Research in Action is central to our Economic Growth & Mobility Project. We\nwant to take the data and apply them to problems in our District but also have those areas serve\nas models for others.\nMy team has done a lot of research in conjunction with the Atlanta and Cleveland Feds on what\nthey call “opportunity occupations,” jobs that pay at or above the median wage that don’t require\na traditional four-year college degree. They know what industries those jobs are in and where\nthey are geographically. This is going to be central to the work we’re doing here — not just\ngetting people to jobs but getting people to good jobs.\nThey’re also working to put numbers behind the question of how public transit impacts job\naccess. They’re mapping the footprint of the existing transit networks and looking at how access\nto opportunity occupations using those networks varies across neighborhoods with different\nincome and educational attainment levels.\nAdditionally, since we know that budget constraints are an issue for a lot of areas, our\nresearchers have assembled examples of investment by financial institutions that meet\nCommunity Reinvestment Act requirements, which can help bring funders and partners to the\ntable. One is a Cars for Careers partnership between a bank and a local nonprofit in the D.C.\narea. The bank provides affordable loans to low- and moderate-income clients to buy used cars\nthat have been donated to the program. Another institution in Oregon is donating tax credits to\nthe local public transit system and free dial-a-ride transportation for seniors and people with\ndisabilities.\n5\n\nConclusion\nI said at the beginning of my remarks that the issues at the center of economic growth and\nmobility are intertwined and inextricable from the overall economic health of a region. They also\nhave effects that span farther than each individual.\nTransportation is essential to getting most people to jobs, and a region with low unemployment is\nstronger economically. A wider revenue base can mean more investment in education and\ninfrastructure, and it can mean more investment in the community — which, in turn, can bring in\nmore businesses and encourage more economic growth.\nTransportation can also be central to health care and education. That’s the current and rising\nAmerican workforce, and keeping people healthy and educated will make that workforce\nstronger.\nTransportation is not, obviously, the only aspect of infrastructure that affects economic health,\nbut it is significant and it touches many others. And the work we’re doing in northeastern\nPennsylvania will help us here and serve as a model for others.\nWith that, I’m happy to take any questions.\n6",

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nConference on Technology-Enabled Disruption:\nImplications for Business, Labor Markets, and Monetary Policy\nIntroductory Remarks: Panel on Broader Labor Market Implications\nof Technology-Enabled Disruption\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\nDallas, TX\nMay 24, 2018\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nWhile it’s always a pleasure to be in Dallas, it’s particularly enjoyable to be in such exceptional\ncompany, so thank you. I’ll keep my opening remarks brief so we can move on to the discussion,\nbut I do want to use a few minutes for some rhetorical housekeeping.\nFirst, I’ll set some parameters for how I view today’s topic in a wider context. I’ll discuss what I\nthink are the most important issues arising from changes in the labor market. Finally, I want to\nconsider how we take the next necessary steps and outline what I think it means for all of us —\nwhether academic, policymaker, or both — and what it portends for the wider economy.\nSince I’m going first, I’ll give the standard Fed disclaimer in full so Mary and Sam can feel free\nto shout “disclaimer ditto” in lieu of the full spiel: The views I express today are mine alone and\ndo not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\nThe first thing I’d like to do is address the subject of this conference: technology-enabled\ndisruption. Coming from an engineering background and having a hand in both the physical and\ndismal sciences, AI and machine learning hold particular fascination for me.\nI am more than happy to recite chapter and verse on the revolutions emerging from labs across\nthe globe, from universities across the Philadelphia Fed’s District to Mary’s backyard in Silicon\nValley to any number of international hubs.\n1\n\nBut I also want to be sure that we place it in context, looking not just at today’s advances but at\ntechnology’s impact throughout human history. Because whenever we venture down this\nparticular path of discussion, it becomes apparent that, much like beauty, disruption is often in\nthe eye of the beholder. And at the risk of sounding like an apostate, I think we’re merely at a\nparticularly interesting leg of a very long journey.\nI don’t think the robots are coming for us, and I doubt very much that human workers will\nbecome obsolete.\nLooking at the forest as well as the trees is an essential exercise in any discussion of how we\nadapt to change. Technological advancement has impacted human existence since our ancestors\nfirst hewed tools from stone, then abandoned them for those wrought from iron and then bronze.\nAnd each step from the Industrial Revolution to the Internet age has taken us further along the\npath. This excursion has certainly accelerated in pace, and change now comes at a much faster\nrate than we’ve previously experienced.\nWhat’s vitally important now is how we keep pace. How does our workforce adapt, how do\nindustries keep up, how do we ride the wave instead of letting it crash over us?\nWhen I consider the effects on the automotive industry, for instance, I see a much more dramatic\nimpact from the computerization of the dashboard than from driverless cars.\nThat fundamental change to the family car means today’s mechanics need a set of computer\nskills that would’ve been unthinkable a decade or two ago. And even if the entire fleet of our\nnation’s trucks and taxis are eventually replaced by autonomous vehicles, we’ll still need\nsomeone to fix them.\nAnd while some of that will be done by robotics, each step in this evolution involves human skill\nand interaction.\nThat evolution is important because, as we move from point A to point B, people are a\nfundamental part of the equation. I see technology not as ushering in the demolition of entire\nsectors but as the compelling case for why we need to reassess how we train and educate our\nworkforce.\n2\n\nThere is no question that some of that emphasis will be on computer skills on all points across\nthe employment spectrum. Both fast food workers and home health aides, for instance, are\nincreasingly required to have data-entry capabilities and a fluency in basic systems.\nHowever, I also view the growing influence of technological disruptors as laying bare the\nadvantages of our humanity that cannot be reproduced.\nMuch of what automation has already displaced, and the industries in which its impact will\ncontinue to grow, are repetitive actions and rote knowledge that robots do better and more\nefficiently than we do.\nBut there are things machines can’t do, and those are the things that make us quintessentially\nhuman. The inevitability of continued technological evolution should be accompanied by\npolicies and initiatives that train our current and incoming workforce to both master current\nrequirements and instill the agility to adapt to change.\nIt should also — at the risk of being heretical — recognize the comparative human advantages of\ncreativity and individuality that even the most advanced AI is far from duplicating.\nThis is increasingly important as employers face a dearth of workers with the necessary skills to\nstaff their current ranks, let alone their future ones. While there is some academic debate over the\nextent of the skills gap, research by my staff shows its clear existence.\nAnd with the caveat that “data” is not the plural of anecdote, it’s also the number one issue I hear\nfrom our business contacts both in my District and across the country. I hear the same from\ncolleagues.\nThat gap will likely become starker as the labor market tightens and the labor force shrinks. With\ndemographic influences poised to push labor force participation rates further downward over the\nnext several years, the chasm could widen.\nThat means asking employers, educators, HR professionals, job seekers, and the rest of us to\nthrow out some ingrained habits and assumptions and adopt a new perspective.\nTo effectively move toward that future, and in some cases, catch up to the present, it is\nimperative that we rethink education and training. It’s often the case that when we adapt to meet\nchange, the pendulum swings too far in one direction, abandoning some fundamental strengths.\n3\n\nSo, I want to make clear that I view this as an opportunity to both increase our technological\ndexterity and double down on the areas that foster creativity, like the arts and humanities.\nThe first shift is perhaps the most difficult because it requires a culture change. We have to stop\nviewing education, particularly postsecondary education, as one-size-fits-all.\nNot everyone wants or needs a four-year degree, and it’s not necessary to get one right away. We\nhave to not only increase access and availability to other options, with alternative pathways and\ntraining programs, but to view them as smart, laudable choices, equal in merit to their purely\nacademic counterparts.\nThe Philadelphia Fed has an Economic Growth & Mobility Project (EGMP) that focuses in large\npart on workforce development, and my team’s work on “learn and earn” pathways has shown\ntheir promise. That’s everything from apprenticeships to high school models that prepare\nstudents for work directly after graduation without sacrificing the central curriculum.\nThey offer the opportunity after graduation to enter a profession while either taking college\ncourses, preparing for future education, or just jumping straight onto a career path.\nWhat’s important about these programs, particularly the apprenticeships, is that they’re not\nconfined to the traditional trades.\nWe’re seeing them in everything from IT to medicine, strong areas of job growth and career\nopportunities, especially in my District. My staff has also done some very interesting work with\ncolleagues in the Reserve System on what they call “opportunity occupations” — jobs that pay at\nor above the median wage that don’t require a traditional four-year degree.\nTheir work has identified not just the occupations themselves but their geographical spread,\nwhich could be a resource for creating pipelines. Other researchers are additionally looking at\njob-posting data sets to better determine what skills are most sought after, whether there is any\nregional variation, how long certain jobs go unfilled, and why.\nThe next phase in opportunity occupations research is looking at how skills can transfer between\nsectors and industries, and here we come back to the quintessentially human aspects of work that\nare irreplaceable by machine.\n4\n\nThey’re looking at those core capabilities that can move someone from, say, an associate-level\njob in IT to a manager position in health care.\nThis is something that’s profoundly important, and it also reminds us that sometimes,\nsupplanting human expertise with technology — for instance, by using keyword software —\ncould actually be harming employers’ chances of finding qualified candidates.\nThis speaks to some extent to the need for employers to rethink their requirements and how they\nmeet them. In the aftermath of the recession, they had their pick of a crowded labor pool. In a\ntighter market, where the wish-list candidates are fewer and in more demand, they may need to\nreconsider what is truly important to fill an open position. That could prompt an overall rethink\nof how we recruit and retain our own workforces, which could be a catalyst for change.\nOther research underway in EGMP aims to quantify the return on investment for employer-\nlinked training programs. One of the things they’ve seen over and over again is the\npredisposition to see workforce development as a social program rather than an investment. Even\nthough, in many cases, the simple math of a single investment in a workplace training program is\nvastly more cost effective than the combined expense of an extended recruiting period for an\nopen job that represents a productivity loss while it goes unfilled.\nThis could be a truly important plank in bridging the skills gap.\nI’ll stop there and hand over the reins or, I suppose, the keys to the driverless car, as the case\nmay be.\nTo recap, with apologies to Mark Twain, I think reports of the death of human jobs are greatly\nexaggerated and that technological advancement in fact offers an opportunity to disrupt our own\nmodes of education and training. I’m looking forward to my fellow panelists’ assessments and to\nthe discussion today.\nThank you.\n5",

Harker today are my own and not\nnecessarily those of the\nFederal Reserve System or\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nthe Federal Open Market\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia Committee (FOMC).\n\nEver Evolving, Never Irrelevant: The Philadelphia Fed’s Fintech Conference\nThe Eighth Annual Fintech Conference\nPhiladelphia\nOctober 22, 2024\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood morning, everyone, and welcome to the 8th Annual Fintech Conference hosted by the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.\nNow, I’m not here to distract at all from today’s proceedings. But I still must preface my remarks\nwith the standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily\nreflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the Federal\nReserve System.\nBut disclaimer notwithstanding, I believe I can speak for everyone in thanking our panelists and\nspeakers without whom this conference would not be able to work, and also the organizing\npartners without whom this year’s conference would not be able to happen.\nAnd I must single-out for thanks Julapa Jagtiani, who truly is the visionary behind this entire\nendeavor.\nBack when Julapa proposed a conference focused on the growing fintech space, I gave it the\ngreen light not just because it was a timely subject but also because I thought it offered an\nopportunity for the Philly Fed to showcase the field’s thought leadership. Today we find\nourselves at the eighth edition of what is, in my view, among the most influential global fintech\nconferences.\nJulapa was really on to something. Moreover, she has made this convening what it is today. So,\nJulapa, thank you and congratulations!\nBut of course, I must give my biggest thanks to all of you with us for this conference, whether\nyou are among the 200 here in person or the more than 1,400 watching online. This is a far cry\nfrom the first conference.\nI can speak of this conference’s growth — both in attendance and in prominence — through the\nwords of English poet William Blake who penned the line, “What is now proved was once only\nimagined.”\nAnd looking back at the seven previous conferences, I can also use Blake’s words to sum up\nanother vital aspect of this event: “Without Contraries is no progression.”\nOr, maybe in more modern parlance, when I served as a White House Fellow, my former boss,\nthe late FBI Director William Sessions, would say, “No friction, no traction.”\n\nJulapa and her team have always brought together speakers and panelists who don’t always\ncomplement each other, in which ever way you wish to use the word, “complement.” There have\nbeen very spirited and frank conversations about the core issues surrounding the fintech space\nand its potential broader economic prospects.\nThis conference has become a platform where experience is valued, with panelists and\nspeakers bringing ever-increasing levels of expertise built on years of research and practice to\nthe stage. Moreover, these are ongoing and evolving discussions. That is, in and of itself, a\ngood thing. The fintech space, for all its dynamism and complexity, is always evolving and if we\nlooked at a topic — any topic — at just a single conference and then moved on, we’d be missing\nso much.\nConsider the focus of the very first conference in 2017: “Fintech: The Impact on Consumers,\nBanking, and Regulatory Policy.” The sessions in that first conference included, “Fintech\nLending and Roles of Alternative Information” and “Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.”\nThe keynote address topic was, “Bitcoin, Blockchain, and Cryptocurrencies.”\nThese have all remained core topics covered at this conference year over year. They remain on\nthe docket today because they not only continue to impact our financial and economic\nlandscape but they are also doing so in new and ever-changing ways.\nToday’s conference features an updated and expanded vocabulary, with terms such as\n“tokenization” and “banking-as-a-service.” And I trust that they will remain in bold print on the\nagendas of future conferences for the same reason.\nWithin these conferences we have had some hearty discussions that lean, sometimes slightly\nand sometimes more overtly, into, well, maybe we’ll call them “spirited discussions.” But that is\nalso good.\nWe should be engaging in these kinds of discussions regularly and deeply, presenting new\nevidence and experiences to refine these arguments and improve the technologies themselves.\nAnd no doubt, without these discussions we’d be missing the nuance — and the contraries and\nfrictions — that accompany any advancements. It is perhaps an overused term, but fintech\nremains a “disrupter” to traditional banking and financial models even as they are adopted by or,\nat least, partnered with traditional banks and nonbank financial institutions. But as this\nconference has proven, being called a disrupter doesn’t have to be pejorative.\nTake instant payment systems, for example. According to an October 2023 survey conducted by\nMcKinsey, more than 90 percent of respondents reported having used a digital payment\nplatform in the previous year.1 In 2021, that number was 82 percent, which was 10 points higher\nthan it was five years prior2 — the year before the inaugural Fintech Conference.\n1 Chen, Jeana, Deepa Mahajan, Marie-Claude Nadeau, and Roshan Varadarajan. “Consumer digital\npayments: Already mainstream, increasingly embedded, still evolving,” McKinsey & Company, October 20,\n2023, https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/banking-matters/consumer-\ndigital-payments-already-mainstream-increasingly-embedded-still-evolving.\n2 Goel, Vaibhav, Deepa Mahajan, Marie-Claude Nadeau, Owen Sperling, and Stephanie Yeh. “New trends in\nUS consumer digital payments,” McKinsey & Company, October 26, 2021,\n2\n\nBut it is not necessarily bank-designed-and-operated apps that are handling many of these\ndigital payment transactions. It is many times falling to a banking-as-a-service platform run by a\nnonbank intermediary, who is conducting the actual movement of money from one account to\nanother. As a quick aside, the leaders of several of these instant payment companies are\namong the speakers at this conference. And let’s not forget that when I took to this podium a\nyear ago, I lauded the Federal Reserve’s own foray into the instant payments space through the\nlaunch of FedNow.\nBut let’s assume that if we walked out onto Independence Mall and asked a random passerby if\nthey use a “banking-as-a-service” app, we’d likely get a very quizzical look.\nNow, if we instead mentioned the name of a specific payment service or loan provider that\nexists as an app on their phone instead of a brick-and-mortar building, we’d likely get a more\nknowing response.\nIf I could make a generalized assumption, it would be this: Being able to directly buy groceries\nor even secure a car loan through their phone is something that individual would consider a net\npositive. Fintech has increased the speed and efficiency of the financial system as it pertains to\nthem.\nBy the way, I’d be interested if anyone here wishes to undertake this particular social\nexperiment during one of the break periods.\nSo, what does all this have to do with why we are here? Because this conference has\nestablished itself at the forefront of discussions on topics that may have once been considered\narcane but have since become ubiquitous. And here we’re not just talking about the changes in\ntechnologies but we’re also being forced to contend with the need to change the regulatory\nenvironment, as well.\nFor all of us, the task is to make sure we understand the full discussion. That’s why it is vital that\nwe invite all views into these conversations, so we can assure ourselves of actual progress that\nworks for those of us in this room and also for consumers.\nSo, if I may step into the role of one of Blake’s “contraries” for a moment, I recently read the\n2019 book, The Great Reversal, by economist and NYU Professor Thomas Philippon.\nIn one chapter, he noted something he found peculiar: According to his data, by 2010, the share\nof U.S. Gross Domestic Product claimed by financial intermediaries reached roughly 8 percent.\nIn 1880, it was 2 percent, and while it had ebbed and flowed over the years, it never exceeded 6\npercent until the 1980s and kept growing.3 Certainly, that makes sense as the number of\nfinancial products and services being offered has grown exponentially.\nYet, according to Philippon, the unit cost of financial intermediation — or the cost of providing a\nservice to a consumer — has remained roughly constant at around 2 percent. And that goes all\nhttps://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/banking-matters/new-trends-in-us-\nconsumer-digital-payments.\n3 Philippon, Thomas. The Great Reversal: How America Gave Up on Free Markets. Cambridge, MA: Harvard\nUniversity Press, 2019, pp. 210–213.\n3\n\nthe way back to the start of his data in the 1880s. This, as he states, creates a puzzle — if we\nhave so much more invested in the intermediary systems that enhance the efficiency and speed\nof our financial system, why has the cost at the consumer’s end remained steady? Philippon, in\nsubsequent research, brought in some later data to update this figure, finding that the cost had\ndecreased slightly between 2010 and 2015.4 So, we have grounds for optimism, but overall\ncosts have yet to fall significantly below that stubborn 2 percent.\nAs the amount of choice before consumers has grown, and as financial technologies have\nremoved so many barriers to entry and movement, why hasn’t this cost decreased by more?\nObviously, the financial system in 2024 is not working at the same level of operational efficiency\nas it was in 1924 — it’s working at far greater magnitudes of efficiency.\nSo, perhaps this is the challenge I shall leave with you all here: To use this conference not\nmerely as a way for us, in Blake’s words, to prove that which had previously only been\nimagined, but to prove it in a way that provides both an operational benefit to the financial\nsystem and a tangible benefit to the end-use consumers beyond convenience.\nDare I say, if that gets traction and makes progress, there would likely be a lot less friction and\nmany fewer contraries.\nAnd it is in this sentiment that I am honored to turn the podium back over to Julapa, so she can\nintroduce our first speaker. I thank you for allowing me these few minutes and I wish you all a\nproductive and thought-provoking conference.\n4 Philippon, Thomas. “On fintech and financial inclusion,” BIS Working Papers No 841 (2020).\n4",

    "text": "The Global Interdependence Center’s\nPayment Systems in the Internet Age Conference\nSan Diego, CA\nFebruary 6, 2017\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the FOMC.\n\nThe Global Interdependence Center’s Payment Systems in the Internet Age Conference\nSan Diego, CA\nFebruary 6, 2017\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood afternoon and thank you. I’d like to start by saying that I’m a proud and loyal son of the\nFederal Reserve System’s Third District, which encompasses the eastern portion of\nPennsylvania, southern New Jersey, and Delaware. I’m proud of the people, the places, and our\ncontributions. With that said, thank you for getting me out of that weather and inviting me to San\nDiego.\nWe’re here today to discuss “payment systems in the Internet age,” a subject that could occupy a\nfull month’s conference and that brings up interesting complexities for anyone interested or\ninvested in the subject.\nIt is also something of a complex topic for someone involved in regulation, so I should note from\nthe outset that the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of\nmy colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\nWith that out of the way, I’d like to talk today about how fintech has evolved and the role it\nplays in the overall financial system. That involves going back to first principles, because\nwhenever we’re dealing with emerging areas of regulation, it’s important to address what that\noversight is and isn’t addressing.\nThe Evolution of Fintech\nThose of us who’ve been watching the evolution of what we now call fintech can probably agree\nthat it existed before the headlines it’s garnered over the past five or six years. That, in fact, they\nreflect changes that have been in motion since the ’90s and early 2000s.\nI don’t want to diminish the inventive spirit evinced by the tech sector. But it’s important to\nremember that the application of technology to financial institutions and functions has been\ngoing on for some time. We sometimes forget, with the incredible innovation coming out of\n1\n\nSilicon Valley ― and Silicon Alley, and Silicon Beach, and all the other hubs this country has\nproduced ― that the tech revolution is advancing into middle age, which is only to say that\nwe’ve been watching the disruption of various sectors ― even ones as staid and resistant to\nchange as financial services ― for a while now.\nWe’ve gone from hardware-oriented to software-oriented innovation, and IT has become much\nmore sensitive and responsive. Internet capabilities have advanced by leaps and bounds just in\nthe past decade, changing the game for front-end functions. This makes it possible for startups to\nreach consumers in a way that only banks could do 25 years ago. In many instances, this has\ninverted the relationship between consumers and service providers and banks.\nSo, if you ask anyone who’s old enough to have witnessed the industry evolve since that time ―\na time when many of the people creating today’s software were just being born ― you’ll hear\nthat major change has come but also that, in some ways, everything old is new again. We’re just\nfinding new platforms.\nTake peer-to-peer lending, an area that’s captured particular attention. Lenders and lendees are\nconnected in ways they haven’t been before, and there’s a spirit of inclusion and a feeling of\nactive participation, which is wonderful. But even that movement is essentially adding a\ntechnological edge to something we’ve been doing since humankind embarked on a system of\ngoods and trade in kind. In my day, it happened over beers at the corner bar, when Eddie asked\nJoey to loan him a 20. Peer-to-peer lending has been going on since time immemorial. What\nmakes fintech different is that the scope of its ability to match people with one another is\ninfinitely broader.\nDefining Fintech\nWhich brings me to what, exactly, we mean by fintech. While it doesn’t have a fully accepted\ndefinition, I think we can all agree that fintech is more or less the application of technology to\nthe financial services sector.\nIt may seem odd to define it, but there is honestly some confusion. And with so many firms\ncalling themselves fintech, it’s good to lay down a baseline. So, for the purposes of our\n2\n\ndiscussion today, I’ll be talking about fintech firms as those that apply technological innovation\nto financial functions and systems.\nBanking and Financial Systems: First Principles\nAlso for the purposes of our discussion today, I am going to get even more basic and establish\nwhat those systems are, why they exist, and what underpins them.\nThe evolution of financial systems and intermediation has been studied and commented upon for\ncenturies. It evoked renewed interest after the global crisis as people began to reexamine the\npurpose of markets and the role of the financial system.\nWhile there is a lot to dissect with regard to the various innovations of financial vehicles and the\nways in which institutions are structured, a financial system is fundamental to the human\nexperience as we know it.\nThese systems evolved because humanity is driven to find comforts beyond subsistence-level\nliving. We can’t buy food or shelter in the modern age without a system of payments, finance,\nand credit. And our incorporation of a financial system has existed in some form for most of our\nhistory. Whether it was trading or banking, societies across the globe have operated on the\npremise of: You have something I want or need, and I will give you something in exchange.\nFrom the central agora to apps on our phones, whether it’s a creditor’s note or a series of 1s and\n0s, the essentials of the system have stood the test of time.\nAt its most basic, the financial system exists to keep savings safe; to ensure that people and\nbusinesses can easily price, buy, and sell things; and to make certain that we can all use our\nfinancial resources to their best advantage, whether that means paying for food and housing,\ngetting an education, expanding businesses, or investing our assets.\nThis is critical for all of us because a strong and sound economy can only exist when it’s\nunderpinned by a strong and sound financial system.\nAnd what underpins a strong and sound financial system is trust.\nAdam Smith said, “All money is a matter of belief,” and it naturally follows that all financial\nsystems are a matter of trust. A financial system can only exist if we collectively agree to it. A\n3\n\nsystem of savings, credit, exchange, and investment survives because we have faith in people we\ndon’t know, currency we have no individual control over, payment systems with inner workings\nwe don’t see, and institutions we grant power to ― both to house and to regulate those systems.\nWhy do I mention these? Because they are central to the next steps for fintech.\nFintech: What’s Next\nWhile I noted that fintech is just the latest iteration of changes we’ve been seeing for a few\ndecades now, it is still new from a regulatory standpoint, and it’s likely heading into uncharted\nterritory. It’s unlikely that increased oversight will be welcomed with open arms, but I should\nsay now that it’s actually in the interest of fintech firms.\nIn part because they exist in a business environment that is much more Silicon Valley than Wall\nStreet, fintech firms, by and large, do not see themselves as banks. But many of them are,\nultimately, financial institutions.\nBanks, by definition, are institutions that take deposits and make loans. While many fintech\norganizations see themselves as mere facilitators, if they are providing the essential functions of\na banking institution, that poses questions about regulation. And if they’re subject to oversight,\nit’s better for them to understand what it takes to be compliant from the beginning.\n“Regulation” being the great bogeyman of the industry, I’d like to note that regulation is\nnecessary for a functioning system. The trust that underpins the financial system is either earned\nor guaranteed by people or institutions. One of the ways of conferring that trust is the promise\nthat mechanisms are in place to safeguard the system.\nFintech firms need that trust the same as any other bank or financial institution. This underlying\nexpectation is why it’s best to get in early on regulation. It’s in these firms’ self-interest to\nprovide a layer of trust-building that regulation can offer, particularly those that are getting to a\nscale where negative events could have major consequences.\nThis is especially true because most fintech firms today haven’t yet seen the down side of a\ncredit cycle, and trust then will be shaken.\n4\n\nAny student of economic history has to acknowledge that, like death and taxes, a down side to\nthe cycle is inevitable. The aftermath of the cycle’s end will determine a lot of the character and\ncontour of what sort of company can survive in this space. That alone should be cause for fintech\nto want some form of oversight.\nWhat fintech outfits don’t want is regulation that comes in after a crisis. That type of regulation\nalmost always fights the last war, and that could mean tighter strictures and less room for\ninnovation after the crash at the end of a credit cycle. Policymakers have too much experience\nwith the old adage that history may not always repeat itself, but it often rhymes.\nSo, I think there are two things to focus on when talking about regulation: First, that it’s\nstructured to protect both institutions and the public. Second, that we consider what regulation\nalready looks like and where we think it’s headed.\nRegulation\nI have to stress that as a Federal Reserve Bank president, I have no hand in drafting regulations.\nSo, forgive me if I veer into armchair quarterbacking.\nWhat I am able to do is talk more broadly about what’s been proposed, the examples we have to\nlook at in other countries and regions, and what I think is likely to occur.\nThe European Union has given us some comparison for the proposed measures from the Office\nof the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), which remains the most comprehensive attempt at\nmapping out a strategy in the U.S. to date. In particular, a lot of commentary in the payments\nindustry has drawn parallels between the European Commission’s Payment Services Directives\nand the OCC’s proposal to grant national bank charters to fintech companies.\nFintech firms vary widely in their business models: While some provide payments-related\nservices, others offer loans to consumers and businesses, provide digital currencies, or offer\nfinancial planning or wealth management services.\nFor fintech firms whose business falls more on the payments end, there is some comparison to\nthe European model. The Commission’s Directives ask that these types of firms be licensed and\nsatisfy other general requirements. The closest analogy we have in the U.S. is state regulation\n5\n\nand supervision of money-service businesses. Some fintech firms that fall under this umbrella are\nunhappy with the idea of having to obtain many, if not dozens, of licenses to operate around the\ncountry. The proposed OCC charter may offer them some relief.\nOn the other side, to the extent that the fintech firm is weighted toward making loans ―\nespecially to consumers ― the Payment Services Directives don’t quite correlate. For that, the\nbetter comparison is the Commission’s Task Force on Financial Technology, which makes\npolicy recommendations on fintech in financial services. It formally incorporates viewpoints\nfrom multiple regulatory bodies, not just banking regulators, which sets the European model\napart from the OCC’s suggested framework.\nThere is an open question about whether or who should supervise fintech lenders in the United\nStates, made all the more complicated by the interplay between our state and federal regulatory\nframeworks. Most personal finance companies, for example, are licensed and regulated at the\nstate level. Uncertainty about the boundaries between these two competing spheres of authority\ncan be seen in some states’ reactions to the OCC’s proposal.\nBut, particularly if we’re talking about loans to consumers, it’s only a matter of time until federal\nconsumer protections will come into play.\nAll of which is to say, it’s complicated. But it continues to be, in my opinion, in the interest of\nfintech companies to be regulated.\nThis may sound like the particular nannying of a sometime regulator asking for more oversight.\nI’m not speculating at all that the Fed will be involved in fintech regulation. But I can say that\nnone of us are trying to stifle innovation. If anything, you’ll hear us praise the ingenuity and\nimagination that comes from the technology sector. But there are risks, and we should be talking\nabout them. Regulation can’t solve everything, and it can’t anticipate or guard against every\nproblem. But it can try.\nFor me, regulation is not just a question of protecting consumers; it’s a question of protecting the\ninnovators as well. It’s in their best interest to have an established framework in which to\noperate. In part because the trust it engenders will underpin their essential role in the financial\nsystem.\n6\n\nConclusion\nAgain, this all comes back to trust and its critical role in the financial and economic systems.\nWhether it’s Eddie borrowing a 20 off of Joey at the corner bar, or the loan officer at our local\ncommunity bank, we trust people to act in accordance with an agreed-upon code, both the legal\none enshrined in legislation and the moral one we’ve entered into as a society. Whether it’s a\nstructurally important financial institution or an app on our phone, we trust institutions to hold up\ntheir end of the bargain we struck when we deposited or borrowed funds. And whether it’s\nadministered by multiple agencies or a single body, at the state or federal level, we trust that\nthere is a safeguard in place to guide and protect the companies we’re entrusting with our\neconomic livelihoods.\n7",

    "text": "An Economic Outlook\nNew Jersey Bankers Association\nSomerset, NJ\nJanuary 20, 2017\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the FOMC.\n\nNew Jersey Bankers Association\nJanuary 20, 2017\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nIntroduction\nGood morning. It’s a pleasure to be in New Jersey.\nToday, I’d like to give an overview of the economy, talk about the implications for monetary\npolicy, and explore some of the issues affecting the region, particularly workforce development.\nBefore I start, however, I should add the usual disclaimer that the views expressed today are\nmine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\nGrowth\nWith that out of the way, the headline is that things are looking pretty good. Or, as I should say\nas a policy wonk, “The economy is displaying considerable strength.” GDP continued to grow in\nthe third quarter at an even faster pace than in Q2. Third-quarter growth was recently revised up\nto 3.5 percent. That was driven largely by consumption.\nConsumer confidence is strong, retail sales are still solid — though slightly slower than\npreviously anticipated — and equity markets are up.\nThe new orders index, though positive, fell slightly in December, though the regional business\nactivity index increased sharply.\nAll in all, the snapshot is of a robust American economy.\nInflation\nAs you know, the Fed has a dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability. In its\nsimplest terms, that means that most people can find a job if they’re looking and inflation stays\nlow and stable.\nStarting with inflation, we aim for an average of 2 percent. A little higher or a little lower from\ntime to time is not something to worry about. We don’t need to be exactly at 2 percent all the\ntime. We’re looking for an average over the medium term.\nPage 2 of 7\n\nPeople sometimes assume that the Fed worries more about inflation being too high than too low.\nBut we give equal weight to distance from our goal, regardless of the direction. Over the past\nfew years, inflation has been below target. That’s the main reason interest rates have been so low\nfor so long. We’re starting to see some upward movement in the Fed’s preferred measure of\ninflation, the core PCE: It has increased to 1.7 percent, near our target.\nI know the joke is that Fed policymakers must not eat or drive because we prefer the core\nmeasure. But we’re looking for underlying trends, and stripping out those volatile components\ngives us a better read. That said, the yearly growth in the headline PCE index has also increased,\nrising to 1.0 percent in the third quarter of 2016, from 0.3 percent a year earlier.\nAdditionally, inflation expectations are starting to rally around the 2 percent goal. One important\nfacet of economics is that expectations can play a role in outcomes, particularly in inflation. It’s\nsomething of a monetary self-fulfilling prophecy. If markets believe inflation will remain low,\nit’s more likely to do so. And over the past few years, not everyone was on the same page with\ntheir predictions. But as expectations consolidate around our target rate, it makes it more likely\nthat our target will become reality.\nLooking at all the information and the trends over the past few years, I see inflation on course to\nmeet our target sometime this year or next.\nLabor Market\nOn the employment side of things, we’re doing very well. We had another month of solid gains\nin December, with the economy adding 156,000 jobs. That’s an average of 165,000 over the last\nquarter of 2016.\nThe unemployment rate remains low at 4.7 percent, which is at, or below what most economists\nbelieve is its natural rate of about 5 percent. The natural rate is the rate that we expect in a\nhealthy economy.\nOf course, we don’t just look at the headline unemployment rate. And it should be noted that\njoblessness hits some portions of the population harder than others. For instance, the\nunemployment rate for African-American men was 8.6 percent in December, almost four\npercentage points higher than the average for the entire adult population.\nThere’s also a lot of talk about hidden pockets of unemployment, with particular concern that\npeople may have dropped out of the labor market entirely, out of frustration. But even U6\nunemployment has declined to 9.2 percent. While that’s still higher than headline\nunemployment, it’s worth noting that U6 peaked at about 17 percent during the worst of the\nrecession and its aftermath.\nPage 3 of 7\n\nDemand for labor also remains strong and more people are quitting their jobs. That’s good news\nfor the economy — it shows workers are more confident they can find another one — though I\nsuppose some overworked HR managers might not be 100 percent thrilled about it.\nLayoffs also remain at all-time lows and job postings are near historical peaks. We continue to\nhear from our business contacts that finding workers, especially in certain occupations, is getting\nprogressively more difficult.\nTaking all these factors into account, it’s safe to call the U.S. labor market more or less at full\nhealth.\nOf course, that’s the economy as a whole. Things aren’t evenly distributed across this huge and\ndiverse country. In New Jersey, unemployment is still slightly above the national average, at 5.0\npercent. Job growth is lagging the country as a whole on an annualized basis, with New Jersey\nseeing 0.3 percent compared with the nation’s 1.7 percent. Labor force participation — which\nI’ll discuss in more detail in a moment — dropped steadily from April of 2016 to its current\nreading of 63.6 percent. That’s the lowest reading since 1983.\nOverall, New Jersey faces different issues than other states. The concentration of workers in\nuncompetitive industries has had a hand in slow job growth, and the large foreclosure inventory\nis restraining the housing market. The share of active loans in foreclosure is roughly three times\nlarger than the country as a whole. We’ve made significant progress since 2013, but the share is\nstill above prerecession readings, and we are faced with the simple math that when you’re hit\nharder, you have more ground to make up, and it takes longer to recover. House prices in New\nJersey are growing below 3 percent, while the national average is 6. Add in the state budgetary\npressures and the recent downgrade of the state credit rating, and the concerns of the people in\nthis room look entirely different than those of other states’ bankers associations.\nThings are getting better, particularly in the past few months, but I point out the disparities\nbetween regions for two reasons.\nOne is that I get to praise the structure of the Federal Reserve System. I think it’s uniquely\nAmerican to have a decentralized central bank — to have a structure that makes policy for a\nhuge and incredibly varied economy, but takes into account the differences between regions. We\nknow that the economic fortunes of Camden don’t look like those of Seattle. And when the\nFOMC comes together, the presidents of the 12 banks get to be a voice for their communities and\nbusinesses.\nI also mention it because I’m interested to hear your take on the employment situation in the area\nand the state. How are you faring? Something I’ve heard over and over again from businesses of\nall sizes is that they have the jobs; they just can’t find the people. There seems to be a skills void\nthat can’t be filled by the existing workforce.\nPage 4 of 7\n\nMy staff recently conducted a study on what they call “opportunity occupations.” These are jobs\nthat pay at or above the national median income but that don’t require a traditional four-year\ndegree. They make up close to 30 percent of the job market nationally. If we reconsider the way\nwe are training people and further promote the occupations that require special skills, but not a\ntraditional bachelor’s degree, we can start to maximize the potential of our workforce. Let’s stop\ntrying to make postsecondary education “one-size-fits-all” when our job needs and workforce are\nso varied.\nThis is something that I think and talk a lot about. I’m a son of the District and an unapologetic\ncheerleader for it. I’m invested, not just as the president of the Philadelphia Fed, but as someone\nwho sees the great potential of this region. I want to see us become a destination for business,\nand that means making the best use of our greatest resource: our people.\nI should be clear that I don’t have the power to change any policy or enact any law that can bring\nthat kind of investment. But I can make the economic case to the people who do. We need to\nattract talent, train the people we have, and make the tristate area a top destination, in part by\noffering a world-class workforce.\nIt’s Peter Drucker 101: Play to your strengths. I always tell people that the best business advice I\nhave is to make yourself invaluable. I’d offer the same advice to any city or region looking to\nbecome a business destination.\nLabor Force Participation Rate\nI will also note that despite positive overall trends in the labor market, the participation rate is\nlower than I’d like.\nThe labor force participation rate is a fairly basic calculation. It divides the workforce — those\nemployed and those looking for work — by the population over the age of 16. That does not\ninclude people who’ve taken themselves out of the labor force.\nThe participation rate has been declining over the years and it plummeted in the aftermath of the\ncrisis and recession, which is what we would expect. Recessions cause dips in the participation\nrate and it tends to rebound as the economy does.\nBut over the past six years, it hasn’t risen back up as much as we might have thought. We can\npoint to a number of reasons to explain this, but later on I will talk about one trend that’s\nsomething of a mystery.\nA portion of the drop is that we simply can’t meet historical surges. In the 60s and 70s, as\nwomen entered the workforce in greater numbers, the rate swelled. But we no longer have a\nlarge, untapped portion of the population that can offer the same boost. So, we have to readjust\nexpectations somewhat.\nPage 5 of 7\n\nAnother contributing factor is lifestyle fit: Fewer high school and college students are working\nwhile they’re in school, and some people have decided that they’re content to have single-\nincome households.\nThen there is the big one: demographics. The initial wave of the large baby boom generation has\nstarted to retire. As the boomers exit the workforce, they’re not being replaced in the same\nnumbers. Not to mention, we’re living longer, so the share of people on the retirement end is\neven larger. This is the overwhelming factor affecting participation, and I’ll return to it shortly.\nAnd then there is the mystery of the missing prime-aged males. This very unfairly named group\nconsists of men aged 25 to 54. For reasons that we’re not quite sure of, their participation has\nbeen dropping. In 1954, it was 98 percent, compared with 88 percent today.1 This makes for one\nof the lowest participation rates for prime-age males among developed countries and one of the\nmost rapid declines.\nAgain, the impact has not been felt evenly. Among prime-age African American men, the\nparticipation rate has fallen from 91 percent in 1972 — the oldest data available — to 80.3\npercent today.\nThere are some troubling features of this decline among all men. The first is that dropping out\nseems to be a persistent state. The majority of men who report not working in any given month\nhadn’t worked in the previous year either. The second is that this demographic, when employed,\nadds to overall productivity, so the economy feels the loss when they are out of the workplace.\nI do want to reiterate that the group we’re talking about are men who are out of the labor force.\nFor prime-age males in the workforce, the unemployment rate is low and the U.S. fares a lot\nbetter than our counterparts.\nAs I said, we don’t really know why this is happening to any degree of certainty. It could be that\nmen participate in the workforce more intensively in their thirties and forties, so it’s reasonable\nto assume the ageing population is playing a role. But when we analyze the data, it turns out that\nnonparticipation goes up as the age goes down. That is, the younger the age group, the more\nlikely they are to be out of the workforce. The data also show that participation rates follow\neducational attainment.\nThe consequences for this group’s lack of participation are severe, both for them and the\neconomy. Around one-third of nonparticipants live below the federal poverty line. Most get by\non government assistance or financial support from spouses or other family members.\n1 Council of Economic Advisors. “The Long-Term Decline in Prime-Age Male Labor Force Participation,” June\n2014, available at\nwww.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/page/files/20160620_cea_primeage_male_lfp.pdf (last accessed January 9,\n2017).\nPage 6 of 7\n\nFor the rest of us a lower participation rate all around means lower productivity, which means\nlower growth.\nIt’s essential to have a robust workforce. Research by my staff indicates that, due to\ndemographics and the retiring baby boomers, the low participation trend is unlikely to reverse. In\nfact, they project labor force participation could drop up to 2 percentage points further over the\nnext five years.2 That’s from where we stand now at 62.7 percent.\nMonetary Policy\nSo, what does this all mean for monetary policy? After December’s meeting, that makes a brisk\naverage of one 25-basis-point hike per year for the last two years.\nBut I see three modest hikes as appropriate for the coming year, assuming the economy stays on\ntrack. Fed policymakers enjoy saying we’re data-dependent and this is an area where that rings\nespecially true.\nI’ve said it before, and it’s worth repeating, that monetary policy is a fairly limited set of tools\nwith a fairly limited reach. We will respond to changes in the economy with moves in the federal\nfunds rate, and we can do a very good job of creating the conditions that are consistent with\neconomic growth. But the kinds of policies that will deliver that growth — employment\nprograms, development, taxation, and trade policies — are up to elected officials at the local,\nstate, and national levels.\nConclusion\nAll in all, things are looking good. The labor market is strong and we’re creating jobs at a good\npace. The drop in labor force participation must be addressed, but that will take legislative\naction. Inflation is moving back up to our 2 percent goal and growth is solid. We’re starting 2017\noff on a good foot.\n2 Shigeru Fujita. “On the Causes of Declines in the Labor Force Participation Rate,” Research Rap Special Report,\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, February 2014, available at www.philadelphiafed.org/-/media/research-and-\ndata/publications/research-rap/2014/on-the-causes-of-declines-in-the-labor-force-participation-rate.pdf?la=en.\nPage 7 of 7",

Your award is very well deserved.\nI’d like to take a few minutes this morning to discuss the national economy, inflation, monetary policy,\nand an exciting new research initiative from the Philadelphia Fed. And then, we can get to your\nquestions. But please, nothing about baseball: The wounds are still too fresh.\nBefore I can go any further, I need to give you the standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are\nmy own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\nThe Economy\nLet’s begin with the national economy, where there are signs that activity is decelerating. Credit card\npurchase data indicate that consumer spending, which comprises around 70 percent of economic\nactivity in the United States, is slowing, with services and retail leading the decline. Investment in\nhousing has weakened, and even the boom in manufacturing, which has buoyed the economy, is\nstarting to wane.\nAfter two negative quarters of GDP growth to start the year, the third quarter saw growth of 2.6\npercent. That growth was largely due to strong exports. In sum, the reopening boom we experienced as\nbusinesses came back to life after a pandemic-induced hibernation appears to be pretty much over.\nThere is one glaring exception to this rather lackluster data set: employment. The job market continues\nto run extremely hot. The national unemployment rate is 3.7 percent, and we still have more than 10\nmillion unfilled jobs. All of which is to say, one economic category has certainly not suffered even as\nother sectors have slowed: Help Wanted signs.\n1\n\nInflation\nNow to inflation, which remains far, far too high.\nThe Federal Reserve’s long-range target is 2 percent annualized inflation, and right now, annualized PCE\ninflation, including food and energy, stands at 6.2 percent. Prices were up 0.3 percent in September\nfrom just a month before. Moreover, inflation is widespread throughout the economy, with numerous\ncategories continuing to register hefty increases.\nThis is a period of tremendous hardship for Americans, particularly those of low or moderate income. I\nfind it particularly alarming that we’re seeing rapid price increases in life’s true essentials, like food, rent,\nhealth care, and gasoline.\nThe bottom line is that we can’t have a well-functioning economy with high inflation, particularly if high\ninflation expectations get embedded. To make the economy as efficient as we can in the long run, we\nhave to get on top of inflation.\nWe are committed to bringing down inflation.\nTo do so effectively, we need to understand what has caused it. A global pandemic, a war in Europe, and\nfiscal and monetary policy decisions have combined to limit supply and boost demand. The result has\nbeen inflation running at 40-year highs.\nLet’s begin with constraints on supply.\nCOVID-19 pandemic lockdowns have badly damaged supply chains. We all know about semiconductor\nshortages, which have limited supplies of everything from new cars to washing machines. These\nshortages persist, owing largely to China’s Zero-COVID policy. But the pandemic has wrought shortages\nin more obscure items. A major auto company, for instance, is having a hard time securing enough of its\ntrademark emblems, which has in turn slowed shipments of new vehicles.\nRussia’s horrific invasion of Ukraine further choked supply.\nAfter Vladimir Putin’s forces invaded Ukraine, shipments of grain and fertilizer fell, pushing up food\nprices. The decline in Russia’s energy exports has helped fuel the rise in energy prices, causing an energy\ncrisis in Europe and the U.K. Gasoline prices spiked here, fell a bit, and are now back up again. OPEC Plus\nhas further compounded our problems by announcing it will cut production, even in the face of elevated\nprices. We know that gas prices are incredibly important to consumers and responsible for much of the\ndecline in consumer sentiment.\n2\n\nCertain U.S. government policies have contributed to our supply-side issues. While I remain neutral on\nthe overall wisdom of each of these policies, their effect on supply is undeniable. The federal\ngovernment applies tariffs on everything from Chinese-made televisions to Canadian lumber. Our\nimmigration policy, such as it is, has resulted in a more than two-year pause in legal immigration. As a\nresult, we have about 2½ million fewer workers than we would have had, if we had remained on trend.\nAll of these supply constraints have been accompanied by robust demand. For one, as I indicated earlier,\nour labor market remains hot. That means Americans are earning paychecks, even if their relative value\nis declining because of inflation.\nNot surprisingly, low unemployment rates have produced significant upward pressure on wages. In\nmany regions, smaller employers with thin margins are having a hard time filling entry-level positions.\nWe’ve heard from community bankers who can’t compete with larger banks for jobs like tellers.\nFiscal policy has added to demand. The federal government pumped around $6 trillion into American\nhouseholds during the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic through programs like mortgage\nforbearance and student loan forbearance. In fact, the amount of fiscal support provided by the federal\ngovernment was significantly larger than the aggregate decline in GDP triggered by the pandemic in the\nfirst place.\nThat aid was also dispersed in a largely untargeted fashion. That’s understandable, of course: We were\nin the middle of a full-blown panic, and the federal government needed to get money out the door. But\nit’s clear that policies like these contributed to high levels of demand.\nMonetary Policy\nAnd finally, expansive monetary policy — that’s us — kept the cost of capital low, which stoked demand.\nThroughout most of the COVID-19 pandemic, we kept rates near zero and enacted a major asset-buying\nprogram.\nAs a central bank, the Federal Reserve can do little to affect the supply constraints pushing up inflation.\nAnd as I have indicated, those problems, unfortunately, will take time to resolve.\nBut the Federal Reserve can absolutely affect demand, and that is what we are doing. We want to see\ninflation coming down steadily and consistently, and we also want to see it abating across a wide array\nof goods and services. The goal is to adjust conditions so that demand better matches supply.\n3\n\nWe have two primary tools for implementing monetary policy: the federal funds rate and our balance\nsheet.\nSince last fall, we have been tightening financial conditions. That process, at least as the market\ninterpreted it, started last September, even before we began to move the federal funds rate or taper\nour asset purchases. Instead, simply announcing that we would soon begin to taper our asset purchases\ncaused two-year Treasury yields to rise.\nThe taper began in earnest last November and is now complete. In fact, we are now reducing our\nbalance sheet. We are shedding $60 billion in Treasuries and $35 billion of agency debt and mortgage-\nbacked securities each month. Which is to say, we are removing a significant amount of financial\naccommodation quite rapidly.\nWe have also raised the federal funds rate 375 basis points since the start of the year. Granted, we\nstarted from zero, but we have raised rates significantly — and very quickly.\nIn the upcoming months, in light of the cumulative tightening we have achieved, I expect we will slow\nthe pace of our rate hikes as we approach a sufficiently restrictive stance. But I want to be clear: A rate\nhike of 50 basis points would still be significant. Since 1983, the FOMC has increased the target a total of\n88 times, and of those, 75 of the hikes were less than 50 basis points.\nAt some point next year, I expect we will hold at a restrictive rate for a while to let monetary policy do\nits work. It will take a while for the higher cost of capital to work its way through the economy.\nAfter that, if we have to, we can always tighten further, based on the data. But we should let the system\nwork itself out. And we also need to recognize that this will take time.\nAbove all, I want to stress that we must remain data dependent and flexible on policy. What we really\nneed to see is a sustained decline in a number of inflation indicators before we let up on tightening\nmonetary policy. And again, we need to make sure inflation expectations don’t become unanchored.\nSo what does all of this mean for the economy? I expect that economic growth will moderate this year\nas both inflation and tightening financial conditions begin to crimp consumption. Overall, I forecast flat\nGDP growth for 2022, 1.5 percent growth in 2023, and around 2 percent growth in 2024.\nInflation will come down, but it will take some time to get to our target. I expect core PCE inflation to\ncome in around 4.8 percent in 2022, around 3.5 percent next year, and 2.5 percent in 2024.\n4\n\nTurning to the job market, the unemployment rate should peak at 4.5 percent next year as financial\nconditions bite. It should then fall to 4 percent in 2024, which suggests that, even as we tighten\nmonetary policy, labor markets will stay quite healthy. We’ve heard from contacts in manufacturing\nthat, given how hard they have worked to staff up, they will be extremely reluctant to cut jobs even as\nthe economy slows.\nThat gives me confidence that we can bring inflation under control without doing unnecessary damage\nto the labor market. Our resolve is strong, and our goal of stable prices and maximum employment is\nachievable.\nThe Anchor Economy Initiative\nNow, in the remaining few minutes, I’d like to describe an exciting new initiative from the Philadelphia\nFed called the Anchor Economy Initiative. It’s fitting that we are convening in University City today\nbecause this place exemplifies the Anchor Economy Initiative perfectly.\nThe Anchor Economy Initiative seeks to quantify the economic impact of higher education institutions\nand hospitals — eds and meds — that we call the anchor institutions in their communities.\nThis is vital work. Anchor institutions are often the largest employers in regions, they’re the producers of\ntalent that other businesses need, and they lay the foundation for durable economic growth.\nThey also have characteristics that other institutions just don’t. For one, even though they’ve made\nsizable leaps in their use of technology in recent years — especially during the COVID-19 pandemic —\nhigher education institutions and hospitals are physically embedded in their communities. In fact, that’s\none of the reasons we call them anchor institutions. Unlike corporate headquarters, manufacturing\nfacilities, or sports teams that can pick up and move, higher education institutions and hospitals tend to\nstay where they are. Hospitals and higher education also tend to be labor intensive, meaning they are\noften among the largest employers in their regions.\nEds and meds also serve as bulwarks against the vicissitudes of the business cycle. Enrollment in colleges\nand universities, for instance, is countercyclical, meaning that when the economy slows, usually more\npeople go to school, boosting anchor institutions. Hospitals are also recession resistant; after all, people\nrequire medical care no matter how the local economy is faring. All of which suggests that regions with\nstrong anchor institutions may have more durable economies than those without.\n5\n\nAnd in recent years, we’ve also seen anchor institutions take an increasing interest in building up the\nareas they serve. They are typically critical partners in community development initiatives. We’ve seen\nmore hospitals and universities invest in neighborhood economic development, boosting local\ncommercial corridors, seeding residential real estate development, and building neighborhood\namenities. Now I suspect you understand the connection to University City.\nAnchor institutions’ impact goes beyond the immediate. This is a key point that I really want to stress.\nFundamentally, anchor institutions stimulate growth through innovation, commercialization, new\nventure formation, and talent attraction. In that sense, they can drive long-term economic development\nand growth.\nWe see this here in Philadelphia all the time. The talent and research coming out of our universities and\nhealth-care systems have led to the creation of a booming biotechnology industry. Which is to say,\nanchor institutions are not only often the largest employers themselves in regions, they’re also the\nproducers of talent that other businesses need.\nLet’s not sugarcoat things, though. Eds and meds are both being radically disrupted by technology,\ndemographic shifts, and increasing costs. As I alluded to earlier, the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated\nboth telehealth and remote learning. This has certainly created opportunities for health systems and\nuniversities to expand their markets, but it also loosened the place-based nature of their services. All of\na sudden, these anchors are, frankly, a little less anchored.\nDemographics are another downside risk, though with disparate impacts for universities and hospitals.\nWith falling birth rates, fewer 18-year-olds are heading to college and even fewer will enroll in the\nfuture, especially if immigration rates remain depressed, as they are now. This demographic shift is most\napparent in the Northeast and Midwest, which also happen to have higher concentrations of colleges\nand universities. That raises real questions about the viability of many of these institutions in the future\n— and the impact that will have on communities.\nOn the other hand, an aging population is one that will require more health care, boosting hospitals.\nEven here, however, the picture is mixed, as many hospitals have closed over the past several years.\nMeanwhile, the ever-rising cost of education and health care means that more people may be priced\nout of accessing eds and meds altogether, which is both a humanitarian concern and an economic one.\n6\n\nThat’s why, at the Philadelphia Fed, we’ve developed what we call the Anchor Economy Dashboard, a\nnew tool that quantifies the impact of higher education institutions and hospitals on more than 500\nregions across the country.\nFor each of these regions, the dashboard calculates the total number of jobs — direct, indirect, or\ninduced — supported by local eds and meds institutions. Direct jobs comprise those employed directly\nby anchor institutions, like doctors, nurses, and college professors. Indirect are those working in fields\nthat directly support anchor institutions, like IT contractors supporting a hospital. And induced jobs are\nthose that are supported by the economic activity that anchor economies generate. The folks working at\nthe Last Word Bookshop have induced jobs.\nOne thing that makes the Anchor Economy Dashboard so neat is that it also calculates a reliance\nindex for each region. The reliance index provides a summary measure of how dependent a regional\neconomy is on anchor institutions. It adjusts economic impact by the size of the regional economy and\nincorporates measures of impact in terms of employment, income, and gross value added. A reliance\nindex of 1 means a region’s reliance on anchor institutions is at the national average — below that\nmeans it’s less reliant, and above that means it’s more reliant.\nOn a national scale, the dashboard clearly shows what I’ve been talking about: The economic impact of\nanchor institutions is massive: 9 percent of total U.S. employment, 6.3 percent of total U.S. income, and\n8.1 percent of total U.S. gross value added comes from higher education institutions and hospitals. That\ntranslates to 18.2 million jobs, $1.1 trillion in income, and $1.7 trillion in gross value added to the\neconomy.\nHere in the Philadelphia region, the total economic impact from anchor institutions is more than\n495,000 jobs, $33.8 billion in income, and $51.4 billion in gross value added. That’s nearly 13 percent of\nthe region’s jobs, 8.4 percent of its income, and 11.4 percent of its gross value added. All told, that\namounts to a reliance index of 1.39, indicating that our region is more dependent on anchor institutions\nthan the U.S. average.\nConclusion\nI urge you all — after today’s program — to head over to philadelphiafed.org to delve into the\ndashboard. We have data for 524 regions across the U.S. — truly a treasure trove. I think you’ll find the\ninformation there useful and important.\n7\n\nIn closing, I’d like to reiterate my thanks to you for joining us, and the Federal Reserve’s strong\ncommitment to bringing down inflation. We will get this job done.\nNow, let’s get to your questions.\n8",

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nHigher Education in an Evolving Economy\nEndowment and Debt Management Forum\nNational Association of College and University Business Officers\nNew York, NY\nFebruary 8, 2018\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood morning and thank you. It’s a pleasure to be here.\nIn considering my remarks today, I found the narrative going in something of a spiral, because\nthe topic of higher education is inextricably linked to so many others. Going down one route of\ninquiry leads inevitably to a dozen others, which branch off into a dozen more. Compounding\nthat issue is that, while I view the subject from the perspective of a policymaker concerned with\neducation’s immense influence on the country’s long-term economic strength, I also have the\nexperience of an academic, a business school dean, and a university president. I’ve seen how the\nadministrative sausage is made; so whatever your role in the process, I can commiserate.\nOne of the wonderful things about academia is that you can be provocative in your opinions on\npolicy orthodoxy — and I’ve certainly been accused of that once or twice. As a Federal Reserve\npresident, however, I tend to be more circumspect in my public declarations and am bound —\njust to be on the safe side — to deliver the standard disclaimer that absolves my colleagues from\nassociation with anything I might say to offend: The views I share today are mine alone and do\nnot necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\nWith that out of the way, I’d like to talk today about the essential role that higher education plays\nin the economy, address some of the issues facing the sector on both a macro and micro level,\nand, at the end, perhaps question some operational orthodoxies. Just as a throwback to my\nacademic days.\n1\n\nEducation’s Fundamental Economic Role\nThe issue of education’s importance is easy to address and almost impossible to overstate. It is\none of the constants of human history that throughout cultures and epochs, the foundation of\nevery society has rested on the education of its people. From a policy perspective, education is\nthe heart that pumps the blood into every other organ in the economy. It trains our workforce, it\nemboldens our innovation, it sharpens our competitive edge.\nThe institutions that perform this vital function of the American economy, and you, the people\nwho help execute that mission, have a monumental amount of responsibility on your shoulders.\nAnd I am fully aware that you are doing it in the face of change and challenges, most of which\nyou have no control over. But no pressure.\nSo I’d like to talk a little about the conditions in which you’re operating, and some of the factors\naffecting your current and future work, that also impact the nation as a whole.\nA Changing Landscape\nWhile there is a lot of discussion about headline issues right now, I find that the underlying,\nsecular trends that get less attention are significantly more impactful. We live in a world that is\nrapidly changing on both a demographic and technological level, and the old models aren’t\nnecessarily keeping up with the demand for change.\nI am a great proponent of education for education’s sake, but I’m also a pragmatist in that much\nof the goal of postsecondary education is to prepare students for work. And we have a very\ndifferent labor landscape today than when I was in college.\nLabor force participation in the United States is significantly lower than a decade ago. This is\nlargely due to demographic factors and, according to research by my staff, is likely to continue to\ndecline. I know that millennials are tired of hearing that everything is their fault, so the younger\nof you in the audience will be delighted to hear that this one you can blame on the boomers. The\nboomers represent the largest generation in our history to head into retirement, and they’re living\nlonger as well. And while I’m delighted at the prospect of the extended cut of my own golden\nyears, this will put a strain on the economy.\n2\n\nFor one, it means more people living on fixed retirement incomes, more people depending on\nMedicare and Social Security, and more people whose medical and general care expenses will be\nhigher than they are now. Much of that burden will fall on the generations behind them.\nIt also means experiencing the downside of a simple economic equation: Growth is,\nfundamentally, growth in the labor force plus growth in productivity. Without an increase in one\nof those variables, GDP is likely to suffer, and in recent years, productivity growth has proven to\nbe stubbornly low as well. Simply put, we need more people.\nAnd while the millennial generation is actually larger than the boomers, millennials are both not\nyet in their prime earning years and not enough to increase the labor-force growth sufficiently.\nAs for your demographic outlook, the birth drop-off in the mid-’90s means you’re likely facing\nfewer occupants of classroom seats in the foreseeable future.\nI want to reiterate the caveat about the views I express being my own, and I want to make clear\nthat I’m a monetary policymaker — I don’t add my two cents to fiscal, foreign, domestic, or any\nother policy. But people coming off the sidelines, as well as into the country, add much needed\nnumbers to our workforce. They’re a component of your financial success as well. Students\ncoming from abroad are an important revenue stream for colleges and universities because they\npay higher tuition fees and contribute substantially to business and STEM programs. If it\nbecomes harder for them to come, or if increased competition from abroad gives them incentive\nto stay home or go elsewhere, your bottom lines suffer, and our economy overall misses out on\nU.S.-educated students in critical fields. This won’t be remedied by simply filling the void with\nAmerican students; there are entire programs that just don’t have enough domestic candidates to\nsurvive.\nAnother aspect of the landscape that has changed significantly since my own college days is the\nway technology has affected all aspects of work. It’s no longer uncommon for people to have\nseveral careers in their working lifetime, and constant retraining is essential in virtually every\noccupation. And I’m not just talking about, say, doctors keeping up with the latest surgical\ninvention; I mean that being an auto mechanic today is as much about the computer as it is about\nthe chassis.\n3\n\nSo, on this vast, macro level, we have the two irresistible forces of demographics and technology\naffecting the very movable object of the American workforce.\nBarriers to Entry\nBut we also have myriad financial factors affecting the individuals who make up the nation’s\nstudent body and our current and future workers.\nFirst, we can’t talk about higher education without talking about the financial cost. Both the\nsticker price of tuition and the discounted rate have risen faster than incomes over the past 20\nyears, putting pressure on households’ finances.\nSecond, as everyone in this room will be acutely aware, there is the issue of dwindling state\nfunding. Demographics are bound to impact this issue even further as an increasing share of\nbudgets on the local, state, and federal levels goes toward retirement benefits, pensions, and\nhealth care.\nThese factors both contribute to the growing share of student loans, which now makes up the\nsecond-largest slice of the consumer debt pie, surpassed only by mortgages. While the issue of\ntuition prices and decreased funding have fueled the market for student loans, I worry that\nmounting numbers, combined with uncertainty about the future of repayment and forgiveness\nprograms, may deter some lower- and moderate-income students from entering higher education.\nWhile those determinants have received a lot of attention, there are other, less tangible factors\nthat either erect barriers to entering college or affect students’ success once they’ve enrolled.\nThere are more elements to the school experience than just tuition and books, and campuses\naround the country have done great work to address that fact. Whether it’s navigating office\nhours or finding resources like free tutoring, programs that focus on underserved students have\nbeen important factors in their success. There’s a good body of research to back that up, both\nqualitative and quantitative.1 In fact, one of the Philadelphia Fed’s research teams is currently\nworking with Rutgers University–Camden to assess the outcomes in one of its financial aid\n1 James J. Heckman and Tim D. Kautz, “Hard Evidence on Soft Skills,” National Bureau of Economic Research\nWorking Paper 18121 (2012), http://www.nber.org/papers/w18121.pdf.\n4\n\nprograms — in this case, one that offers financial relief to students well into the middle-class\ncohort. Part of the goal is to clarify those additional support needs.\nWhen I was at the University of Delaware, we had a program for students who were the first in\ntheir families to attend college. We had them arrive in June so they could spend a few months\nfamiliarizing themselves with experiences their families just couldn’t give them first-hand advice\non. Some of it was academic, but a lot of it was soft skills, and it worked. Those students had\nfirst-year GPAs equivalent to their classmates whose families had a history of college\nattendance.\nIncreased cost pressures on institutions may force them to cut or curtail those programs, which\nwould be a great loss, and disproportionately affect lower- and middle-income students.\nThe Resonating Impact\nThe overall issue of student debt is important because it doesn’t just affect individuals, it\nresonates across generational lines in families and spreads into the wider economy.\nResearch shows that in the decade leading up to 2015, the number of adults over 60 who took on\nstudent debt quadrupled, with roughly three-quarters of that being assumed on behalf of children\nor grandchildren.2 Given the same demographic shifts I mentioned earlier, that means debt is\nbeing held by a substantial number of people living on fixed incomes, while the extended\nduration of their lives leaves them more likely to encounter increased care costs, making default\na real threat.\n2 CFPB Warns Student Loan Servicing Problems Can Jeopardize Long-Term Financial Security for Older\nBorrowers (2017), https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-warns-student-loan-servicing-\nproblems-can-jeopardize-long-term-financial-security-older-borrowers/.\n5\n\nOn the national level, research by the Philadelphia Fed’s Consumer Finance Institute, along with\nothers, shows that student debt is affecting both small business formation and homeownership\nrates.3, 4\nThose obviously pose a risk far outside the confines of individual debt.\nFinancial uncertainty and cuts to programs that support underrepresented students could also\nexacerbate the achievement gap and increase income inequality. This isn’t just a social issue;\nresearch shows that inequality exacts a financial cost to the country as a whole.5 We are also\nmissing out on vast opportunities on a national scale if we’re not tapping all our resources. It\nmakes logical sense that if sharp minds are denied access to a good education, they won’t reach\ntheir full potential. It’s an old argument, but new research backs this theory up, investigating\nwhat the authors call our “lost Einsteins.” The researchers looked into the backgrounds of patent\nholders in the United States and found some common themes: People who scored well on\nelementary math tests made up the majority, which wasn’t a surprise. But they also came\noverwhelmingly from privileged backgrounds — low-income students who scored the highest on\nthe tests weren’t any more likely to hold a patent than wealthy kids with below-average math\nscores. There were similar results for women, minorities, and people who lived in the southeast\nportion of the country.6 Women alone make up more than half the population; the simple\nnumbers tell us we’re missing out on a lot of potential and productivity in a majority of the\npopulation.\nThat, in turn, comes back to an issue for higher education: Some of the best minds out there\naren’t being recruited; institutions have to invest in ways to reach new and different\n3 Brent Ambrose, Lawrence Cordell, and Shuwei Ma, “The Impact of Student Loan Debt on Small Business\nFormation,” Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia Working Paper 15-26 (2015).\n4 Zachary Bleemer, Meta Brown, Donghoon Lee, Katherine Strair, and Wilbert van der Klaauw, “Echoes of Rising\nTuition in Students’ Borrowing, Educational Attainment, and Homeownership in Post-Recession America,” Federal\nReserve Bank of New York Staff Report 820 (2017).\n5 Era Dabla-Norris, Kalpana Kochhar, Nujin Suphaphiphet, Frantisek Ricka, and Evridiki Tsounta, Causes and\nConsequences of Income Inequality: A Global Perspective, International Monetary Fund (2015).\n6 Alex Bell, Raj Chetty, Xavier Jaravel, Neviana Petkova, and John Van Reenen, Who Becomes an Inventor in\nAmerica?

As I said earlier, I come at\nthis issue from a lot of different angles, and I know that, with this audience, I’m preaching to the\nchoir. I’ve seen a lot of inventive thinking on campuses, but I’ve also seen some of those\nproposals made in vain, purely out of a resistance to change.\nAre we making the best use of all our resources? Language departments can partner with other\nschools with bigger budgets to provide career-based instruction, like nursing schools certifying\nhealth-care-oriented Spanish or business schools offering business Mandarin. This isn’t a\ndeclared minor, it doesn’t require tenured faculty, and much of it can be done with\nsupplementary software and less time in the classroom. But I’ve heard of department heads\nretreating from ideas like this, even those fully funded by another school, because they don’t fall\nwithin a traditional model. And those are the kinds of programs that can attract outside\norganizations as well.\nSome of the most innovative thinking I’ve seen lately has come out of community colleges. As I\nsaid earlier, education for its own sake is important, and so is the range of learning that comes\nwith a four-year degree. But there are also gaps to be filled in a constantly evolving workforce\nand new careers and areas of research that schools can branch out into.\nI was recently touring Atlantic City and the wider Atlantic County, which are part of my District.\nLike a lot of places, when one industry drives the economy, it can be hard to diversify. Atlantic\nCounty is trying to optimize its assets beyond gambling to bring more growth to the area. I\nalways knew they had an airport out there, but I hadn’t realized the size and scope of it, even\nthough I’m a New Jersey native. It’s a hub of FAA research labs, they train U.S. Marshals, and\nthe Coast Guard and Air National Guard have facilities there. It’s got a 10,000-foot-runway that\nwas built so the space shuttle could land in case of emergency. As far as resources go, it’s a\npretty great asset. But it wasn’t being used as well as it could have been. So the county talked to\nthe airline industry, found out there’s a massive shortage of mechanics and other aviation\n7\n\nspecialists, and are working in partnership with Atlantic Cape Community College to create an\ninstitute on-site.\nOr take Philadelphia, where YouthBuild Philadelphia Charter School, which serves students\nwho’ve previously dropped out of high school, has partnered with the local community college\non training and apprenticeships.\nPrograms like these can help students avoid debt, funnel people into well-paying, understaffed\noccupations, and develop new revenue streams without disrupting four-year programs.\nThe Value of Skills-Based Learning\nThey do something else important, which is that they stress the value of skills-based training and\nunconventional paths to education. Not everyone needs a four-year degree and not everyone\nneeds to go college right away. A singular university experience isn’t right for everyone, and if\nwe can shift the thinking on the different ways people engage in higher education, we can shift\nthe thinking about the ways we provide it.\nMy staff has done research on what they call opportunity occupations, jobs that pay at or above\nthe median wage without a traditional four-year degree. They don’t just know what fields they’re\nin; they know where they are geographically, which could make it easier to create a pipeline.\nThese are good, solid careers that can support a middle-class life.\nApprenticeships can also be incredibly valuable, as can any “learn and earn” program. They are a\npath to a career, and people can save for school later on, go back for more training, or master a\nprofession.\nI’m not advocating that traditional four-year institutions change their models to practical\ntraining. I am saying that the pragmatic approaches these programs take to meeting the needs of\nbusiness and industry, while simultaneously being creative in how they educate students, can\nhelp us rethink some of the old ways of doing business.\nThis is the most inventive, diverse economy on the planet, and our approach to education should\nbe just as innovative. In the face of multiple forces applying financial pressure, it just makes\nsense to rethink some of the ways institutions operate.\n8\n\nConclusion\nBob Zemsky has long argued that higher education has been almost unique in its resistance to\ntaking the steps necessary to improve labor productivity, steps that virtually every other industry\nhas and would take. I don’t know that I want to wade far into that particular quagmire, if only to\navoid a flurry of e-mails from my former colleagues and contemporaries. I do know that higher\neducation is operating in changing economic circumstances, with financial pressures coming\nfrom multiple directions. I know that these institutions are hubs of intellect and creative thinking,\nso the tools are all there. I know that sometimes we all need a little push to move outside our\ncomfort zones and try new ways to achieve our goals. And I know that the men and women in\nthe room today can play a critical role in making that happen.\nThank you. I’m happy to take any questions.\n9",

    "text": "2019 Community Banking in the 21st Century\nResearch and Policy Conference\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\nSt. Louis, MO\nOctober 2, 2019\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\n2019 Community Banking in the 21st Century Research and Policy Conference\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\nSt. Louis, MO\nOctober 2, 2019\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood morning and thank you. It’s great to be here, and to share space on an agenda with so\nmany experts and voices of authority on community banking issues, including some of my\nFederal Reserve colleagues. The one problem is that when you speak on day two of a\nconference like this, you run the risk that your colleagues already made the most important\npoints, and you’ll just sound repetitive.\nAnd while we hopefully won’t sound exactly the same, I’m sure we’re all touching on at least\nsome of the same themes. Because if there’s one thing that I’ve found unanimous agreement\non, it’s the importance of community banks.\nSince I’m mentioning the views of my Fed colleagues, now is probably a good time to interject\nthe standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and do not\nnecessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System. Which is something else\nyou’ve probably already heard …\nAs I said, if there is one overarching message to both this conference and our work within the\nFederal Reserve, it is the critical importance of community banks. The Philadelphia Fed is largely\na community bank supervisor, so we have a front-row seat to the effects of community banking\nthroughout our District, and the way it’s embedded in the DNA of our local economies.\nWe were particularly proud to note that the winning team in the CSBS’s case study contest was\nwon by a Pennsylvania school —congratulations again to Juniata College — and, in fact, almost\none-third of the teams hailed from Pennsylvania.\n1\n\nThe Philadelphia Fed has the smallest geographic District in the System, which I actually see as a\nstrategic advantage. Within those borders, we have areas that reflect the makeup of the\ncountry as a whole: urban, rural, suburban, postindustrial. So we get insight on a diverse set of\neconomic profiles. Our size also makes it easier to spend time out in the District, talking to\nbusiness and community leaders to get a better take on what they’re seeing day to day.\nSomething I’ve seen again and again is that the places that are doing well are the places where\nthere’s a strong community banking presence. In fact, I’d say that, particularly for smaller cities\nand towns, community banks are essential to their economic success.\nBut community banks don’t just have local or regional impact; the insight we get from our\ncontacts gives context to a remarkably complex national economy. And that factors into my\nown views on monetary policy when we’re considering what steps to take for the country as a\nwhole.\nI often note that the U.S. economy — the biggest, and arguably most complex, in the world — is\nfundamentally just a collection of myriad microeconomies. It’s communities and localities,\nneighborhoods and families, and businesses of all sizes. As both businesses and as the\ntouchstones of those individual economies, community banks play a key role in their success.\nFor that reason, it’s important that regulators recognize — and help mitigate — the challenges\nyou face. Because there are several issues on the horizon, including technological change,\ndemographic pressures, and regulatory burden.\nAgain, I know I’m repeating the messages you’ve already heard from my colleagues and\ncontemporaries. But given the importance of community banks to the economy and the\nfinancial system, they’re worth repeating.\nTechnological Change\nI’m being followed on the agenda by a panel on technology’s impact on banking, and that’s\nbeen a central discussion across industries for some time. Cybersecurity, of course, has been a\nconcern for banks of all sizes, but the pressure on smaller institutions can intensify when they\ncan’t attain the same economies of scale as the larger ones.\n2\n\nThen there are advances in fintech and changes to businesses of all sorts with the continued\nmarch of overall technological disruption.\nWe at the Philadelphia Fed have a particular focus on technological advancement — how\nmachine learning and AI affect the workforce and business decisions; how it’s impacting choices\npeople make about education and training; and how, frankly, it is changing the entire economic\nlandscape. And community banks are certainly not immune.\nBut I think there are two important things to remember for this sector in particular.\nFirst, that change isn’t new; it’s been a constant feature of the industry for decades. It just looks\ndifferent now. Second, I think those advancements in general amplify the unique importance of\ncommunity banks, and, in fact, create opportunities.\nTaking those in turn, technological change itself is not new — many of you have been in the\nindustry for a long time and have seen that firsthand. Fintech absolutely presents a\nfundamental change in the way we bank — but so did securitization, credit scoring, and prepaid\ncards. So did ATMs. It’s true that they all look pretty quaint when you compare them to today’s\ntechnology — just like a Walkman looks virtually antique compared to a streaming app on your\nphone. But both the Walkman and the ATM were revolutionary at the time.\nBanking has seen constant change and churn for the past half century. The difference is that\ntoday’s technology makes the delivery system more advanced than ever before, and it\nturbocharges the pace of change. Peer-to-peer lending, for instance, has been going on since\nhumanity first established a barter system; it’s just being delivered via a different platform. In\nmy day, it took the form of Frankie borrowing $20 from Jimmy at the local bar. I suppose one\nbig difference is that Jimmy knew where Frankie lived, so default rates were significantly lower\nin the low-tech version.\nOverall, however, with fintech, it’s the platform that’s new, rather than the product or service.\nThat, of course, presents a business opportunity. It’s likely that partnerships between\ncommunity banks and fintechs are going to increase, because the fundamentals of the banking\nsystem aren’t going to change. Whatever mode or method technology provides to deliver those\n3\n\nservices, they still need a trusted broker of money. And while bigger institutions may be better\npositioned to take on the risk of a fintech partnership, the fundamental advantage of\ncommunity banks is the high level of trust their customers have in them. While community\nbanks will obviously have to do their due diligence in forming partnerships, I’d argue that their\ndeep base of trust is a valuable, competitive asset from the fintech perspective.\nThe second technology-based issue is the advances in AI and machine learning, which actually\nmakes the case that the skills and expertise particular to community banking are more\nimportant now than ever before. Technology is only as smart as the data we input, and,\nparticularly in the case of functions like algorithmic lending, the advantage of community\nbanking is even more clear cut.\nCommunity banks know their customers. There’s a local understanding that can’t be\nprogrammed into a one-size-fits-all approach to lending. You heard yesterday from the Bank of\nBird-in-Hand’s CEO Lori Maley. They’re actually an example I often use, because it’s a perfect\ncase study in local understanding. On paper, the communities they serve wouldn’t look\ncreditworthy to most banks. But Bird-in-Hand knows that when something happens, the\ncommunity comes together to fix it. When a barn burns down, the community comes together\nto build a new one. If someone’s in danger of missing a scheduled payment, the community\npools their resources to make it. That knowledge and understanding of who your customers are\nis an advantage that just can’t be replicated by an algorithm.\nMy daughter and son-in-law encountered the same thing when they tried to buy insurance for\ntheir first house. Philadelphia, like most places, has some linguistic quirks, like the extra “r” in\nthe word water — or “werder.” We also have row houses, while most of the East Coast has\ntownhouses or brownstones. In conversation, it’s not a big deal. In real estate dealings, it’s a\nvery different story. My daughter’s first broker didn’t have row houses listed in the database,\nand they couldn’t just reclassify the property because the roof didn’t fit the narrow description\nof the alternatives. After a lot of time spent in a “Who’s on First”-type back and forth, they\nwalked down the street to a local agent who got the insurance approved that day.\n4\n\nThat’s just one example of how a molehill can turn into a mountain for customers. And the\nflexibility community banks have to meet local needs creates a loyal base.\nSo it’s not just that technology highlights the competitive advantage of community banks’ local\nknowledge; I honestly think it creates an opportunity as that specialist insight becomes more\nand more clear in comparison.\nDemographic and Other Changes in Community Banking\nSo community banks have expert local knowledge, they know their customers, and they reflect\nthe needs of the communities they serve. But the demographics of communities across the\ncountry are changing, as is the community banking landscape. Since 2009, the number of\ncommunity banks has declined by about one-third. Nationwide, bank failures have accounted\nfor about a fifth of the reduction, while the rest are due to M&As. In the Philadelphia Fed’s\nDistrict, the reduction in community banks has been slightly higher than the national average\nover that period — 38 percent for the Third District versus 34 percent nationwide. But the size\nof banks in the Philadelphia Fed’s District has increased significantly more than the national\naverage, with Third District banks’ median assets increasing by 89 percent, versus the national\nrate of 57 percent. Those data point to rates of M&A activity that appear to have strengthened\nthe resulting institutions and community banking overall. Over the same decade, we’ve seen a\nconcurrent change in the asset mix with a significant rise in multifamily loans — 91 percent\noverall — though they still represent just 4 percent of total assets. And while securities have\ndeclined slightly, they remain the largest portion of the asset mix at 17 percent.\nSo while there are fewer community banks in the District, they’ve grown larger and more\ncomplex.\nDemographic changes, such as aging and increasingly less-mobile populations, have already\naffected community banking as a whole, and that will likely continue, meaning they may have\nto rethink their business models. That might mean more personal lending and greater small\nbusiness lending. It could mean more commercial real estate lending or more projects with\ngreater potential risk, but also greater possibilities for reward. From the regulatory and\n5\n\nsupervisory perspective, it will be important to watch for those changes and work to take them\ninto account.\nRegulatory Burden\nWe do a lot of work on economic mobility in our District, and community banks have been\ncentral to our impact. Given how much is tied up in their success, I think it’s incumbent on us as\nregulators to be supportive of community banks’ continued viability.\nWe are well aware of the regulatory burdens that community banks have faced. I think that\nhumanity has a propensity to overcorrect in response to crisis, so the pendulum sometimes\nswings a bit too far in the other direction. In the aftermath of the financial crisis, it made sense\nto put every mechanism in place to prevent a reoccurrence of the worst economic disaster\nsince the Great Depression. But there’s virtually universal agreement that community banks\nwound up on the wrong end of that pendulum swing. We’ve made progress in correcting that,\nincluding easing up on timelines and reporting requirements, but there’s still more to do.\nFor me, a crucial element is how we work with banks. It’s important that we’re able to fix errors\nby working together, rather than at odds; to distinguish mistakes from bad faith. It’s also critical\nthat we continue to provide research and support. At the Philadelphia Fed, we’ve been looking\nat succession planning in particular, and our LINC program helps build relationships between\ncommunity banks and community development organizations.\nBecause community banks play such a vital role in the vibrancy of local communities, it’s\nimportant that their business strategies take that impact into account, particularly for groups\non the margins. And from the regulatory side, it’s important to make space for efforts that\nmight involve more risk, but also have the potential for greater reward.\nWe have a bank in our District, ESSA Bank & Trust, that partnered with an existing program to\nease ex-offenders’ transition back into the community. They’ve set aside $250,000 to make\nloans of up to $15,000 per person for housing, transportation, or education and training. The\nparticipants have to take financial literacy courses and provide a plan for the loan: One needed\n6\n\na car to get to work, one trained to become a commercial truck driver, one started a small\nbusiness.\nSo far, things are going well. But I would argue that even if they did lose money, there’s more to\nconsider. ESSA is investing in their community, in an important way that’s often overlooked and\ngenerally underfunded. It has the potential for a significant return on investment for the\ncommunity, and that creates a new customer base for the bank. I think there’s room for\nflexibility and a little more risk appetite to encourage innovation.\nConclusion\nTo sum up: Community banks are important. They play vital roles in communities across the\ncountry, and they make the difference between a local economy that merely survives and one\nthat thrives. They offer insight to policymakers and a chance at success to their customers.\nThere are challenges, as there are in any industry. We’ve moved the needle on some, while\nothers still have a ways to go. It’s important that we work together as we address them,\nbecause the outcomes will have effects that resonate beyond a single sector. Because\nultimately, community banking matters to all of us.\n7",

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nCredentials, Colleges, and Economic Mobility\nUneven Outcomes in the Labor Market:\nUnderstanding Trends and Identifying Solutions\nPhiladelphia, PA (virtual)\nFebruary 3, 2021\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood morning, good afternoon, and good evening to this audience spanning time zones! It’s an honor to\nbe here today at this very important conference. And as a recovering academic, I’m particularly\ndelighted to be here on Day 3, when we will be discussing credentials and higher education. This is a\nvitally important topic for the health of communities across our country, and I truly thank you for having\nme.\nNow, before we proceed with today’s program, many of you veterans of Fed events will know what’s\ncoming next: that’s right, the standard Fed disclaimer. The views I express today are my own and do not\nnecessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or in the Federal\nReserve System.\nPathways to Success\nEducation has long been an engine of economic mobility, and economic mobility is something\napproaching a national creed of the United States. We believe that anybody ― no matter how humble\nthe circumstances in which they were born ― should have a pathway to the middle class.\nFor me, that pathway was football. I grew up in a blue-collar town next to Camden, NJ. My dad, a union\npipefitter, died when I was 9. Much-needed financial aid landed me at Penn where I was a first-\ngeneration college student. That was the beginning of a journey that I could never have imagined when I\nwas a boy growing up in South Jersey.\n1\n\nOthers’ pathways are going to look different from mine. And given that 40 years later I’m still carrying\naround injuries I got playing football at Penn, that’s probably a good thing.\nBut unfortunately, far too many Americans born in tough circumstances, particularly racial and ethnic\nminorities, are having a tough time finding their pathway up. It’s incumbent on all of us as Americans to\nthink hard about how we are going to fix what ― to my mind ― is a profound moral problem: the lack of\neconomic mobility.\nSo, what do we do?\nSkills More Than Degrees\nI’m a career academic and former university president, so this probably sounds like Ronald McDonald\nadmonishing you to lay off saturated fat. But the truth is that many ― maybe most ― Americans don’t\nneed a traditional four-year college degree. What they need are the skills that will propel them into\nmiddle-class jobs. For my dad, my uncles, and my brother, that was pipefitting. And for many, that’s still\na great option. For others, it will be something else.\nMany skills today are gained through a variety of short-term programs that do not lead to degrees but\ncan provide marketable new skills. These courses can be as short as two months, and students ― many\nof whom are in their midcareer and are looking to retool ― gain a marketable new skill. According to a\nrecent Georgetown University study, these can make a meaningful difference in enrollees’ careers:\nCertificates in engineering technologies can lead to high earnings, as do those in fields like information\ntechnology and legal studies. Indeed, the study found some certificates can yield earnings that rival\nthose of bachelor’s degrees in other fields.\nThese short-term credentials can be gained in many venues, from traditional community colleges, to\nprivate academies like computer coding boot camps both online and brick and mortar, to public‒private\npartnerships designed to provide pipelines of talent to the private sector. The way the latter works is\nthat companies essentially outsource a portion of their employee training to outside vendors, using a\n“pay for success” model. That means the company reimburses the entity that paid for the training in the\nfirst place ― say, the local publicly funded job board ― if the new hire hits certain benchmarks, like\nstaying on the job for six months. It can be an effective way to entice corporations to hire from\npopulations they may find too risky or for which they lack sufficient familiarity, particularly those in\n2\n\nunderserved communities. The workers will benefit, of course, but so will the companies who will have\naccess to an undertapped pool of talent.\nAll in all, getting new skills for people strikes me as a situation in which we need to experiment across a\nwide variety of approaches and methods. We have a lot to learn, and the task couldn’t be more\nimportant.\nAt the Fed, we’ve also been studying ways to get people into what we call opportunity occupations —\njobs that pay the median wage or better and that don’t require a four-year college degree. What’s truly\nexciting is that our researchers have found that many workers already possess the skills they need to\nincrease their income ― all they might need is a little additional training.\nMy colleagues in Cleveland and Philadelphia looked at the skill sets of people who are holding at-risk or\nlow-wage jobs. They then matched those skills to jobs that would pay at least 10 percent more than\ntheir current wage and that don’t require a traditional four-year degree. Looking at 33 metro areas\nnationwide, they found that nearly half of lower-wage employment can be paired with at least one\nhigher-paying occupation requiring similar skills. For transitions connecting the most similar occupations\nidentified in the study, the average bump in wages was almost $15,000 ― real money. On our website,\nwe’ve recently launched what we call an Occupational Mobility Explorer, where workers can plug in\ntheir own skills, where they live, and see what’s out there.\nThe Four-Year Option\nFor others, a four-year degree is still going to be the best option. But far too many students, through no\nfault of their own, enter demanding institutions without adequate preparation. Many have\nunfortunately attended high schools that left them ill prepared for college-level work or have had life\nchallenges that have left them unprepared for the demands of a selective college or university. That can\nbe disastrous, because once a student falls behind academically, it’s very, very difficult to catch up.\nThat’s why I’d like to talk a little bit about a program at the University of Delaware (UD), where I used\nto be president. UD’s Associate in Arts Program not only provides a pipeline of students into the\nuniversity, but also makes sure they are poised to succeed once they get there. I hope our experience\nin Delaware can provide a useful example for states nationwide.\n3\n\nThe way the associate in arts program works is this: UD courses are taught by UD faculty in small classes\nin Delaware Tech buildings throughout the state. (Delaware Tech is the state’s public community\ncollege.)\nStudents receive an associate’s degree in University Studies by earning credits in the core courses that\nare required of all undergraduates, and then transition to UD’s main campus to earn their bachelor’s\ndegree. Most full-time students receive money from the state to cover their tuition. The program is high\ntouch, with small class sizes and lots of interaction between faculty and students.\nI’m thrilled to report that 64 percent of students in the program graduate with their associate’s degree\nwithin three years — well above the national average of around 33 percent. Of those, 88 percent go\nonto the main campus at UD, and nearly 80 percent of those graduate with a bachelor’s degree.\nBecause the program is taught by UD faculty, the transition from associate’s to bachelor’s degree\nbecomes something approaching seamless. A member of the English faculty who is teaching in the\nassociate in arts program knows exactly what her students are prepared for once they enter a UD\nEnglish course, for instance.\nIs the associate in arts program going to be replicable in every context across our vast country ―\nparticularly when state budgets are under pressure and education funding is under threat? Of course\nnot. But as with certification programs, I’m suggesting we let a thousand flowers bloom. Now is the time\nto experiment with new models and new pathways to success.\nFunding Options\nAs with so much else in modern life, a big question surrounding all of this is: How do you pay for it? The\ntraditional student loan has become a millstone around the necks of far too many Americans. Total\nstudent loan debt now tops $1.7 trillion, surpassing credit card debt and second only to mortgages.\nResearchers at the Philadelphia Fed and throughout the Federal Reserve System have studied the ways\nin which student debt burdens affect subsequent credit outcomes and life events. And all the while,\nstudent loan programs are often disproportionately inaccessible to lower-income and minority\nborrowers due to stringent credit criteria. Besides, many microcredential courses like coding boot camps\ntypically aren’t eligible for federal student loans, meaning many students dig deep into their own\npockets or borrow money from family and friends to make necessary investments in their careers.\n4\n\nAnd even among those students who receive student loans and generous financial aid, that sometimes\nisn’t enough. At the Philadelphia Fed, we’ve studied the effects of Bridging the Gap, an innovative\nprogram at Rutgers University‒Camden that significantly reduces or even eliminates 100 percent of\ntuition for middle- and low-income students.\nWhat we found is that, even though reduced tuition was a huge help, many students still had challenges\nmanaging ongoing living and educational expenses beyond tuition. They still needed to work to support\ntheir families, for instance, or scrimp and save for books and other educational materials. Another\nchallenge for students is geographic; it can be emotionally and economically difficult for students to\nleave their hometowns for education ― particularly, again, if their family members count on them for\nfinancial support.\nIncome-based repayment programs offer one potential alternative worth exploring. They are designed\nso students make payments once their incomes rise above a minimum threshold, and students will\nnever pay more than the cap set at the onset of the agreement. But absent strict oversight, income-\nbased repayment programs could be ripe for abuse, so regulators will need to keep a very close eye on\nthem.\nThe bottom line is this: There is an urgent need for education ― certificate or degree based ― to be\nmore affordable for more people.\nThis will take input and action from many segments of society ― government, civil society, the\ncorporate sector, and, perhaps especially, from the universities and colleges themselves. The Fed has a\nrole to play, too, with our research and convening power.\nTo me, increasing accessibility to education in all its forms is not only an economic imperative but a\nmoral one as well. Indeed, the economic effects of the pandemic are already having a noticeable impact\non enrollment among our country’s most disadvantaged.\nAccording to the National Student Clearinghouse, enrollment at two-year institutions was down\nsignificantly in fall 2020 versus the prior year. First-time enrollment and enrollment for many well-\npaying vocational programs are even further down. These declines are concentrated among freshmen\nenrollees ― particularly Black, Hispanic, and Native American students. This is a trend we need to do\neverything in our power to reverse. Once again, too many pathways are being blocked.\n5\n\nWith so much at stake and this being such an important topic, I thank you again for having me today.\nBut before I go, with the recent change in administration in Washington, and the Super Bowl coming up,\nI can’t resist making one more plug for my old university. Did you know that UD is one of only five\nschools nationwide to have graduated both a Super Bowl starting quarterback and a U.S. president?\nSo, thank you again for having me. Now over to you, Keith.\n6",

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nHello! It’s great to be back in Delaware without having to fight the traffic on I-95.\nI’m honored to be addressing today’s luncheon — please go ahead and start your salad. To begin, I’d like\nto sketch out just a few brief remarks about the state of the economy and the path of Federal Reserve\npolicy, and then we can turn things over to a Q&A.\nBut before I do that, I need to give you the standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my\nown and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or in\nthe Federal Reserve System.\nFor the past 18 months, the U.S. economy has moved in tandem with the waxing and waning of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. During periods when case rates and hospitalizations have declined, the economy\nhas surged as American consumers have voted with their feet — and their wallets. When COVID-19 risks\nabate, more Americans dine out at restaurants, check in to hotels, and — much to the chagrin of their\nfellow passengers who were hoping to stuff their luggage in the overhead compartments — fill up\nairplanes. Those are important categories of spending in a country where consumption makes up about\n70 percent of total economic activity. In the second quarter of this year, for instance, GDP grew at a very\nhealthy annualized rate of around 6.5 percent as case rates plummeted.\nAnd, of course, the opposite occurs during periods when the virus spikes. When the Delta variant of\nCOVID-19 erupted, fomenting the country’s fourth major wave of the pandemic, things started moving\nsideways. Consumer confidence tanked, and large industries like hospitality and leisure stagnated at\n1\n\nbest. So for this quarter, we can expect growth to come in at an annualized rate of between 3 and 4\npercent, a sharp slowdown from earlier this year.\nBut there are reasons to be sanguine that the country’s recovery from this wave of COVID-19 may prove\nmore durable than in the past. And that’s because more than half of the country is now fully vaccinated.\nGetting more shots into arms will save lives and aid the recovery by reducing the size and severity of\nfuture COVID-19 waves. The Delta variant has also concentrated minds: It seems to have not only\npersuaded more Americans to get shots on their own, but it also pushed more corporations and\ninstitutions to mandate their employees to get vaccinated. That is cause for optimism.\nStill, headwinds remain. Supply chain constraints are a powerful one, as shortages of crucial parts like\ncomputer chips have hobbled not only the production of cars and trucks, but also comparatively smaller\ndurable goods like home appliances. (Yes, there are computer chips in your washing machine; we’ve\ncome a long way since the days of the washboard.) One of our business contacts, a major homebuilder,\ntells us he’s now selling new homes with used appliances in them with the promise that he’ll replace\nthem as soon as he can. Manufacturers in our region are also reporting being hamstrung by supply chain\nissues. Unfortunately, there are indications that these constraints could persist for the next couple of\nyears.\nThere’s another input lacking in supply as well: labor. Job openings are at record highs, hitting nearly 11\nmillion at the end of July. Meanwhile, more people are quitting their jobs, and the rate at which open\npositions are being filled is continuing to slow. The upshot, of course, is better pay for those who are\nworking: Wages are up more than 4 percent year over year.\nIt’s clear that a combination of factors — trouble accessing childcare or eldercare, lingering fears about\nthe virus, the rise in equities and home values spurring people to retire, and perhaps a general\nrevaluation of life choices — is persuading a lot of Americans to stay on the sidelines even as the\neconomy has reopened. And notably, the elimination of extra federal unemployment benefits has not\nnoticeably — at least not yet — appeared to nudge people back into the workforce.\nHere in Delaware, there are strong signs of economic recovery. Nearly 70 percent of adults are fully\nvaccinated, and various economic metrics are trending in a positive direction.\nOn the jobs front, the unemployment rate in Delaware was 5.4 percent in August, representing a huge\nimprovement from April 2020 when the jobless rate was 13.4 percent. But there is still some ground to\nbe made up: In February 2020, unemployment stood at 4.5 percent. Employment in financial services\n2\n\nand manufacturing is either at or very close to prepandemic numbers, though there is still ground to be\nmade up in leisure and hospitality. In terms of unfilled job openings, the most in-demand roles in the\nstate are registered nurses, applications software developers, and customer service representatives.\nThe housing market continues to perform well. The state’s year-over-year home price growth in July was\naround 16.2. Home price growth in Sussex County has been even stronger at around 20 percent. Exports\nhave rebounded significantly, too, with healthy growth in the outbound shipment of chemicals,\ncomputers and electronics, and transportation equipment.\nOn the national level, for 2021, I would expect GDP growth to come in at around 6.5 percent. It will then\nmoderate to about 3.5 percent in 2022, and 2.5 percent in 2023. Inflation, meanwhile, should come in\naround 4 percent for 2021 — we’re already seeing some moderation there, as prices of used cars finally\nstabilize. After that, we can expect inflation of a bit over 2 percent for 2022 and right at 2 percent in\n2023. Unemployment should fall steadily during this period as well.\nDownside risks include persistent supply chain issues or yet another resurgence of the virus. And in the\nshort term, a failure by Congress to raise the debt ceiling could harm economic growth significantly.\nIn terms of monetary policy, I am in the camp that believes it will soon be time to begin slowly and\nmethodically — frankly, boringly — tapering our $120 billion in monthly purchases of Treasury bills and\nmortgage-backed securities. Those purchases were necessary to keep markets functioning during the\nacute phase of the crisis. But to the extent that we are still dealing with a labor force issue, the problem\nlies on the supply side, not with demand. You can’t go into a restaurant or drive down a commercial\nstrip without noticing a sea of “Help Wanted” signs. Asset purchases aren’t doing much — or anything\n— to ameliorate that.\nAfter we taper our asset purchases, we can begin to think about raising the federal funds rate. But I\nwouldn’t expect any hikes to interest rates until late next year or early 2023.\nNow, before we move to our Q&A, I’d like to share just a little bit of information from our most recent\nCFI COVID-19 Survey of Consumers. One of the pleasures of this job is sharing some of the research we\ndo with audiences like you.\nSince April 2020, the Philadelphia Fed has been conducting a series of national surveys that focus on\nchanges in job status, income levels, and personal financial security. The economic data we have access\nto at the Fed — and believe me, we look at a ton of data — are an extraordinary resource. But it’s\n3\n\nimportant, too, to understand how people’s economic realities are playing out on the ground. Our\nCOVID-19 surveys have been instrumental in allowing us to do that.\nI’d encourage all of you to take a look at our series of surveys on our website — philadelphiafed.org —\nbut I’d like to point out just a few important data points from the latest survey, which was done this\nsummer as Delta surged.\nFirst, more people were feeling more confident about their personal finances this summer than they\nwere in the spring. More were working normal hours, and more were working onsite, rather than\nremotely, and 10.9 percent of respondents reported being currently laid off or furloughed, down from\n17.9 percent last fall.\nBut when it came to expectations about the future, the survey found wide disparities across groups.\nWomen, people making less than $40,000 a year, and people under the age of 36 were much more\npessimistic about their earnings over the next year than men and older people, for instance. The good\nnews is, across all survey respondents, the number of people reporting they are having trouble making\nends meet has been declining.\nThe headline of this iteration of the survey is “Cautious Optimism Reigns,” which I’d say captures my\nsentiment regarding the economy as well.\nSo, thanks again so much for having me. And now, let’s move on to questions.\n4",

    "text": "An Economic Outlook\nThe Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania\nPhiladelphia, PA\nFebruary 21, 2017\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the FOMC.\n\nEconomic Outlook\nThe Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania\nPhiladelphia PA\nFebruary 21, 2017\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood afternoon and thank you. It’s always a pleasure to be back home at Wharton.\nToday I’ll give a brief overview of the economy, my outlook for the next year or so — including\nthe path of monetary policy — and then talk a little bit about a subject that’s probably near and\ndear to a lot of your hearts: student debt.\nBefore I begin, I’ll start the way I always do with the standard proviso that my views today are\nmine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of others in the Federal Reserve System or my\ncolleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nLabor market\nWith that out of the way, things are looking pretty good.\nWe started off the year with a strong labor market. We added 227,000 jobs in January, and the\nunemployment rate stands at 4.8 percent, which is at or below my estimate of the natural rate of\nunemployment. That’s a slight uptick from December, but it reflects more people coming off the\nsidelines and back into the labor force. So in this case, it’s a positive outcome.\nU6 unemployment is 9.4 percent. While that’s still higher than I’d like, it’s a far cry from the bad\nold days of the recession and its aftermath when U6 reached a peak of about 17 percent.\n1\n\nQuits are still high, layoffs remain low, and job postings are near historical peaks. My business\ncontacts continue to tell me that finding workers, especially in certain occupations, is getting\nmore and more difficult.\nTaking that all into account, the labor market continues to tighten. And I see it as more or less\nback to full health.\nWhenever I talk about the labor market, I’m always careful to point out that just because things\nare good — or even healthy — doesn’t mean they’re perfect. There continue to be pockets in the\ncountry — both geographically and demographically — that aren’t feeling the relief. We have a\nlot of them in the Fed’s Third District: post-industrial towns, rural areas, and the urban\nlandscape. Philadelphia is the poorest of the 10 biggest cities in America, and Camden has, at\nvarious times, been called the poorest city in America period. Among different segments of the\npopulation, the unemployment rate for African American men remains at 8.0 percent,\nsignificantly higher than the national average.\nWe need to pay special attention to the regions and demographic groups that have been left\nbehind. The Fed can help to some extent through our community development work, which\nfocuses on strengthening local economies. But for the most part, monetary policy doesn’t have\nthe scope or tools to address these issues head on. That takes legislative action.\nAnd while I’m relatively upbeat about employment, there’s still room for wage growth to move\nup. While the continued improvement in the labor market has moved the needle on wage growth\n— as of January, the year-over-year growth was about 2.5 percent — previous expansions have\nseen sustained growth of above 3 percent. That’s what we expect in a robust economy.\nInflation\nMoving on to inflation, we’re seeing positive upward movement, although PCE remains below\nour 2 percent target. Headline and core PCE closed out last year at 1.6 and 1.7 percent,\nrespectively. That’s a world of improvement over the end of 2015, when they were at 0.6 and 1.4\npercent.\n2\n\nWe do have January numbers for CPI inflation, with headline CPI rising a remarkable 0.6\npercent, driven largely by an increase in gas prices. That brings the year-over-year change to 2.5\npercent. Core CPI rose 0.3 percent, bringing that year-over-year change to above 2 percent.\nI should note that inflation as measured by CPI is often higher than PCE. That said, it still\nindicates an overall upward movement, and I see us reaching our 2 percent target on PCE\nsometime this year or next.\nAnother positive indicator is that we’re starting to see inflation expectations rally around the 2\npercent goal.\nGrowth\nTurning to growth, real GDP increased 1.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016. A substantial\ndrag from net exports slowed growth there. While real GDP growth was stronger in the second\nhalf of 2016 — after it grew by 3.5 percent in the third quarter — we’re really looking at\nmoderate growth overall, averaging just under 2 percent. The Philadelphia Fed’s Survey of\nProfessional Forecasters points to 2.2 percent growth in the current quarter.\nRetail sales have been strong, rising 0.4 percent in January. In fact, we’ve seen a rapid\nacceleration in retail sales since the middle of last year. And consumer confidence has continued\nthe upward trend it started in 2016, carrying into this year.\nOverall, I see strong consumer spending driving growth of about 2 percent over the course of the\nyear. And that 2 percent growth is more or less what we should consider normal for the medium\nterm.\nMonetary policy\nSo, what does all this mean for monetary policy? Given the state of the economy — more or less\nback to normal — I continue to see three modest rate hikes of 25 basis points each as appropriate\nfor 2017, assuming things stay on track.\nI’ve said it before and I don’t mind repeating myself: Monetary policy is a fairly limited tool that\nis fairly limited in its scope. A lot of people would like to see growth above our 2 percent\n3\n\nprojection, but that’s not really up to Fed officials. That’s the kind of policy that’s outside our\npurview.\nIf we really want to move the needle, we need to invest in physical and human capital.\nStudent loans\nAnd that’s where I come to the subject of student loans.\nI should mention that different Federal Reserve Banks have different areas of research focus.\nDallas, as you might imagine, spends a lot of time looking at energy markets. In Philadelphia,\nwe’re the System leaders in research on consumer credit and finance. So, we have a lot of\nexpertise in this area.\nThere’s no question that investing in the education of our citizens is essential for growth and is\nthe core of our economic future. We’re talking about the engine of the American economy: The\nmen and women who will be creating the next miracle drug, inventing the next radical\ntechnological innovation, writing the next wave of legislation.\nBut there’s an all-too-familiar problem that can act as a barrier to people getting the education\nthey need.\nTo steal a line from John Oliver, if you went to college in America, chances are you have two\nthings: Bob Marley’s greatest hits and student debt.\nThe headlines you’ve heard before, and they’re fairly staggering:\nThe number of people with student debt doubled between 2000 and 2014, for a total of about 42\nmillion. Aggregate student loan debt in the U.S. is currently nearly $1.3 trillion.1\nThe average student loan borrower has about $31,000 in outstanding balances, whereas the\ntypical American borrower owes over $16,000.2\n1 FRBNY Quarterly Report on Household Debt and Credit, November 2016. The actual number is $1.279 trillion as\nof September 30, 2016.\n2 The actual numbers are $31,308 (average) and $16,648 (median). The statistics are based on information contained\nin the New York Fed Consumer Credit Panel/Equifax data set.\n4\n\nAnd 11 percent of balances are past due, compared with 8 percent 10 years ago. It should be\nnoted, however, that the delinquencies have been coming down since the peak of 12 percent in\n2012.3\nThat’s the data we’re used to hearing, and that’s what most of the conversation is about, for good\nreason.\nBut there are more data and some nuances to the numbers that bear investigating. Because if\nwe’re going to reach policy conclusions — and for the record, I’m not going to reach any policy\nconclusions because that’s not my job — we should dig a little deeper.\nFirst and foremost, defaults on smaller loans are actually more common than on big ones.\nThere are a number of factors that play into this, but there are some trends that emerge.\nLarger loans tend be taken on by people attending four-year institutions, and those students tend\nto complete school at a higher rate. They may have more debt when they graduate, but\ngraduating makes them more likely to find a job and a better paying one at that. So, those\nstudents tend to be in a better position to repay loans.\nStudents at for-profit colleges or two-year programs are generally in school for shorter periods of\ntime, which is part of the reason the amounts are smaller. However, a significant portion of these\nstudents are unlikely to finish their degree or certificate. And people who don’t complete their\nprograms are more likely to default.\nThis is largely because they struggle to find jobs that pay enough to both repay loans and cover\nthe general cost of living. That was made exponentially worse by the recession and the attendant\nweak labor market.\nIn 2013, for instance, the unemployment rate for borrowers who were recent graduates of four-\nyear, public, and nonprofit institutions was 7.7 — only a little higher than the overall average\nunemployment rate for that year.\n3 FRBNY Quarterly Report on Household Debt and Credit, August 2016. The actual number is 11.0 for those who\nare 90 days’ delinquent or in default at the end of 4Q2016. The statistics are based on information contained in the\nNew York Fed Consumer Credit Panel/Equifax data set.\n5\n\nBy contrast, recent graduates of two-year colleges had an unemployment rate of 16.9 percent.\nMore alarmingly, those who went to for-profit schools had an unemployment rate of 20.6\npercent.4 To put that in perspective, we would literally have to go back to the Great Depression\nto get a national level of unemployment that high.\nThe recession was also marked by a dramatic increase in attendance at two-year and for-profit\ncolleges. These schools accounted for roughly half of the increase in student debt between 2009\nand 2011. This increase was part of a longer-term trend that highlights a lot of the data I’ve just\ntalked about. From 2003 to 2013, over 30 percent of the increase in student debt was taken on by\nstudents from those institutions.5\nWhat does this tell us, and why does this matter?\nI’m not ignoring the issues facing students who graduated on time from four-year institutions and\nfound good jobs when they left. Being in a better state than their counterparts doesn’t lessen the\nblow of a few decades of paying off loans. And it still has implications for the broader economy:\nMillennials are now technically a larger generation than the baby boomers, and owing money\naffects the way they live and participate in the economy. There’s a good amount of research that\nlinks student debt to younger adults being unable to move out on their own. Some of it finds a\nbig enough effect to impact the housing market.\nBut we should also look at the way the segmentation of the student debt market impacts the way\nwe view the issue, and, more broadly, how we approach policy.\nFundamentally, this is a question of how we look at skills, the labor force, and the ways in which\nwe prepare people for professional success.\nI’m always careful to avoid wading into debates about how elected officials should make policy.\nThere are larger questions about the allocation of funds at the local, state, and federal levels that\nI’m going to sidestep.\nWhat I can address is some of the data and research.\n4 Adam Looney and Constantine Yannelis, “A Crisis in Student Loans? How Changes in the Characteristics of\nBorrowers and in the Institutions They Attended Contributed to Rising Loan Defaults,” Brookings Papers on\nEconomic Activity (September 2015).\n5 See Looney and Yannelis.\n6\n\nI’m frequently amazed at the simplicity of programs that have demonstrable effects. Case in\npoint, there is evidence to suggest that by simply offering high school students more intensive,\npersonalized information about college options, they make better, more successful choices.6\nLikewise, a more flexible approach to repayment can keep people from winding up in a debt\ncycle that can permanently affect their credit.\nAt the moment, student debt holders have the option of programs that protect them from\nspending more than 10 percent of their income on repayment. But they have to reapply annually,\nfilling out the kind of complex sets of forms that bureaucracy is famous for. And eligibility is\nbased on the previous year’s income, which means if you lose your job, you won’t be off the\nhook for payments for quite a while. The complexity — and probably the frustration — of the\nprocess keeps a lot of people out of the process who could use the help.7\nOne possible solution can be found in our counterparts overseas. Repayments are automatically\nlinked to income through the tax systems in countries like Australia, the UK, New Zealand, and\nothers. In addition to the relief it gives people paying off student loans, it reduces the dreaded\nreams of paperwork.\nAnother issue altogether is thinking about how we address tertiary education on a societal level.\nWhen my parents were growing up, all you needed for a good job was a high school diploma.\nThat was still true for some of my generation, but that necessity quickly turned to being a college\ndegree. I bet a lot of you and your friends feel that you won’t be competitive in the marketplace\nwithout a master’s.\nThe thing is we don’t all need or want the same educational track. A traditional four-year degree\nis great for some people. Ditto a post-graduate degree.\n6 Caroline Hoxby and Sarah Turner, “What High-Achieving Low-Income Students Know about College,” American\nEconomic Review Papers & Proceedings, 105 (May 2015), pp. 514–517.\n7 Eric P. Bettinger, Bridget Terry Long, Philip Oreopoulos, and Lisa Sanbonmatsu, “The Role of Application\nAssistance and Information in College Decisions: Results from the H&R Block FAFSA Experiment,” The Quarterly\nJournal of Economics, 127 (August 2012), pp. 1204–1242.\n7\n\nFor others, it’s not necessarily the right path. And we should stop making people feel as though\nthey all need to fit into the same mold.\nOne of our research areas at the Philadelphia Fed is skills training and alternative routes to\neducation and professional readiness.\nThe data show a skills gap. I hear it all the time from my business contacts: They have the jobs\n— they just don’t have the people to fill them because they don’t have the right training.\nMy staff recently conducted a study on what they call “opportunity occupations.” These are jobs\nthat pay at or above the national median income but don’t require a traditional four-year degree.\nThey make up close to 30 percent of the job market nationally.\nIf we reconsider the way we train people, especially for occupations that require special skills,\nwe can start to maximize the potential of our workforce.\nI saw this in action when I visited the Academies at Roxborough High School with my\nCommunity Development staff. This is a program that trains high school students to be career\nready when they graduate, so they can make the move into jobs that will pay them a good wage.\nSome of them will go on to traditional four-year programs, some will get further technical or\nvocational training, some will start their career path right out of the gate. But they’ll all have the\nopportunity to make a living while they’re pursuing either more education or moving along their\nprofessional pathway or both.\nIf we approach education and the needs of the workforce from a different angle, we can save a\nlot of the heaviest-hit students a world of debt hurt.\nConclusion\nI can’t formulate education policy, or allocate funds, or even make my own children study\nwhat I want them to — although, of course, I’m immensely proud of them and they’ve made\nexcellent choices without listening to me.\nBut I can point to the research and what the data say. Changing our approach to how we invest in\neducation and training won’t take care of the entire student debt issue, but it can help those who\nare disproportionately affected by it.\n8",

Harker today are my own and not\nnecessarily those of the\nFederal Reserve System or\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nthe Federal Open Market\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia Committee (FOMC).\n\nA Look at Fintech from the Inside to the Upside\nFintech and Financial Institutions Conference\nPhiladelphia, PA\nApril 10, 2025\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood afternoon and, once again, welcome to the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.\nMy thanks to you all for being here, to Paul Laux and all the other organizers from the\nUniversity of Delaware for leading the effort organizing this conference, and to my\ncolleague Vitaly Meursault for his leadership on behalf of the Philly Fed.\nIf there’s one thing I’ve learned during all my time as president and CEO of the Philly\nFed, and before this as president of the University of Delaware and dean of the Wharton\nSchool at the University of Pennsylvania, it’s to never speak more than necessary,\nespecially when lunch is involved! So, I hope to keep my remarks relatively brief.\nAs many of you may know, for each of the past seven years, the Philadelphia Fed has\nconvened a fall conference focused mostly on the consumer side of the fintech space.\nThis conference has helped make our Bank a thought leader at the heavily trafficked\nintersection of finance and technology.\nBut, as I said, that fall meeting, while adding truly vital knowledge to the public sphere,\nhas largely brought together practitioners. Today, we welcome the researchers and\nspecialists whose work has been at the front end of the topics the fall conference\ncovers. So here, we get to discuss the theoretical which underpins the practical. Put the\ntwo conferences together, and we are fully rounding out our understanding of fintech.\nOr, if I may use a truly Philly example, we now have both the soft pretzel and the\nmustard. Or the cheese and the steak. Or the — well, you get the idea.\nBut before I dive further into any of this, I must first dispense with a small piece of official\nbusiness — the standard Fed disclaimer! The views I present today are my own and do\nnot necessarily represent those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee or within the Federal Reserve System.\nNow, I must begin by explaining why I take such a great interest in fintech, and why I am\nproud that, throughout my tenure as president and CEO of the Philly Fed, we have\ncarved out our place in this field. For those of you who don’t know me, I’m not a trained\neconomist. By education, I am an engineer. I came to economics, quite frankly, to help\nme solve an engineering problem! But, truth be told, over the subsequent years I have\nfound, happily, that economics and engineering really aren’t that far apart.\n1\n\nSurely, I’m not the first to have this revelation, either. In fact, John Hayford, who served\nas director of the College of Engineering at Northwestern University in the early 20th\ncentury, wrote an essay all the way back in 1917 for the Journal of Political Economy\ntitled “The Relation of Engineering to Economics,” in which he said:\n“Economics and engineering are closely related. Economics has been defined as\nthe social science of earning a living. With the same appropriateness,\nengineering may be defined to be physical science applied to helping groups\n[. . .] to make a better living.”\nWhen we take a deeper look at that statement, one word comes to mind: efficiency.\nWhether we come to a systemic challenge as an economist or as an engineer, the initial\ntask is to measure whether that system is operating at optimal efficiency. That is the\nultimate key to progress. And, if maximum efficiency isn’t being achieved, then the goal\nbecomes to get there.\nAnd few spaces allow for us to see this nexus of economics and engineering, and its\nbroad impacts, quite like fintech. We have, over the course of not only the past century\nbut also just within the past couple of decades, participated in a movement of society\nfrom one where cash went from being a tactile good — printed paper and minted metal\n— to becoming a digital good — a series of zeroes and ones. Fewer and fewer people\nare carrying physical wallets filled with currency in favor of metaphorical wallets and\ndirect-payment apps on their smartphones.\nAll within the span of a few years.\nThe explosion of fintech options has been nothing short of a sea change in how we look\nat, interact with, and even conceive of money. Fintech has been a great disruptor, in a\nmostly positive meaning of that term.\nThrough fintech, both individuals and institutions have been able to close transactions\nmore quickly — just think of how many parents no longer have to snail-mail a check to\ntheir child at college when they can just send the funds over the internet. And fintech\nhas also helped improve access to credit — again, why wait weeks to get cleared for a\npersonal loan or mortgage when you can get an instant approval over an app.\nThese advances appear to be an overwhelming victory for efficiency. But are they truly?\nCertainly, from a viewpoint of system speed, they are. Waiting for a check to travel\nacross the country and clear surely takes more time than money sent through an instant\npayment app. But here I would ask us to think about whether speed should be our only\nmeasurement and defining ideal.\nThis is particularly important when it comes to issues of AI and machine learning. I, for\none, would heed the caution expressed by my colleague here at the Philadelphia Fed,\n2\n\nEconomic Advisor and Economist Lukasz Drozd, in a recent article for our quarterly\nresearch journal:\n“The concerning aspect of AI [. . .] is that it is a major general purpose technology\nwith the potential to broadly and persistently tilt the incoming flow of new capital-\nproductivity-augmenting innovations toward those that automate tasks, rather\nthan augment the productivity of capital in previously automated tasks.”\nTo further refine my answer to this question of efficiency, I also turn to the book, The\nGreat Reversal, by New York University economist and Max L. Heine Professor of\nFinance Thomas Philippon. I found his writings salient to the program of the fall fintech\nconference — and I find them perhaps even more so here.\nAccording to Philippon’s research and data, the share of U.S. Gross Domestic Product\nclaimed by financial intermediaries in 2010 was roughly 8 percent. In contrast, in 1880,\nit was 2 percent. And while this figure had bounced around a bit in the interim, it had\nnever exceeded 6 percent until rapidly increasing in the 1980s. And from there it kept\ngrowing.\nNow, this growth should make sense to us given the proliferation of financial products\nand services over the past four decades and growth of jobs for those whose work has\nhelped those products and services come to market. But the paradox that Philippon\nuncovered in this data is that the unit cost of financial intermediation — or the cost of\nproviding a service to a consumer — had remained roughly constant around 2 percent.\nAnd that goes all the way back to the start of his data in the 1880s.\nThis, as he stated, creates a puzzle — if we have so much more invested in the\nintermediary systems that enhance the operational speed at which our financial system\nworks, why has the cost at the consumer’s end remained steady? Now, his subsequent\nresearch, in which he added an additional five years of data, showed that this unit cost\nhad decreased slightly from 2010 and 2015 yet still remained stubbornly close to that 2\npercent level. But no one can claim that the financial system of 1880 is on par with\n2025, let alone 2015, from a standpoint of operational efficiency.\nSo, the overall question I believe we must ask is why hasn’t this decrease been greater\nand more observable? Consumer choice has exploded as many barriers to entry have\nbeen scaled down or eliminated. And here is where we can welcome John Hayford back\ninto the conversation, because here is where economics and engineering merge.\nAnd, to be sure, I don’t mean “here” in the figurative sense for the purposes of my\nremarks, because they are actually converging at this conference.\nFirst, I would suggest that we have an invaluable opportunity to look anew at how new\nfintech applications are constructed, how they intend to operate, and which systems\nthey intend to improve upon if not replace outright. The road from theory to practice is\n3\n\nnever a straight line, nor perhaps should it be. Research should lead to testing, which\nshould feed back to additional research and then more testing, before a final product is\nrolled out to the market.\nAnd even then, even after that instance of commercialization, the work should not stop.\nWe must go back and constantly evaluate the data and ensure that what worked on\npaper, and then in a controlled experimental setting, is now working at large. As we\nknow, algorithms often need review.\nThis is where the Federal Reserve’s interests lie. It’s why the efforts of Vitaly and his\ncolleagues here who are focused on machine learning and AI are so critical. One of the\ncore functions of the Federal Reserve, after all, is to ensure the stability of the United\nStates’ financial system. So yes, we have an inherent role in ensuring fintech advances\nlive up to their promise.\nMoreover, however, I would also offer that there is no inherent aversion to new\ntechnologies within the Fed — in fact, I would look no further than the FedNow instant\npayment system as an example of the Federal Reserve System bringing some of the\nsame technologies available to consumers and implementing them for financial\ninstitutions.\nThe underlying reason for our interest is the simple reality that technological innovation\nis happening, and if it’s not happening here, it’s happening somewhere else. And given\nthe Federal Reserve System’s preeminence in matters of financial stability and security,\nit is a no-brainer that we should seek to become not just thought leaders but thought-\nand-practice leaders. We may not be developing consumer products here within these\nwalls but the research we are conducting in machine learning and AI, and even beyond\ninto the realm of quantum computing, can certainly provide perspective for those who\nare doing the coding and creating.\nWe know how important it is to ensure that new systems are built on a solid\ntechnological foundation. And by that I don’t simply mean that an app is properly coded\nso it won’t crash on the end user. I also mean that the data being used to underpin that\napp’s function is properly utilized and stripped of potential biases.\nIf the great promise of fintech is leveling the playing field and eliminating barriers to\nentry then we cannot risk having that promise broken because an imperfect algorithm,\nbuilt around imperfect data, leads to a biased outcome. But let us take that a step\nfurther and imagine that multiple institutions or apps are utilizing the data. The impact of\nflawed data could fan out across the consumer landscape. And as we know from\npractice, reining in a bad algorithm is perhaps just a notch above trying to put\ntoothpaste back into the tube.\nI would suggest that for all its immense promise, as a very first step, we must agree that\nmachine learning is only as good as the data we’re asking the machines to learn.\n4\n\nAnd in this, perhaps we can find the solutions that will make both the John Hayfords and\nThomas Philippons of the world happy — that at this nexus of finance and engineering\nwe will not only be able to make systems run better and more smoothly for consumers\nand institutions, but also perhaps drop that unit cost of intermediation and deliver\nsystemic savings.\nAnd that, I would say, would be a maximally efficient use of our efforts.\nSo, with that, I shall conclude and allow you to enjoy what remains of your lunches and\nresume the conversations which began earlier this morning.\nI again thank you for your participation in this inaugural conference. I wish you all the\nbest for a productive convening.\n5",

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nEquity and the Recovery\nReinventing Our Communities: Planning for Equity in Recovery –\nLessons We’re Learning from COVID-19 (webinar)\nPhiladelphia, PA\nMay 28, 2020\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood afternoon. Thank you very much to Daniel for that introduction and a big thank you to everybody\nat both the Philadelphia and St. Louis Federal Reserve Banks who worked tirelessly to make this virtual\nevent possible. We usually hold these biennial Reinventing Our Communities conferences in\nPhiladelphia, though two years ago we met in Baltimore for the first time. Back then, we thought that\nwas a big change! Little did we know …\nNow, we may be meeting in a very different format this year, but I still have to begin by mentioning my\nusual Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of\nanyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or in the Federal Reserve System.\nThe COVID-19 crisis has certainly changed America in the course of just a few months. Many of us have\nbecome expert “social distancers” and furious handwashers. Some of us have even become amateur\nbarbers.\nBut in other important ways, this health crisis has not so much changed things as simply exposed, and in\nsome cases accelerated, trends that were already present in our society.\nThe United States went into this crisis a troublingly unequal place, beset by serious inequities in income,\nwealth, and opportunity.\nPerhaps most disturbing is that the multiyear economic expansion we experienced through much of the\nlast decade did nothing to reduce American inequality. Indeed, last year, even as by many measures, the\neconomy was in great shape, the Census Bureau calculated that income inequality in 2018 was the\nhighest it had been in the 50 years it has measured it. The Gini coefficient — which measures the\nequality of income distribution — shows that incomes in the U.S. are far less equally distributed than in\nother industrialized countries like Germany and Japan.\n1\n\nWealth inequality is even starker.\nMy colleagues at the St. Louis Fed calculated last year that, as of 2016, the top 10 percent of wealthiest\nAmerican households owned 77 percent of the country’s total wealth. The bottom 50 percent owned\nonly 1 percent. Fully 10 percent of American households had negative net worth, meaning their total\nhousehold debt outstripped their assets.\nInequality and poverty touch all corners of America, from depopulating rural communities in the Great\nPlains, to postindustrial cities in the Northeast and Midwest, to neighborhoods in even some of our\nwealthiest cities like San Francisco and New York. But we can’t deny that certain communities have\nborne the brunt of these inequities more than others. It’s simply a fact that some of the underlying\ninequalities in our society deal with race. To cite just one example, as of 2016, the average family wealth\nof white families was nearly seven times greater than that of black families.\nThe health crisis has only heightened these inequities. For one, the coronavirus itself is affecting some\ncommunities more than others. In Philadelphia, more than half of those who have died from COVID-19\nhave been African American, despite African Americans making up only about 40 percent of the city’s\npopulation. This is a trend that has been observable nationwide.\nAnd the economic costs of the health crisis have fallen on those least able to bear them as well.\nOur researchers at the Philadelphia Fed have been studying closely which neighborhoods and\nhouseholds have been most affected by the economic shutdown. They’ve found that those most likely\nto be at risk of losing employment were already disproportionately low income.\nIn other words, both as a health and an economic crisis, COVID-19 has the cruel effect of hurting those\nwho were already most vulnerable.\nAmerican inequality is a moral and ethical challenge to our country’s founding creed. But research\nshows it’s also a growing economic problem. The International Monetary Fund has found that when an\nadditional 1 percent of income goes to the top 20 percent of income earners, GDP falls. But when the\nsame gains are made by the bottom 20 percent, GDP rises.\nThat makes sense, of course: Those who earn less money are likely to spend it, whereas high earners\nsave. That’s crucial because consumer spending accounts for about 70 percent of our country’s total\nGDP. Ensuring an equitable recovery from COVID-19 is critical in making sure the next expansion is not\nonly fair but also strong and durable.\n2\n\nThat’s why today’s discussion is so vitally important. Our role at the Fed is not to dictate fiscal policy but\nto use our academic and applied research, our outreach, and our convening powers to help\npolicymakers all across the country better understand how to deal with these challenges.\nHere at the Philadelphia Fed, we’ve launched the Economic Growth & Mobility Project, a multilevel\neffort to bring entrepreneurial solutions to achieve inclusive economic growth and create pathways out\nof poverty through the pillars of creating job opportunities, improving human capital, and addressing\nhousing and infrastructure needs.\nAs this crisis continues, we must redouble our efforts to redress some of the great underlying challenges\nto our society. Thank you very much for being a part of this extremely important conversation.\n3",

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nHighlighting the Labor Market’s New Complexities; Listening to Worker Voices\nNational Association for Business Economics (NABE)\nMonetary Policy and Outlook Webinar\nPhiladelphia, PA (virtual)\nJune 1, 2023\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood afternoon, everyone. It is a pleasure to join you in this series on monetary policy and our\neconomic outlook.\nAnd I thank NABE for the invite and Dr. Elaine Buckberg for moderating.\nYou heard from my colleague, Richmond Fed President and CEO Tom Barkin, on Tuesday, so I am\nhonored to provide a Fed bookend to this webinar.\nI look forward to having a useful and engaging dialogue. But please allow me to open with my thoughts\non the direction in which we are heading.\nAnd I must lead with the standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not\nnecessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or in the Federal\nReserve System.\nWhile headline PCE inflation has come down from its peak of 7 percent last year, it is still running at over\n4 percent year over year — way above the Fed’s long-run target of 2 percent annually. Disinflation is\nunder way, but it is doing so at a disappointingly slow pace.\nThis persistently high inflation comes with real costs for American families — cutting into purchasing\npower and household wealth. And the pain isn’t being felt equally.\n1\n\nThe toll is falling most heavily on those least able to bear it. I’m especially concerned about the elevated\ncosts of housing, food, and health care — life’s true necessities.\nTo combat this inflation, the Fed has been working to slow the economy modestly and bring demand\nmore in line with supply. We have increased the target range for the federal funds rate — our primary\nmonetary policy tool — by 500 basis points since March 2022. Ongoing balance sheet reduction is also\ntightening financial conditions.\nWe’re already seeing promising signs that these actions are working; for example, house price indexes\nare cooling.\nAnd it is encouraging that even as we have raised rates, the national economy remains relatively healthy\noverall. Since January, we’ve experienced modest growth in economic activity.\nThere are also still a record number of Americans employed, with more than 1 million jobs created, on\nnet, so far this year. While there are some signs that labor market tightness is beginning to ease a bit,\nthe unemployment rate remains near record lows — 3.4 percent in April.\nWe’re also paying close attention to the banking system. The recent failures of Silicon Valley Bank,\nSignature Bank, and First Republic ignited an understandable wave of anxiety among banks, depositors,\nand investors. But I can assure you that the U.S. banking system remains sound and resilient.\nWe know that problems in a few banks, if left unattended, can undermine confidence in healthy banks.\nThat’s why the Treasury, the FDIC, and the Fed acted quickly to protect the U.S. economy and its\nbanking interests. The Federal Reserve also led a thorough, transparent, and swift review of the events\nsurrounding Silicon Valley Bank so we could learn what went wrong.\nSo, of course, I know the question on everyone’s mind: OK, Pat, where do we go from here?\nThe Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate: to promote full employment and\nprice stability. On the jobs front, things look quite good; we are, effectively, at full employment. But\nwhen it comes to inflation, there is still significant room for improvement.\n2\n\nIt will take some time to evaluate how recent events may impact overall economic activity and inflation.\nI expect to see tighter credit conditions for households and businesses that may slow economic activity\nand hiring, but the full extent is still unclear.\nWhat is clear is that the Fed remains fully committed to return inflation to its 2 percent target. To do\nthis, the policy stance needs to be restrictive enough — but what is “enough” is not written in stone\nsomewhere.\nInstead, I am closely monitoring incoming data, listening to our contacts and audiences, and evaluating\neconomic conditions to assess whether additional tightening will be needed.\nI do believe that we are close to the point where we can hold rates in place and let monetary policy do\nits work to bring inflation back to the target in a timely manner.\nAlong this path, I project that we will see modest growth this year, with real GDP coming in a bit below 1\npercent.\nI expect inflation to decline to somewhere around 3.5 percent this year, before falling to 2.5 percent in\n2024, and leveling out at our 2 percent target in 2025. Unemployment is also likely to tick up slightly,\nhitting around 4.4 percent this year.\nBut this is just a snapshot of what conditions look like today. We’re operating in a very uncertain\nenvironment, and I will be closely monitoring our dashboards of economic indicators and assessing their\nimplications.\nNow, as I’ve said before, survey data are an important tool in the economic business. At the Fed, we\nlook at everything from big broad numbers like GDP and employment growth to more granular figures\nlike restaurant reservations and mobility data.\nThese data — hard data — tell us a lot. But even hard data have their limits. The numbers can point in a\ncertain direction, yet there may be a lot going on underneath those numbers, which is not as easily\nvisible but is just as vital to drawing a complete picture.\n3\n\nTake, for example, the employment picture.\nThroughout the past year, each interest rate hike was predictably followed by voices warning that we\nwere about to tank the labor market and spike unemployment. That hasn’t happened, but we monitor\nthese trends to see how workers will be impacted if it does.\nGiven the tight labor market, there’s obviously something deeper happening. We continually hear from\nsome employers that certain tools aren’t working as they once did. Simply offering higher wages still\nisn’t attracting the workers some need, and some efforts to increase the productivity of current workers\nis instead leading to increased turnover.\nThese cases are especially true at the lower end of the wage scale, and this may be why some have\ngroused that, “No one wants to work anymore.” But I think we all would agree there’s more going on\nunder the surface.\nNow, I’m not strictly an economist. I’m a civil engineer. And that background is what is forcing me to\nlook at this issue in a different way.\nAnd this is what we at the Philadelphia Fed are doing. And I’d like to spend a few moments on this\nbefore we get to our Q&A.\nOver the past year, our Community Development and Regional Outreach team, along with colleagues at\nthe Atlanta Fed and elsewhere, engaged with low-wage and non-degree-holding workers nationwide in\na series of focus group conversations.\nWe’ve been listening to them and to their reasons why they may have exited the labor market at the\nonset of the pandemic to reenter from an entirely different door on the other side of it or are quitting\njobs at such a high rate.\nWe’re calling this effort the Worker Voices Project. And we released our first report — “Shifting\nPerspectives and Expectations on Employment” — one week ago.\n4\n\nYes, workers want to be paid what they believe they are worth and bring to the table, but it’s not only\nabout wages. And, yes, they want to be somewhere they can be productive and contributing employees,\nbut not if they don’t believe their contributions are appreciated, let alone rewarded.\nWhat we increasingly heard is that workers want something that we, as economists and civil engineers,\ndon’t yet have a metric for: being treated with dignity.\nAs one participant told me recently, “Work is not the end-all, be-all.” Or, in the words of another,\n“We’re looking for a place where we belong.”\nThe factors going into the decisions of where to work, or whether to go in an entirely different direction,\nare increasingly complex. And these complexities may make us rethink what we thought we knew about\nlabor markets.\nI encourage everyone to take a look at our initial Worker Voices Project report.\nFor us as policymakers, soft data are perhaps equally important to get a full understanding of our\neconomic situation. And the soft data we’re getting through Worker Voices are what will help us chart a\ncourse for a strong and growing — but also a more inclusive — American economy.\nI know that’s a lot to start with, but I also know it’s what is going to lead us to a great conversation.\nAnd, Elaine, to that end, let’s get right to it.\n5",

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nFuture Monetary Landscape Is Being Painted by\nBoth Hard and Soft Data\nChartered Financial Analyst (CFA) Society Philadelphia’s 80th Anniversary Celebration\nPhiladelphia, PA\nOctober 19, 2023\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood evening.\nThank you, Floyd, for that welcome and introduction, and my thanks to you and to Executive Director\nPete Conners for putting together this evening’s program.\nI thank each of you as well for joining us this evening, given there is, shall we say, a competing event. I\nmust note that this is the second time in as many weeks in which Major League Baseball did not first\nconsult the Philadelphia Fed’s event calendar when making the Phillies’ playoff schedule. However,\nwhile I’m not particularly superstitious, when this happened last week, the Phillies won 10-2, so maybe\nthere’s something to this after all. But just in case, I’m wearing my Phillies tie.\nI also congratulate you for the reason we’re all here tonight — to celebrate the 80th anniversary of the\nCFA Society Philadelphia. Membership in an organization such as this isn’t just a good thing to have for\nthe networking opportunities or even for the chance to hear a Federal Reserve Bank president opine on\nmonetary policy. It’s also good for the industry and for your clients, as it puts confidence in your\ncommitment to them and their financial futures and in the high standards of governance espoused by\nthe CFA Society Philadelphia.\nNow, speaking of monetary policy, I plan on sharing my overall thoughts and insights on the economic\nlandscape before us — both nationally and in our region. Then, as Floyd said, we’ll get this podium out\nof the way and get to having a conversation where we can drill down on specific issues. And believe me,\nas much as I may enjoy standing up here, I much more enjoy engaging in direct conversation.\n1\n\nBut before we can get to any of this, there is one piece of business to which I must attend, and that is\nthe usual Federal Reserve disclaimer: The views I express this evening are my own and do not\nnecessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the\nFederal Reserve System.\nI’ve recently boiled this down to the following: Anything I say tonight is a simple matter of “Pat said,”\nnot “The Fed said.” So, let’s use that.\nAs you can imagine, the thing I get asked about most — whether by the press, audiences such as\nyourselves, or even my friends — is interest rates.\nSo, let me begin by painting my picture of the economic landscape with the following broad\nbrushstroke: Over the past several months, I have been clear in my view that, absent a stark turnabout\nin the data that I see and the on-the-ground testimonies of contacts that I hear, I believe that we are at\nthe point where we can hold rates where they are. And so far, economic and financial conditions are\nevolving roughly as I expected, though I am keeping a close eye on the latest data, which have come in a\ntad stronger than my baseline forecast.\nLet me roll back the clock a bit to 2022, when we started the pivot to a restrictive stance.\nIn a span of barely over a year, we not only did a lot, but we did it very fast. The policy rate went up by\nmore than 5 percentage points, reaching its highest level in more than two decades. We also turned\naround our balance sheet policy, and we turned it around fast.\nThe speed in which we worked then is also part of my argument for holding steady now. The workings of\nthe economy cannot be rushed, and we know there are lags, which mean that the full impacts of the\nhigher rates may not yet be fully absorbed. I heard this very clearly from my discussions with contacts\nacross the financial sector throughout the summer, as my viewpoint evolved to its current state.\n2\n\nAnother part of my argument can be summarized this way: Doing nothing is doing something. And I\nthink doing nothing at this moment equates to doing quite a lot. As long as policy rates remain\nrestrictive, we will keep steadily pressing down on inflation and bringing markets into better balance.\nAnd I further believe that a resolute, but patient, stance of monetary policy will allow us to achieve the\nsoft landing that we all wish for our economy.\nLook at the latest data on PCE inflation — it may have remained elevated in August at 3.5 percent year\nover year, but it is down 3 percentage points from this time last year. Even when the volatile aspects of\nenergy and food costs are stripped away to give us the core measure of PCE inflation that economists\nbelieve is a better harbinger of trends, we also see clear signs of progress. In fact, the August monthly\nreading was its smallest month-over-month increase since 2020.\nNow, that said, the available data for September have mostly come out stronger than I expected. The\nlatest on retail sales confirms that households retained spending power and did not seem shy to use it\nover the summer. A resilient consumer is not a problem. Indeed, perhaps the key tenet of a soft landing\nis that households get to adjust their plan for when and how it best serves them — as opposed to the\nkind of drastic, unavoidable adjustments that come with, say, suddenly losing their job.\nTruthfully, the momentum in consumer spending is a bit of a head-scratcher. Contacts talk of a more\ncautious, price-sensitive consumer. Major surveys also show a steady drop in consumer confidence since\nthe summer. But there could have been some specific factors at play over the summer that we have yet\nto fully parse out, or we could be right on a turning point, or perhaps the fundamentals are even\nstronger for households.\nWe simply do not know. But we know that we do not know, and I believe that we should proceed\naccordingly: with caution and patience.\nLet me be clear, though. Certainly, we are not going to tolerate a reacceleration in prices. I stand ready\nto revise my views and act accordingly if I see signs of reinflation. However, I am not going to overreact\nto normal month-to-month variability in the data.\n3\n\nAnd for all the fancy techniques, the best way to separate a signal from noise remains to average data\nover several months. Of course, to do so, you need several months of data to start with, which, in turn,\ndemands that, yes, we remain data dependent but patient and cautious with the data.\nAnd the data I do see, and all what I hear, point to a steady disinflation that is already under way and\nsustained, if slow. My projections have inflation dropping below 3 percent in 2024 and leveling out at\nour 2 percent target thereafter.\nOf course, there’s much more than just the policy rate at work here. There are numerous outside factors\nthat are working in parallel with it to further push down on inflation.\nFor those in this room, I don’t think I need to do much more than to point to the bond markets as a\nproof point. Certainly, the impacts of restrictive policy on bond prices across the yield curve are exerting\ntheir own pressures — and creating their own challenges along with it.\nAnd, of course, there are also the tighter overall credit conditions that have existed since the collapses\nof Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic several months ago. In speaking with contacts\nover the summer, I heard that even while activity slowed, credit quality did not lag overall. Business\nlending continued for many, though it was reported to me that many borrowers were focusing more on\nfinancing for their “must haves,” not their “like to haves.”\nThere are other pressures that must be considered, too. The continued turmoil in the labor market is\nlikely to similarly exert downward pressure on the economy — not just in the loss of overall economic\nactivity but in the immediate impact on consumer spending as striking workers go without their usual\nwages.\nThere’s also another elephant in this room, and that is the resumption of student loan payments. Again,\nwe do not yet know the full scope this will have on consumer spending and savings, but we know that\nwe do not know, so I am keeping a close eye on the matter.\nAnd finally, we cannot forget that events around the world, and the uncertainty they bring, can have a\nreal impact on our economy here at home. We are all watching, and in many cases praying about, the\n4\n\ntragic situation in Israel and the Middle East, stemming from those recent terrorist attacks. And there is\nstill Russia’s ongoing war against Ukraine. Those are just two examples.\nSo, taking this all together, the picture painted is one that, I believe, shows that allowing the policy rate\nto remain steady is the prudent position.\n“Well, Pat, that’s all well and good, but when are rates going to come down,” I hear you ask.\nI wish I had an answer for you, but at this moment, I don’t. My forecasts are based on what I know as of\nnow. And as time goes by, as adjustments are completed, as new data emerge, and as we gain\nadditional insight on the underlying trends, I may need to adjust my forecasts, and with them, my time\nframes. So, as inexact as the term “higher for longer” sounds and is, it’s the best way I have to answer\nthat question. Rates will need to stay high for a while.\nIt is not just the data that will signal to me when the time comes to adjust policy either way, but what I\nalso hear from contacts and through outreach.\nAnd I must note that while I really do not expect it, should inflation rebound, I would not hesitate to\nsupport further rate increases as our objective to return inflation to target is, simply, not negotiable.\nAgain, I say this with all the forecast data I have at this moment. And at this moment, I expect the\neconomy’s overall resilience to continue. Its underpinnings remain strong.\nFor starters, GDP growth has been outperforming estimates from earlier this year, and I do expect GDP\ngains to continue through the end of 2023, before pulling back slightly in 2024. But do not conflate a\nmore moderate rate of GDP growth as a contraction. I do not anticipate a recession.\nOn the jobs front, I anticipate unemployment to end the year at about 4 percent — which is just slightly\nabove where we are now — and to increase slowly over the next year to peak at around 4.5 percent,\nbefore heading back toward 4 percent in 2025.\n5\n\nThis path would put the unemployment figure in line with the natural rate of unemployment, or that\ntheoretical level where labor market conditions support stable 2 percent inflation.\nNow, this does not mean that I expect mass layoffs. I do not.\nFirst, we have seen months where the unemployment rate increased because more workers moved off\nthe sidelines and back into the labor force. I expect us to continue to have such months. And second, I\nhave to also balance the soft data I receive from my discussions with contacts — and many have related\nthat, given how hard they’ve worked to find the workers they currently have, they are doing all they can\nto hold onto them.\nThe economic indicators tracked by the Philadelphia Fed also give me reason to feel positive about the\npath forward.\nAmong our most closely watched indicators are the manufacturing and nonmanufacturing business\noutlook surveys conducted with firms throughout the Third District. The latest Manufacturing Business\nOutlook Survey came out this morning. Now, while firms in both of the most recent surveys noted\ndeclines in month-over-month activity, the six-month outlooks reported in each remained optimistic\noverall.\nIn addition, we also publish a monthly summary metric of economic activity: the State Coincident\nIndexes. And in each state in our region — Delaware, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania — the overall long-\nrange trend continues to be positive.\nSuch optimism is also borne out in some of the other hard data points we look at, including business\nformation. And here I would note, specifically, that the numbers of applications for high-propensity\nbusinesses — those expected to turn into firms with payroll — remain elevated across the board in the\nThird District when compared with prepandemic levels. And I also see the data showing that hotel\noccupancy rates, while not yet back to prepandemic levels, have continued to rebound.\nI do take these as promising signs.\n6\n\nOf course, there are areas in which we have some concern. And specifically, I’ll note the commercial real\nestate (CRE) sector. Office vacancy rates continue to be well above their prepandemic levels. Office\nspace net absorption rates in the Philadelphia region continue to be negative. I do have some anxiety\nthat last month’s transition of the Wanamaker Building into receivership isn’t going to be a one-off\nevent.\nAnd to be clear, to me, the issues surrounding CRE aren’t just about the investments in the buildings\nthemselves but also about the livelihoods of the businesses — especially the small businesses — which\nsurround them and which are simply not getting anywhere near the foot traffic they did just a few years\nago.\nNow, I really want to step away from this podium and get to our conversation. But before we do, let me\nto pose the following question, which has nagged at me for months now as I’ve taken in data and\nformulated my position on the future direction of monetary policy: What in the economy has\nfundamentally changed from, say, 2018 or 2019?\nIn 2018, inflation averaged 2 percent almost to the decimal point and was actually below target in 2019.\nUnemployment averaged below 4 percent for both years and was as low as 3.5 percent, while policy\nrates peaked below 2.5 percent.\nNow, I’m not saying that we’re going to be able to exactly replicate prepandemic economic conditions.\nBut the resilience of this economy is making me rethink some of the classic models.\nAnd that’s probably a good thing. After all, I’m not a classically trained economist — by education, I’m\nan engineer. And if you know anything about engineers, we’re always willing to challenge previous\nassumptions and to look outside the box.\nAnd if there’s something else about engineers, we’re also really good at judging the limits of a system,\nand I think I’ve just about hit my limit on my prepared remarks. I am eager to get to our conversation.\nSo, Floyd, why don’t we do away with this podium and get to it.\nBut one last thing: Go Phillies!\n7",

    "text": "FEBRUARY 27, 2025\nEconomic\nOutlook for\nDelaware and\nBeyond\n2025 Lyons Economic Forecast\nNewark, Delaware\nThe views expressed\nPatrick T. Harker today are my own and not\nnecessarily those of the\nFederal Reserve System or\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nthe Federal Open Market\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia Committee (FOMC).\n\nEconomic Outlook for Delaware and Beyond\n2025 Lyons Economic Forecast\nUniversity of Delaware\nNewark, DE\nFebruary 27, 2025\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood afternoon!\nI thank Lyons Companies, the Alfred Lerner School of Business and Economics, and all of today’s\norganizers and sponsors for making this annual event possible. And of course, I thank all of you for\nattending and being part of it. I took note that the first edition of this convening was held in 2006,\nwhich would make today the 20th annual event. So, I further offer my congratulations on this\nmilestone.\nI look forward to the discussion with Christian and Michael that will follow my remarks.\nI also cannot understate how much of a pleasure it is to once again be on campus at the University\nof Delaware. Serving as president of this institution holds a very special place in my personal and\nprofessional history as well as my heart. Throughout my tenure, I aspired to lead through the\nUniversity’s motto, “Knowledge is the light of the mind.”\nIn many ways, those words were the inspiration for us when the decision was made to purchase a\nshuttered automotive manufacturing facility and convert it into this space we find ourselves in\ntoday. Many a future career has been ignited here. The STAR Campus remains, to me, one of my\nproudest achievements.\nIf you find me to be more in a reminiscent mood today, there’s a reason. As you may know, at the\nend of June I will reach the Federal Reserve’s time and service limits as president and CEO of the\nPhiladelphia Fed. As I contemplate that retirement, it is giving me an opportunity to look back over\nthe course of my career.\nOr, quite possibly, it’s looking around my office at all the books, framed mementos, and\naccumulated knick-knacks that I need to find boxes for that is jogging me down memory lane!\nAlso, as today marks my last formal visit to the First State as president of the Philly Fed, I ask you\nfor one final time to listen to the Fed disclaimer: The views I express this afternoon are my own and\ndo not necessarily represent those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues\non the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nBefore I get to my economic outlook, allow me to again express my real appreciation in being\npresented with the James B. O’Neill Award for Excellence in Economic Education and\nEntrepreneurship. It truly is an honor.\n\nJim’s vision to equip teachers to better teach economics in their own classrooms has made\nprofound contributions to economic education for thousands of students in Delaware and around\nthe world. The Master of Arts in Economics and Entrepreneurship for Educators (MAEEE) program\nthat he created has prepared hundreds of teachers to be the nation’s economic education leaders.\nIn fact, economic education staff at many of the Reserve Banks, including in Philadelphia, and at\ncouncils and centers for economic education across the country have either graduated from the\nMAEEE program, been mentored by Jim, or otherwise been touched by his work. Jim’s commitment\nto equipping teachers to be the field’s force multipliers has ensured that generations of\nelementary, middle, and high school students have learned economics, personal finance, and\nentrepreneurship before they graduated.\nNone of the work I have ever undertaken, whether as a professor, a dean, a university president, or\nas president of the Philly Fed has ever been in the pursuit of earning some sort of award. To me,\nseeing students succeed, institutions succeed, the public succeed, and our society prosper\nthrough our work is enough.\nAdditionally, I know that I did not earn this award on my own. At every step and in every phase, I’ve\nbeen lucky to have numerous professionals around me upon whom I could rely to see our common\nvision come to fruition. This is true, especially, of my time here at UD as well as at the Philly Fed. I\ndidn’t wake up one morning and build the STAR Center — it took a tremendous team. And likewise,\nat the Philly Fed, I haven’t single-handedly done the work of producing the materials that are used\nin countless classrooms throughout the Third District to educate students on the Federal Reserve\nSystem and its role in our nation’s economy. Nor have I single-handedly maintained the Philly Fed’s\nexhibit that informs the thousands of individuals visiting our Bank.\nEducation may be an individual pursuit — and at times a lonely pursuit — but it pays societal\ndividends. I hope that is something we never lose sight of. So, again, I am honored and humbled to\nhave been named this year’s recipient, but I feel even more privileged to share this recognition with\nthose whose hard work made it possible.\nNow, allow me to change gears and move on to my economic outlook.\nAnd I will start with the issue that I know is very much top-of-mind: inflation. To be sure, while we\nhave certainly made progress in our work to get annual Personal Consumption Expenditure\ninflation — or PCE — back to our annual target of 2 percent, inflation remains elevated. And\nregardless of whether you’ve been following the news or been paying attention to prices at the\nstore, you also know that inflation is taking us, as monetary policymakers, on a bit of a bumpy ride.\nIn fact, over the shorter term of the last several months progress toward the 2 percent target has\nslowed.\nAnd that was even before January’s Consumer Price Index — the CPI — surprised us on the upside.\nBut, if you take a quick look at history, you’d see that January CPI inflation has surprised us on the\nupside more often than not — in fact, it has done so in nine of the past 10 Januarys. To repeat what\nI said at a conference last week, five days after the CPI’s release, my belief is that seasonal\nadjustments are struggling to keep up with a fast-changing economy. So, there is much more that\ncan be gleaned by looking at longer-term trends than there is at a specific moment in time.\n2\n\nBut what does this mean for monetary policy? Over the last four months of 2024, we reduced the\npolicy interest rate to its current range of 4.25 to 4.5 percent, and that is where it stands after our\ndecision during the year’s first FOMC meeting to hold steady. I believe this is the right call. The\npolicy rate remains restrictive enough to continue putting downward pressure on inflation over the\nlonger term, as we need it to, while not negatively impacting the rest of the economy. And the\ncaution I am taking is to look at all the data and not be moved to act, in either direction, based on\none report covering one month.\nIf you’ll allow me an oversimplified analogy, take the Eagles’ season. They opened a bumpy two\nand two, trading wins and losses across four weeks. But the team didn’t panic and stuck to its\ngame plan and let that play out over the entire season. And I’d say that ended rather successfully,\neven if it gave us fans some moments of stress.\nSo, that said, I am taking a similar posture when it comes to monetary policy. In other words, let’s\nstick to the game plan.\nNow, certainly, there are outside factors that are throwing in some uncertainty, including changing\npolicies in Washington or elsewhere around the world that may have an impact on inflation\ndynamics. There are also situations such as the bird flu epidemic which is decimating egg\nproduction and leading to higher prices on the shelves — and I don’t think I need to point out the\nimportance of poultry to Delaware’s economy.\nBut this is why we watch the data and then react, if we must. Again, I am of a position that we let\nmonetary policy continue to work, for a couple of reasons.\nFirst, labor markets have largely returned to balance and the economy is creating jobs at roughly\nthe rate it was in the months and years immediately prior to the pandemic. Yes, the number of\nmonthly new jobs is lower than what we had seen through much of the past four years, but I would\nnot confuse “deceleration” with “decline.” We came out of the pandemic in a full sprint, a pace\nwhich was unsustainable over the long run. We’re now settling into a solid pace — we haven’t\nstopped and we’re certainly not moving backward.\nWe’re seeing this right here in Delaware, where the unemployment rate sits about where it was\nprior to the pandemic. Payroll employment continues to move in a positive direction, though at a\nslower rate than it was previously, and unemployment claims remain low.\nSecond, GDP growth, while moderating, likewise remains in growth territory. Consumer spending\nover the longer term has remained positive, buoying GDP, though it does present some concerns.\nWhether they advance beyond concerns is yet to be seen. But my concern, nonetheless, rests in\ncredit cards, which is a significant industry here in Delaware. The data we have at the Philly Fed\ntells us that more than one in 10 credit card accounts are currently only being maintained through\nbalance-holders making only the minimum monthly payments.\nThis is not necessarily a flashing red light to me, but a yellow one. Not every minimum payment is a\nprecursor of a missed payment. Not every account is destined to fall into delinquency. Some\nconsumers, surely, will cure their accounts and clear their balances. But the data clearly tell us\n3\n\nthat many consumers are under stress in managing their finances in the midst of higher-than-target\ninflation. So, this is a space worth keeping an eye on, and I will. Closely.\nAll in all, given those reasons, I see an American economy that entered 2025 in a position of relative\nhealth and strength despite inflation being above target. And I believe the same holds true, too, for\nDelaware’s economy.\nI mentioned the employment picture a moment ago. But overall business conditions as measured\nby the Philadelphia Fed’s State Coincident Indexes, a summary metric of economic activity,\ncontinues to signal green. Delaware’s Coincident Index increased 3.1 percent throughout 2024,\nabove the US average of 2.7 percent, and well above the other states of the Third District — New\nJersey was at 2.3 percent and Pennsylvania was at 2 percent.\nMoreover, new business applications in Delaware remain at a high level, averaging nearly 5,000 per\nmonth as of December’s numbers. Leading up to the pandemic, this number was about 2,000 per\nmonth.\nBefore my FOMC colleagues and I return to Washington in mid-March for our next meeting, we will\nreceive an additional unemployment report, plus two inflation reports — one each of both PCE and\nCPI — among a host of other economic data. I will certainly be looking for any emerging trends and I\nwill certainly do what I can to block out any noise, or at least to ascertain where it’s coming from.\nBut, again, from the macro view, the data I currently see allows me to provide an economic outlook\nthat is optimistic, despite the ongoing challenge of getting inflation back to target.\nYet the data also helps me to understand why, on the micro level, not every American family or\nbusiness may be feeling similar optimism. They feel inflation, and they feel it in very real terms.\nMany see housing prices which remain out of reach — and I’d note here that Delaware, as a whole,\nis struggling with home affordability as measured by the Atlanta Fed’s Home Ownership\nAffordability Monitor.\nSo, as policymakers, we still have much work to do. And even though my time is limited — just\nslightly more than 120 days — I am going to remain committed to the task ahead until my\nretirement. And, moreover, I know the Philly Fed staff to whom I turn for guidance will be keeping to\nthe task, too.\nBut we certainly cannot do it alone. Yes, the hard data we take in on a regular basis tells us a lot\nabout the state of the economy. But those numbers are so often presented in stark black and\nwhite. And the world is not drawn in black and white.\nFor the past near-decade, I have relied on contacts up, down, and across the Third District to\nprovide me and my team with the soft data that turns the black and white into living color. In some\nway, every conversation I or someone else at the Philly Fed has with you or your colleagues helps to\nfill in those empty corners.\nThrough you, we have been able to get a much more vibrant picture of economic conditions across\nnot just Delaware, but also Southern New Jersey and Eastern and Central Pennsylvania. What’s\nimportant about that is that we are the smallest Federal Reserve District by area, which means that\n4\n\nan economic happening in one corner of the Third District may not be an independent event but\ncan have a ripple effect all the way to the other corner.\nYour reports on conditions as you see them have allowed us to track those ripples from the\nmoment they are first felt so we can work accordingly for the benefit of the entire District.\nI cannot thank you enough for your insights. I cannot thank you enough for never being shy about\nyour thoughts and opinions. I cannot thank you enough for the way in which you have always\nwelcomed me and others from the Philly Fed into your communities for in-depth discussions on\nwhat you’re seeing, what you’re hearing, and what you think we need to take a look at, too.\nThese insights aren’t just invaluable to us at the Philly Fed, but I take them directly to the FOMC\nconference table, too.\nI think here is where I’ll wind down my prepared remarks and take my seat with Christian and\nMichael for our discussion.\nSo, once again, thank you for inviting me to be part of this annual event.\nBut, even more so, thank you again for all that Delaware has meant to me over the past 18 years.\nThere’s always going to be a part of me that is a fightin' Blue Hen.\n5",

    "text": "Trade and Training\nEuropean Economics and\nFinancial Centre\nLondon, United Kingdom\nJune 27, 2017\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nTrade and Training\nEuropean Economics and Financial Centre\nLondon, United Kingdom\nJune 27, 2017\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood afternoon and thank you. It’s a pleasure to be in London and a special pleasure to be\nstanding in the truly beautiful Palace of Westminster.\nPeople generally invite a Fed president to speak about the U.S. economy, and I certainly plan to\noblige. So today, I’d like to start with an outlook and discussion of my view of the path of\nmonetary policy. But I’d also like to address something that binds not just our two countries but\nnations across the globe: international trade.\nI’m standing in a building that is steeped in history and tradition, from Black Rod and the\nQueen’s Speech to the dragging of the Speaker in the House of Commons. So, I feel a need to\nhonor that tradition by sharing one of our own. And while our history is obviously shorter in\nterm than yours, this is nonetheless a time-honored Fed custom: the standard disclaimer that the\nviews I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the\nFederal Reserve System including my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC).\nU.S. Outlook\nWith that, I’ll start off with a snapshot of the American economy.\nGrowth for 2017 so far is more or less what we expected. The first quarter was relatively weak,\nwhich has been the case for first quarters over the past several years. That’s what we’ve come to\nexpect at this point, so it’s not cause for alarm. This year’s 1.2 percent Q1 growth was influenced\nby factors I believe are transient, like weather, seasonality, and low inventory investment. I\n1\n\nexpect second quarter growth to rebound and overall GDP growth for 2017 to average about 2.3\npercent.\nI’m aware of the pitfalls of economic forecasting — I believe the old maxim is that economists\nare people who will know tomorrow why the things they predicted yesterday didn’t happen\ntoday. But I’ll tempt fate by saying that I predict growth of just above 2 percent for 2018 and\n2019. That’s assuming that things unfold the way they have been. And if things do continue on\ntheir current path, that’s frankly the rate of growth we should consider normal in the U.S.\nInflation has been a hot topic of conversation recently. The latest PCE numbers are from April,\nwhich show a downtick in both headline and core inflation, to 1.7 and 1.5 percent year-on-year,\nrespectively. That was the second report in a row that had PCE heading in the wrong direction.\nCoupled with the most recent CPI data for May, which makes for the third of those reports to\ntrend downward, it’s prompted a lot of questions for Fed policymakers. Will soft inflation data\nderail our normalization plans?\nI make this point frequently, but policymakers are wont to be repetitive, so I’ll make it again. It’s\na mistake to get caught up in a single decimal point, report, or even a quarter’s worth of data.\nThe importance lies in underlying trends, and, in the case of inflation, I’ve seen the factors\nexerting downward pressure as temporary. That said, the Fed is data dependent, and, as\ninformation comes in, there’s the possibility that those transitory factors may be less transitory\nthan we thought.\nFor the meantime, therefore, I’m sticking to my outlook that we’re on the right path, but I’m\nadjusting my view slightly on meeting our inflation goal from the end of 2017 to the beginning\nof 2018. This is the advanced economic practice of “hedging one’s bets.”\nAs for the labor market, I see very little slack left. The most recent data show an unemployment\nrate of 4.3 percent, the lowest the U.S. has seen in 16 years. That’s either at or below the natural\nrate and reflects a steady tightening over the course of the expansion. I see that rate edging down\neven further over the course of the next couple of years before moving a few tenths of a\npercentage point back up again.\n2\n\nJob creation remains strong, and you can see clearly in the JOLTS data that openings and quits\ncontinue to indicate a fairly tight market. I think we’ll see an average of about 190,000 jobs a\nmonth for this year, which should fall to about 100,000 jobs a month by the end of 2019. Many\nheadlines and commentators have responded to any month of job creation below 200,000 with, in\nmy opinion, overreaction; much of the narrative around May’s 138,000 number was anguished.\nBut it was a good number for where we are right now. As we move forward on a downward glide\npath over the next couple of years, eventually reaching a pace of about 100,000 jobs a month, we\nshould remember: That’s going to be more than adequate to keep pace with population growth.\nAn area I have been hoping to see more improvement in is wage growth, and we’re finally\nstarting to see some upward pressure. I see wage growth of about 2.5 to 3 percent this year,\nwhich is very welcome.\nBased on the strength of the economy, therefore, I still support the continued gradual removal of\naccommodation.\nI still see another rate hike as appropriate for 2017, having already implemented two this year.\nAnd we’ve recently announced the plan to unwind our $4.5 trillion balance sheet. We debated a\nnumber of options but ultimately decided on a reduction of reinvestment in both Treasuries and\nmortgage-backed securities. It will start off slowly, build gradual momentum, and begin\nsometime this year — though I don’t want to tie that to a date in the calendar or a rung on the\ninflation ladder. It will be predictable to the point of boredom; we will communicate our\nintentions clearly, with a good amount of lead time; and once the process commences, it will be\nessentially on autopilot.\nThe caveat, of course, is that this is dependent on things continuing to unfold as they have been.\nTo adopt an adage from my host country this evening, policymakers agree with Macmillan on\nwhat we’re wary of: “Events, dear boy, events.”\nThose events can take many forms, and, in the years following the financial crisis and\nsubsequent recession in most of the world, we were reminded that sometimes they come from\noutside our own borders. I’m aware that the U.S. in some cases is more resilient; we’re the ones\nwho give the world the proverbial cold when we sneeze. But we’re not immune. All our\n3\n\neconomies have become more and more intertwined, and the discussion of national economics is\nnow also a discussion of global economics.\nTrade Gains: The Classics\nThe fact is that all advanced economies rely on trade. It makes simple economic sense for\nnations to use their comparative advantages, focusing on goods that are relatively cheap for them\nto produce and importing those that are relatively expensive to make at home. International trade\nallows countries to focus on what they’re good at, rather than spending valuable time and\nresources attempting to produce every good they need.1 International trade also addresses\ncyclical ups and downs, letting countries borrow in the lean times and build nest eggs in the\nboom ones.\nMore importantly, many countries would fail to be completely self-sustaining, owing to the\nsimple limitations of natural and other resources. But even a country like the United States,\nwhich covers enough diverse territory with multiple resources to source most of what we need,\nrelies on trade, because our economy depends on selling to our partners.\nThen there is the overwhelming body of work arguing that trade fosters peace and cooperation. I\ndon’t believe I’m allowed to deliver a speech in the United Kingdom without mentioning the\ngreat Adam Smith, so here’s my reference: From Adam Smith’s view of mutually beneficial\ntrade relationships fostering harmony to Bastiat’s positing that trading nations will avoid war\nwith one another, the idea that peace is wrought by intertwined economic fortunes is a well-\nestablished principle of economic thought.\nThe Production Chain Conundrum\nThat, however, is the philosophical, borne out by data as it may be. From the practical side, there\nis the reality that many supply chains have become as intertwined as global economies. Products\nwhose provenance is a single country no longer make up the entirety of trade. A tractor, for\ninstance, may be made out of raw materials shipped from Asia to South America for processing,\n1 David Ricardo, On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation. John Murray, Albemarle-Street (1817),\nprint.\n4\n\nthen to North America to make the frame, then back to South America for finishing touches, then\nback to North America for sale, some domestically and some via the export market.\nWhile this is an extensive chain of custody for any one product, it’s generally done for\nefficiency’s sake, utilizing countries’ expertise and saving businesses money while delivering\nquality.2 It makes sense and benefits all parties involved.\nBut this kind of global production is particularly sensitive to trade protection because every time\nthat tractor’s parts cross a border, they face a potential tariff.\nHere I will tread with extreme caution — I’m not in the business of dispensing advice to other\npolicymakers, and I’m definitely not weighing in on trade policy for the U.S. or any other nation.\nFrom a purely economic perspective, however, our economies have become too integrated with\none another to turn back. Trade on this level is unlikely to disappear — on the contrary, it’s\nlikely to increase — and that means even modest tariffs, if they are applied several times over to\nthe same production chain, would be enough to disrupt a host of industries.\nTrade’s Influence on Growth and Income\nThat would be a disservice to everyone, because trade is a net positive both on a national and\nindividual level. Research shows that a 10 percent increase in trade is associated with a 5 percent\nincrease in income per capita.3 Likewise, doubling a country’s trade share can lead to an increase\nin GDP of an estimated 25 percent over the span of a decade.\nHistory chronicles trade’s effects. Economic development from 1800 to 1980 saw a steady rise in\nglobal inequality precisely because only developed economies were open to trade. When\npreviously closed economies subsequently opened up, the trend was reversed.4 China is just one\n2 David Hummels, Jun Ishii, and Kei-Mu Yi, “The Nature and Growth of Vertical Specialization in World\nTrade,” Journal of International Economics, 54:1 (June 2001), pp. 75–96.\n3 James Feyrer, “Trade and Income — Exploiting Time Series in Geography,” National Bureau of Economic\nResearch Working Paper 14910 (2009).\n4 David Dollar and Aart Kraay, “Trade, Growth, and Poverty,” Economic Journal, 114:493 (February 2004),\npp. F22–F49.\n5\n\n— but perhaps the most discussed — example of how trade can rapidly reverse economic fates.\nKorea is another example, as are, increasingly, Vietnam and the Philippines.\nUltimately, international trade has helped mitigate global poverty: Although the world’s\npopulation grew by 1.6 billion between 1980 and 2000, the number of people living in extreme\npoverty actually declined by up to 200 million.5 While trade can’t take all the credit for that shift,\nit certainly played a role.6\nHarm over Help?\nIf trade’s benefits are so overwhelmingly positive, why has there been such animosity toward it?\nI think there are two reasons: First, there are common myths attached to trade and its effects.\nSecond, there are, in fact, losers in the trade game, which is something we should take seriously.\nOne of the arguments against trade is the belief that low-wage countries unfairly compete against\nmature economies. Some believe this delivers the double blow of taking jobs away from\ndeveloped countries while simultaneously allowing advanced economies to exploit their less\ndeveloped counterparts.\nA more accurate depiction is that low wages go hand in hand with lower productivity, meaning\nless developed economies do not, on the whole, have an edge. Additionally, as trade in these\ngoods shifts, it frees up resources in more developed economies, letting them concentrate on\nmore specialized goods made by skilled workers, who, in turn, earn higher wages.\nAs for lower wage countries, the simple math is that, without trade, those wages would be even\nlower.\nThe Costs of Trade\nThat said, there are people who feel the downside of global trade more acutely than others.\n5 “Poverty,” World Bank, n.d., http://data.worldbank.org/topic/poverty (accessed September 27, 2016).\n6 Matthias Busse and Jens Koeniger, “Trade and Economic Growth: A Re-examination of the Empirical\nEvidence,” Economics Bulletin, 35:4, (2015), pp. 2862–2876.\n6\n\nTrade, on the whole, is a benefit. It makes products cheaper, including necessities like food, and\ncountries tend to reap the rewards on a macro level.\nBut the many who benefit don’t do so in a life-altering way; we aren’t moved by a price change\nof a few dollars or cents in our everyday purchases. In the case of the United States, the\nrelatively abundant supply of skilled workers benefit, while the unskilled portion of the labor\nforce can, in fact, lose out to competition from abroad.\nThe rewards are reaped in breadth, spread among the 320-plus million people who live in the\nU.S. Those who suffer, however, do so on a profound level. Entire industries and the populations\nthat depend on them are affected. Those effects are big and are taken on by a small number of\npeople, increasing their burden.\nThere are a lot of reasons jobs in certain sectors have disappeared. Automation, changes in\nmarket preferences, and other factors have contributed to industry shifts. So, while trade does\nhave real effects for some workers, much of the debate is muddied by the multiple contributors.\nSo, what can we do to help the people who’ve been negatively affected?\nA Skilled Workforce\nAgain, there isn’t much that can be done to stop the trade train. The natural state of the human\ncondition is to search for not just subsistence but for substance, and opening the door to trade\ngenerally makes things better, faster, and more affordable.\nBut we have to do something to help those who are displaced or disadvantaged. This is\nsomething of a conundrum with a labor market with so little slack left. We’ve reached a point\nwhere the competition is among employers vying for candidates rather than applicants vying for\njobs. While there’s some debate on the subject of the skills mismatch, research by my staff\nshows this is absolutely an issue. And while I know that the plural of “anecdote” isn’t “data,” it’s\ndefinitely something I’m hearing from the business community across my District. A\nbusinessman I know has doubled the bays for his trucking repair business to keep up with\ndemand, but half of them are empty because he can’t find qualified mechanics. He’s paying\nsalaries of over $100,000 a year, but he can’t fill the jobs. That’s because trucking repair doesn’t\n7\n\njust involve basic maintenance anymore; it requires digital skills. It reflects what we’re\nconsistently seeing: There are jobs but not enough people with the right training.\nI’m using examples from my District, but we’re seeing examples across the country. I should\nnote that the Federal Reserve System is made up of 12 regional Banks in Districts across the\ncountry, along with the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C. My District is the smallest,\ncomprising about two-thirds of Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey, and all of Delaware. In total,\nthat’s a little less than half of the United Kingdom.7 So, small for the U.S., but not insignificant\nby any means. And it’s made up of multiple and diverse economies from postindustrial to rural,\nurban to suburban.\nOne solution to the skills gap is obviously training programs and more investment in practical\neducation. My staff recently completed a guide to apprenticeships in our area to provide private\nsector organizations with information on how they can get involved. This is a good start, and the\nmore research and data the better. But there also needs to be a cultural shift. At some point,\nvocational education took on a negative connotation, and that’s a problem. Education shouldn’t\nbe one-size-fits-all. Not everyone wants or needs — or frankly should — take the traditional\nuniversity route.\nMore research by my staff identified what they’re calling “opportunity occupations,” jobs that\npay at or above the median wage but don’t require a traditional four-year degree. If we can be\nmore strategic about the way we train our rising and existing workforce, we can benefit both\nworkers and employers.\nWe can’t guarantee that every industry will be immune to whatever creative destruction comes\nits way. But we can instill a culture that prizes training and is therefore better able to adapt to\nchange.\nAgain, I’m not telling anyone how to legislate. My only job is to offer data and economic reality.\n7 Robert Feenstra and Gordon Hanson, “Global Production Sharing and Rising Inequality: A Survey of Trade and\nWages,” National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper 8372 (2001).\n8\n\nThat reality is that trade is not a zero sum game; a win for one country is not a loss for another.\nRather, it is a contribution to a global market that ebbs and flows in an overall benefit to\neveryone.\nAnd international trade is an overall positive. There is nothing in this world that is without risks,\nand no progress comes without paradigm shifts. But we have it in our power to take those shifts\nand turn them to our advantage by thinking of new — and reprising old — ways of adapting to\nchange.\nThank you.\n9",

    "text": "On Balance: All Things Considered\non the Road to Normal\nOfficial Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum\nFrankfurt, Germany\nMarch 26, 2019\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nOn Balance: All Things Considered on the Road to Normal\nOfficial Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum\nFrankfurt, Germany\nMarch 26, 2019\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nNote: President Harker presented similar remarks on March 25, 2019, at the OMFIF meeting in\nLondon.\nGuten Tag und danke. It’s a pleasure to be in Frankfurt. Since that greeting all but exhausted my\nGerman vocabulary, I’ll turn to something I’m more fluent in: policyspeak. I promise to pepper\nit with some actual English.\nI’ll start with a brief economic outlook, then turn to a topic that has garnered a surprising\namount of attention in recent months: the Fed’s balance sheet. It is a subject rife with awkward\neconomic phrasing, but an important one nonetheless, so I hope you’ll bear with me.\nBefore we get to that, however, a bit of verbiage required of all Fed policymakers and easily\ntranslatable: the standard disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and do not\nnecessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\nOutlook\nWith that out of the way, the promised outlook, which is, overall, pretty good.\nStarting with GDP, I see growth a bit above 2 percent for this year, returning to trend of around\n2 percent sometime in 2020. That reflects structural, slow-moving forces — like demographics,\nmuted growth in the labor force, and lower productivity growth — rather than any temporary\nheadwind.\n1\n\nPCE remains the primary driver of real GDP growth, and household spending continues at a\nstrong, sustained pace. Businesses, however, have reported an increase in uncertainty and a\ndecrease in confidence. Coupled with tighter financial conditions, the investment outlook is not\nquite as rosy as last year. It’s certainly not dire, but the specter of uncertainty does cast a\nshadow, and the ambiguity of the current climate appears to be having a dampening effect.\nI am also monitoring international influences, including the outlook for growth abroad and\ntrade developments.\nFor the U.S. overall, I would say that, on balance, the potential risks tilt very slightly to the\ndownside, but I emphasize the word “slight.” I still see the outlook as positive, and the\neconomy continues to grow in what is on pace to be the longest economic expansion in our\nhistory.\nWe are also seeing continued strength in the labor market, with employment data continuing\nto show remarkable health — so much in fact, that it has surprised many of us. While there was\nwidespread despairing over the February jobs report, I’d caution against getting caught up in a\nsingle data point. The medium term is what’s important, and over the past six months, we have\ncreated an average of 190,000 jobs a month.\nInflation is running around our preferred 2 percent target and, importantly, does not appear to\nbe on a strong upward trajectory. If anything, it’s edging slightly downward.\nBased on these combined conditions, I continue to be in wait-and-see mode. My current view is\nthat, at most, one rate hike this year, and one in 2020, is appropriate, and my stance will be\nguided by data as they come in and events as they unfold.\nThe Fed’s Balance Sheet — A Brief History and Where Things Stand Today\nBefore I head into the particulars of the balance sheet, I’d like to add some context, with a\nquick reminder of how we arrived here, and what, exactly, “here” is.\nIn response to the financial crisis and its aftermath, central banks around the globe took a\nnumber of policy initiatives. Unlike many others, the Federal Reserve did not enter into a\n2\n\nregime of negative rates. Instead, we lowered the federal funds rate to essentially zero, and\nfollowed it with several rounds of quantitative easing.\nAs its more technical name — large-scale asset purchases — indicates, QE involved buying large\namounts of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities, swelling the Fed’s balance sheet to\napproximately $4.5 trillion — about five times its size before the onset of the crisis.\nThe last of the purchase programs ended in late 2014. At that point, the outlook for the U.S.\neconomy had improved markedly and the Committee started to think about raising the federal\nfunds rate, which was still essentially at zero. At the same time, they decided to keep the\noverall size of the balance sheet constant, reinvesting the proceedings as our asset holdings\nreached maturity.\nIn October of 2017, it was time for the balance sheet to start its journey back to normal. We\nbegan by reinvesting only some of the principal payments from our Treasury and MBS\nsecurities, and the balance sheet decreased by the amounts not reinvested. In other words, we\nlet our assets run off at a gradual and predictable pace. Steady as that pace may be, however,\nwe’ve already reduced our securities holdings by close to half a trillion dollars.\nOn the other side of the balance sheet, the aggregate level of reserves currently stands at\nroughly $1.6 trillion. That’s $1.2 trillion less than the peak of $2.8 trillion, back in 2014, and\nclose to $600 billion less than when we started unwinding. Reserves declined by more than our\nasset redemptions due to the growth of non-reserve liabilities, mostly currency.\nWe noted at the time that the unwinding would be essentially on autopilot and spectacularly\nboring — though we were clear about our intent to keep an eye on things. Along the way, we\nhave communicated our plans and principles regarding the normalization process. And from the\nvery beginning, we made it clear that we intended to hold “no more securities than necessary\nto implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively.”\nAs the balance sheet runoff unfolded, we rapidly approached the beginning of the end. Last\nNovember, we resumed our discussions of the Committee’s plans to implement monetary\npolicy over the longer run.\n3\n\nStaff from across the Federal Reserve System presented excellent work on an array of options.\nAfter careful consideration, we agreed that the current implementation framework has served\nus very well. Our administered rates have proven effective at controlling short-term interest\nrates. This allows us to continue using changes in the target range of the fed funds rate as the\nprimary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy. In January, therefore, we\ncommunicated our intention to maintain an “ample supply of reserves” that ensures control\nover the federal funds rate via our administered rates, without necessitating active\nmanagement of the supply of reserves.\nTransition to the Long-Run Framework\nToday, we’re in a very good place. We know what we want the long-run framework to look like;\nwe know that we’re getting closer every day; and we know that we’re not far from the efficient\nlevel of reserves. In the last meeting, therefore, we decided on one more step in the transition\nto the long-run framework.\nIn short, we intend to end the balance sheet runoff in September, resuming the reinvestment\nof all principal payments. Paydowns from MBS, capped at $20 billion per month, will be\nreinvested into Treasuries, which is consistent with our long-standing plans to hold primarily\nTreasuries in our portfolio.\nBut we are not quite done normalizing yet. We don’t just want an ample supply of reserves, we\nwant “no more than necessary.” In September, when the runoff ends, reserves will likely still be\nsomewhat above the level needed to efficiently and effectively implement monetary policy.\nA key issue is that we only have estimates of the demand for reserves, and we certainly don’t\nhave the luxury of a tensile test — breaking points in engineering and economics are very\ndifferent animals. We should therefore approach the “efficient and effective” level of reserves\nwith caution.\nWe intend to do that by keeping the size of our aggregate securities holdings constant for a\ntime. During this period, we will see a very — and I do stress “very” — gradual decrease in\naverage reserves, as currency and other non-reserve liabilities grow over time.\n4\n\nThis slow and steady approach, which is based on work by the Philadelphia1 staff, is not only\nthe safer option, it has the additional advantage of reducing uncertainty about the evolution of\nasset redemptions. It is, therefore, firmly in line with the FOMC’s stated objective to proceed in\na “gradual and predictable manner.”\nAs reserves continue to decline, they will eventually reach their efficient and effective level,\nwhich prompts the question: Will that be the end point for normalization? Not quite. While the\nbalance sheet will indeed hold no more securities than necessary, they will likely not be the\nsecurities we want to hold in the long run.\nA Matter of Principle(s)\nAs laid out in the Normalization Plans and Principles, our aim is for the balance sheet to consist\nprimarily of Treasury securities. That is not its current composition, and won’t be for some\ntime, with MBS still accounting for 40 percent of our total asset holdings. Additionally, the\nremaining maturity of our Treasury holdings is still relatively long — about two years longer\nthan the average maturity of outstanding Treasury securities.\nThat means, of course, that we still have some normalizing to do. The conversation will\nnaturally revolve around the long-run composition the FOMC wants to achieve. However, it’s\nimportant to note that “long run” does mean “long run” — this is a marathon, not a sprint.\nEven if economic and financial conditions evolve as anticipated, the composition of the balance\nsheet will not see any drastic change in the near future. And, as noted in January, the\nCommittee is prepared to alter the size and composition of the balance sheet if future\neconomic conditions warrant more accommodative policy than can be achieved by reductions\nin the federal funds rate alone.\nIt is my own view, therefore, that the discussion should give primacy to principles over goals,\nboth in guiding the long-run composition of the portfolio and its management along the\ntransition.\n1 I would like to thank Roc Armenter for his research and insight.\n5\n\nIt’s something of a crutch in speechmaking to rely on quotes from the good and the great who\ncame before us. So I ask your forgiveness as I fall into exactly that trap, and invoke an oft-cited\nline from FDR, that rules aren’t necessarily sacred, principles are.\nAmong those principles that should be granted sanctity in the debate are neutrality and\nflexibility, which had formed the basis of balance sheet management prior to the crisis.\nNeutrality should function as something of a Hippocratic Oath where market functioning is\nconcerned, vowing to “do no harm.” Our Treasury holdings should, in principle, avoid cornering\nthe market on any particular security. One option might be to simply match the maturity\ndistribution of outstanding Treasuries, which would evenly distribute our footprint across\nmaturities. We should also be mindful that recently issued Treasuries, deemed “on the run,”\nare vital for a well-functioning market. We should consider, therefore, how evenly acquisitions\nare spread at the Treasury primary auction.\nTurning to the principle of flexibility, in my view the asset portfolio should ideally allow us to\nquickly and safely deploy an array of balance sheet policies if necessary — again, this would\nonly transpire if economic conditions warranted more accommodation than the federal funds\nrate alone can provide. This is where an asset portfolio with a somewhat shorter duration offers\nan advantage: The shorter the duration of the portfolio, the larger the flow of maturing\nproceeds at any given time. That flow can be redirected, allowing for a swift change in the\ncomposition without expanding the balance sheet or having to sell assets outright. A simple\nway to ensure that the balance sheet delivers a steady flow of maturing proceeds is to increase\nTreasury holdings, which have a maturity of a year or less.\nThis approach — that is, extending the duration of our Treasury securities without expanding\nthe balance sheet — was the basis of the Maturity Extension Program, or Operation Twist, as it\nwas sometimes known, in 2011.\nWhile I believe that neutrality and flexibility should be our core guidelines, I should stress that\nthey are not the only factors to consider, and I look forward to discussions with my FOMC\ncolleagues and staff across the Federal Reserve System.\n6\n\nFinally, I want to note that balance sheet normalization has received a lot of attention both in\nour meetings and communications, and will continue to do so. While that does reflect its\nimportance, it does not reflect our current monetary policy stance. We often refer to the\nFOMC’s “toolkit” when discussing policy options. Balance sheet policy certainly remains an\noption, but we’ve put it back in the toolbox, and stored it in the basement — within arm’s\nreach, but out of sight for now.\nConclusion\nUltimately, I end where I started: Things are looking pretty good. The fundamentals of the U.S.\neconomy are strong, and we’re on the path to normal. There will be many more discussions as\nthings unfold — heavily laden with policyspeak, in all likelihood, but important nonetheless.\n7",

    "text": "Economic Outlook Amid COVID-19\nChicago Council on Global Affairs\nChicago, IL (via Zoom)\nMay 7, 2020\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nEconomic Outlook Amid COVID-19\nChicago Council on Global Affairs\nChicago, IL (via Zoom)\nMay 7, 2020\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood afternoon. Thank you for having me here today … in some form …\nBefore we begin, let me dispense with the usual Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own\nand do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or in the\nFederal Reserve System.\nIt’s no secret that we find ourselves in the midst of a crisis like none of us have experienced in our\nlifetimes. The coronavirus that arrived on our shores just a few months ago has already killed tens of\nthousands of Americans, ended a years-long streak of solid economic growth, and caused tens of\nmillions of our fellow citizens to lose their jobs.\nIt’s amazing to think how different my remarks would have been had I given them just two months ago.\nAppreciation for the Frontline Workers\nThe coronavirus is above all a public health crisis and the Federal Reserve as an institution — and me\npersonally — can’t say enough to adequately convey our gratitude toward America’s health-care\nworkers, as well as other frontline workers like police, grocery-store workers, truck drivers, and\ninnumerable others who are risking their own health for the well-being of the country.\nThe economic ramifications of this crisis, of course, have been stark as well.\nPerhaps most notable has been a collapse in most forms of consumer spending, a component of GDP\nthat accounts for about 70 percent of our country’s economic activity.\nIn March, we experienced a literally unprecedented 7.5 percent fall in consumer spending, and April\ndata will surely be even worse. In the same month, manufacturing output fell to levels not seen since\n2011. And data from the Institute for Supply Management showed a stark contraction for April as well.\n1\n\nIt’s notable that this diminution, particularly on the consumer side, was observable even before states\ntook serious action to curtail the spread of the virus. That strongly suggests that the coronavirus itself,\nand not just government policies designed to mitigate it, are harming the economy.\nBefore states and cities started imposing lockdowns and shutting down businesses they deemed\nnonessential, data show the cutbacks in spending: Airline bookings were collapsing and foot traffic into\nrestaurants had already begun a steep decline, to name just a few examples of weakening consumption\ndemand in some categories of goods and services. Consumers were voting with their feet — or at least\nwith their wallets.\nEven my presence here by Zoom is evidence that it isn’t only government mandates that have slowed\nthe economy. It was a decision we took ourselves, to stay home and to stay safe.\nThe point is this: Until the virus itself is under control, even as more states gradually open up, we can\nexpect the economy to underperform relative to where it was just a couple of months ago.\nDoes that mean we should simply sit on our hands until effective therapies, or a vaccine, emerges? Of\ncourse not. And as you probably know, our institution, the Federal Reserve, has taken bold action to\nhelp deal with the economic consequences of what is fundamentally a public health crisis.\nAt the Federal Reserve, we have essentially found ourselves in the role of firefighter — and we’ve\npoured water on the fire. But we want to avoid damaging the underlying infrastructure of what just a\nfew months ago was a very healthy economy.\nAccess to Liquidity for All\nOur goal is to use our vast lending powers to maintain our underlying economic infrastructure by making\nsure that every sector of the economy has access to liquidity. I realize that more needs to be done, that\npeople and firms will need infusions of cash, and that all of this is occurring at an unprecedented pace.\nBut that is a role for the federal government. Working together, we can try to ensure that the necessary\nconditions for a recovery will be there when this health crisis has passed.\nRegarding Federal Reserve actions, we have, first and foremost, acted by lowering our policy interest\nrate to near zero — and we expect to keep it there for some time.\nWe’ve also taken a number of actions to keep credit flowing. Beginning in March, as the depths of the\ncrisis became apparent, we started buying large amounts of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed\n2\n\nsecurities to prevent credit markets from seizing up. The markets have largely stabilized, and we’ve now\nslowed the rate of those purchases.\nWe’re also focusing on using all of our available tools to get loans directly into the hands of those who\nneed them most.\nTo do that, we’re going to be buying bonds from cities and states, most of whose sales tax revenues\nhave tanked along with consumer spending. This program, called the Municipal Liquidity Facility, will\nprovide essential liquidity to local governments as they fight the pandemic.\nWe’ve also set up what we’re calling our Main Street Lending facility. The goal here is to get cash in the\nhands of small- to medium-sized businesses whose operations have been hampered by the virus. These\nbusinesses tend to be the economic lifeblood of their local communities, and this lending facility is\ndesigned to forestall mass closures of small and medium-sized businesses on Main Streets across the\ncountry.\nRelatedly, the Federal Reserve is also bolstering the Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection\nProgram by supplying liquidity to financial institutions that are issuing loans to those crucial businesses.\nStress on Higher Education\nWe know that this crisis is severely harming the nonprofit sector as well. As a recovering academic and\nuniversity president myself, I’m acutely aware of the stress this crisis is inflicting on, for instance, the\nhigher education sector. The Federal Reserve is thinking carefully about setting up facilities that can\nprovide direct lending to colleges, universities, and nonprofit medical institutions.\nI want to be clear. We’re not in 2009 anymore and this is not quantitative easing 2.0. The principle\nbehind quantitative easing was that people weren’t engaging in investments because the cost of capital\nwas too high.\nThat is simply not the case now. The reason people aren’t engaging economically is the health crisis.\nI also want to be clear that these facilities — as well as the actions that have been taken on the fiscal\nside, especially the CARES Act that Congress passed a few weeks ago — are not economic stimulus.\nThere may be a time for stimulus later, after the acute phase of the health crisis has passed.\nOur facilities, instead, are a form of emergency relief — of insurance. We’re doing everything we can to\nhelp people get through a really painful time.\n3\n\nSo, now the $64,000, or perhaps the $22 trillion, question. What happens next economically?\nThe second quarter data will be brutally painful as a result of both the virus and the government-\nmandated economic shutdown. Take your pick of bad, really bad, or really, really bad.\nWhat happens after that to a large extent depends on how the virus moves through our society, and our\nreaction to it in terms of balancing stay-at-home policies versus an intelligent — and I want to stress,\nintelligent — reopening.\nThe Economy: Possible Paths\nThere are multiple scenarios as to how this plays out. But here are just two to consider: In the more\noptimistic scenario, the economy largely opens in June, we have technology in place to contain the\nspread of the virus, and there is no second wave in the fall. In that scenario, I would expect a severe\ncontraction in GDP in the second quarter followed by a significant rebound in the second half. However,\nthe second half rebound is not enough to fully offset the contraction in Q1 and Q2; 2021 would then\nshow above-trend annual GDP growth.\nThe less optimistic scenario is that we open too quickly and see a significant second wave of the virus.\nNot only would this be a health catastrophe, but it would reverse the recovery as well. In this less\nhopeful scenario, I project a similar growth path to the baseline for 2020, followed by a painful\neconomic contraction of GDP in 2021 as shutdowns are reintroduced.\nLonger term, of course, there will be a recovery. But I also want to stress that it might be an uneven one.\nThere’s an old saying that a rising tide lifts all boats. But that might not apply here.\nManufacturers of durable goods, for instance, should come back quickly.\nOne large manufacturer in our District who temporarily halted operations reports that orders\nthemselves never evaporated — they were simply delayed as virus mitigation measures took effect. But\nas Pennsylvania and other industrial states slowly and intelligently reopen, I think we can expect\nmanufacturing output to quickly bounce back.\nTravel and hospitality, on the other hand, may be in for a longer and more painful contraction.\nBusinesses may have enough experience teleconferencing instead of holding physical meetings that they\nmay decide to cut back on corporate travel. Families may choose to avoid crowded spots like\n4\n\namusement parks and cruise ships. The knock-on effects to airlines, hotels, and restaurants that cater to\ntravelers could be severe and long-lasting.\nCommercial real estate could also suffer for similar reasons.\nCompanies may find that working from home isn’t so bad after all and reduce physical office space.\nThere is also a strong possibility that many hotels and restaurants will never reopen. There will probably\nbe retailers, big and small, that also shutter permanently.\nIn the long term, the uneven recovery will present a risk to our banking sector, which is heavily exposed\nto sectors like commercial real estate. The good news is we went into this crisis with a well-capitalized\nregulated financial system. But I want to urge banks to retain capital as we prepare to enter a tough\nperiod. In my personal opinion, they probably shouldn’t be issuing large dividends at the moment.\nI want to close by mentioning a subject dear to my heart: diners!\nNear my house in South Jersey there’s a diner that, just a few days after restaurants were shut down\nhere, quickly turned into a full-service grocery store. Now perhaps this only demonstrates the ingenuity\nof the South Jersey diner sector. And I’ll admit I’m biased on that score …\nBut I also think it underlines Americans’ boundless ability to adapt — to retool when the times call for it.\nI’m sure that we will get through this.\n5",

    "text": "La Salle University\n16th Annual Economic Outlook\nThe Union League of Philadelphia\nPhiladelphia, PA\nFebruary 15, 2017\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the FOMC.\n\nLa Salle University 16th Annual Economic Outlook\nThe Union League of Philadelphia\nPhiladelphia, PA\nFebruary 15, 2017\nPatrick Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood afternoon. It’s a pleasure to be here, and I want to thank everyone for coming, even those\nof you who are just trying to get out of class.\nToday I’d like to talk about the economy as a whole, which I’m sure you expect of a Fed\npresident. But I’d like to start out with a refresher course on the Fed and what it is we do as well\nas a sort of monetary policy 101. That’s not to assume no one knows what we do, although I’m\noften surprised at cocktail parties to hear how much power people think I have. I can’t single-\nhandedly move markets, although it’s flattering people think so. It’s more to reset the wider\nconversation about where the U.S. economy is today, what challenges we’re facing, and what\ncan be done to really change its course. And, frankly, with so many La Salle students in the\naudience, I’m not missing an opportunity to talk to the next generation of potential Fed\nemployees.\nBefore I begin, the first rule of the Fed club is: Don’t talk about the Fed club until you’ve\ndelivered the standard disclaimer: The views I express today are mine alone and do not\nnecessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\nThe Fed: Overview\nFirst, the very basic overview. The Federal Reserve System is made up of 12 regional Banks\nacross the country and a Board of Governors in Washington, D.C. I’m president of the\n1\n\nPhiladelphia Fed, which covers eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey, and Delaware. Each\nof the regional Banks is an independent entity, and we represent our Districts when we meet in\nD.C. to formulate monetary policy.\nWe do that roughly every six weeks at the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC,\nmeetings. That’s where we vote on monetary policy, which is now mostly about moving interest\nrates.\nThe governors always have a vote as does the president of the New York Fed. The rest of us\nrotate on to voting positions. I’m voting this year for the first time. I’ve noticed people care a lot\nmore about what I have to say recently, which I’m sure is just a coincidence.\nWhen we’re not in a voting position, we’re still part of the conversation. One of the benefits of\nthe System is that we get to be the voices for the people in our regions.\nThe Federal Reserve has two responsibilities outlined by Congress, what’s referred to as our dual\nmandate. Those are price stability and maximum employment. In their very simplest terms —\nwith apologies to any economists in the room who hate it when we put things in their simplest\nterms — that’s first, low and stable inflation. And second, that — for the most part — if you’re\nlooking for a job, you can find one. That isn’t a guarantee for every single person or that the job\nyou get is the one you want; it’s a cold and analytical assessment of the overall state of the labor\nmarket in a massive economy.\nThe Fed also regulates banks, processes payments, and conducts economic research.\nAnd — the part that never gets enough attention, in my opinion — we do research and work in\nour communities to help strengthen local economies. We have an exceptional team in\nPhiladelphia, and I’m not just saying that because they make me look good. We recently had\nChair Yellen come with us to visit the West Philadelphia Skills Initiative, which connects\nunemployed people in the area with employers. The Philadelphia Fed’s Community\nDevelopment team works with organizations to promote stronger economies through everything\nfrom skills training to research on economic mobility. And they connect people and issues to the\nresources they need.\n2\n\nDifferent Banks also sometimes specialize in particular research areas. Obviously, Dallas does a\nlot on energy markets. New York has a special focus on international financial markets. In\nPhiladelphia, our area of expertise is consumer credit: cards, household debt, student loans, etc.\nSo, that’s the Fed overview. We do a lot of things other than monetary policy.\nMonetary Policy: The Basics\nThat said, monetary policy is still the big one. And that’s where I come — if you’ll indulge me\n— to my second primer of the day: monetary policy 101.\nMonetary policy is not the all-powerful tool it’s often portrayed as. It’s relatively limited in its\nscope, and it’s a relatively blunt instrument. In normal times, monetary policy is mostly raising\nand lowering interest rates — or keeping them the same.\nIn extraordinary times, we may use tools like quantitative easing or forward guidance, which is\njust policy speak for telling people what to expect.\nHowever, the majority of what we do is the somewhat boring business of keeping rates at a level\nthat encourages a healthy economy and helps us meet our dual mandate.\nThe policy decisions that affect things like debts and deficits, taxes and spending, are made by\nelected officials. Those are fiscal policy.\nFiscal and other policy areas are where you find the decisions that really affect things like\ngrowth. The Fed creates the conditions in which a healthy economy can thrive. We till the land\nand make the soil fertile, if you will. But the actual thriving part — planting the seeds and\ntending the crops — are decisions beyond our control, which brings me to where we stand now\nin our role and our decisions.\nThe economy, overall, is in pretty good shape. After eight-plus long years of recovery, the\neconomy is more or less back to full health.\nWe added 227,000 jobs in January, continuing a steady pace of employment. The unemployment\nrate stands at 4.8 percent, at or below what economists term the “natural rate” of unemployment.\nThat’s the rate we can expect in a healthy economy.\n3\n\nI want to say here that when Fed policymakers talk about employment, we’re doing it at a\nnational level. I’m not blind to the realities on the ground, particularly in my own District. There\nare pockets here and around the country that have been left out of the rebound. There are\ndemographics that have been persistently cut out of that good labor-market fortune: The\nunemployment rate for African American men, for example, was 8.0 percent in January.\nWe make policy at a national level, so we look at national averages. But we understand that there\nare areas that still need particular focus; it’s part of the reason we, as presidents, make sure we\nfeed back the realities on the ground in our Districts. Some of the issues we can help address\nthrough our community development work, but most of it is up to fiscal and other policy.\nAs for inflation, that’s been a little more stubborn, but we’re on track there as well. The myth\nabout inflation is that the Fed is only concerned about it when it gets too high. In truth, we have a\ngoal of 2 percent, and we worry about deviation in either direction. I don’t mean we run around\nwith our hair on fire if it’s a little higher or a little lower once in a while. We’re looking for an\naverage over the medium term.\nIt surprises some people that the issue with inflation over the past few years is that it’s been too\nlow. That sounds odd to a lot of people, especially those of us who lived through the high\ninflation of the late ’70s and early ’80s. The students in the audience definitely won’t remember\nthat, and I think some of the faculty might even be too young.\nIn any event, we’re starting to see upward movement on our goal, and I see inflation rising to\nmeet our target sometime late this year or next, which means that we’re essentially at our goal.\nOur job now is to maintain the land and keep conditions right for economic growth.\nFor our part, that’s about how we manage interest rates. I see three hikes as appropriate for 2017,\nassuming things stay on track.\nGrowth\nThe growth part, however, is up to fiscal and other policy.\nSo, what really does move the economy?\n4\n\nAnd what problems are we actually facing?\nI think it’s safe to say there are a lot of opinions about both of those. And I hear most of them.\nWhether I like it or not …\nSo, I’d like to cut through the noise.\nWith employment generally at our goal and inflation on track to meet it, the issue now is growth.\nFrom an economic modeling standpoint, growth right now is more or less what we should\nconsider normal. My forecast for 2017 is a touch above 2 percent.\nIf we want to move that needle, we need to address the underlying factors that are keeping it at\nits current rate.\nGrowth is fundamentally productivity plus growth of the labor force, and therein lie two of the\nbigger problems facing the American economy.\nProductivity\nI’ll start with productivity. Productivity is defined as output per unit of input. Basically, how\nmuch cost and effort it takes to produce a single unit of a good.\nProductivity has been falling lately — not just in the U.S., incidentally, but globally. And to\nsome extent, the reasons are a mystery.\nThere is one school of thought, popularized by the economist Robert Gordon, that productivity\nhas been spurred throughout history by big, game-changing inventions. Think steam engine,\nelectricity, the Internet. And that the only way we will see productivity on par with past surges is\nif some revolutionary new invention again changes the way we do business. Well, wait a minute.\nDoesn’t the vast world of Internet-enabled work count? In this theory, not really. The\nexplanation would be that in the first tech revolution, most of the innovation went into making\nbusinesses work more efficiently, letting them produce more with less. In this iteration, the\nmajority of the disruption has been in areas of leisure rather than business. Some might even\nargue that the availability of such personal distractions has caused us to be less productive\nbecause we’re more distracted.\n5\n\nThis might sound terrifying because what else is there to invent? But in this view of the world,\nall isn’t lost because we never really know when the next big revolution is around the corner.\nI’m not personally dedicated to this theory. I think there are ways to increase productivity. But\nit’s been a potent and interesting point of discussion.\nThe other question most often posed is whether we’re measuring productivity correctly. With all\nthe web-based business out there, is it even possible to measure output? Aren’t we assessing\nproductivity on an outdated scale?\nThe first thing I’ll say is that productivity is notoriously difficult to measure. And the economy\nmay be changing in ways that make it even harder. We have the best minds available working on\nthis, but they fully admit it’s difficult to keep up. For example, how do we include smartphone\napps that are downloadable for free in measures of output? Research at our Bank suggests that,\neven if we correct for this, it would only make a small difference in the rate of output growth. So,\nour best guess remains that productivity has slowed, while at the same time, there is widespread\nagreement that output and productivity are likely somewhat greater than we think. Welcome to\nthe dismal science.\nLabor Force Participation Rate\nThe second factor in the growth equation is the labor force.\nYou’ve probably heard a lot of talk lately about the “real” or “hidden” unemployment rate. There\nis some thought that it might be significantly higher than the official numbers say.\nTo dig into this, I should outline a few measures of how we gauge the health of the labor market.\nSome of it is what you hear frequently: the unemployment rate. That number is actually what we\ncall U3 unemployment. That’s the basic measure of the unemployed as a percentage of the labor\nforce. You’re unemployed if you’re looking for a job; if you’ve just graduated and you’re on\nyour first search, you’re part of that number. If you’re looking for work after some time off,\nyou’re part of it, too. If you’ve retired, if you’re not working by choice, if you’re taking a break,\nyou’re not considered unemployed. U3, as I said, is currently 4.8 percent.\n6\n\nThe U6 measure is more involved. That one takes U3 and adds people who are working part-\ntime but would like to be full-time and people who say they’d like a job but stopped looking. U6\ncurrently stands at 9.4 percent.\nWe also look at how many people are quitting their jobs, which reflects how confident they are\nthat they’ll find another. We look at how many net new jobs were created. We look at what we\nhear from businesses about how hard it is to fill positions, and a host of other information.\nThen there is the labor force participation rate. This is where things get sticky.\nThe labor force participation rate is a measure of what proportion of the working-age population\nis either employed or looking for a job. It’s easy to look at this and draw some unsettling\nconclusions, especially when I tell you that the labor force participation rate is currently 62.9\npercent.\nThis is the number that alarms some people. But there’s more to it than meets the eye.\nFirst of all, we define the working-age population as everyone over the age of 16. So, that means\nyour kid brother who’s a junior in high school and my 92-year-old mother are both counted.\nSecond of all, we’re dealing with a different population than we have in the past. The baby\nboomers represent the biggest generation in history to start moving into retirement, and we’re\nliving longer in general. I’m pretty pleased about the last one, frankly. Ultimately, the pool of\npeople not seeking employment for very good reasons is much larger, skewing the overall\nnumber.\nSo, in the sense that low labor force participation points to an unemployment rate that is radically\nhigher than official numbers suggest, that’s not really the case.\nIt is, however, a problem, just for different reasons.\nThe participation rate has been declining in recent years. There are a few factors that influence\nthat. For one, people are staying in school longer and many younger people aren’t working while\nthey’re there. For another, some people have decided that they’re happy with a one-income\nhousehold, often reflecting preferences of work–life balance.\n7\n\nThe third — and this is the big one — is, as I mentioned, that the baby boomers are heading into\nretirement.\nI say this is the big one because research by my staff shows that the fall in the labor force\nparticipation rate is mostly due to demographic factors.1\nAnd because the vast majority of the decline comes from the onset of the baby boomers’\nretirement, they don’t think the trend will reverse. In fact, they project that the participation rate\nwill drop a further 2 percentage points over the next five years.2\nThis is a big deal.\nIt’s a big deal because participation affects growth. As an example: If you look at the U.S.\neconomy during the recovery, you’ll see that after the bottom out in 2009, real GDP grew at an\naverage of about 2 percent for the next six years. That’s not just slow for a recovery; it’s slow by\nhistorical averages. In comparison, in the second half of the 20th century, growth averaged 3.5\npercent. A full 1.7 percent of that came just from the expansion of the American workforce. Over\nthe course of the recovery, by contrast, the labor force has grown by an average of about 0.5\npercent. That’s less than half the historical average.\nWe also have to think about the economic pressures that demographics put on us as a country.\nWith an unprecedented wave of Americans heading into retirement and living longer to boot,\nwe’re talking about a lot of resources: Social Security, Medicare, living expenses in general.\nWhile the millennial generation is slightly larger than the boomers, they’re not yet fully in the\nworkforce, and even the oldest of them still aren’t in their prime earning years.\nThe changes to the American labor force in age, in educational attainment, and in expertise in\ncertain sectors are actually harming productivity. In general, productivity is higher in midcareer\n1 Shigeru Fujita, “On the Causes of Declines in the Labor Force Participation Rate,” Research Rap Special Report,\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia (February 2014).\n2 See Fujita.\n8\n\nworkers, and their proportion of the U.S. labor market is smaller than it was during the height of\nthe baby boom’s working years.3\nDeclining participation equals shrinking output. That is, with fewer workers, the U.S. will\nproduce less. When we produce less, growth stalls. Ultimately, successful and healthy economies\nhave high participation rates.\nPolicy Possibilities\nNow that I’ve scared the daylights out of everyone, can anything be done?\nAgain, the solutions to these problems lie in areas outside monetary policy. Since I know how it\nfeels to have someone else comment on the job you’re doing, let me be clear that I’m not telling\nelected officials what to do. I’m just a policy wonk with too much data on my hands, and I\nfollow the numbers.\nSo, please take this next part as simply the analysis of an impartial, data-driven party.\nAs pertains to productivity and growth overall, investment in human and physical capital are\nvital; that is, education, science, health, and the infrastructure of our cities and towns. These help\ncreate a strong and diversified workforce and will help America keep its edge as a leader in\ninnovation across sectors.\nOne of the areas we’ve focused on at the Philadelphia Fed is skills training and alternative routes\nto education and professional readiness.\nThe data show that there’s a skills gap. That is, there are jobs out there that can’t be filled\nbecause people just don’t have the right training. That’s the big problem in many industries:\nthere are jobs but not enough people who can do them.\n3 James Feyrer, “Demographics and Productivity,” The Review of Economics and Statistics, MIT Press, vol. 89(1),\npp. 100–109 (February 2007).\n9\n\nMy staff recently conducted a study on what they call “opportunity occupations.” These are jobs\nthat pay at or above the national median income but that don’t require a traditional four-year\ndegree. They make up close to 30 percent of the job market nationally.\nIf we reconsider the way we train people, especially for occupations that require special skills,\nwe can start to maximize the potential of our workforce. Let’s stop trying to make post-\nsecondary education one-size-fits-all when our job needs and workforce are so varied.\nOn the participation side of things, we can only grow as fast as our workforce can take on the\nwork. Right now, we just don’t have the people, unless we want my mother and her friends to\ncome out of retirement. But I’m pretty sure we’d have a fight on our hands …\nWe need more bodies in the workforce. How and whether we make the decision to do something\nabout it is again out of my hands. And I don’t want to wade into turbulent political waters. But\nthe bottom line is that we don’t have enough people, and pulling talent in from outside the\nUnited States is one way to solve the problem.\nConclusion\nThe United States is and has been an economic powerhouse for most of the past century. We’re\nthe world’s largest economy, and we have consistently been a source of innovation and\ninvention. If we want to keep our global edge, it’s time to think about broad policies that look to\nwhere we’ll be in the future. When I was playing football, we ran where the ball was headed to\ncatch it; that’s how we have to look at policy — monetary, fiscal, and other — not where we are\non the field but where we’re headed.\nI hope I haven’t taken up too much of your time, and I’m happy to turn the floor over to some\nquestions.\n10",

    "text": "Investing in America’s Workforce Book Launch\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York\nNew York, NY\nNovember 9, 2018\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nInvesting in America’s Workforce Book Launch\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York\nNew York, NY\nNovember 9, 2018\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood morning and thank you. It’s always a pleasure to be in New York, and I want to thank\nPresident Williams and the entire team at the New York Fed for their hospitality.\nI also want to thank John for going first and saving me the extra time of delivering the full Fed\ndisclaimer — I’ll just go with, “What he said.”\nI want to use my time today to talk a bit about the context of Investing in America’s Workforce,\nand how that research — and the gist of its findings — resonates across the work we’re doing\nat the Fed, both at our Bank in Philadelphia and across the System.\nJust last month, the Philadelphia Fed hosted our flagship community development conference,\nReinventing Our Communities, or ROC, in Baltimore, in partnership with the Richmond Bank.\nFed officials like to talk about how data-driven we are, and this applies to our CD work as well.\nOur focus in Philadelphia has been putting research into action to find sustainable approaches\nto economic growth, and ROC is about working at the intersection of research and practice.\nWe had some truly phenomenal speakers, but Joyce Bacon was a standout. And while almost\neverything about her is exceptional — her story, her presence, her work and commitment —\nshe is, in one way, all too ordinary. And that is in her experience with some workforce\nprograms.\n1\n\nJoyce essentially went through training for a job that wasn’t there. Anyone involved in\nworkforce development has seen something like what she experienced – or they’ve seen\npeople train for jobs that disappear, jobs with no opportunity for growth, or jobs that don’t pay\na living wage. It’s one of the pitfalls of a system that is all too often transactional in nature. It’s\noften called the “train and pray” model.\nThe happy turn to Joyce’s story is that she found her way to the West Philadelphia Skills\nInitiative, which does what everyone in this room would say is absolutely crucial to any\nsuccessful training program: It works with employers, identifies skills that are in demand, and\noffers relevant training that prepares candidates both for jobs and for growth within their\nfields. They make that connection between local economic activity and job seekers.\nJoyce went straight into an entry-level position at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, and\nwithin six months, she was promoted. But she was also very moved and motivated by her\ntraining experiences — both the good and the bad — and went back to West Philadelphia Skills\nInitiative as a coach. She comes in to talk to candidates, give them support, and let them know\nthey can do it — a lot of them have gone through the same thing she did. She can tell them\nfrom experience that this time really is different; this is a place that doesn’t just train you for a\njob, it trains you for a career.\nAll too often, we’re spending time and energy on training that doesn’t address employers’\nneeds, leaving qualified talent on the sidelines. That doesn’t just waste money, it depletes\npeople’s reserves of hope. We need more investment in programs like the one in West\nPhiladelphia, that think about the evolution of the employment landscape. That’s even more\nimportant as technological advancement affects jobs and industries on a daily basis.\nWe recently published research on the likely effect of automation in both our District and in the\nU.S. We identified the jobs that were in danger, as well as assigning degrees of likelihood to\ntheir eventual disappearance. We also looked at the people doing those jobs, who would be\nhardest hit, and where new jobs would likely be created.\nOur conclusion? Almost one in five jobs in our District have a 95 percent or better chance of\nbecoming automated, and the people most likely to be displaced are some of the economy’s\n2\n\nmost vulnerable workers — women, people of color, younger people, and workers in lower-\nskilled positions.\nSome people will be absorbed into new jobs, but there’s a risk that others will not.\nNow is the time to shift our thinking about how we train and prepare our workforce. That’s how\nwe ensure that, instead of getting automated out of work, people have the skills to move into\nthe jobs that arise from the change.\nIf you take Joyce’s far-too-common first training experience, add discouragement, and multiply\nit by a rapidly automating workforce, the results for the vast majority of both workers and\nemployers run to negative territory. But we can change the outcome of the equation if we\nchange how we approach the problem.\nInvesting in America’s Workforce\nA little over a year ago, many of us were in Austin for the release of the Investing in America’s\nWorkforce (IAW) research. My remarks that day focused on the need to change the thinking\nabout workforce development — and that in changing perspectives, we’d change behavior,\nand, ultimately, change the outcomes.\nOne year on, I’m delighted to say … that speech fixed it! Everyone can go home now!\nObviously, I’m kidding. And obviously, there’s still a lot of work to do, even on that first step of\nperspective change. Miraculously, no matter how many times I say to an audience that business\nhas to start viewing workforce development as an investment, rather than a social service, it\nhasn’t moved the needle much. Even when every head is nodding in agreement.\nIt seems like common sense — in fact, it is common sense — that an investment in skills is an\ninvestment in the overall economy. But changing a commonly held assumption is almost as\ndifficult as changing a deeply ingrained belief. And after the speeches and panels and plenary\nsessions, it is very, very easy to go back to business as usual.\nPerhaps if policy wonks were given to more sweeping oratory, we could change minds in a\nsingle speech. Unfortunately, my children tell me I’m not persuasive enough to make them\n3\n\nchange the channel … And this incredibly important, incredibly necessary, incredibly valuable\nwork that you all do takes more than rhetorical flair. But with the continued commitment and\neffort everyone here puts in, we can chip away at the status quo until we’ve carved out a new,\nbetter reality.\nBack in Austin, I recapped the IAW findings on where and how various aspects of the system\ncan change perspectives and approaches.\nOne of the messages that resonated throughout this work was the idea that everyone involved\nin workforce development should start thinking like investors looking for long-term rewards,\nrather than lenders thinking only about short-term risks.\nThe research showed that the public sector could be more effective by better aligning\noverlapping goals, such as workforce and economic development. They could also maximize\nbenefits from investing in intermediaries that see the bigger picture — ones that don’t just train\nworkers, but connect them to jobs, or train them with an eye on what the industry’s future\nneeds will be.\nAs Joyce’s experience perfectly demonstrates, that can make a life-changing difference.\nFoundations, for their part, can take on the mantle of venture philanthropists, promoting\ninnovation, collaboration, and capacity building.\nAnd employers should see their workers as assets to invest in, instead of line-item labor costs\nthat can be limited or decreased. Our experts believe that the shift in outlook may result in a\nshift in behavior.\nThere are any number of ways that change could be beneficial, particularly if it means increased\ntraining opportunities for existing employees or professional development opportunities. It\nmeans a workforce with better skills, and creates entry-level openings for a new generation of\ntalent, as existing employees move up the professional ladder. It will also likely save capital in\nthe long run: Consider the accumulated cost of employee turnover versus investing a fraction of\nthat in upskilling a current or potential worker.\n4\n\nThat change in outlook could also encourage apprenticeship programs and other work-based\ntraining. We know from experience that programs that let people learn and earn are especially\nsuccessful.\nOverall, if private sector organizations can train an investment lens on their approach to talent\nmanagement, we’re more likely to see an increase in job quality, which is important. And, of\ncourse, the organizations themselves will likely see a huge benefit.\nOutcomes-Based Investments\nThat’s the perspective that informed a funding model we recently launched as part of the\nEconomic Growth & Mobility Project. The model brings partners together to fundamentally\nrethink the way we fund workforce development — in both the public and private sectors —\nand how we pay for results.\nIt was born of, and is fueled by, two years of research and outreach by my team. It will utilize\ngrowing interest in new financial models to tap private sector investment in workforce\ndevelopment and provide 21st century digital skills to workers, ultimately moving its\nparticipants into the middle-skill jobs of the future.\nEarlier this year, we brought on Social Finance, a national leader in innovative Pay for Success\nprojects, to help us think about how to make the case for employer investment in workforce\ndevelopment. We saw there were dollars on the table that could be better spent, and the\nmissing capital could often be found in the money employers spend on recruitment, hiring, and\ntraining new workers.\nWe approached our local workforce development board, Philadelphia Works, to propose a new\ntype of public-private partnership: one that would include employer investment but also\nprovide feedback to the current workforce training programs. In this model, Philadelphia Works\nassumes the role of investor, providing the initial funding to launch the outcomes-based pilot\ntraining program.\nWith Philadelphia Works on board, we approached a large national technology employer that\njust happens to be headquartered in our fair city. It saw an opportunity to use this model to\n5\n\nexpand the local talent pool by building out the necessary technological training in specific\nfields, particularly for middle-skilled jobs with growing demands for technological proficiency.\nOutcomes-based finance, or Pay for Success, is not a new concept, of course. What makes this\ninitiative different is that instead of issuing social impact bonds and having government paying\nfor outcomes, the employer will pay the bill once the training meets its business needs and\ndemonstrates return on investment. Repayments can then be recycled to pilot other projects\nand meet the needs of even more job seekers and employers in Philadelphia.\nIn August, Social Finance announced that it will provide technical assistance on the project’s\nstructure, which will be funded by a grant from the White House Social Innovation Fund. The\ncommunity development team at the Philadelphia Fed will assist with evaluating the project\nand analyzing return on investment to the employer. They will also design a toolkit so that\nother employers and cities can launch similar projects, including the ever-important wisdom of\nthe lessons learned from this maiden voyage.\nThe first class of trainees will be announced in late spring of next year.\nConclusion\nWhat makes this work especially resonant is that it’s the embodiment of what we learned last\nyear in Austin. The message of Investing in America’s Workforce is that it’s time to change the\nway we look at things.\nThe new funding model is a way of changing our perspective on workforce development. And\nwith a private sector partner taking the step to be the investor, we’re sending a message that\nworkforce development truly is an investment, one that major employers are willing to make.\n6",

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nFintech in a Changing World\nThe Sixth Annual Fintech Conference\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nPhiladelphia, PA (virtual/in-person hybrid)\nAugust 3, 2022\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood morning! I’d like to begin by giving a big welcome to everyone here in Philadelphia and to\nthose of you joining us virtually. One of the benefits of hosting a hybrid conference like this is\nthat we derive the advantages of being together physically — I’ve had some of my best ideas on\nthe sidelines of conferences like these — while also being able to welcome many people who\ncouldn’t make it to Philadelphia.\nIt’s great that we have such a huge turnout today. I think that’s a testament not only to the\ngrowing interest in the subject we are here to discuss — fintech — but also to the stellar lineup\nthat we’ve assembled for this, the Philadelphia Fed’s Sixth Annual Fintech Conference. My\ncolleague Julapa Jagtiani, the organizer of these proceedings, has truly done it again. If you’ve\nnever been to one of our fintech conferences before, trust me, you’re in for a treat. Over the\nnext two days, we will hear from the leading voices in industry, government, and the Fed.\nAnd speaking of the Fed, here is where I give my standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express\ntoday are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\nOur last fintech conference was in November 2021, and although that wasn’t even a year ago, I\nthink it’s safe to say that conditions for the fintech industry — not to speak of the broader\neconomy — have changed dramatically.\n1\n\nI’ll give one example. Last November, I spoke about the rapid growth of buy now, pay later\nfirms, which effectively repurposed Kmart’s old layaway model for the digital age. With buy\nnow, pay later, shoppers are able to divide payments for purchases into a series of installments\n— sometimes with zero interest tacked on. And unlike with layaway, consumers benefit from\ngetting the product up front and paying for it over time. This has proved a popular option, with\nbuy now, pay later representing $2 of every $100 spent on e-commerce in 2021.\nBuy now, pay later looked robust in a low-interest rate environment. That’s because the vast\nmajority of firms in the space have no deposits to tap. Instead, they borrow money that they\nthen turn around and lend. Typically, their revenue comes from fees charged to merchants.\nRising rates have drastically changed the landscape for buy now, pay later. Forced to borrow at\nhigher rates, these firms are facing pressures they simply weren’t last November.\nUnsurprisingly, major operators in the space have retrenched, with one of the leading lenders\nshedding 10 percent of its workforce last month.\nThe fintech landscape is changing rapidly as a result of macroeconomic conditions. Significant\ndevelopments are occurring, and we’re lucky to have so many superb panelists here this week\nto discuss them.\nThe adoption of buy now, pay later has important implications for offering financial services to\nlow- and moderate-income consumers or others who may be locked out of more traditional\nmeans of obtaining credit. Consider a young adult in her first job who has no established credit\nhistory and therefore can’t get approved for a bank credit card. She can now use buy now, pay\nlater to finance that important purchase. Moreover, some buy now, pay later lenders report\npayment histories to credit bureaus, allowing these new borrowers to begin to build a credit\nhistory.\nOr think about the family that declared bankruptcy several years ago and that continues to be\ncharged high rates on traditional forms of lending, even though they’re back on their financial\nfeet. Buy now, pay later offers an alternate method of accessing credit.\n2\n\nA survey from the Philadelphia Fed of buy now, pay later users in the United States found that\nusers are generally non-White, lower earning, and younger than users of other payment\nmethods like debit and credit cards.\nFintech, in other words, can help foster financial inclusion. That’s undeniable. But that is far\nfrom inevitable.\nLike all tools, fintech can be used for good, ill, or somewhere in between. Just as fintech can\nfoster frictionless legitimate transactions, for instance, it can foster frictionless fraudulent\ntransactions as well. Fraud is an example of where a little bit of friction can be a good thing.\nFintech has developed a lot over the six years we’ve been hosting these conferences, and the\ndiscussions like those we will have over the next two days have moved out of the largely\ntheoretical and evermore into the realm of the empirical. We have increasingly rich data sets\nhere in the United States and abroad that provide important insights on how fintech is\nreshaping credit markets.\nTake one example: A recent paper examined how fintech lending differed from traditional bank\nlending in China during the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis. Analyzing the dispersal of\nunsecured personal loans by three large fintech firms and a large commercial bank, the\nresearchers found that fintechs were more likely than banks to extend credit to new and\nfinancially constrained borrowers. Fintech borrowers were more likely to be unemployed, to\nearn lower incomes, and to have had prior delinquencies.\nA happy story, right? Well, not quite.\nThat’s because it turns out that the delinquency rate of fintech loans tripled after the COVID-19\noutbreak, whereas there was no significant change in the delinquency rate for bank loans over\nthe same period. This is a puzzling finding, somehow suggesting that, in this case at least,\nfintech lenders were unable to accurately predict borrowers’ financial health in the event of a\npandemic, but commercial banks were. That strongly implies that the Chinese fintech firms\nwere operating with imperfect or insufficient information about their borrowers. While issuing\n3\n\ncredit to the financially constrained is potentially beneficial, it does no good to the lenders or\nthe borrowers if the loans end up delinquent.\nBut this is hardly an iron law: Other examples have found fintech loans going delinquent at\nlower rates than bank loans. That suggests that elevated or lower credit risk is not necessarily\ninherent to fintech itself, but rather dependent on each firm’s particular business model.\nAnother recent paper that examines unsecured small business loans in India offers an\nimportant example. There, the authors found, when fintechs used a more holistic method for\nevaluating borrowers’ credit risk than a simple credit score, both borrowers and lenders\nbenefited.\nOver several years, small businesses in India seeking credit from fintechs agreed to share data\non their so-called cashless payments, certified checks, Internet banking, mobile banking, point-\nof-sale transactions, and money transfers on mobile apps. The upshot? They gained access to\nlarger loans at lower rates than those who used traditional credit scores to access credit.\nOne can imagine such a model working here in the U.S., where the credit constrained are able\nto demonstrate their creditworthiness in ways besides their credit scores. In my opinion, there\nis no good reason that on-time rent and utility payments should not be just as determinative in\nobtaining credit as on-time payments for car loans or credit cards.\nAgain, the opportunities to use fintech to reach the economically constrained and financially\nmarginalized are truly exciting — and very important. It’s now on all of us to seize them.\nSo again, thank you so much for joining us. We have a very rich menu of programming over the\nnext two days, which I’m sure we will all benefit from.\nI’ll now turn things over to David Mills, my colleague from the Board of Governors, who will\nlead a discussion on the future of payments.\n4",

    "text": "Monetary Policy Normalization:\nLow Interest Rates and the New Normal\nOfficial Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum\nNew York, NY\nJanuary 15, 2020\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nMonetary Policy Normalization: Low Interest Rates and the New Normal\nOfficial Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum\nNew York, NY\nJanuary 15, 2020\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nI’m a generally inquisitive person by nature, and one of the perks of being a Fed president is that\nindulging my curiosity is actually a job requirement — discussions like this give us good feedback and\ninsight, and it’s important to maintain an open, transparent dialogue. So I’m very happy to be here.\nThough I should note the flipside: One of the perils of being a Fed president is that you open yourself to\nthe risk that discussion turns into inquisition …\nToday’s roundtable is titled “Monetary Policy Normalization: Low Interest Rates and the New Normal,”\nand it’s probably telling that those 10 relatively short words contain multitudes.\nSo I’d like to start with a brief recap of the key issues and recent events that influence today’s\nconversation — or at least, as brief as I can make them — then head straight into the discussion.\nFirst, however, as is par for the course, I’ll issue the standard disclaimer that the views I express today\nare my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\nI always issue that disclaimer, but I’m highly aware that people care a lot more about what I have to say\nin years that I’m a voting member of the FOMC. So my New Year’s resolution is to say it whenever I\nspeak, even if I’m just ordering a sandwich …\nOur initial intent for today was to focus on the unwinding of the balance sheet, and as you can see, I’m\naccompanied by my colleague Roc Armenter, who is one of the principal architects of our approach. But\npolicy does not exist in a vacuum, and, of course, there are other, connected topics, including the\ndisruption in the money markets last September.\nTo set the stage then, I’ll remind everyone of where we were, where we are, and where we’re going.\n1\n\nIn the Beginning — Balance Sheet Normalization\nAs you know, at the start of 2019, the FOMC decided that we would continue to conduct monetary\npolicy in a regime of “ample reserves,” in which control over the federal funds rate is exercised primarily\nthrough the setting of administered rates, and the supply of reserves does not need to be actively\nmanaged.\nShortly after that, we announced our plan to cease asset redemptions and hold the balance sheet to\nroughly a constant size come September. As currency and other non-reserve liabilities grow, aggregate\nreserves see a natural, gradual decline. Our end game was for reserves to reach a level “consistent with\nefficient and effective implementation of monetary policy.”\nThere were two primary objectives to this approach. First, to reduce uncertainty about asset purchases\nby announcing our plans well in advance. Second, to approach the necessary level of reserves, which is\nitself suffused with uncertainty, with an abundance of caution.\nWe only have estimates of the demand for reserves, though we’ve conducted a great deal of research\naround the Federal Reserve System, including continued conversations with market participants. In fact,\nstaff at the Philadelphia and New York Feds were among the first to identify that the need for reserves\ncould be much larger than initially anticipated. To be on the safe side, it made sense to move slowly,\nbuying time to carefully observe market developments and better assess their implications. That is, we\ngave ourselves time for the inevitable “unknown unknowns” of life.\nJust such a surprise arose in September.\nThe episode was clearly triggered by the outsized flows of funds to the Treasury. But the dates for tax\npayments and bond settlements are not a surprise; they are fixtures of the fiscal calendar and well\nknown to both policymakers and markets. Everyone was expecting large liquidity flows.\nThe impact, however, was clearly much larger than anyone anticipated, markets included.\nThe repo market took the brunt of the impact, as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) rose\nabove 5 percent on Tuesday, September 17, with some trades executed at rates as high as 10 percent.\nWhile this was certainly not an average day, it’s important to note that the repo market didn’t freeze.\nThe volume of secured overnight finance remained steady, at the $1.2 trillion level it had maintained for\nthe past several months.\n2\n\nThe funding pressures in secured markets passed through to the federal funds market. The effective\nfederal funds rate rose to the top of target range on Monday the 16th, and surpassed the top of the\nrange by 5 basis points the next day.\nWe immediately took action to ensure that the effective federal funds rate returned to, and stayed\nwithin, the target range. The very next day, the Desk started repurchase operations to stem the\npressures on money markets, which have continued — including term operations — to date.\nSince September 17, 2019, to the End of the Decade\nIn October, the FOMC decided to restart asset purchases to keep reserves at or above the level reached\nin early September, a little over $1.5 trillion. Additionally, the Desk has been conducting term and\novernight repurchase agreement operations to offset money market pressures — for instance, the\nquarter-end dynamics that are inevitably more burdensome at the year’s end. All in all, since\nSeptember, we have supplied about $400 billion in additional reserves; about $250 billion via repo\nagreements and the rest in asset purchases.\nThese measures clearly worked, with the effective fed funds rate maintaining a virtually constant level\nsince October, and repo markets staying calm. Instead of wreaking havoc, the year’s end was a non-\nevent. The money markets essentially rang in the New Year by binge watching Netflix in their PJs instead\nof with noisemakers and popped corks.\nImplementation Framework Going Forward\nGoing forward, the Committee remains committed to implementing monetary policy in a regime of\nample reserves, which, again, does not require active management of the supply of reserves. The\nTreasury purchases announced in October will continue until at least the next quarter to ensure we\nmeet that goal.\nCentral to this event is the question of why the liquidity did not flow smoothly to where it was needed\nmost. Are some of the market’s pipes rusty? Clogged? Are more needed? Has regulation inadvertently\ncontributed to some erosion or blockage?\nThe second question is whether the Fed ought to expand our toolkit — whether we could, or should, do\nmore to ensure interest-rate control. One possibility under discussion is a standing repo facility. We are\nin the process of evaluating the potential costs and benefits, and exploring possible designs as well as\nalternatives, so it is still very much in the discourse, rather than the decision, phase.\n3\n\nWhile September’s turmoil offered perhaps too much excitement, it also provided a good deal of\ninformation. It showed that we need a larger pool of reserves than most of our estimates had initially\nindicated. It showed that when reserves are scarce, even for as short a period as a week or so, it can\ngenerate large spikes in money market rates. And it showed, unfortunately, that banks remain\nextremely reluctant to borrow from the discount window, even when that reluctance results in outsized\npenalties far above the primary credit rate.\nMonetary Policy Review\nThis episode highlights that some fundamental shifts have occurred in market functioning. And, in fact,\nas the world’s economies rebuilt over the course of the lengthy recovery, we’ve come out the other side\nto a state of normalcy that doesn’t look exactly like it did before the financial crisis.\nLast year, we began a broad review of the strategies, tools, and communication practices we use in\npursuit of our monetary policy goals. Again, that’s an important undertaking on both a philosophical\nlevel and as a general exercise in good practice. But it’s also important because we find ourselves in new\nterritory, as the U.S. economy has changed in ways that impact the efficacy of our policymaking. In\nparticular, the natural rate of interest, both at home and abroad, appears to have fallen, increasing the\npossibility of moving ever closer to the zero lower bound, which, in turn, dilutes the power of our\nmonetary policy tools in combatting downturns.\nIt’s been said often, but bears repeating, that a change to our 2 percent inflation goal is not on the table.\nBut it is nonetheless a wide-ranging review. As you may have seen in the minutes from the FOMC’s\nSeptember meeting, makeup strategies were discussed, and we reviewed the utility of unconventional\npolicy tools — such as balance-sheet policies and forward guidance — in October. We expect to reach\nsome preliminary findings by midyear, but we also expect these conversations to be ongoing.\nI’ve personally found this exercise to be fascinating from an academic standpoint and vital from the\npolicymaker’s roost. But the highlight for me has really been the series of Fed Listens events\nspearheaded by Vice Chair Clarida. Each of the 12 District Banks hosted outreach and consultation\nevents with a broad range of people and groups, including labor leaders, nonprofits, community leaders,\nand local business owners. Even though the economy is in good shape, it works differently for different\npeople and places, and it’s important to put context and contour to the discussion.\nI’m going to end with that observation, because we’re here for a discussion, not a monologue, and I’m\nmore than ready to dive into the context and contour you bring to the discussion.\n4",

Harker\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily\nthose of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\nThe New Normal for the U.S. Economy\nThe Philadelphia Fed Policy Forum\nPhiladelphia, PA\nDecember 4, 2015\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood morning and welcome to the 11th Philadelphia Fed Policy Forum. This is my first\nPolicy Forum as President and CEO, and I have been looking forward to it since joining the\nBank in July.\nOur Policy Forums are held only once every two years. They provide a unique opportunity\nto bring together some of the most renowned leaders in economic research and focus on\nlong-term issues and their implications for monetary policy.\nAs someone who has spent much of his career at academic institutions, I am particularly\nthrilled to lead an organization that provides a forum for the sort of wide-ranging\ndiscussions and debates we will hear today.\nI want to thank Mike Dotsey, director of research, and his staff for organizing today’s\nprogram. They have brought together an all-star lineup of thought leaders from across the\ncountry. I am excited for you to hear them and so appreciative that they could join us.\nOur theme today is “The New Normal for the U.S. Economy.” What is the “new normal”?\nAs the saying goes, “It depends who you ask.” But I believe most would agree that the\nquestion is complex and that there is scope for different viewpoints. Today, we will hear\nseveral views on the U.S. economy’s current and long-term economic prospects.\nOur goal is to delve into some of the different issues and perspectives that are influencing\nour nation’s economic growth. We will cover a wide range of topics, broadly divided into\nthree areas that have an impact on our economy: technology/innovation, social factors,\nand monetary policy.\nHere at the Philadelphia Fed, economist Leonard Nakamura has been researching how the\nevolution of information and communication technology is creating measurement issues\nfor our statistics. One example is that some innovations, such as free apps and social\n1\n\nmedia, are widely used but may not generate revenue, at least not right away. Leonard\ncalls this URL — “Ubiquity now, Revenue Later.”\nIn a “URL world,” is productivity growth truly as low as it appears in the official statistics? It\nis possible that new disruptors to the economy, like free apps and social media, are making\nour progress harder to capture in current economic measures. This is a special concern for\nmonetary policy because it is possible that we are not fully capturing rising quality in our\nprice measures and that inflation is even lower than we think it is.\nThese issues have a direct bearing on the conduct of monetary policy. This is why today’s\ndiscussions on the economic impact of technology and innovation are relevant for central\nbankers. I am honored to welcome Robert Gordon and Joel Mokyr from Northwestern\nUniversity, and Erik Brynjolfsson, whose book The Second Machine Age: Work, Progress,\nand Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies was one of the highlights of my summer\nreading.\nI am also very pleased to have leaders like Daron Acemoglu, Darrell West, and Eric\nHanushek with us to address issues surrounding immigration and income inequality.\nAll of these issues have critical implications for the new normal. Our day will conclude with\nthoughts on monetary policy from two of my respected colleagues: James Bullard,\nPresident of the St. Louis Fed, and Narayana Kocherlakota, President of the Minneapolis\nFed. Narayana has served the Federal Reserve with great distinction for the past six years.\nIt has been a pleasure getting to know him, and I want to wish him the best for his future\nendeavors.\nWe all know that what the new normal will mean ultimately depends on the growth rate of\nworker productivity, the key determinant of our standard of living. Most of you are familiar\nwith Paul Krugman’s statement that while “Productivity isn’t everything, but in the long\nrun it is almost everything.”\nThe recent slowdown in productivity growth and the continuing downshift in labor force\ngrowth are prominently influencing our views of the new normal. But trends are not\ndestiny — or at least they needn’t be. The growth rate of productivity is influenced by a\nrange of factors, many of which we can influence. These include the rate of discovery of\nnew knowledge, the incentives for businesses to adopt new technologies and to provide\nthe needed on-the-job training for their workers, the effectiveness of our educational\ninstitutions in providing formal schooling, and the growth in the size of our domestic and\ninternational markets. Last but not least, it also includes the whole gamut of economic\npolicies that interact with all of those factors.\n2\n\nOur nation’s growth is one of the most important issues we face as policymakers. We know\nthat incremental changes in the standard of living will determine our future prosperity. We\nneed to be thinking about what we can do to positively influence growth rates five, 10, and\n15 years down the road.\nWhile prospects for long-term growth in the United States remain solid, the medium-term\noutlook has been revised downward in recent years. My view, which is my own and not\nnecessarily that of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (FOMC), is that we will see steady and modest growth going forward.\nGDP growth has averaged 2.2 percent since the Great Recession ended in June 2009, and\nthe most recent FOMC projections show the central tendency for long-term growth to be\nin the 1.8 to 2.2 percent range. Economic fundamentals have been improving, and we are\napproaching normalcy.\nAccordingly, I would like to see rates raised sooner rather than later. With an early start,\nwe can better ensure that monetary accommodation is removed gradually and that\ninflation returns to the Fed’s 2 percent target smoothly. My fear is that the Federal Reserve\nrisks losing its credibility and only adds uncertainty to the economic landscape the longer\nthe Committee waits to begin normalizing policy.\nTherefore, raising rates this year will, in my view, serve to reduce monetary policy\nuncertainty and to keep the economy on track for sustained growth with price stability.\nOne of the highlights of my first four months at the Fed has been the opportunity to meet\nwith people across the District. I have heard firsthand about small business challenges,\ninnovative community programs, new housing models, and much more. People’s pride,\ncommitment, and resilience are empowering. As someone who has dedicated much of his\nlife to education and developing our future leaders, I am inspired by the great potential I\nsee.\nOur challenge is to ensure that we have the resources, the vision, and the leadership to\nmake full use of our District’s potential.\nWe don’t know exactly what tomorrow will look like, but we do know it will be different.\nWe need to stay attuned to, and ahead of, those changes.\nI think you can see why I am so excited to have you here in Philadelphia for today’s\nprogram. I hope that it raises many questions and inspires more discussion and research on\nthese pressing issues.\n3\n\nThank you for joining us. I look forward to the presentations and the discussions they will\ngenerate. Please enjoy today’s program.\n4",

    "text": "Worker Voices Tell Us What the Data Do Not\nShifting Perspectives and Expectations on Employment\nA Fed Communities Virtual Event\nPhiladelphia, PA\nAugust 10, 2023\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nWorker Voices Show Us What the Data Do Not\nShifting Perspectives and Expectations on Employment\nA Fed Communities Virtual Event\nAugust 10, 2023\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThank you very much, Tameshia, for leading that enlightening discussion, and thank you to Rebecca,\nDavid, and Johnny for sharing your stories and insights.\nAnd, of course, thank you to Fed Communities and my colleagues from throughout the System —\nincluding Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, who we heard from earlier — for their partnership in the\nWorker Voices Project.\nTo be sure, we’re at a watershed moment in our economy. I’m not just talking about the fight against\ninflation, in which we’re making progress.\nIt is a watershed moment in the labor market as well, especially for those of us who look at data and try\nto interpret their meaning. But numbers have two inherent problems. First, the numbers we get are\nalways backward looking, a snapshot from an earlier time. Second, the numbers blur the faces and\nvoices of those they seek to capture; they can only tell us so much.\nThis is where discussions like this and, more specifically, efforts like the Worker Voices Project are so\nessential. For our economy at this moment, it is important for those of us who hold a responsibility for\npromoting full employment and fostering economic opportunity to know, in real time, why workers are\nmaking the decisions they are, especially workers either employed in low-wage positions or who do not\nhave a college degree.\n1\n\nAnd I also would suggest there are important messages that employers would be wise to heed\nconcerning the kind of workplace they may need to create to attract the workforce they will need to be\nsuccessful.\nBy education, I’m a civil engineer, even more than an economist. If you know anything about civil\nengineers, we’re always looking for ways to make things stronger, better, and more resilient. For me,\nthis includes our economy.\nAs we have heard from today’s discussion, the factors going into the decisions made by workers of\nwhere to work, when to work, or whether to leave the work they have previously known to blaze an\nentirely new path — like David has — are increasingly complex. And we oversimplify these complexities\nat our own peril, whether as policymakers or employers.\nCertainly, the pandemic did not create these complexities. As long as there has been work, workers have\nmade decisions about their place and role in the economy, based on a number of factors. And workers\ntoday have more choices before them. The pandemic served as a breaking point for all of these stresses\n— at few other times in history have so many seemingly come to the same conclusions about their own\nfuture in the workforce.\nThey want to be treated with respect and dignity.\nThey want to the opportunity to gain new skills that will provide them with upward mobility.\nThey don’t want a job that doesn’t just get them through the day, but the opportunity to create a\nsatisfying and high-quality career.\nThey want managers who recognize that they, like them, have families and dreams outside of work and\nstrive to ensure an appropriate work–life balance.\nThe expectation of workers is that they will be treated as individuals. And this is especially true for\nworkers in jobs at the lower ranges of the wage scale or those without degrees. Jobs are not one-size-\n2\n\nfits-all, and neither are workers. Hiring processes may be more automated, but no worker wants to be\ntreated like an automaton.\nAnd the Worker Voices Project is providing the data that put this reality into greater focus and\nperspective.\nAs a result, many of us who have studied economics are having to rethink some of the premises we had\npreviously relied upon. But that’s probably a good thing. Despite what many of us were taught in Econ\n101, the study of economics is not all straight lines and straightforward conclusions. Sometimes the\neconomy, and those contributing to it, not only bend long-established rules but contribute to the\ncreation of new ones in the process.\nWe appear to be at that kind of moment now, and the research in the Worker Voices Project is\ncontributing to this new way of thinking. Which is good, because if one thing is now crystal clear, it is\nthat workers no longer want to be treated merely as a plot point on a graph.\nFor us as policymakers, the soft data provided by Worker Voices are equally important as, if not perhaps\neven more important than, numbers-driven hard data in getting a full understanding of our economic\nsituation.\nI am excited not just about this report, but for the research that is going to grow out of it. The more we\ncan bring the examples outlined in the Worker Voices report into our way of thinking, the better our\nchances of creating a strong, growing, and more inclusive American economy.\nSo, when I hear someone utter the apocryphal question, “Why doesn’t anyone want to work anymore?”\nmy response is to ask in return, “What are you doing in your workplace to make them want to work for\nyou?” and to point them to the Worker Voices Project.\nAgain, I thank our panelists and everyone who contributed to today’s webinar. And I thank all of you\nwatching for spending part of your afternoon with us.\nWhitney, I’ll now hand the program back to you.\n3",

    "text": "An Economic Outlook\nShadow Open Market Committee\nFall 2019 Meeting\nPrinceton Club\nNew York, NY\nSeptember 27, 2019\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nAn Economic Outlook\nShadow Open Market Committee Fall 2019 Meeting\nPrinceton Club\nNew York, NY\nSeptember 27, 2019\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nIt’s a pleasure to be here today.\nOne of the great joys of this job is being surrounded by some of the world’s best economists\nand policy experts, whose ideas and insights are central to the Fed’s work and mission. On\noccasions such as today, we sometimes take the opportunity to share new research by Fed staff\nor an idea that we’ve been debating.\nSometimes life makes those choices for us.\nGiven the turmoil in the money markets last week, this seems to be one of those times.\nSo with that in mind, I’ll start with a quick outlook for the economy, then delve into what\nhappened last week, and what it means. Spoiler alert: It does not affect the stance of monetary\npolicy or have a meaningful impact on the economy.\nI thought I’d get that out there nice and early.\nAs I venture into this discussion, I’ll start with the requisite Fed disclaimer that you’ve all heard\nbefore — and that some of you have delivered yourselves — that the views I express are my\nown and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\nThe Outlook\nWith that caveat firmly in place, the headline is that my outlook hasn’t really changed.\n1\n\nThe labor market continues to show remarkable strength, and we’re creating jobs above the\nrate we need to keep pace with growth. I expect unemployment to stay below the 4 percent\nmark for the next couple of years, assuming economic conditions unfold as forecast.\nInflation has been persistently below target for some time, but it does appear to be on track to\nmeet our preferred 2 percent goal — albeit slowly — and I think we’ll get there in the next 18\nto 24 months.\nWhile concerns about growth have been amplified lately, the trajectory looks to be about on\ntrack with our recent forecasts. Consumers continue to be the engine powering growth, fueled\nby the strong labor market. I continue to see overall GDP growth for 2019 a little above 2\npercent, returning to trend of about 2 percent next year.\nThat said, there are clear downside risks, mostly posed by trade and international\ndevelopments and the uncertainty they breed. It is that uncertainty, more than anything, that is\naffecting business decisions. We hear it again and again from our contacts, it surfaces over and\nover in the Beige Book, and it’s showing up in data on confidence and investment across\nmultiple sources.\nThat leads me to a point I’ve made before. Fed watchers often note that many of us have\nthemes or phrases we return to often. Two of my most frequent are: It’s important to\nremember that growth is fundamentally the simple sum of growth in the labor force plus\ngrowth in productivity. And monetary policy is a relatively blunt tool with relatively limited\nscope. The Federal Reserve can pull the levers available to us to create a more hospitable\nenvironment for growth, but trend economic growth is driven by fiscal policy. Monetary policy\ncan’t mitigate risk or move the growth needle in a meaningful way.\nNow that I’ve delivered my oratorical calling cards, the issue people care about most: rates. My\nown view is that we should hold firm, letting things settle and watching how events play out.\nAnd with that, I’ll to turn to the other topic on everyone’s mind.\n2\n\nWhat Just Happened?\nAs a quick recap: Last week, there was unusual stress in money markets, due primarily to funds\nflowing to the Treasury to meet corporate tax payments and settle Treasury security purchases.\nThere was a significant surge in repurchase — or “repo” — rates early in the week, which put\nupward pressure on the effective federal funds rate, and, in fact, pushed it above the top of the\ntarget range on Tuesday.\nWhile interest-rate control and market functions are obviously important issues, I want to\nreiterate my opening note that they neither reflect — nor direct — the stance of monetary\npolicy. Nor do they have implications for the wider economy.\nIt’s clear that last week’s episode was triggered by the outsized flows of private sector funds to\nthe Treasury. But the dates for tax payments and bond settlements are not a surprise; they are\nfixtures of the fiscal calendar and well known to both policymakers and markets. Everyone was\nexpecting large liquidity flows.\nThe impact, however, was clearly much larger than anyone anticipated, markets included.\nThe repo market took the brunt of the impact, as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR)\nrose above 5 percent last Tuesday, with some trades executed at rates as high as 10 percent.\nWhile this was certainly not an average day, it’s important to note that the repo market didn’t\nfreeze. The volume of secured overnight finance remained steady, at the $1.2 trillion level it has\nmaintained for the past several months.\nThe funding pressures in secured markets passed through to the federal funds market. The\neffective federal funds rate rose to the top of target range on Monday the 16th, and surpassed\nthe top of the range by 5 basis points the next day.\nThat day, Tuesday, the New York Fed’s Open Market Trading Desk started repurchase\noperations to stem the pressures on money markets, and continued them for the duration of\nthe week. Additionally, two technical adjustments were agreed upon at last week’s FOMC\nmeeting: First, the interest paid on reserves was set 20 basis points below the top of the target\n3\n\nrange; and second, the overnight reverse repo rate was set 5 points below the bottom of the\ntarget range.\nThose measures successfully relieved funding pressures, and the effective fed funds not only\nmoved back within the target range, it came down to 10 basis points below the range’s ceiling\nthat Thursday and has remained there. Conditions started to normalize in repo markets as well,\nwith repo rates drifting lower on Thursday and Friday, and starting this week around 1.85\npercent. In fact, there was a significant drop in the fraction of volume in the federal funds\nmarket that traded at rates above the target range. For instance, less than 1 percent of the\ntotal fed funds volume was priced outside the target range.\nOn Friday, the Desk announced that it would initiate a series of repo operations — including\nseveral term operations — to help keep the fed funds rate within the target range. Those\noperations will continue until October 10. We have seen strong demand for repo operations\nthis week, possibly indicating that funding pressures may return on quarter-end, and the Desk\nstepped up the operation limits yesterday. As Chair Powell noted at the post-meeting press\nconference, we will continue to monitor market developments and adjust operations as\nnecessary to ensure that rates in the federal funds market stay within the target range.\nThe obvious question that arises — and indeed has been asked — is whether the current level\nof reserves is appropriate. And whether the Fed might need to expand its toolkit to better\nmanage interest rates.\nI don’t think we can adequately answer those questions without first taking a step back and\nseeing them in their wider context.\nAs you know, earlier this year, the FOMC decided that we would continue to conduct monetary\npolicy in a regime of “ample reserves,” in which control over the federal funds rate is exercised\nprimarily through the setting of administered rates, and the supply of reserves does not need to\nbe actively managed.\n4\n\nShortly after that, we announced our plan to cease asset redemptions and hold the balance\nsheet to roughly its post-redemption size. As currency and other non-reserve liabilities grow,\naggregate reserves see a natural, gradual decline. Our end game was for reserves to reach a\nlevel “consistent with efficient and effective implementation of monetary policy.”\nThere were two primary objectives to this approach. First, to reduce uncertainty about asset\npurchases by announcing our plans well in advance. Second, to approach the necessary level of\nreserves, which is itself suffused with uncertainty, with an abundance of caution.\nWe only have estimates of the demand for reserves, though we’ve conducted a great deal of\nresearch around the Federal Reserve System, including continued conversation with market\nparticipants. In fact, staff at the Philadelphia and New York Feds were among the first to\nidentify that the need for reserves could be much larger than anticipated. To be on the safe\nside, it made sense to move slowly, buying time to carefully observe market developments and\nbetter assess their implications. That is, we gave ourselves time for the inevitable “unknown\nunknowns” of life — like the one that occurred last week, just to pick an entirely random\nexample. And in fact, while they may appear jarring in the moment, temporary episodes like\nthis offer a host of information and insight.\nIt is very possible that reserves are near, or approaching, their appropriate level — that it is, as\nthe Philadelphia and New York Feds’ research noted it might be — on the higher end of our\nestimates. If that is the case, we may need to resume the organic growth of the balance sheet\nearlier than anticipated.\nWe will continue to monitor and assess money market conditions, and act as necessary to\nensure interest rate control. I think a central question is why the liquidity did not flow smoothly\nto where it was needed most.\nI’ll once again save you any suspense: I have more questions than answers. I think it’s important\nto avoid jumping to conclusions, and I certainly wouldn’t write any prescriptions — policy or\notherwise — before we know what ailed the markets.\n5\n\nIn the oft-used analogy of the money markets as plumbing, we should ask whether some pipes\nmight be rusty. Or clogged. Or if more might be needed.\nIt is also worth asking if regulation might be contributing to any erosion or blockage that might\nexist.\nThe second question is whether the Fed ought to expand our toolkit. As many of you will have\nnoted from the June FOMC minutes, there was a discussion about the possibility of a standing-\nrepo facility. In theory, this could provide a backstop against unusual spikes in the federal funds\nand other money market rates. These discussions are in their infancy, and there is more work to\nbe done, particularly in considering how such a facility would be designed, what its objectives\nwould be, and what its net benefits would be relative to alternative approaches.\nConclusion\nAll in all, I see three key takeaways from this interlude. First, in the face of unexpected turmoil,\nthe Fed took swift and appropriate action, and it appears to be having the desired effect.\nSecond, the element of surprise suggests some deeper issues may be at play. And third, that\nthe Fed is committed to do what it takes to maintain interest rate control, and we will continue\nto keep a watchful eye.\n6",

    "text": "Giving the Economy Time to Catch Its Breath\nMortgage Bankers Association Annual Convention and Expo\nPennsylvania Convention Center\nPhiladelphia, PA\nOctober 16, 2023\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nGiving the Economy Time to Catch Its Breath\nMortgage Bankers Associa�on Annual Conven�on and Expo\nPennsylvania Conven�on Center\nPhiladelphia, PA\nOctober 16, 2023\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Execu�ve Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood morning.\nMy thanks to the Mortgage Bankers Associa�on for the opportunity to be part of your annual conven�on\nand to Chair-elect Laura Escobar for that introduc�on.\nAnd, with that, welcome to the City of Philadelphia and the Third Federal Reserve District.\nI am honored to share this podium with my fellow speakers and to provide my outlook for economic\ncondi�ons moving forward.\nBut before I do that, there is one piece of business to which I must atend, and that is the usual Federal\nReserve disclaimer: The views I express are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else\non the Federal Open Market Commitee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\nOr, if I may give the Cliffs Notes version: When recoun�ng my remarks, please just say, “Pat said,” not\n“The Fed said.”\nLet me put it plainly: I stand here this morning fully aware of the mood in this room. And I am also fully\naware of the way the ac�ons we on the FOMC have taken over the past 18 months in our efforts to tame\ninfla�on and get it back down to our 2 percent annual target have, in their own way, contributed to the\ncurrent mortgage climate.\n1\n\nAs you know, one of the pillars of the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate is price stability — ge�ng infla�on\nback to that 2 percent annual target. And while I am sensi�ve to the impacts higher policy rates have\nhad, that goal remains job one.\nThroughout the summer, I traveled with my team throughout the Third District — as we do every year —\nto meet with community bankers and other contacts in their home communi�es, to talk about\ncondi�ons on the ground, to hear their perspec�ves and concerns, and to see firsthand the impacts of\nmonetary policy on the local level.\nSuffice it to say, the impact of rising mortgage rates was something that took front and center in nearly\nevery conversa�on. In fact, the climate could be crystalized in seven words, which one of those contacts\nsaid to me recently: “There are no first-�me home buyers.”\nThat’s a stark assessment. And it is one I take without further parsing. The housing market is key for our\neconomy overall, not to men�on its greater importance for our society as a whole in ensuring that every\nfamily has access to a safe and affordable place to call home.\nThe rise in interest rates not only raised borrowing costs on those looking to purchase a home, but it also\ncontributed to the contrac�on of inventory. It is completely understandable that current homeowners\nwon’t put their houses on the market and step away from their current low-rate mortgages.\nAnd it is just simple market dynamics that a lack of inventory would elevate prices overall, further\nlessening the depth of the pool of poten�al buyers.\nOf course, the other side of this coin is new home sales, which both the hard data show and our contacts\nrelay are trending upward throughout this period. This, too, makes sense from the view of market\ndynamics — the way around contrac�ng inventory in exis�ng homes is to purchase a home that didn’t\nexist before. And we know these homes o�en come with atrac�ve ameni�es and features an exis�ng\nhome may not, including being more energy efficient and decreasing the cost of keeping that home\ncomfortable.\n2\n\nBut, again, these sales cannot fully make up for the overall slowdown in one of the economy’s most\nimpac�ul sectors.\nNow, I’m not going to stand here and provide a lecture on things you all know. And I am not going to\nminimize the work we’ve done to get infla�on moving back toward target. What I want to provide you\nwith this morning is where I see things moving forward.\nTo start, I remain in the place where I have found myself for the past several months: Absent a stark turn\nin what I see in the data and hear from contacts, and audiences like you, I believe that we are at the\npoint where we can hold rates where they are.\nA�er our last policy rate hike in July, I went on the record with my view that, if economic and financial\ncondi�ons evolve roughly as I expect, we can hold rates where they are. And, so far, economic and\nfinancial condi�ons are evolving as I expected, perhaps even a tad beter.\nDisinfla�on is under way, labor markets are coming into beter balance, and economic ac�vity continues\nto be resilient.\nLooking back, we did a lot, and we did it very fast. In fact, I heard that summa�on from some of your\npeers throughout the summer. In barely more than a year, we increased the policy rate by more than 5\npercentage points and to its highest level in more than two decades. We also turned around our balance\nsheet policy, and we turned it around fast.\nThe workings of the economy cannot be rushed, and it will take some �me for the full impact of the\nhigher rates to be fully absorbed. What I have heard this summer is an appeal to give you and your\ncustomers the thing you wanted most: �me to catch your breath.\nBut my argument is that by doing nothing, we are doing something. And I think we are doing quite a lot.\nLook where we are — headline PCE infla�on remained elevated in August at 3.5 percent year over year,\nbut it is down 3 percentage points from this �me last year.\n3\n\nAbout half of that drop is due to the vola�le components of energy and food, so despite both of these\nbeing basic necessi�es of life, economists typically exclude them in the so-called core infla�on rate,\nwhich gives a more accurate assessment of the pace of disinfla�on and its likely path forward.\nBut even that core measure of PCE infla�on has also shown clear signs of progress, and the August\nmonthly reading was its smallest month-over-month increase since 2020.\nAnd again, I’m telling you something you already know, the rate of infla�on in housing prices is similarly\ndown from its peak levels.\nI do see a steady disinfla�on under way, and I expect it to con�nue, with infla�on dropping below 3\npercent in 2024 and leveling out at our 2 percent target therea�er.\nHowever, there can be challenges in assessing the trends in disinfla�on. For example, September’s CPI\nreport came out modestly on the upside, driven by energy and housing.\nLet me be clear about two things. First, I will not tolerate a reaccelera�on in prices. But second, I do not\nwant to overreact to the normal month-to-month variability of prices.\nAnd for all the fancy techniques, the best way to separate a signal from noise remains to average data\nover several months. Of course, to do so, you need several months of data to start with, which, in turn,\ndemands that, yes, we remain data dependent but pa�ent and cau�ous with the data.\nAs long as policy rates are restric�ve, we will keep steadily pressing down on infla�on and bringing\nmarkets into beter balance.\nAnd the policy rate has outside factors that are working in parallel to further push down on infla�on. For\nexample, while we are now six months past the spring banking turmoil, the �ghter credit condi�ons that\nhave existed since then are having the impact of higher interest rates without requiring them to be so.\n4\n\nAddi�onally, the current turmoil in labor markets is likely to similarly exert downward pressure on the\neconomy — not just in the loss of overall economic ac�vity but in the immediate impact on consumer\nspending as striking auto workers, for example, are forgoing their usual wages.\nOn top of this, we can also add the resump�on of student loan payments. Again, we do not yet know\nwhat impact this will have on consumer spending and savings, but I do expect it to be impac�ul, if not\nsignificant.\nSo, it is against this backdrop that I believe the prudent posi�on to be in is one in which the policy rate\ncan remain steady. Alas, you may have no�ced that I didn’t tell you how long rates will need to stay high.\nUnfortunately, I simply cannot tell you at this moment. My forecasts are based on what I know as of\n10:30 a.m. on Monday, October 16, 2023.\nAs �me goes by, as adjustments are completed, and as we have more data and insights on the\nunderlying trends, I may need to adjust my forecasts, and with them my �me frames. But, as for future\npolicy, I can tell you I do subscribe to the moniker, “higher for longer.” I didn’t coin the phrase, but my\nexpecta�on is that rates will need to stay high for a while.\nIt is not just the data that will signal to me when the �me comes to adjust policy either way, but what I\nalso hear from contacts and through outreach.\nA�er all, my discussions over the summer helped lead me to my current posi�on. And while I really do\nnot expect it, if infla�on were to rebound, I know I would not hesitate to support further rate increases\nas our objec�ve to return infla�on to target is, simply, not nego�able.\nMeanwhile, I con�nue to see strong underpinnings for our economy overall. This economy is proving to\nbe nothing if not resilient. I expect this to con�nue.\nGDP growth is outperforming es�mates from earlier this year. I do expect GDP gains to con�nue through\nthe end of 2023, before pulling back slightly in 2024. But do not conflate a more moderate rate of GDP\ngrowth as a contrac�on. Put simply: I do not an�cipate a recession.\n5\n\nOf course, to afford a home, a family needs a job to provide the means through which to purchase it. I\ncon�nue to an�cipate unemployment to end the year at about 4 percent — just slightly above where we\nare now — and to increase slowly over the next year to peak around 4.5 percent before heading back\ntoward 4 percent in 2025.\nThis path would put the unemployment figure in line with the natural rate of unemployment, or that\ntheore�cal level where labor market condi�ons support stable 2 percent infla�on.\nNow, let me be clear about one thing: This does not mean that I expect mass layoffs.\nThere are many factors that play into the calcula�on of the unemployment rate itself. For instance, we’ve\nhad recent months in which, even as the economy added more jobs, the unemployment rate increased\nbecause more workers moved off the sidelines and back into the labor force.\nI also have to balance the so� data. For example, I have heard from employers — both directly and\nthrough contacts — that given how hard they’ve worked to find the workers they currently have, they\nare doing all they can to hold onto them.\nThen there are also factors that have a very persistent impact on the underlying dynamics of the\neconomy and the labor market — technological change, immigra�on, child care all can shape or reshape\nlabor markets. And some or all of these factors can be at play simultaneously.\nThe amount of upheaval we’ve felt in our economy in a rela�vely short period of �me may lead some to\nbelieve that there are fundamental changes taking place. I would argue that’s only natural, given what\nwe’ve all been through since March 2020.\nThe pandemic was such a large health and economic crisis that it marks a “before” and an “a�er” in our\nminds and lives, not the least of which was the tremendous loss of life that touched so many of us very\nclosely. I cannot blame anyone who says that the new normal s�ll does not feel normal.\n6\n\nBut let me conclude by posing the following rhetorical ques�on: What in the economy has\nfundamentally changed from, say, 2018 or 2019? In 2018, infla�on averaged 2 percent almost to the\ndecimal point and was actually below target in 2019. Unemployment averaged below 4 percent for both\nyears and was as low as 3.5 percent, while policy rates peaked below 2.5 percent.\nNow, I’m not saying that we’re going to be able to exactly replicate prepandemic economic condi�ons.\nBut the resilience of this economy is making me rethink some of the classic models.\nI have been wrong before, and this economy is challenging us with its willingness to do what the\nmodels say it should not and cannot be able to do. But, as they say, every challenge comes with\nopportunity.\nOpportunity to look at the data in different ways. And opportunity to get out and to speak with contacts\nfor the all-important so� data, which, so o�en, captures nuances that the hard data cannot.\nAll of this — the hard data and the so� data — must be viewed together. And when it is, I believe my\nposi�on on holding the policy rate steady is the prudent one to take.\nI believe such a resolute, but pa�ent, stance of monetary policy will allow us to achieve the so t landing\nthat we all wish for our economy. And with that landing, we’ll be able to see our economy take off\nagain, but this �me on a clear and stable path forward.\nI thank you all for the opportunity to be with you today. I wish you the very best for a produc�ve\nconven�on.\nThank you.\n7",

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nThe Opportunity Gap and How to Fix It\n2021 AL DÍA Roundtable\nBack to Work: Leveraging Your Skills to Find Better Opportunities\nPhiladelphia, PA (virtual)\nMarch 3, 2021\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood morning! It’s really great to be here. The kind of research we’re going to be discussing today is\nabsolutely critical to building a healthy economy that supports all Americans — and just as important as\nthe work the Fed does on monetary policy and interest rates. So I’m really pleased to see so many of you\nhere.\nI’m also happy to be here on this day in particular. Today is the 156th anniversary of the founding of the\nFreedman’s Savings Bank, which was created after the Civil War to help develop the financial\nindependence of African Americans following the abolition of slavery.\nNow, before I proceed, whenever I’m talking about any of the work the Fed does, I have to provide the\nstandard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of\nanyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or in the Federal Reserve System.\nIn a few minutes, you’re going to hear all about our Occupational Mobility Explorer, a truly exciting tool\nthat I think will help to move the needle when it comes to helping transition people into family-\nsustaining careers. We know that it’s not just a skills gap that is holding many people back, but it’s an\nopportunity gap as well. The Explorer is designed with that in mind.\n1\n\nBut before we do that, I think it’s worth addressing why the Occupational Mobility Explorer is so\nimportant, particularly for Black and Latino communities here in our area and across the country. Simply\nput, Black and Latino workers are struggling more than others. That’s a trend that long predated the\npandemic — and that has also only been heightened by it.\nIn the state of Pennsylvania, the Black unemployment rate is 17.2 percent, and the White\nunemployment rate is 7.8 percent. Labor participation is also lower among African Americans than other\ngroups.\nAnd across the country, the picture looks grimly similar: Nationally, Black unemployment stands at 9.2\npercent versus 5.7 percent for White workers. Meanwhile, the country’s unemployment rate for Latinos\nis 8.7 percent.\nWomen across all races have also been severely impacted by the pandemic. Nearly 3 million women\nhave dropped out of the formal labor force since the COVID-19 pandemic began.\nEven with some hopeful signs as virus cases fall and the economy continues to reopen, I’m concerned\nthat, as the broader economy climbs upward, far too many workers are being left behind. As of late last\nyear, 75 percent of GDP losses from the COVID-19 pandemic had been recouped — but only 60 percent\nof job losses had been reversed. Those job losses have been concentrated among racial and ethnic\nminorities and women. We also know that, after prior recessions, it took longer for Black and Latino\nunemployment rates to drop than it did for other groups.\nStructural barriers have impeded the progress of minorities and women since even before the founding\nof the country. And today, forces like job segregation, inequality in education, and sometimes even\noutright discrimination continue to hold back far too many of our fellow Americans.\nThat’s why it’s imperative that in striving to redress our country’s stark inequities, we focus on root and\nbranch reform rather than quick fixes.\nHere at the Philadelphia Fed, that means our approach acknowledges and examines the root causes of\nemployment disparities; targets interventions to disproportionately affected populations; removes\n2\n\nbarriers to work, training, and education; encourages improved job quality and support for workers; and\nincreases access to career pathways that lead to financial stability. I’m an engineer by trade, and I know\nthe importance of building sturdy foundations.\nBuilding a more equitable economy is not just ― in my view ― an urgent moral task, but an important\none for our economy as well. According to my colleagues at the San Francisco Fed, the economic loss\nowing to racial and gender disparities in our labor market stands at around $2.6 trillion. The bottom line\n― quite literally ― is that we will all benefit from a more inclusive economy.\nThat’s why today’s conversation is so important: It is about helping the incredibly talented people in our\nregion connect to opportunities, leverage their skills, and connect with training and job placement\nprograms.\nSo, thank you again for joining us today. And now over to you, Keith.\n3",

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nHello! It’s great to be here in La Jolla. I didn’t realize when I received an invitation from GIC that this\nevent would have a connection to the Super Bowl. As we flew over Arizona, I saw that my connection\nwould be ever so slight — and that the closest I’d get to game tickets would be passing over the stadium\nat 30,000 feet. Go, Eagles!\nThis really is a terrific program, and we’ve already had some informative sessions. So, thank you to GIC\nfor having me and to all of you for joining us today.\nI would like to talk a bit today about the rapidly evolving payments landscape and, in particular, how the\nCOVID-19 pandemic brought unique challenges to American families and accelerated changes that were\nalready in motion. After I deliver my prepared remarks, we can have an open discussion, which I’m very\nmuch looking forward to.\nI will be measuring the economic and financial implications of the pandemic the way economists do,\nwith dollars and percentages and trends. But I do not forget that the pandemic has been — first and\nforemost — a humanitarian tragedy of global scale. More than 6.5 million people perished from the\nvirus, including more than 1 million of our fellow Americans. And those numbers would have been much\nworse if not for the many public health workers, and others in essential businesses, who stepped up so\nthat others could stay safe.\n1\n\nConsumer finance is an important area of study at the Philadelphia Fed, where our CFI — Consumer\nFinance Institute — continues to pursue path-breaking research. Simply put, the way Americans spend,\nsave, and invest has profound consequences for the financial industry, the broader economy, and, of\ncourse, American families. Understanding consumer finance patterns — how they change and how they\nwill continue to evolve — is vital to the Federal Reserve’s mission of fostering an economy where\neveryone can prosper.\nAnd speaking of the Federal Reserve, here is where I give you my standard Fed disclaimer: The views I\nexpress today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\nI think we all know that the COVID-19 pandemic changed a lot about American society. Some changes,\nsuch as our inability to convene for events like this one, were thankfully fleeting. But in many areas, the\npandemic simply accelerated changes that were already taking place, and it is quite natural to think that\nthose changes are more likely to remain. To disentangle the fleeting from the long lasting, we need to\nlook at how consumer finance was already changing prior to the pandemic and how the American\npeople — and the institutions that serve them — reacted to the unprecedented circumstances of the\npandemic.\nToday I’ll share some of what we’ve seen in the realms of liquidity, spending, and adoption of new\nfinancial tools over the last few years.\nLiquidity\nI’d like to begin by considering the effect of the pandemic on Americans’ access to liquidity, primarily in\nthe form of cash holdings and checking account balances. A staggering 20 million workers lost their jobs\nin April 2020, and while many were rapidly rehired, total employment only returned to pre-pandemic\nlevels two years later. Data collected in November 2020 in the CFI COVID-19 Survey of Consumers\nindicated that more than half of the respondents had experienced some type of disruption to their\nemployment or income since the beginning of the pandemic. As we know, one of the principal federal\nresponses to the crisis was to provide direct stimulus payments (through the CARES Act) and enhanced\nunemployment benefits to Americans. How did these relief measures pass through to consumers’\nwallets?\n2\n\nThe pandemic certainly made life unpredictable; we can all attest to that. The Diary of Consumer\nPayment Choice found that consumers continued to demand cash in that uncertain environment. This\nFederal Reserve survey showed that, on average, consumers held 25 percent more cash in their wallets\nin 2020 than they did in 2019. This figure dropped in 2021 to be more in line with pre-pandemic levels.\nSimilarly, consumers held more cash at home, in the car, or elsewhere in both 2020 and in 2021 than\nthey did in 2019 by significant amounts.\nTurning to checking account balances, the Fed’s Survey of Consumer Finances showed a generally rising\ntrend in checking and similar balances through 2019, but unfortunately, the timing of that triennial\nsurvey did not align well with the crisis.\nI would instead turn to some of the most timely information available on balances in consumer checking\naccounts during the pandemic, published by the JPMorgan Chase Institute. The underlying data are\nbased on a representative sample of their checking account customers. Keeping in mind that those\ncustomers may not be entirely representative of checking or deposit account holders in general, it still\nprovides some illuminating information.\nAccording to the JPMorgan Chase Institute, the median balance in checking accounts increased\nsignificantly from late 2019, spiking at various times matching the largest disbursements of stimulus\nfunds, enhanced unemployment support, and tax refunds. While this phenomenon occurred broadly\nacross their study population, some of the largest increases were seen in the more vulnerable groups.\nDespite this seemingly positive news, it’s important to keep in mind that many of these changes were\nthe result of temporary relief measures implemented by the government. It is unlikely that permanent\nchange takes hold in the overall liquidity of households, particularly of lower-income households. In\nJune 2022, median checking account balances remained significantly higher than they were in 2019, but\nthey were also significantly lower than their peak values realized in March 2021. And while many low-\nincome consumers had some of the largest increases, a sizable share have average balances lower in\nmid-2022 than prior to the pandemic. As we move further into the post-pandemic economy, it will be\ncrucial to understand which phenomena are likely to revert to the previous norms and which are\nsustainable, and for whom.\n3\n\nPayments\nWe saw quite profound changes in the way Americans made payments throughout the pandemic. These\nshifts speak to the adaptability of the American people and the financial system during unprecedented\ncircumstances. However, it is also true that many of these changes were already in motion prior to the\npandemic.\nLet me now take a moment to describe what we were seeing before the pandemic. Up until the end of\n2019, there was a gradual decline in the share of consumer transactions that used cash for payments,\nand a much more rapid decline in the number and value of paper checks used to make payments. ACH\ntransactions — typically direct deposit and some bill payments — were growing but no longer as quickly\nas they had over previous decades.\nUnmistakable was the rapid growth in the number and value of credit and debit card payments. Among\nthose, consumer purchases online, typically made by credit and debit cards, outpaced card transactions\nused for in-store purchases. Finally, contactless card payments, digital wallets, and peer-to-peer (P2P)\npayments facilitated by companies like Zelle and Venmo, while still relatively uncommon, were clearly\ngrowing.\nThen COVID-19 hit. And like so much else, the way Americans spent changed drastically.\nThe Federal Reserve Payments Study did a comprehensive job describing the shifts in noncash payments\nthat occurred in the first year of the pandemic. For one, the number of card payments — credit, debit,\nand prepaid — declined in 2020. This was unprecedented. The total dollar value of card payments grew\nslightly, but that growth was well below trend. Industry sources confirm that the weakness was\nprimarily in credit cards. In fact, the value of debit transactions increased substantially in 2020, relative\nto 2019. This shift from credit to debit cards began to reverse in late 2021, with the value of credit\ntransactions growing more rapidly than debit.\nUnpacking these top-level shifts, the mix of in-person and remote payments also changed in these early\npandemic years: In 2018, the total value of in-person and remote payments were about the same, but in\n2020, the value of remote payments exceeded that of in-person card payments by 10 percentage points.\nThis may be a more persistent change because while consumers have resumed going to restaurants and\n4\n\ngrocery stores, they appear to be still making relatively fewer in-person payments in those locations,\npossibly because they can pay remotely and then pick up their goods.\nThe pandemic also appears to have contributed to significant growth in several recent payment\ninnovations. The growth in the use of contactless cards, for instance, accelerated even while the number\nof in-person payments declined. Contactless payments now account for 4.6 percent of the number of in-\nperson payments, more than double its share in 2019. There was a similar effect for P2P payments and\ndigital wallets. In the first half of 2020, 18 percent of deposit accounts experienced their first P2P\npayment, and 11 percent of credit or debit card accounts experienced their first digital wallet payment. I\ndo not expect these changes to reverse.\nWe talked about cash as a means of storing liquidity, but what about cash as a means of payment? To\nexamine those trends, we look again to the Diary of Consumer Payment Choice. The latest summaries of\nthis survey report that the share of payment transactions made with cash has been falling over time, fell\nprecipitously in 2020, and then actually rose slightly in 2021 as in-person transactions picked up. A bit of\na roller coaster, then. But the bottom line is that the cash share of payments remains well below pre-\npandemic levels — this being a clear example of the pandemic accelerating change that was already in\nmotion.\nFinally, as is often the case, we can learn the most by going directly to the source — in this case, the\nconsumers. Late last year, the Philadelphia Fed’s CFI did just that, asking consumers whether they were\nusing specific forms of payment more or less than they were in 2021. On net, consumers reported using\ncash and checks less and contactless cards more. They also indicated they were using P2P apps and\nmobile payment apps more frequently. As is typically the case, younger consumers tend to be the most\nlikely adopters of payment innovations. Roughly speaking, this suggests that indeed the pandemic\naccelerated the longer-run trends of declining use for paper forms of payment and a more robust\nadoption of new, electronic ways of making payments.\nCryptocurrency\nAnd now for something that can’t get lost between a seat cushion: the latest newcomers to the\nlandscape, cryptocurrencies. As you surely know, cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual currencies (such\nas Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and many others) in which transactions are verified and records are\n5\n\nmaintained by a decentralized, distributed ledger system using cryptography, rather than by a\ncentralized authority.\nSince the early 2010s, the rise of so-called cryptocurrencies has received significant attention from\nfinancial market participants, policymakers, and academics.\nCryptocurrencies have been marketed in a variety of ways. Early in their existence, they were touted as\na more secure and anonymous method of payment, and a means of keeping funds out of the traditional\nbanking system, while recent messaging has shifted to their value as an investment vehicle.\nCryptocurrency markets have gained a reputation for high volatility in recent years, with rapid price\nincreases and decreases over relatively short periods. For a considerable stretch of time, beginning in\nearly 2019, prices trended up significantly, leading to a perception of cryptocurrencies as lucrative\ninvestment vehicles. Beginning in early 2022, however, the cryptocurrency market experienced what is\ndescribed by some as a crypto winter, a prolonged bear market that resulted in a nearly $2 trillion loss in\nmarket value, coin and exchange collapses, and damage to a number of financial services firms that are\nclosely aligned to the crypto space.\nIn January 2022, CFI, in conjunction with economists from the Federal Reserve Board, included\nquestions related to cryptocurrency ownership and opinions in the CFI COVID-19 Survey of Consumers.\nThe survey gave us a basic understanding of the adoption of, and attitudes toward, cryptocurrencies\namong the survey population, with special attention paid to differences across demographic groups. The\nresults of that survey are found in a CFI Research Brief published in December and available on the\nPhiladelphia Fed’s website.\nIn the months since that survey was conducted, the drastic change in prices and associated turmoil —\nagain, the recent period referred to as a crypto winter — likely contributed to a shift in attitudes\nregarding cryptocurrencies among owners and nonowners alike. Therefore, in October 2022, we again\nsurveyed consumers to see how perceptions of cryptocurrencies had changed. I’d like to share some\nhighlights from our published report and touch on some new, previously unpublished, information\nbased on the new survey.\nIn the survey fielded last January, we found that almost one-quarter of respondents, or someone in their\nimmediate family, owned cryptocurrency at that time. Most current crypto owners had acquired those\nassets recently. More than two-thirds of crypto owners last January had acquired their first crypto assets\n6\n\nwithin the previous 12 months, almost a third in the previous six months. This surge in adoption took\nplace in a media environment that saw massive increases in the marketing of cryptocurrencies during\n2021. Unlike many of the other changes discussed, the rise of cryptocurrency does not seem to be\ndirectly related to the pandemic, though an environment of low rates, ample liquidity, and, quite\nfrankly, more time at home may have all contributed.\nThe survey asked owners about why they chose to purchase crypto. Just under 30 percent of crypto\nowners cited financial reasons, though some viewed their purchases as short-term investments in\nanticipation of rapid appreciation, while others were looking for long-term investments for stable\ngrowth. Almost one-quarter of crypto owners had acquired their assets out of simple curiosity, and just\nunder 20 percent suggested their decision was influenced either by family or social media. A relatively\nsmall share of crypto owners — around 15 percent — suggested they had acquired their assets primarily\nbecause they expected to use them for transactional purposes.\nWe also asked about future crypto purchase plans. In January 2022, slightly more than half of the\nexisting crypto owners (55 percent) said they were likely to buy more crypto. Nonowners remained\nskeptical, with less than 7 percent of them saying they were likely to buy crypto in the future.\nDemographic analysis of crypto ownership for the most part conforms with our usual expectations. For\nexample, crypto ownership is relatively more common among younger respondents and respondents\nreporting higher incomes. This is consistent with research suggesting that these are categories of\nconsumers who are more likely to be early adopters of new financial tools and technologies. Similarly,\nthe likelihood of owning crypto assets was higher among respondents who were also engaged in mobile\nand P2P payments or mobile banking.\nMen were more likely than women to own crypto assets. Black and Hispanic respondents were more\nlikely to own crypto assets than White respondents.\nNow let’s turn to what we learned when we examined the responses from consumers in the more\nrecent October 2022 survey. Keep in mind that respondents to the January survey had yet to go through\nthe crypto winter, while the October respondents had already lived through most of it. And it shows.\nCrypto ownership among respondents decreased significantly, from 25 percent in January 2022 to 19\npercent in October. We observed decreases in the rate of ownership across nearly all demographic\ngroups. Nevertheless, the relative concentration of crypto ownership across the population changed\n7\n\nlittle: Younger, male, more affluent, or non-White consumers remain the most engaged demographic\ngroups with crypto.\nFuture plans to purchase more crypto assets cooled, with less than 40 percent of October’s owners\nindicating that they will likely buy more in the future. Remember that, in January, more than half of\nrespondents said they had future plans to purchase more crypto.\nDespite the crypto winter, short- and long-term investment remain the most commonly chosen reasons\nfor buying crypto. Indeed, these reasons seem to have become more important. In October, 35 percent\nof crypto owners cited long-term growth as a principal reason for owning; that is an increase from 29\npercent of crypto owners last January. Somewhat less surprisingly, crypto owners in October were less\nlikely to cite social reasons for holding these assets than were crypto owners last January.\nInterestingly, curiosity remained strong as a purchase reason, increasing from 24 percent of crypto\nowners in January to nearly 30 percent of crypto owners in October. We see this as an indicator that\nthere is still interest among consumers in cryptocurrencies, with the depressed prices of the crypto\nwinter possibly providing an opportunity to satisfy that interest for some.\nWhat do we take from these data? In many ways, it is what we would expect to see from a market after\na downturn: Participation and interest in the market both decreased as groups of consumers shy away\nfrom risk. The strength of investment and experimentation as reasons for participation in the market has\nremained steady and the socioeconomic groups most likely to acquire cryptocurrencies haven’t\nmaterially changed. These patterns seem to suggest that cryptocurrencies will remain in demand by\ncertain consumers despite the recent crypto winter.\nConclusion\nSo, I realize I’ve thrown a lot of data at you. And although we are convening in a college town today, I\npromise there won’t be a quiz. But I am going to assign some homework. Have a look at the Consumer\nFinance section on the Philadelphia Fed website; you’ll find some very interesting work there.\nWhat I do think is that these data offer unique insights about the way American society responded to\nthe COVID-19 pandemic and its unprecedented strain. It allows us to discern which changes are likely to\nbe fleeting and which ones were already in motion prior to the pandemic and are likely to be long\nlasting.\n8\n\nWe saw how pandemic-era policies and lifestyle shifts led to a run-up in household liquidity; however,\noverall, this run-up is not likely to be sustainable for everyone.\nWe saw Americans embrace new ways of making payments as they, first, shifted to online shopping, and\nthen made changes to their payment habits that apparently have real staying power.\nAnd we’ve seen how consumers responded to dramatic changes in the cryptocurrency markets, slowing,\nbut likely not reversing, the growth of that sector in the coming years.\nWhat we have yet to see is how these shifts will play out in the long run — and how they will affect the\nFederal Reserve’s solemn responsibility of fostering an economy where all Americans can thrive.\nSo, thanks again for having me. Now let’s get to the discussion.\n9",

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nWhat to Expect When You’re Expecting to Normalize Monetary Policy\nGlobal Interdependence Center’s Central Banking Series\nTokyo, Japan\nNovember 13, 2017\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood morning. It truly is a pleasure to be here, and I’d like to thank our hosts for their\nexceptional hospitality and such exquisite surroundings. In cases like this, you feel compelled to\nreciprocate, by way of cultural exchange, with some emblem of your country. But I realize that\nsome of what we hold to be quintessentially American — from blue jeans to baseball — have\nbeen so embraced, and dare I say even so improved in some cases, that they’re also\nquintessentially Japanese. I find, therefore, that the remaining, unique tradition I can share is this:\nthe standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily\nreflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\nWith that out of the way, I’ll begin by noting the subject of today’s panel: How to cope with\nunconventional policy. I suppose this stands out to me because, while unconventional policy\ncertainly needs to be managed and requires an adjustment by both policymakers and markets, it\nis, overall, a coping mechanism in and of itself. Each of us turned to these tools to address our\nown situations during and after the financial crisis. Unconventional policy was the salve to the\ncrisis’s wounds.\nThe Road to Normal\nEach of us on this panel, and indeed in this room, brings a different perspective on how those\npolicies played out. But we’re all more or less on the same path; we’re just at different points on\na journey that ultimately leads to normalization. In the U.S., we’re a bit farther along than our\ncounterparts and, as such, can be looked at as something of a test case, though the cynic might\n1\n\ncompare us instead to the canary in the proverbial coal mine. In either case, our steps so far can\nprove illuminating, and some of our research and discoveries may prove informative as well.\nThe caveat, of course, is that there are a few differences in the case of the U.S. Unlike many in\nthis room, the U.S. did not enter into a regime of negative rates. Instead, we lowered the fed\nfunds rate to essentially zero, then engaged in three rounds of quantitative easing when rates\nfailed to adequately spur recovery. We aren’t alone in that experience, although we are farther\nahead in terms of normalization. And the last qualification: In the grand tradition of Americans\nretaining the imperial measurement and Fahrenheit systems, monetary policy implementation in\nthe U.S. is just different enough than others’ to make exact translation difficult.\nThat said, I believe our experience can still be informative.\nUnconventional Policy and the Fed’s Balance Sheet\nAs a quick reminder, I’ll offer a brief history of U.S. monetary policy during and after the crash.\nWhen lowering rates to near-zero failed to jump-start the economy, we turned, as most of us here\ndid, to unconventional policies, which were primarily driven by large-scale asset purchases, or\nLSAPs — a phrase policy wonks concede we have lost the battle on, so I’ll simply refer to the\nprogram by its better known moniker of quantitative easing, or QE.\nQE involved buying more and different assets than our usual practice of holding mostly short-\nterm Treasuries. We purchased longer-term Treasuries and bought mortgage-backed securities.\nThe balance sheet swelled to approximately $4.5 trillion, a significant increase from the roughly\n$900 billion balance before the onset of the crisis.\nSince late 2014, when we ended the purchases, we’ve been reinvesting the proceedings as\nthey’ve reached maturity, keeping the balance sheet constant, until last month.\nA modest rate hike in December of 2015 signaled the first baby steps toward normalization.\nWe’ve since raised them three more times, by 25 basis points each time, and I still have another\n25 basis point rate increase penciled in for this year, although perhaps I should say, “lightly\npenciled in.”\n2\n\nUnwinding\nThat, of course, is not the only mechanism by which normalization must occur. In our September\nFOMC meeting, we voted to start the process of unwinding the balance sheet, commencing last\nmonth. The size of the balance sheet is larger than we’ve ever seen, and the MBS in particular\nrenders its makeup different than before the crisis. Current assets are made up primarily of those\nTreasuries and MBS, while the liability side overwhelmingly consists of paper currency and\nbank reserves and balances and, to a much lesser extent, the overnight reverse repurchase — or\nreverse repo — facility.\nIt’s true that we haven’t faced exactly this type of normalization before — no one has — but it’s\nalso true that it’s unlikely to be remotely interesting as a policy event, except as a chapter in\nsome future generation’s economics textbook. It will be slow, deliberate, boring, and essentially\non autopilot.\nTo look at what we’ve done — and are planning to do — and to consider what lessons that could\nhold for other central banks, we should go back to first principles.\n“Why,” for instance, is a legitimate question. It is possible to maintain an exorbitantly large\nbalance sheet and let the growth of the economy eventually render it proportional.\nFrom my perspective, removing accommodation is the right next step for a few reasons.\nMonetary policy in the United States has been very accommodative for close to a decade. The\neconomy now is more or less at full strength: There’s very little slack left in the labor market and\ngrowth has kept pace with our projections. Inflation is still below the Fed’s target rate and is the\none area that not only continues to elicit caution, it even constitutes a conundrum … I won’t get\ninto too much detail, but some work by my staff suggests that the Phillips curve has not been a\ngood predictor of inflation over the past several decades.1 I do think we have to be cautious,\ntherefore, about how we’re measuring inflation. At the same time, I don’t advocate throwing out\nall conventional economic positions with the bathwater. With a labor market this tight, inflation\n1 Michael Dotsey, Shigeru Fujita, and Tom Stark, “Do Phillips Curves Conditionally Help to Forecast Inflation?”\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia Working Paper 17-26, August 2017.\n3\n\nis likely to reassert itself at some point. All of which is to say that as we near the point of full\nhealth, it makes sense to return policy to a more normal stance.\nThis is also about keeping our powder dry. In the event of another shock to the system, I want\nour tools to be at their most effective and, in my view, that means reducing our balance sheet.\nAdditionally, as productivity has dropped, it’s taken the neutral funds rate with it, making the\nzero lower bound closer and resulting in less room for maneuver with the funds rate, which will\ncontinue to be our primary monetary policy tool.\nIn the case of rates returning to zero, then, if something were to happen — if another crisis were\nto occur — further asset purchases may prove less effective, or perhaps simply more difficult and\ncostly to execute, with a large balance sheet still in place.\nThe famous line is that the Fed takes away the punch bowl just as the party is getting good. I\ndon’t think we’re taking away the bowl; I think we’re making sure there’s enough punch for the\nfuture.\nSlow, Predictable, and Utterly Unexciting\nIn making the decision to start bringing the balance sheet back into alignment, three aspects were\ncrucial. How to do it was obviously top of mind but also how to ensure a slow, steady pace that\ncould essentially be left to churn on its own. We also knew, from past experience, that\ncommunicating our intentions was going to be a key factor in the efforts.\nThe means of unwinding the balance sheet were straightforward: We could either stop\nreinvesting the securities as they come to maturity or sell them on the open market. We opted for\nthe former, with gradually increasing caps on the amounts that are not reinvested. This ensures\nthe crucial aspects of gradual, predictable, and boring that we’re aiming for.\nThis is not to say that we will ignore the process as it unfolds. We’ll keep a watchful eye and\nrevisit it in meetings. If economic or other events necessitate intervention, we’ll make that call.\nBut we fundamentally want this to slowly and mechanically happen in the background.\n4\n\nI’ve said before that this will be the policy equivalent of watching paint dry. But I should specify\nthat the paint is oil based; the process is going to take some time. We have not yet established\nwhat the new normal will look like.\nThe balance sheet will definitely be bigger than it was before the crisis because the economy is\nbigger. But its eventual size will depend on how overnight and other short-term rates behave as\nthe unwinding progresses.\nAlso vital to our plans is the sense of predictability. I’m not sure there’s a single Fed employee,\nfrom president to examiner, who didn’t take the lessons of the 2013 taper tantrum to heart.\nRegarding unwinding then, we made every effort to communicate early and often, and as clearly\nas possible — a feat for an organization renowned for its policy speak — to ensure the message\nwas clear. The market response to the announcement was somewhere between a yawn and a\nshrug, so I really do have to commend the entire Fed System for the clarity and consistency of\nthe message. It’s one of the key successes I’d point to in managing normalization after such an\nextraordinary time.\nKey Lessons\nThere are other lessons to be gleaned, not just from the progress on the balance sheet, but from\nthe moment of liftoff.\nOne of the most important is that, in the normalization process, it’s possible to manage the\nbalance sheet and rates separately, albeit with limits.\nWhen we ended QE in late 2014, serious questions were posed about the feasibility of raising\nrates, given the size of the balance sheet. Traditionally, the New York Fed’s markets units that\nimplement the policy — which we refer to simply as “the Desk” — implemented rate increases\nby making reserves scarce in the fed funds market. But more than $2 trillion of reserves rendered\nthem anything but scarce. The only way the Desk could remove $2 trillion of reserves overnight\nwould be by effectively holding the largest fire sale in economic history.\nThe current situation necessitated a great deal of effort to gain a deep understanding of uncharted\nwaters. Ultimately, a combination of expertise and analysis engineered a successful liftoff in\nDecember 2015. Rates have been under control since and remain well connected to other money\n5\n\nmarkets. As the FOMC decides to increase the target range for the federal funds rate, it increases\nboth the interest banks earn on reserves and the rate an extended list of counterparties can earn\nvia the reverse repo facility.\nHere I’ll return to the note I made earlier that the United States differs in a few areas. In the\nclassic model of a corridor system, the interest on reserves provides a floor, for the obvious\nreason that no bank wants to lend at a lower rate than it would earn by simply keeping its\nbalances. In the U.S., however, not all institutions qualify to earn interest on reserves. With\nreserve markets satiated, it is therefore the reverse repos — available to a wider range of\nadditional institutions — that provide a firm floor on market rates and the interest on reserves\nprovides a cap.\nThese two rates — interest on reserves and reverse repos — currently form the boundaries of the\nfed funds target. Research by my staff correctly predicted that most fed funds trades would occur\nat rates safely in the middle of the target range, even if actual use of reverse repos is quite low.\nBy offering an alternative to trades in the market, the reverse repo facility improves the\nbargaining position of lenders and drives rates, even if lenders rarely have to resort to the facility\n— a “spooky action at a distance” that also helps to keep the fed funds rate connected to other\nmoney market rates.2\nAs our balance sheet declines, so does the supply of reserves. Eventually, reserves could become\nscarce again, which would, theoretically, make it possible to return to a classic corridor system in\nwhich interest on reserves operates as a firm floor on market rates. Exactly what level of reserves\nwould enable that is a topic of ongoing research. That level could be substantially larger than the\nlast time we conducted policy in a reserves-scarce environment, owing to how much has changed\nsince 2008. I will therefore continue to monitor this issue as the balance sheet shrinks.\n2 Roc Armenter and Ben Lester, “Excess Reserves and Monetary Policy Implementation,” Review of Economic\nDynamics, 23, (2017), pp. 212–235.\n6\n\nConclusion\nThe United States is, by and large, farther down the road to normal than other countries that\nturned to unconventional policies and, as such, we can pass along the lessons of our experiences\nthus far. These are clearly not direct correlations, but there are echoes, and we all operate on the\nfundamental monetary policy oath of “first do no harm.”\nThe knowledge that rates and the balance sheet can be decoupled has been invaluable, as has the\nwork to prepare the markets for what’s to come.\nThis is a new path for all of us. What we’re trying has never been done before, at least not on\nthis scale, and while it might be, to borrow a phrase, the “final frontier” of monetary policy, I do\nbelieve we’ll pull off the ultimate feat and make a couple trillion dollars utterly uninteresting.\n7",

Harker\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not\nnecessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the\nFederal Open Market Committee.\n\nBuilding a Healthy Long-Term Economy\n2016 World Class Summit: 10 Years to 2026\nEconomy League of Greater Philadelphia\nPhiladelphia, PA\nJuly 13, 2016\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nIntroduction\nGood evening. It is a pleasure and a privilege to have the opportunity to engage with the distinguished gathering\nof professionals and leaders represented here at tonight’s 2016 World Class Summit.\nThank you, Steve Wray and Chris Chepel, for the invitation. And thank you, Bill Rhodes, for that generous\nintroduction.\nTonight I am here as both a Federal Reserve Bank president and a lifelong member of this community. I was born\nand raised in New Jersey; spent many years at the University of Pennsylvania as a student, an academic, and an\nadministrator; headed to Newark to serve as president of the University of Delaware; and now I am back in\nPhiladelphia at the Fed.\nI drive home every day to South Jersey and plan to remain in the area long after the year 2026. So, when I am\nasked to speak about how we can best ensure a bright economic future for this region 10 years from now, not only\ndo I think about this question professionally, but I also think about it on a very personal level. I am always looking\nfor answers to this question. I look for answers in the data I pore over every day. And, I look for answers in the\nstories I hear from the people I meet throughout the District.\nI often reflect on a visit I made last October to the YouthBuild Charter School, where I met a number of young\npeople who had previously dropped out of school. Through this program, they were earning their high school\ndiplomas while training for jobs in construction and retail. In the hours we spent together, these young people\nshared stories about their hopes for the future. They were remarkably clear about the barriers and hard work they\nfaced to get back on track. They were also very aware of how they were benefiting from this fantastic program as\nwell as the passionate teachers and administrators who were there to keep their focus on the long term.\nThere is no doubt that these students embody a quintessential Philadelphia quality that I think is undervalued but\nincredibly important — grit. University of Pennsylvania Professor Angela Duckworth defines “grit” as perseverance\nand passion for long-term goals. Her research says the smartest of us aren’t necessarily the best at our jobs, the\nbest students, the greatest innovators, or even the most successful professionally. People with grit are those who\n1\n\nstay focused on the long term even when things aren’t going perfectly in the “right now.” They achieve difficult\ngoals. They don’t necessarily learn quickly or easily. They work really hard and consider life a marathon rather than\na sprint.\nIn August, the YouthBuild students who I met last fall will be graduating. Some will go on to college, and others will\nfind jobs in the industries for which they have trained. They will become an important part of our economy in the\nnext 10 years. The path they have taken, and the character they have shown, will be assets that our economy\nneeds and can use to grow.\nThe people of the Greater Philadelphia region embody grit — this is who we are. But how do we translate the grit\nthat defines us into a stronger workforce that will be the foundation for a stronger economy?\nMy talk tonight will focus on this topic as it relates to our region’s long-term health. But before we get there, I\nthink it best to start with a look at our current economic landscape. I must offer the following disclosure: My\nremarks today reflect my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\nEconomic Overview\nFor the most part, economic fundamentals appear to be solid, personal income growth has been healthy, job\ngrowth continues — albeit with some volatility — at a healthy pace, and there has been a modest increase in\nequity prices and continued steady growth in home prices.\nAdditionally, consumers appear fairly confident as measured by various indices of consumer sentiment, and\nhousehold balance sheets are in good shape. These solid fundamentals have contributed to a healthy pickup in\nconsumption with a growth rate that is likely to accelerate to a bit above 4.0 percent in the second quarter. As a\nresult, it appears that GDP is growing above its trend rate, reversing what was a weak first quarter in which GDP\ngrew at a mere 1.1 percent.\nHowever, I believe that part of the first quarter weakness was largely due to seasonal adjustment problems with\nmeasured GDP. An alternative measure of economic activity produced at our Bank, called GDPplus, indicates that\nthe economy grew at 2.3 percent in the first quarter. Using that measure as my guide, the U.S. economy appears\nto be on fairly firm footing this year.\nBased on recent data, I anticipate that we will see growth of about 2.0 percent in 2016, increasing to roughly 2.3\npercent in both 2017 and 2018. However, there are some risks to my fairly optimistic forecast.\nSome of those risks are reflected in the recent volatility in job growth. The latest employment report largely\narrests the concerns that arose from the exceptionally weak job numbers in May, but it remains to be seen which\nof the latest two reports better represents the true state of the labor market.\nI think the best way to view the recent data is to average through it, which implies a gradual tapering in\nemployment growth to a rate that is still considerably above that which would imply no change in the\n2\n\nunemployment rate. Given the maturity of the recovery, I anticipate that employment growth will gradually slow\nto a more sustainable pace consistent with maintaining our low level of unemployment.\nViewing the jobs data in this way is consistent with other labor market evidence. Job openings remain at historic\nhighs, and the high level of the quits rate indicates that workers feel fairly confident in their ability to change jobs.\nFurther, wage growth has been increasing steadily. Over the past three months, average hourly earnings have\nincreased at a 2.5 percent annualized rate. Also, contacts in our region indicate that they continue to search for\nworkers but that finding those workers with sufficient skills is getting increasingly more difficult. Nevertheless, the\ndisconnect between the labor market and economic activity is puzzling.\nThe first quarter saw strong employment growth and perhaps fairly weak output growth, while the current\nquarter is witnessing a weakening in employment growth just as economic activity is accelerating. That behavior is\ncreating uncertainty for both forecasters and policymakers, myself included.\nOther areas of concern are the manufacturing and energy sectors, which continue to struggle, although there have\nbeen some signs of recent improvement. Regional contacts appear a bit more upbeat than they were a few\nmonths ago, but the durable goods part of the market is still having a rough time. The data on core orders in April\nand May also do not point to any near-term strength in investment. Finally, there is the uncertainty surrounding\nBrexit, which may provide additional headwinds to an already struggling manufacturing sector, and further\nappreciation of the dollar could result in declining net exports.\nThat said, Brexit is low on my list of risks, and I do not anticipate more than a transitory couple of 10ths of a\npercentage point slowdown in growth.\nOn the inflation front, there are signs of firming as the dollar has stabilized, and oil and gas prices have risen\nsubstantially. Consumer price inflation continued to firm this quarter with core measures approaching the FOMC’s\ntarget of 2 percent. Given these observations, I believe that inflation will return to target sometime next year.\nConsidering the economic projections, I anticipate that it may be appropriate for up to two additional rate hikes\nthis year and that the funds rate will approach 3.0 percent by the end of 2018.\nGrowing Our Human Capital\nNow, let’s look a little closer to home. Philadelphia’s economy is heating up. Job growth in the metropolitan area\nbegan outpacing U.S. job growth this year, which is not the norm. More important, Philadelphia’s growth is\nbeginning to keep pace with that of other comparably sized U.S. metropolitan areas.\nEmployment is up in nearly every sector, and the jobless rate has risen somewhat in recent months, which\nreflects, in part, that more people are joining the labor force due to greater job opportunities. Still, the average\nover the past five months is comparable with that of the nation’s. Moreover, we anticipate that the recent rise will\nsoon reverse and that much of the rise will be smoothed away with next year’s revisions.\nWhile housing remains sluggish in Pennsylvania as a whole and in outlying areas of the Philadelphia metropolitan\narea, growth has been dramatic within the City of Philadelphia. As in other large cities, the surge in development\n3\n\nand redevelopment of housing, plus the growth of new office space, has been accompanied by commercial and\nmixed-use projects, which are especially appealing to millennial workers. We know that in order for us to continue\non this path, productivity growth is essential.\nThere are two general ways productivity growth can be achieved:\n1. Through the development of better technologies that improve our ability to produce existing products\nor entirely new products, and\n2. By improving the skills of our workforce. Doing so will lead to workers earning more (and spending\nmore) as well as producing more.\nBoth tactics highlight the necessity of building human capital.\nKeeping this momentum will require us to make some targeted human capital investments and explore new ways\nto meet old challenges. In the time we have, I would like to highlight a few areas where I think we have some work\nto do as well as some of the promising strategies that are in play.\nI’m sure it is no surprise to you that I believe one of the answers lies in securing a solid education system that\nbegins with pre-K for all children. The Economy League of Greater Philadelphia and other organizations across the\nstate worked diligently to make the case for Pre-K for PA. And our economy will reap the benefits of this work\ndown the road.\nHaving spent most of my career engaged in academics, I have found that it has become even more apparent over\nthe past year working at the Fed that the foundation for a well-trained workforce begins in these early days of\nschool. These are critical times where character, self-esteem, and work ethic — the foundations of grit — are\ndeveloped.\nA solid education system, which includes pre-K, is something we must continue to work toward. Not only will it\nproduce a pipeline of future Philadelphians with the grit to take on the hard work ahead, but it will also make us a\nmore desirable place for skilled people to live.\nOur researchers have studied the connection between having a solid school system in place and the positive\neconomic impact this has on cities like Philadelphia, where young, educated people choose to build their careers\nand raise their families.\nAs a former college president, my next point may sound controversial. Not everyone is going to be college-bound,\nand that’s OK. College is not for everyone. But what is not OK is that our region has 106,000 disconnected youths,\nyoung people who are not in school or not working.\nThis growing figure points to the critical need for a training system in our region that is more agile, one that meets\nthe needs of those at various skill levels. That is how we will give more of our young people a path toward success.\n4\n\nIn addition to these disconnected youths, there are many young people who start and never finish college. Why is\nthis?\nIt could be that the average high school curriculum is not rigorous enough to prepare youths for college. Or maybe\nit’s that many students who pursue college do not feel — rightly or wrongly — that the average curriculum is\nhelpful for future employment.\nI pondered this daily as an academic leader and now as a Fed president because this college completion rate\ndecline leaves our economy with young people saddled with school loan debt, without a degree, and no higher\npaying job to pay off this debt.\nAs an economist, I see a growing mismatch between what our education sector offers to students and the skills\nand training our business sector increasingly needs. This disparity — if left unattended — will have a significant\nimpact. So, what can we do?\nAs a region, we must focus on creating a training system that is more agile, one that works in real time for our\nindustries in need, our disconnected young people, and our long-term economy.\nI had the pleasure of taking Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen on a tour of Philadelphia a few weeks ago. She was\ninterested in hearing more about employment efforts that are working here in the city. On our drive through West\nPhiladelphia, we had the opportunity to visit clients at the West Philadelphia Skills Initiative (WPSI).\nIn this program, anchor institutions work with and through a local nonprofit organization to identify future job\nopenings and train local residents to fill these positions. I believe the partnerships that help to build these kinds of\ncollaborative, innovative programs create a more agile labor market. These programs benefit the individual\njobseeker, the employer, and ultimately, the economy.\nWe are also exploring other areas including apprenticeship programs. These programs combine study with on-the-\njob training and have been shown to have a sizable impact on the lives of workers and the economy in other parts\nof the world. So far in the U.S., we have had some limited experience, but there are huge opportunities to expand\nthese programs.\nIn an assessment and cost-benefit analysis of the Registered Apprenticeship program in 10 states, Mathematica\nPolicy Research estimated that, on average, those who complete one of these registered programs can expect to\nbe compensated nearly $300,000 more over their lifetimes — including benefits — than those who do not. We can\nand should find ways to expand these programs in our region.\nThe Delaware Valley chapter of the National Tooling and Machining Association plans to develop an\napprenticeship program in precision machining. In May, the Fed’s Community Development Studies & Education\nDepartment organized a meeting in which the program was introduced to workforce and manufacturing leaders in\nPhiladelphia.\n5\n\nAttendees included representatives from Philadelphia Works, Inc.; the Community College of Philadelphia; the\nSchool District of Philadelphia; and three local manufacturing organizations. What came out of this meeting was a\ngenuine interest in working together. Our partners are now exploring ways in which we can work with a local high\nschool to possibly use their facilities to grow these programs.\nHere again is a training system that meets the needs of manufacturers in our region who can’t find skilled\nemployees. And for the unemployed and underemployed, it provides good-paying jobs and long-term careers. We\nneed to be creative and look for ways to boost this model in the areas of technology and other sectors to capture\nthe imagination of young workers and to provide the training and skills they need.\nCollaborative Leadership Is Key\nThe late John W. Gardner once said, “When an institution, organization, or nation loses its capacity to inspire\nhigh individual performance, its great days are over.”\nOur efforts to strengthen the region’s human capital are important ways for us to ensure that our great days are\nahead. It is through collaborative leadership — like that demonstrated by the Economy League and its World Class\nGreater Philadelphia Agenda — that our region can think critically and act decisively on behalf of our region’s\neconomic future.\nThe Economy League — and nearly 2,000 regional businesses, nonprofits, government, labor, and community\nleaders — are improving education and talent outcomes in our region, boosting business growth, and making our\ninfrastructure more effective and reliable. It is through such efforts that we will make sure there are skilled people\nto hire when our region’s projected 3 million square feet of new office and mixed-use space is ready. We must\ndeliver on the challenge of having the resources, vision, and leadership to make full use of our District’s potential.\nThe Philadelphia Fed stands ready to partner with you in this effort. This year, we created a new council, made up\nof both for-profit and nonprofit leadership, with the purpose of working collaboratively to address the critical\nissues impacting our region. Over the next year, we will be working with the council on key issues, including\nhuman capital, to identify ways in which the Fed can better leverage its research and facilitation resources to\nstrengthen our economy.\nWe are ready to work toward our shared goal of fostering human capital needed to build this region today and\ntomorrow. My expectation is that this collaboration will yield impacts for the region for years to come.\nWhen I think about all we are discussing today, I picture myself opening up the Philadelphia Inquirer in 2026 and\nflipping to the business section — and, yes, I believe I will still be reading a paper publication in 2026. I also believe\nthat, if we stay focused, I will be reading about the fruits of our labor.\nAnd please, let there be a big Carson Wentz profile on the cover of the sports section about his early retirement\nafter multiple Super Bowl wins for the Eagles. Or even just one!\n6\n\nBut seriously, what will get us through tough and unpredictable times — with limited fallout — is the grit and\nagility we start producing today. The investment we make in human capital will position us for a healthy\ntomorrow.\nThank you for your time.\n7",

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nThe Intrinsic Value of Inclusive Growth\nPennsylvania Economic Association Annual Conference\nAlvernia University\nReading, PA\nJune 2, 2017\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood afternoon and welcome; it’s a pleasure to be here.\nToday, I’d like to give an overview of the economic outlook, including my views on monetary\npolicy, then talk a bit about a subject that’s crucial to economic success on a local, regional, and\nnational level but that often gets treated as a separate subject: economic growth and mobility.\nBefore I do that, let me perform the sacred Fed ritual of delivering the standard disclaimer: The\nviews I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the\nFederal Reserve System, including my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC).\nThe Economic Outlook\nI’ll start with the outlook, which, overall, is pretty good.\nFirst quarter GDP growth was quite weak. The most recent revision puts that number at 1.2\npercent, which is better than the previous 0.7 percent estimate. This actually illustrates a point I\nwant to make because I think it’s a mistake to give either number too much weight.\nWe’ve seen weak first quarter growth for several years now to the extent that it’s essentially\nbecome the new normal. This year’s culprits were weather, low inventory investment, and our\nold friend seasonality. These effects are likely transient, and they’ve proved to be so in the past. I\n1\n\nproject overall GDP growth of 2.3 percent for 2017, which is pretty much what we should\nconsider normal for the medium term.\nTurning to inflation, things are still on track, despite a couple of months trending in the wrong\ndirection. Both headline and core PCE ticked down in April, to 1.7 and 1.5 percent year-on-year,\nrespectively, but I still think we’re doing fine. We spent a lot of the past few years waiting for\ninflation to rise to meet our 2 percent target. Now we’re on track, and two reports showing slight\ndownward trends don’t derail my outlook.\nMuch like the disappointment over slow first quarter GDP growth, I think the concern over a\ncouple of months of less-than-perfect inflation data is unwarranted.\nWe’re essentially at normal now, and it’s a mistake to get caught up in a single report, or month,\nor even quarter’s worth of data. It’s much more important to take a step back and look at\nunderlying trends and what they mean for the medium term. In this case, my forecast remains\nthat we should reach our inflation goal around the end of the year.\nOn the other side of our mandate, I see very little slack left in the labor market.\nIn May, unemployment reached its lowest rate in 16 years, reaching 4.3 percent. I see it moving\ndown even further — dropping as low as 4.2 percent by the end of next year. Upward pressure\non wages is finally starting to assert itself, and I estimate wage growth of between 2.5 and 3\npercent this year. This is a very good sign; it’s one of the things that’s been missing as the\nrecovery has unfolded.\nJob creation is still strong. We had 138,000 jobs in May, which is a good number. I see job\ncreation eventually falling to about 100,000 a month by the end of 2019.\nJust as I think we need to put monthly fluctuations in inflation data in perspective, I think we\nneed to put job growth in context. In the very near future, we’re not going to need to create jobs\nat the intense pace we’ve been experiencing over the past few years.\nThe 100,000-jobs-a-month rate is going to be more than sufficient to keep up with population\ngrowth. That’s more or less the rate we’ll need in a normal, healthy economy.\n2\n\nBased on the strength of the economy, I still see three rate hikes of 25 basis points each as\nappropriate for 2017.\nI also believe that we will begin unwinding the balance sheet sometime this year, although I’m\nnot tying that to a date on the calendar or a data point on an inflation report. It will be slow,\nsteady, incredibly boring, and essentially on autopilot.\nAnd, of course, all of this is predicated on the assumption that things continue to unfold as they\nhave been.\nThe Costs of Poverty and Inequality\nI say “based on the strength of the economy,” and I do believe that we are more or less at full\nhealth. The small adjustments that need to be made here and there are not earth-moving numbers,\nthey’re just needed to ensure that the foundation is strong.\nBut that, of course, is the macro view. And that doesn’t take into account the places across the\ncountry, and within the Third District, that haven’t recovered the way their neighbors have.\nYou’ll hear a presentation later today that delves deeper into the state’s economy, and, of course,\nI’m speaking to the Pennsylvania Economic Association, so I’m sure you’re fully aware that\nthere are pockets of the state that haven’t made their way back yet. You’re aware that\nPhiladelphia is the poorest of the top 10 cities in the U.S. You’re aware that some of the cities\nand towns right next door are struggling economically.\nOne of the things the Fed does that doesn’t get much attention is our Community Development\nwork. It’s almost our best-kept secret, which is too bad, because it’s incredibly important. I’d\ntherefore like to talk a bit today about why that is and what we’re doing at the Philadelphia Fed\nto work with communities of all economic profiles across the Third District.\nFrom my personal perspective, there is an ethical obligation to do what we can to help each\nother. But Congress didn’t charge us with determining moral imperatives, which, obviously, rely\nmuch less on data than a wonky policymaker would be comfortable with.\n3\n\nSo, I’ll stick to the pragmatic argument, which is that inclusive growth is good for the overall\neconomy, and conversely, that both poverty and inequality in income are detrimental to the\neconomic well-being of the country.\nThe current poverty line in the United States is an annual income of $24,339 for a family of four.\nAccording to the most recently available data, the U.S. has over 43 million people living in\npoverty. That’s over 13 percent of the population.1 As for inequality, the United States ranks\n43rd in the world by the Gini index.2 There is growing debate within the field of economics on\nthe impact of inequality. But while some inequality is inevitable in any free-market society, I’m\nin the camp that says too much inequality, or too much breadth in inequality, ultimately costs us.\nChildhood poverty alone costs the U.S. close to $500 billion annually.3 And research shows the\neffects of inequality on GDP is significant as well. For instance, when additional income goes to\nthe top quintile of earners, GDP actually falls by 0.08 percent. But when the same happens for\nthe bottom quintile, GDP rises by almost 0.4 percent.4\nThen there is the simple fact that this vast and diverse country is made up of micro- and\nmacroeconomies that are intertwined and overlap and have ripple effects beyond city, county, or\nstate lines. Our economic fortunes are tied to one another.\nSo, if the problems facing some of us ultimately translate into the problems that face all of us,\nwhat do we do about it?\nEGMP: The Economic Growth & Mobility Project\nFor our part, the Philadelphia Fed has launched the Economic Growth & Mobility Project to look\nfor practical applications for the abundance of research in the field. We have a lot of data and in-\ndepth studies that can inform issues across the District and, hopefully, across the country as well.\n1 See Poverty Thresholds, U.S. Census Bureau, www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-\npoverty/historical-poverty-thresholds.html; see Income and Poverty in the United States: 2015, U.S. Census Bureau,\nwww.census.gov/library/publications/2016/demo/p60-256.html.\n2 See the World Factbook, Central Intelligence Agency, North America: United States,\nwww.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/us.html.\n3 Harry J. Holzer et al., The Economic Costs of Poverty in the United States: Subsequent Effects of Children\nGrowing Up Poor, Center for American Progress, 2007.\n4 Era Dabla-Norris et al., “Causes and Consequences of Income Inequality: A Global Perspective,” IMF Staff\nDiscussion Note, International Monetary Fund, 2015, www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2015/sdn1513.pdf.\n4\n\nI’m a huge fan of research, as I’m sure everyone here is as well. It’s the fuel that keeps\nacademics going. But there’s an added energy when our research has a practical application.\nThe work in the field of economic mobility has incredible potential, and we’re lucky enough to\nbe sitting in the middle of a natural laboratory.\nI say it pretty frequently, but it bears repeating — while the Third District is the Fed’s smallest, it\nprovides a unique perspective. It covers Pennsylvania from about Johnstown and east; southern\nNew Jersey; and all of Delaware. Although it’s geographically very compact, the District\nencompasses urban centers, suburban expanse, post-industrial cities and towns, and rural areas.\nThat means it’s a microcosm of America. We know that the challenges that Philadelphia faces\naren’t the same as the ones we find in Reading. The footprint of the Third District means we\nhave the opportunity to find custom-fit solutions for both of those profiles and others as well.\nEGMP: Workforce Development\nOne of our primary areas of focus is skills training and workforce development. We’re starting to\nsee a different set of issues emerge than we were contending with at the height of the recession,\nwhen unemployment peaked at 10 percent. Now we’ve got jobs going unfilled.\nThis isn’t just what I hear from my contacts in the community; it’s in the data. We’ve come to a\npoint in the labor market where the competition is among the employers trying to fill slots rather\nthan the applicants vying for them. But there’s a skills mismatch. There just aren’t enough\npeople with the right training to do the jobs that are out there.\nI’ll give you an example: A contact of mine has a trucking repair business in Pennsylvania, and\nhe’s doubled the number of bays because business is so good. But half of them are sitting empty\nbecause he can’t find qualified mechanics. He’s paying over $100,000 a year, but he just can’t\nfind workers who are equipped to do the job. It’s no longer just mechanical; now that so much of\ntruck repair is computerized, workers need digital skills as well.\nSo, what do we do? There is obviously a need for training programs and more investment in\npractical education. But there’s also a cultural shift that needs to happen. At some point along the\n5\n\nway, we decided to burden vocational education with a negative connotation. We seem to have\ncollectively decided that education should be one-size-fits-all. And I don’t understand that.\nNot everyone wants to take the road more traveled, and it’s not in everyone’s best interest to do\nso. There are good jobs out there that don’t insist on a traditional college plan.\nMy staff has done research on these in conjunction with the Cleveland and Atlanta Feds. They’re\ncalling them “opportunity occupations”: jobs that pay at or above the median wage that don’t\nrequire a four-year degree. A lot of them are in health care, which is an industry with immense\ngrowth potential.\nIf we can be more strategic about the way we encourage and train our rising workforce, we can\nbenefit both the workers and the employers.\nThere is one caveat that I should mention. Because, of course, there’s very little under the sun\nthat is devoid of nuance or, frankly, potholes.\nIn follow-up research by my staff, they found that during the recession and slow recovery, the\ncompetition for jobs meant some employers began to upskill job requirements, even though it\nwasn’t strictly necessary. That is, for a job that had previously required an associate’s degree or\ntechnical training, they could now ask for a bachelor’s.\nThat has remained somewhat sticky as the labor market has tightened. But I believe that as time\npasses, we’ll start to see things come back into balance again. And I’d like to see that. Because\nthe pathway to an economically secure middle-class life can and should be paved by different\nforms of education.\nAt the end of last year, I visited Roxborough High School in Philadelphia, which has an\nAcademies program that allows students to pick a course of concentration while they study the\nregular curriculum.\nIt’s a pretty brilliant model because it sets them up to enter the workforce directly from high\nschool if they want to, which means they can earn a good salary if they want to take a couple of\nyears on the job before returning to school, work part-time while continuing their education, or\njust start their climb up the professional ladder immediately.\n6\n\nI should mention that all of the students I talked to thought the practical aspect of their learning\nwas a huge positive.\nSome of them get up at 5:00 a.m. and take three buses just to get to school because they see a\nplace in this program as a stepping stone to a bright future. After high school, some of them may\ngo the route of the traditional four-year degree, and some will do something different. One of the\nyoung women I spoke with wants to be an anesthesiologist, for instance, while another is\nthinking about a social media start-up.\nBut regardless of which track they choose, there’s no limit to their choices in life; none of them\nsee their vocational training as anything but a competitive edge.\nThey’re right; after talking with them, I’m pretty sure at least a couple of them are going to be\nrunning the country soon enough.\nI really want their attitudes toward creative paths to education and training to be the prevailing\nones: We all have our own ways of getting to the endpoint, and for the United States to have a\nlabor market that is truly running on all cylinders, we need a workforce that is as innovative and\ncreative as the sectors they represent.\nEGMP: Transportation\nOf course, no difficult problem or economic issue has one root cause; if it did, our job in\nCommunity Development would be much easier.\nIt’s clear that even if we arm people with the skills and training to get good jobs, it might not be\nenough. Because at the end of the day, not everyone can get to the good jobs.\nTransportation isn’t generally seen as an exciting topic, which is fine, because neither is\nmonetary policy. But it’s an important one nonetheless. Some of the most intractable issues we\nface with social mobility are caught up in these kinds of basic infrastructure matters.\nThe ways we’ve migrated in this country, socially and economically, have changed over the\ndecades and centuries. Where we once found the hubs of commerce, we also found residential\nareas.\n7\n\nThen we began the immense wave of suburbanization that fundamentally changed the way we\nlive and work and travel between the two.\nNow, we’re seeing the reversal of the trend that characterized the latter half of the 20th century\nand find people returning to city centers.\nWe have a transportation system, however, that was largely developed during the retreat from\nurban living and therefore built to bring people from the satellites into the center. But that’s not\nnecessarily the best structure now.\nOur Community Development team has been working with the city of Scranton on exactly this\nissue. The Economic Growth & Mobility Project I mentioned is going to focus on action labs,\nwhich we’ll convene to find practical means to solving challenges identified by the communities\nwe partner with. For instance, we’ve been working with stakeholders from across Scranton for\nthe past several months to better understand their challenges in getting low-income residents\nconnected to work and helping them identify solutions.\nOne of the biggest growth areas in the region is distribution centers, and there are a lot of jobs\nattached to them. But our transportation system is set up to bring people to the city center, not\nout to the areas where those distribution jobs are. The basic arithmetic is that, if you can’t get to\na job, it doesn’t matter how many there are. And if you can’t fill the jobs, your business can’t\nexpand.\nWe’re working with a local foundation to help bring people together to address Scranton’s\nspecific needs. Then, hopefully, we can export that model and the lessons we learned to similar\ncities around the country.\nEGMP: Future Work\nThere’s a lot more in the pipeline and a world of work open to us. We have opportunities to\npartner with businesses, civic groups, not-for-profits, and philanthropies across the District and\nthe country to find innovative solutions to problems in diverse areas.\nThe fact is that economic health is the sum of multiple parts, and investments in one area have\nhuge implications for others. A better educated population, for instance, means a more skilled\n8\n\nworkforce pumping more money into the economy. More people employed in good jobs means\nlower crime and safer neighborhoods. Safer neighborhoods mean higher property values.\nThe work we do in Community Development to strengthen local economies will have effects that\nresonate beyond those areas, from Scranton to Reading to Wilmington and beyond.\n9",

    "text": "Investing in America’s Workforce\nInvesting in America’s Workforce Capstone Conference\nAustin, TX\nOctober 5, 2017\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nInvesting in America’s Workforce\nInvesting in America’s Workforce Capstone Conference\nAustin, TX\nOctober 5, 2017\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood morning and thank you.\nThat’s honestly one of the most impactful parts of being a Fed president: getting to see the real-\nlife implications of the data I view on a daily basis and how it translates into life in my District\nand around the country. Talking to employers and job seekers and educators just resonates more\nthan a line on a graph.\nI’m going to talk today about several different aspects of workforce development, each of which\ncan truly bring about phenomenal results. And I don’t necessarily have a favorite program or\napproach, but sometimes the work speaks to you on a personal level.\nThe video you just saw was of the Philly Shipyard’s apprenticeship program. You may have\nheard me say that I grew up in a family of steamfitters and pipefitters. My brother was a welder,\nmy uncles were all pipefitters, as was my dad for a long time.\nI saw how those jobs, those careers, gave people solid, middle-class lives, even without a college\ndegree. I’m the result of that. I’m the beneficiary of a time and a place that offered a host of\nrailways to the terminus of financial security. What you saw in that video was a program that can\nprovide exactly that opportunity for this next generation of Americans. You saw people from all\nwalks of life. Samantha, the young woman, has a B.F.A.; she’s a former artist. You saw that they\nwere of all different ages — Shawn started the program in his 40s. And most of all, you saw that\neach of them feels an incredible world of opportunity is open to them because of this\n1\n\napprenticeship program. It’s not just a job, it’s a career — all of those people see a clear path up\nthe company ladder. At a time when a lot of people have lost hope that fortune can favor anyone\nwithout a traditional four-year degree, it’s heartening to see those prospects alive and well.\nIt’s not all about the workers, however. On the flip side, companies can increase quality and\noutput by stocking their ranks with incredibly skilled people. As people learn, adapt, and acquire\nnew skills, the program can hone in on ways to make outcomes even better. And overall,\norganizations can minimize their risk by knowing they’ve got highly trained, expert\ntradespeople making up their workforce.\nIt’s a win-win.\nSo apprenticeships aren’t necessarily my favorite of all the workforce development approaches\nwe’ll talk about over the course of this conference, but they do have a special place for me.\nIn light of that personal observation, let me assure you, with the familiar Fed disclaimer, that all\nthe views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect anyone else’s in the\nFederal Reserve System.\nThe Research\nSo, why am I here today? They don’t just trot out the presidents at these events, they make us\nearn it …\nAnd I’m here to talk about a really substantive report we’ve just released as a System, Investing\nin America’s Workforce: Report on Workforce Development Needs and Opportunities.\nThe impetus for this research was the CRA clarification that allows banks to include workforce\ndevelopment as an investment opportunity. And I want to stress that word: investment. Because\nI’m going to be using it a lot over the next 20 minutes or so.\nThis report is essentially about the value of investing in our combined economic future. So\nwhether this work is directly relevant to someone, we all have a lot to gain from its success.\nThe Fed has a dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment — ultimately, we’re\ncreating the conditions for economic growth. But those conditions won’t be as fertile if we can’t\n2\n\nfill the jobs that are out there now, not to mention the ones coming in the future. The U.S. can\nonly reach its potential when the needs of both business and the labor force are addressed in\nstronger alignment. So, we took a deep dive into what’s happening now and what we need to\nplan for the future.\nCommunity Development teams from across the Federal Reserve System gathered information\nin more than 50 listening sessions, across 32 states and Puerto Rico, from almost 1,000\nworkforce development leaders who work at the intersection of training, recruitment, and\nfinance.\nMy team used qualitative research methods to find central themes from industry respondents:\nThey talked about the challenges they’ve observed across the country but also the promising\nstrategies they see as well as opportunities for investment in workforce development.\nA lot of the findings reflect what we see in the data and what we’re hearing from our community\nand business contacts across the country.\nBut what makes this report stand out is the approaches they used. It let them take a deep and\nbroad look at the insights shared by using a rigorous, qualitative research method.\nFor me, the methodology and the findings confirm the unique role of Community Development\nin the Fed System.\nI often make the observation that while we make monetary policy on a national level, that’s the\n30,000-foot vantage point. It’s a combined view of myriad microeconomies made up of regions\nand businesses and households. That’s why our decentralized system is so important: It allows us\nto really understand our Districts and their specific needs on an in-depth, local level.\nThat same understanding of the unique needs of the communities we serve is what makes the\nCommunity Development function so crucial and what adds so much value. They’ve got depth\nand breadth of understanding and an interconnected system of networks that provides insight on\nthis vast and diverse collection of economies.\nChallenges in the Workforce\nSo, what are we working with?\n3\n\nA lot of what we heard in the listening sessions reflects what I see in the data. The JOLTS data,\nfor instance, and the Philadelphia Fed’s Manufacturing Business Outlook Survey (MBOS), both\nshow a skills gap. The MBOS shows that compared with 2014, the respondents identifying a\nlabor shortage this year jumped from about 33 percent to over 60 percent. And the ones who saw\na skills mismatch went from about 46 percent to around 68 percent.\nOf course, there are other issues. Everyone here is familiar with the factors that impact or limit\npeople’s ability to enter the workforce, to find jobs that can support a family, or even to progress\nup the career ladder.\nThis report highlighted some of the factors we know contribute to these hurdles. They include\nthe skills gap I mentioned, low educational attainment or poor quality of education, and a change\nin employer needs and demands due to increasing automation and technical advancement.\nThe research also highlighted the barriers that aren’t related to skills, like addiction,\nincarceration, child-care costs.\nThere are also logistical impediments; in the case of housing and insufficient transportation —\nthe simple consequence of place.\nAnd there is the issue of job quality. While we’re essentially at the point of maximum\nemployment — in its simplest terms, if you want a job, you can get one relatively easily — that\ndoesn’t mean it’s a good job, or that it pays a living wage, or that it comes with the benefits that\ncan be truly family-sustaining.\nThis situation doesn’t actually keep people from work, but it does affect their ability to move up\nthe economic ladder.\nAnd that’s not just a problem for individuals, families, and communities but for the economy as a\nwhole.\nLooking at these barriers, they’re each a brick in the wall, one that stands between people and\neither sustainable employment or economic mobility.\nSo, how do we chip away at the bricks? How do we knock that wall down?\n4\n\nWhat we heard in the listening sessions, and what a lot of experts and practitioners say, is that\nthere needs to be a change in perspective.\nThat shift in thinking is going to be a theme because, sometimes, it’s all about how we view\nthings. When we change the way we look at things, those things can start to change. None of us\nis static, and none of us can view our work or our challenges through a single lens. The research\nshowed that experts truly believe that a change in thinking will lead to a change in behavior,\nwhich can lead to a change in outcomes.\nThe Shift in Thinking: Public Sector\nSo, what for instance, would that mean for the public sector?\nWe heard consistently, and it is a central theme in the report, that we have got to stop looking at\nworkforce development as just a social service. I mean everyone. We need to look at it for what\nit is: an investment in the American economy.\nIf we stop looking at workforce development as a cost and start looking at the long-term return\non investment, we can change the conversation and the approaches.\nFrom a purely economic standpoint, early childhood education isn’t an expenditure; it’s an\ninvestment in our future workforce. It’s an investment in the next generation of entrepreneurs\nand health-care workers and teachers.\nLikewise, investing in workforce development doesn’t just benefit individuals; it helps create the\nworkforce our businesses need.\nIf we ignore that investment opportunity, we aren’t just losing the economic resources; we’re\nlikely creating a cohort that could actually be a cost.\nIn the same vein, we heard that we need to better align overlapping goals, like workforce\ndevelopment and economic development efforts. Or investing in intermediaries that connect\npeople to jobs — not just the ones that train workers but the ones that train with an eye on what\nthe industry’s future needs will be.\n5\n\nAnd one of the key messages we heard was that people involved in this work need to start\nthinking like investors who look at long-term outcomes, rather than lenders that look at short-\nterm risks.\nInvestors succeed when the company they’re backing does well. The U.S. economy succeeds\nwhen we back programs that move people out of poverty and into stable, sustainable\nemployment.\nAnd when we shift to an investor mindset, it creates opportunities for financial institutions to\nbecome strategic partners.\nFor example, there’s a new fund in Philadelphia that allows banks to work with a CDFI\nintermediary to drive capital to early childhood education. This is important because we know\nit’s a two-generation strategy: helping the working generation find steady employment and\nknowing their children are getting the skills they need to be successful now and in the future.\nThe Shift in Thinking: Private Sector\nSo, what shift in thinking would they like to see in the private sector? Employers looking at their\nworkers as assets to be invested in, rather a line-item labor cost to be limited or decreased. If\nemployers do that, our experts believe their behavior might also change.\nThey may increase incumbent worker training or professional development opportunities. Those\napproaches both increase the skills of their current workforce and, as people start to move up\nwithin an organization, create entry-level positions to bring in a new generation of talent.\nIt could also encourage apprenticeship programs and work-based training. We know from\nexperience that we’re especially successful when people can learn and earn, supporting their\nfamilies while increasing their skills.\nSo, if private sector partners can shift their thinking, we’re more likely to see an increase in job\nquality, which is important. We’re in a tight labor market right now, but we aren’t creating\nquality jobs within that market; we won’t see as big of an economic impact.\nWhat did our listening session participants want from the financial institution side? They\nsuggested favorable funding so businesses can invest in their workforce, which in turn can\n6\n\ncontribute to the overall virtuous economic cycle. In California, for example, lenders are\nproviding reduced-cost capital to businesses that are committed to improving job quality over\ntime or offering quality jobs.\nThe Shift in Thinking: Philanthropy\nAnd what did we hear from the philanthropic side? An invitation to be bold. Because\nphilanthropy has the freedom to use real ingenuity.\nFoundations can use their capital to promote innovation, collaboration, and capacity building;\nthey can be venture philanthropists.\nWe know that shifting thinking and perspectives isn’t always easy. We also know that it’s often\nnot lack of funding — but lack of risk tolerance — that stops new approaches and innovations.\nPhilanthropy is the group that’s able to take on that risk and prove best practices. They can be the\ncatalysts for innovation and capacity building across the community development field.\nIf they can be the ones to bring their risk appetite up a notch, take the lead on facilitating\nincreased collaboration and capacity building, and use those to prove best practices, they may be\nable to leverage additional investment based on solid track records.\nWe heard from a lot of people that there’s a need for this kind of leadership and support to\naddress challenges the best way the respondents see: holistically.\nInstead of having very restrictive capital and rigid reporting requirements, organizations can be\nempowered to think about how they’re investing and building capacity to meet the needs of their\nclients, the same way venture capitalists would invest in the capacity of businesses they want to\nsucceed.\nSo, instead of paying for services or funding services, they’re funding outcomes. And by doing\nthat, we’re giving organizations flexibility and trust and the space to better meet the unique needs\nof their clients. Those organizations can become more nimble, more sustainable, and able to\noperate more effectively in the context of the complex challenges they’re facing.\nThis is also an opportunity for lenders to provide impact because they, rightfully, have to think\nabout limiting risk. They can’t take on the more adventurous investments that foundations can,\n7\n\nbut they can support the capacity building that organizations need by offering flexible financial\nproducts.\nFor example, we heard that in order to effectively train people for the jobs of today and\ntomorrow, one of the pressing needs is cutting-edge, high-tech equipment. Which is expensive.\nSo banks offering affordable financing can help organizations meet those challenges.\nConclusions and Next Steps\nThose challenges aren’t small. We wouldn’t all be here if they were. But the changes in\nperspective we heard overwhelmingly in our research, the different approaches we all talk about\nwanting, can yield game-changing results.\nRemember the barriers? The bricks that fit together to make the wall higher and harder to scale?\nIf we change the way we look at it, we see how it might change.\nClimbing isn’t necessarily easy. But with the insight we’ve already heard today; with the\napproaches our research participants highlighted; and with the capacity and talent of stakeholders\nfrom the public, private, and philanthropic sectors, we can absolutely turn that wall on its side.\nThose steps form the ascendant path of economic mobility, and they’re a climb everyone should\nhave a chance at.\nAs many of you know, we’ve recently launched an Economic Growth & Mobility Project at the\nPhiladelphia Fed, and this is exactly what we’re focused on.\nIn addition to our work on the Investing in America’s Workforce report, we recently released an\napprenticeship guide for business. We are also currently exploring ways to put some of the\ninvestment opportunities we’ve found through this research into action in the Third District.\nI truly believe we’ll have people lining up to partner in this work if we can change people’s\nperspectives. I met with a group of CEOs last week, and they confirmed that this is work the\nbusiness community is crying out for.\nBefore I turn it over to questions, I obviously can’t end without the requisite, and well-deserved,\nshout-outs. To our colleagues across the System who hosted listening sessions and collaborated\n8\n\non this research: They’ve all done an incredible job contributing to the report. And to my team,\nof course; in particular, Theresa Singleton for her leadership and Noelle St.Clair for all her work\non this report.\nI also want to thank our other colleagues across the Federal Reserve System and at the Board of\nGovernors, our partners in the room today and those that couldn’t make it out to Austin, and\nthose who have given their time and insight throughout the conference by speaking and sharing\ntheir work. I’m looking forward to the rest of it.\nWith that, I’m more than happy to take some questions.\n9",

Its JPMorgan Chase Innovation Center was recently selected by the Association to\nAdvance Collegiate Schools of Business ― the AACSB ― as an award-winning example of where\n“inspirational work is being done by business schools around the world.” Garnering such an\naward in competition with so many strong and well-resourced peer business schools is the\nresult of the outstanding efforts of many people at the University of Delaware. So,\ncongratulations again.\n1 | P age\n\nAn Economic Outlook\nToday I would like to offer my views on the economic outlook for the U.S. economy and\nmonetary policy and to discuss what I am sure are the issues on all of your minds: interest rates\nand the path they are on, how we can get to full economic health, and what approach we\nshould consider to make full use of our District’s incredible potential.\nAs always, my views are mine alone and do not reflect those of my colleagues at the Federal\nOpen Market Committee (FOMC) or anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\nAfter expressing my views on our nation’s economic health and prospects, I would like to offer\na few observations about the economic conditions a bit closer to home, concentrating on what\nI believe are the inherent strengths and challenges in Delaware’s economy.\nThen, I would like to take a few minutes to address my stance on monetary policy based on my\nassessment of inflation and economic activity over the coming year. If the economy evolves in a\nmaterially different way from what I anticipate, my policy views would likewise change.\nAs Chair Janet Yellen and many of my colleagues have emphasized, I likewise view decisions\nabout economic policy as data dependent, meaning that as we review the data coming in, our\nopinions about the appropriate timing of normalization shift appropriately. Furthermore, the\nconversations and interactions we have every day in the communities we serve also factor into\nthese decisions.\nAn Economic Snapshot\nDespite a fairly weak fourth quarter when real GDP increased by a paltry 0.7 percent, I remain\nupbeat. Economic fundamentals are sound, and our financial system is in good shape. Labor\nmarkets remain dynamic, income growth is solid, and consumer spending continues to increase\nat a solid pace.\n2 | P age\n\nIf there is anything that I believe would pose any risk to the forecast I will deliver, it would be\nthe recent events on Wall Street coupled with the strong dollar and weakening growth in China.\nThe effects that these developments may have on the U.S. economy are something that we\ncontinue to watch closely.\nEmployment\nI am stepping into the Fed at a time when our business climate maintains a steady and gradual\nimprovement, and though challenges remain, we continue making strides.\nRobust employment growth, increased disposable income, and fairly healthy household\nbalance sheets should cause consumption to grow in the coming year by 2.7 percent, and it is\nthe consumer who will underpin the economic progress in my forecast.\nOne of the fundamental strengths supporting this economic growth will be the continued\nstrength in job growth.\nEach of the past three years has witnessed the creation of more than 2 million net new jobs,\nand many of these jobs were in high-skilled professions. Although I expect that employment\ngrowth will slow somewhat, I am still expecting a year when the economy creates in the\nneighborhood of 2 million net new jobs.\nThe number of job openings remains high, and in my meetings around the District, I often hear\nleaders lament about the difficulty in finding the right workers. The latest employment report\nfor January is broadly consistent with that expectation.\nAs job growth continues, labor market slack will diminish. I, therefore, anticipate stronger wage\ngrowth than the 2 percent or so that we achieved last year.\n3 | P age\n\nI also believe that we will see more people return to the labor market and that the participation\nrate will rise modestly to around 63 percent.\nOur participation rate was hit hard by the recession, but it is a number that is also heavily\ninfluenced by demographics and social shifts as well as by the number of discouraged workers.\nFor instance, in the 1960s and ’70s, women entered the workforce in greater numbers, so we\nsaw the participation rate spike. While 63 percent is still low by historical standards, the\nparticipation rate has been trending down for some time. Although I believe we will see a small\ncyclical uptick, the strength in job growth could bring the unemployment rate down to 4.7\npercent by year-end.\nEquity Markets\nAs I mentioned earlier, equity markets have been extremely volatile as of late, and we have\nseen a large sell-off and close to a 10 percent drop in equity prices.\nMuch of the current unease we are experiencing could be due in part to worry regarding China.\nTaken together, slower Chinese growth and declining share values embeds some downside risk\nto my assessment of future economic activity.\nThat said, China is not our major trading partner, and it may well be that as the U.S. economy\nproves its resilience, equity markets are expected to calm down and reverse direction.\nI do anticipate that the loss in wealth arising from the dramatic sell-off will offset some of our\neconomy’s fundamental strength, but I do not feel it will overwhelm it. Thus, although declines\nin asset prices have tempered the view I had of the economy a few months ago, the recent\ndeclines have not fundamentally changed it. As a policymaker, I think it is important to take a\nlong-term view rather than react to short-term volatility and, thus, to consider an array of data\nand longer-term trends in forming our policy stance.\n4 | P age\n\nReal Estate\nSwitching to real estate, I am fairly optimistic about residential investment. The demand for\nhousing has picked up, and prices of both houses and especially rentals are growing strongly.\nPermits for single-family homes are at their highest level since the recovery began, and plans\nfor building in the multifamily sector remain robust. That underlying strength was also reflected\nin December’s healthy report on new single-family homes that grew by 544,000 at an\nannualized rate — the strongest performance since February 2015.\nNonresidential investment is a bit more problematic, however. I say this because I feel it is\nunlikely that we will see strong growth in business fixed investments ― such as new structures,\nequipment, and software ― due in part to the strong dollar adversely affecting manufacturing,\nand therefore, the demand for equipment. That said, I foresee manufacturers continuing to\nstruggle in the coming year and anticipate investment growth of only 2.5 percent or so.\nInflation\nLet me now turn to another important component of the U.S. economy that significantly\ninfluences monetary policy, and that is inflation. As you know, inflation continued to run below\nthe FOMC’s 2 percent target in 2015. Both the fall in energy prices and, to a lesser extent, the\nappreciation of the dollar, have held down headline inflation, or total inflation, which includes\ncommodities such as food and energy prices.\nInflation measures that remove these more volatile components are not far from our goal of 2\npercent. I believe that once energy prices stabilize and start reversing, inflation will return to\nour 2 percent target. I see headline inflation accelerating at an annual average pace of 1.5\npercent by the second half of this year.\nBut as Chair Yellen has emphasized, inflation expectations are also a crucial ingredient in\nformulating monetary policy, and she has noted that “[c]onvincing evidence that longer-run\n5 | P age\n\ninflation expectations have moved lower would be a concern.” This is because that would make\nattaining our inflation target harder to achieve.\nSo far, survey evidence, like that obtained from the Philadelphia Fed’s Survey of\nProfessional Forecasters, does not indicate any unanchoring of inflation expectations.\nHowever, market-based measures are showing that investors are seeking less\ncompensation for inflation.\nBut there are downside risks to my baseline forecast. In particular, we have been below our\ninflation target for all but two years since 2008. Consistently below-target outcomes will\neventually lead to a lack of credibility for our 2 percent goal. Hence, it may be worth erring on\nthe side of accommodation to ensure against that outcome.\nHowever, there are also risks to the upside. There is a good deal of anecdotal evidence that\nfirms are planning to raise wages, especially for jobs that are proving to be hard to fill. I do\nexpect some faster wage growth going forward, and accelerating wage growth could translate\ninto more robust inflation. Additionally, it is unlikely that oil prices will continue to drop, and\neventually, they will become a contributor rather than a detractor from inflation.\nMonetary Policy\nMy approach to policy is to conduct it in ways that will best serve our dual mandate of\nmaximum employment and price stability.\nGiven the behavior of oil prices, inflation is likely to be quite low in the first quarter of the year,\nprobably even negative. Regarding the employment side of our mandate, I believe we will\nattain it early this year, if we have not attained it already.\nOver the medium term, I remain confident that inflation will return to target. Arithmetic is in\nour favor: Energy prices would need to fall again and, by a similar magnitude, to renew their\ndownward pressure on inflation. In other words, even if energy prices remain at very low levels,\n6 | P age\n\ninflation should naturally rebound as current prices become the base on which price increases\nare computed.\nSimilarly, import prices should stabilize as the dollar does, removing another source of\ndownward pressure on inflation. Granted, this process will take some time as the price cuts are\ntransmitted across the economy. Thus, my outlook sees inflation returning to target only\ngradually, more gradually than I thought just a few months ago.\nIt is also fair to say that the risks to my outlook are tilted to the downside. The nervousness in\nthe financial markets and the increased caution that it may cause for economic decision-\nmakers, both households and firms, could imply somewhat slower growth, at least in the first\nhalf of the year.\nAlso, inflation is not likely to pick up substantially until the second half of the year, although, for\nthe reasons I have discussed, I remain confident that inflation will move toward the\nCommittee’s long-run objective of 2 percent.\nThese considerations make me a bit more conservative in my approach to policy, at least in the\nvery near term. Although I cannot give you a definitive path for how policy will evolve, it might\nprove prudent to wait until the inflation data are stronger before we undertake a second rate\nhike. Thus, I am approaching near-term policy a bit more cautiously than I did a few months\nago. That is part of being data dependent. And attentiveness to the data will be a key factor in\nall of my future policy recommendations as well. If financial headwinds dissipate quickly and\ninflation picks up a bit more aggressively, it will require a slightly more aggressive approach to\npolicy.\nI believe as we move into the second half of the year with economic activity growing at trend or\nslightly above trend, the unemployment rate below its natural rate, and price pressures starting\nto assert themselves, policy can truly normalize. I mean this in the sense that we can move\n7 | P age\n\naway meaningfully from the zero lower bound and that our reaction to incoming data can\nreturn to a more historical pattern.\nThat would not necessarily imply an overly aggressive path for policy. Thus, it will take fewer\nrate hikes to attain neutrality in policy than it would have 15 years ago. By historical standards,\nthat in itself implies a somewhat shallower path for interest rates than was typical of past\nrecoveries.\nDelaware\nSo, what does this all mean for our District and its challenges? As we know, Delaware is fighting\nto maintain its edge in attracting and retaining corporate headquarters in the state. The recent\nloss of DuPont represents a stark reminder of a shrinking corporate sector. Fortunately, we\nhave seen rapid growth in education and health services, and the state’s thought leaders have\ntheir sights focused on innovation.\nWe can look to the opening of the University of Delaware’s STAR Campus as an example of how\nthis region knows how to combine its strengths of the public and private sectors to grow and\nshape the economy of the 21st century.\nUniversities like the University of Delaware fuel innovations that shape modern life, from life-\nsaving medicines to life-changing technology. And so, in 2008, when the Chrysler plant finally\nclosed and left behind an aged industrial complex ― a reminder of our District’s past ― we\nchose to invest our expertise and resources to build what now stands there and represents our\nfuture.\nWe recycled 140 million pounds of steel, 5,000 tons of concrete, 40,000 light bulbs, and almost\n4 million pounds of copper, aluminum, and stainless steel.\n8 | P age\n\nToday, more than 400 patients a week come to STAR’s health centers, and thriving inside is a\nspirit of entrepreneurship and innovation. Cybersecurity, Bloom Energy, SevOne, and grid-\nintegrated vehicle systems are being worked on over there. There is a lab focused on providing\nkids with disabilities the mobility they need to socialize, learn, and grow. Please excuse my\nexcitement; after all, I am an engineer. But what I am trying to drive home, in this room filled\nwith all kinds of leaders, is that the investment we all make in human capital, research, and\ninnovation will never stop giving. It will keep us relevant, it will create jobs, and it will sustain\nour economy.\nConclusion\nSo, in closing, my overall view of the economy remains upbeat. Our financial system is in good\nshape, our economic fundamentals are sound, our labor markets remain dynamic, our income\ngrowth is solid, and consumer spending is increasing at a solid pace. We continue to face our\nchallenges head on, and in doing so, we have made significant economic strides as a nation.\nThank you.\n9 | P age",

    "text": "Reinventing Our Systems\nReinventing Our Communities Conference\nInvesting in Opportunity\nHilton Baltimore\nOctober 3, 2018\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood afternoon and thank you for your warm welcome.\nI hope you will all agree that we’ve had three exceptional, thought-provoking days in Baltimore.\nOur time together has been packed with compelling speakers, new ideas, and challenging\nquestions.\nAnd now it seems that it is my job to summarize what we have experienced but not tamp down\nthe energy and excitement that has been generated during our time here.\nBut first, let me acknowledge the incredible work that Noelle St.Clair and the entire Federal\nReserve staff did in creating this event. We all know that conferences like this take a lot of effort,\ncreativity, and attention to detail, not to mention flexibility and good humor. Please join me in\nthanking everyone involved in making this week a reality: our speakers, tour guides, and\npartners. You all have sacrificed sleep and time with your loved ones to ensure this event came\noff without a hitch. Thank you.\nAnd a special thanks to our host city of Baltimore and President Tom Barkin and his team at the\nRichmond Fed as well as President Ron Daniels of Johns Hopkins University and the 21st\nCentury Cities Initiative.\nWhat you heard inside this hotel and what you saw outside these walls have hopefully armed you\nwith new insights and ideas to carry forward as you return home.\nI want to take my time with you this afternoon to deliver some brief remarks that may be slightly\ndifferent than many of you might have expected from a Federal Reserve Bank president. Rather\n1\n\nthan focus on data and economic models, I want to talk to you about the need for and the power\nof systems change.\nAnd, while this speech may be a little different, I still have to issue the standard Fed disclaimer:\nThe views I’m expressing here today are my own and do not reflect those of the Federal Reserve\nBank of Philadelphia or the Federal Reserve System.\nPerspectives on Opportunity\nThe Fed is first and foremost a data-driven institution that relies on objective research to inform\npolicy decisions. That said, our understanding must be informed by the real experiences of those\nwho make up the economy — real people who work, spend, save, and invest in the many ways\nthat drive our local and national economy.\nWhile the data and strategies shared over the past three days have provided valuable insight, I,\nfor one, have found inspiration in the stories. From the personal journeys of Due Quach to\nZachary Wood, these perspectives on opportunity have illustrated the power of narrative to shed\nlight on issues and bring data to life.\nI believe the best policy happens at this intersection of national data and local realities — at the\nintersection between research and practice.\nTo that end, one of the most important parts of my job is traveling around the District and\nhearing from people. We hear stories of community stakeholders — from bankers to laborers,\nyoung students to the retired, from the unemployed to the self-employed. We hear stories from\nurban to rural communities across Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware.\nThrough our travels, we are reminded that, even as the economy at large prospers, people in\nmany communities face real economic challenges.\nWe have heard about increasing rates of poverty in suburban communities, the continuing\nmovement of educated workers out of rural areas, rental housing challenges in cities, and the\neconomic impacts of the opioid epidemic in all of these places.\n2\n\nI’ve learned so much from these interactions, and I value the insights people share about how the\neconomy is working — or in some cases, not working — for them.\nWe’ve spent the past three days looking at incredibly innovative approaches to fixing entrenched\nproblems. We have seen examples of investing not only financial capital but also our collective\nhuman, social, and physical capital in order to truly maximize opportunities for more Americans\nand foster greater economic mobility. We have heard the call to action for strategies that move us\nbeyond transactional to transformational change.\nWhat is clear from these stories, and the data that support them, is that in order for this to\nhappen, there is a need for real systems change. These stories are, in fact, where systems change\ncan begin.\nReinventing Our Systems\nNow, systems change can sound like a heady, overwhelming task — it’s too big, it’s somebody\nelse’s problem, it’s beyond my control. But I would argue that we all have a role to play in\nsystems change.\nSystems change is about understanding what is working and what it isn’t, being willing to\nquestion what is underneath, and knowing that cosmetic repairs will never be successful if we\ndon’t reexamine the whole structure. This is work we all can do, and I fundamentally believe this\nis work we’ve started here together over the past three days.\nAll systems require continual assessment to ensure that the assumptions we make, and the truths\nwe hold to be absolute, still make sense as the world around us evolves.\nAs a few of you may know, I am an engineer by training. One of my first jobs as an engineer was\nworking on the New York City subway system in the 1980s. Many nights were spent walking\ndeep into subway tunnels first opened in 1904 looking for cracks and damage, suggesting repairs\nfor a crumbling system and trying to avoid New York rats. I can assure you this work was as\nglamorous as it sounds. As the city is contemplating new improvements, I am sure it is\nuncovering some of the same structural issues I witnessed first-hand three decades ago.\n3\n\nLike those outdated and aging subway lines, some of the systems that impact our economy also\nneed reinventing. In many cases, we have been putting bandages on larger structural problems,\ncovering things that are fundamentally flawed.\nYet, history has handed us an opportunity to fundamentally alter a system of practices and\nperspectives that may no longer be serving our best interests and needs.\nWe have a labor market with very little slack left. We have employers who say they can’t find\nthe right skills, businesses that say a dearth of workers is affecting their ability to grow, and HR\ndepartments that are struggling to fill vacancies.\nAt the same time, my office sits in a city with a 5.9 percent unemployment rate and an\nastounding 25.7 percent poverty rate, and we gather today in a metropolis with similar\ndisparities, at 6.5 percent unemployment and a 22.2 percent poverty rate.\nThis is why the location of this conference is so important — in Baltimore as in Philadelphia —\nwe have a unique moment in time when we can harness the economic changes happening and\nask the challenging questions: How are we making sure our growth and revitalization benefits\neveryone?\nIf we are to prosper locally and nationally, we need to create systems that promote regional\ngrowth and work for more communities.\nAs we reflect on the magnitude of the task at hand, it is essential to remember that systems are\nmade by people, and therefore can be changed if it is collectively determined that they are no\nlonger serving us. This requires, however, that we bring a sense of intentionality and urgency to\nreinventing these systems into something better.\nChallenging Our Assumptions — Racial Equity\nIn order to change systems, we need to challenge our assumptions. At this moment, this means\nwe need to talk about the real disparities we see in our economy. We are all familiar with the\ndata highlighting differences in poverty rates, median household income, and homeownership by\nrace.\n4\n\nIn many ways, these disparities are exactly why many of us are in this room today: We are trying\nto provide pathways to opportunity for communities that have been left behind. Let’s consider\nthe racial wealth gap. In 2016, white families had the highest level of median family wealth at\n$171,000. Yet black families’ median net worth was only $17,600 and Hispanic families’\n$20,700.1\nIn order to understand what is driving this disparity, we need to look beyond the problems we see\ntoday and challenge the systems that brought us here. Research from our colleagues at the\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis indicates that racial disparities in economic security persist\ndue to deeply rooted structural and systemic factors.2\nIt is our job to question how those systems continue to perpetuate racially disparate outcomes\nthat ultimately limit our economic potential.\nSeveral of you attended the Racial Equity Learning Lab we hosted yesterday. Participants\nwalked away with a toolkit to help them analyze the racial impact of their work. They were also\nchallenged to think more deeply: What will you do to ensure your policies and programs are not\nperpetuating disparate impact? How will your work explicitly address these ongoing challenges?\nWhile we strive to invest in opportunity, we also need to challenge our assumptions that systems\nare providing that opportunity equally to everyone. As community development professionals,\nyou have an important role to play here. This will require a close examination of the systems\nrelated to homeownership, access to capital, small business, employment, and education. And it\nwill require building systems that make equity a priority rather than an afterthought.\nI hope we can each walk away from this conference challenging some of these assumptions,\nlaying the groundwork to help us reinvent opportunities in a rapidly changing economy.\n1 Lisa J. Dettling, Joanne W. Hsu, Lindsay Jacobs, Kevin B. Moore, and Jeffrey P. Thompson with assistance from\nElizabeth Llanes, “Recent Trends in Wealth-Holding by Race and Ethnicity: Evidence from the Survey of Consumer\nFinances,” FEDS Notes, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (September 27, 2017).\n2 Ray Boshara, “The Importance of Exploring the Black/White Wealth Gap,” On the Economy Blog, Federal Reserve\nBank of St. Louis (June 12, 2017).\n5\n\nThe highly transitional nature of the economy makes this work even more important.\nReinvent Opportunities — Automation Report\nMachines and technology have already disrupted so much of how we work today, and future\nautomation is only going to disrupt labor markets further.\nThe Philadelphia Fed recently took a close look at the employment landscape of the Fed’s Third\nDistrict. We assessed the likely effects of automation on jobs across sectors and geographies,\nincluding which jobs are at risk of disappearing or changing dramatically. We also analyzed the\npopulations that will be hardest hit by these changes and where jobs will likely be created to\nabsorb displaced workers.\nIn this research, which we are excited to release today, we found that close to one-fifth of jobs in\nthe Third District had a 95 percent or higher chance of automating. And we found that those\nmost likely to be impacted are those in the most vulnerable positions in our economy — women,\npeople of color, younger people, and lower-skilled workers.\nThe research shows us that automation and technology could increase the inequality we are\nseeing in our economy, but that doesn’t have to be the case.\n“The robots are coming.” In fact, they have been here for a while. However, what happens as a\nresult is not inevitable. Our research shows that we can make decisions to reinvent our workforce\nand economic development systems to make sure that more people can benefit from these\nchanges.\nDisrupt Norms — Outcomes-Based Finance Model\nIn order to do that, we need to be bold enough to disrupt norms — particularly around funding.\nJust last month, I had the opportunity to tour Tec Centro, a workforce training center that offers\nbilingual training to prepare local job seekers for the more than 12,000 job vacancies in\nLancaster County. I spoke with students in the Certified Nursing Assistant (CAN) program\nwhose wages will more than double in as little as three months when they finish their training.\n6\n\nPrograms like these can transform lives, and they are essential to the growth of our regional\neconomies. Yet, so many of these programs are unable to scale and meet the demands of our\ncurrent economy.\nThat being said, as we heard from our previous panel, it would be impossible to “grant-make”\nour way out of this. Likewise, we can’t solve the workforce dilemma through public programs\nalone.\nThat is why I’m excited to announce a new pilot that facilitates private sector investment in\nworkforce development. The Philadelphia Fed team in partnership with our city’s workforce\ninvestment board and a major Philadelphia-based national tech employer are creating a new\noutcomes-based funding model for workforce development.\nWith the guidance of thought-leaders like Social Finance, this new model will align incentives\nfor every stakeholder.\nThe program will identify workers in jobs at risk of automation and train them in digital skills,\nones that will be useful immediately after training but will also arm them with skills for the\nfuture.\nOutcomes-based finance, or Pay for Success, is, of course, not a new concept. What makes this\ninitiative different is that, instead of issuing social impact bonds and having government paying\nfor outcomes, the employer will pay the bill once the training meets its business needs and\ndemonstrates return on investment.\nIf it’s successful, this will be the first program of its kind to have the private sector paying for\noutcomes delivered via public workforce funding. Repayments can then be recycled to pilot\nother projects and meet the needs of even more jobs seekers and employers in Philadelphia. This\nwill send a strong message to employers that workforce development is an investment, not a\nsocial service.\nThis is a new kind of partnership, the kind that fundamentally disrupts systems and the ways we\nhave been doing things. And I think it will help hit the reset button on the relationship between\nthe public and private sectors and the ways they work together.\n7\n\nMost importantly, this is an idea that can be adopted across industries. To say that this excites me\nwould be a huge understatement, as you can tell.\nWe hope that by challenging assumptions about the impact of automation and by disrupting the\nnorms of how the private sector invests in workforce development, we can reinvent opportunities\nfor those who could most benefit from the growing economy.\nConclusion\nWe could not gather with you all here without acknowledging the great Jeremy Nowak, who\nserved as chair of the board of the Philadelphia Fed for a number of years. I know that so many\nof you here in this room knew Jeremy. I’m told that, at his memorial service in August, a lot of\nthe stories people told publicly and privately that day were about how often Jeremy had yelled at\nthem but how much they loved him for it. He was that kind of guy: impatient and passionate. He\nspent his career at the intersections of capital and people, of data and anecdote, of reason and\nemotion. He asked hard questions, he challenged assumptions, he disrupted norms, and he\nreinvented opportunities. Every day. And he wanted all of us to do the same thing. Every day.\nThe good news is that you are already leading this work.\nMy challenge to you today — as Jeremy would have challenged us — is to not forget the role\nthat you can all play in fundamentally changing the systems and structures that limit opportunity.\nSo, let us return home and continue to do the hard work and ask the hard questions and demand\nbetter answers from ourselves and from others.\nAnd let us never forget that our work to reinvent our communities matters — for countless\nindividuals and for our larger economy.\nThank you.\n8",

    "text": "Community Banks and Digital Innovation\nFederal Reserve Innovation Office Hours\nPhiladelphia, PA (virtual)\nJune 28, 2021\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nCommunity Banks and Digital Innovation\nFederal Reserve Innovation Office Hours\nPhiladelphia, PA (virtual)\nJune 28, 2021\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nHello and welcome! It’s great that so many of you have joined us for these virtual office hours. And by\nholding this event virtually, we are missing out on useful hallway conversation — not to mention some\ntasty snacks — but it’s terrific so many of you were able to join with just the click of a button.\nNow, before we proceed, I have to give you my standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are\nmy own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or\nin the Federal Reserve System.\nThe Importance of Community Banks\nHere at the Fed we wear many hats: We’re a bank, a supervisor and regulator of other banks, and the\nlargest collection of economists in the world. We have the ability to lend money, to foster payments and\nsettlements, and to promote consumer protection and community development.\nWe also have the power to convene. And that is precisely our aim with this program: to facilitate face-\nto-face discussions with individual banks and fintech firms about responsible financial innovation. We’re\ndelighted you’re here to learn more about how innovation and technology are impacting the financial\nlandscape.\nThese meetings can be two-way learning opportunities for all participants. Banks have tremendous\nregulatory expertise, and fintech firms have deep wells of innovation expertise. But this will also be a\nlearning experience for us here at the Federal Reserve. Your insights are crucial to what we do here\nevery day — so please don’t hold back.\n1\n\nI’m particularly glad that we have so many representatives from small community banks here. While I\nprobably don’t need to belabor the importance of community banks to this particular audience, I think it\nsometimes gets lost just how central community banks are to our economy — and indeed, to American\nsociety.\nJust consider the numbers. There are more than 4,800 active community bank charters across the\ncountry. And of those, almost exactly half are in communities with fewer than 50,000 residents.\nCommunity banks — those with $10 billion or less in assets — collectively hold more than $3 trillion in\nassets. You don’t need to rewatch It’s a Wonderful Life for the hundredth time to get a sense of how\nvitally important these institutions are.\nCOVID-19 and its associated economic effects not only emphasized the importance of community banks;\nthey have also heightened the risks to the sector in a world where more and more business is conducted\nonline.\nGiven their strong relationships with local businesses, community banks were absolutely essential to\noperating the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which kept so many small businesses afloat during\nthe pandemic. According to my Fed colleague, Governor Michelle Bowman, community banks have\nmade up about 40 percent of the total value of PPP loans issued. It’s probably no exaggeration to say\nthat the PPP would have failed without community banks’ support.\nOpportunities and Challenges\nBut economic shutdowns imposed to curtail the spread of COVID-19 — particularly those that shuttered\nbank branches — also demonstrated just how important digitization is and the perils of falling behind on\nfinancial innovation and fintech.\nOnline platforms have gobbled up an increasing number of home mortgages, for instance. And one\nbanker in our area here in the Third District recently told me that because of labor shortages in his area,\nhe has been unable to reopen his bank lobbies even as the pandemic has waned. If these trends hold,\nexpect more and more use of digital solutions.\nDuring these office hours, I would encourage bankers to consider digitization opportunities for your\ninstitution and customers, as well as innovative opportunities that align with your strategic plans. And\ntomorrow, we will hear from District bankers about their experiences with fintech partnerships and\ninnovation.\n2\n\nThere are many opportunities, not only for serving your existing customers but also for reaching new\npopulations. Think of the creative ways fintech could be deployed to reach the under- or even\nunbanked, for instance.\nI understand, of course, that there are challenges. Smaller banks often simply don’t have the workforce\nor the cash to first research and investigate and then to ultimately invest in costly fintech platforms.\nThey lack the economies of scale that bigger banks enjoy. Set-up costs can be prohibitive. And, to be\nfrank, there are occasional cultural differences between the “move fast and break things” ethos of many\nfintech suppliers and the more risk-averse sensibilities of bankers.\nAnd those risks are real. Consider the astonishing rapidity of technological development. There are\nserious and understandable concerns: What if a year or two after making an expensive fintech\ninvestment, the technology has already become obsolete? You don’t want to be stuck with a bunch of\nbuggy whips a year after the invention of the Model T.\nAnd there can be a hesitancy to embrace new technologies on the client side, too, of course. Paper\nchecks and cash, for instance, have endured in part because people are so comfortable with them.\nIt is precisely because of these opportunities and these risks that these office hours are such a great\nopportunity for all of us. Constructive dialogue among banks, fintech firms, and the Federal Reserve will\nhelp us to listen and learn from each other.\nThe Federal Reserve, for its part, is very supportive of innovation. We’re here to convene, to support,\nand to supervise.\nWe will now hear from Bill Spaniel, head of supervision at the Philadelphia Fed, and Board of Governors\nDeputy Director Art Lindo on community bank partnerships.\nThanks again and enjoy the event.\n3",

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nUnderstanding How Americans Earn, Save, and Invest\nNew Perspectives on Consumer Behavior in Credit and Payments Markets Conference\nPhiladelphia, PA (virtual)\nSeptember 9, 2021\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood afternoon and welcome! It’s great to see so many of you at this, the Philadelphia Federal\nReserve’s 11th biennial conference on household finance and consumer payments — though this is the\nfirst we’ve held in 2D.\nWhile I’ll regret the lack of hallway conversation — honestly, some of my best ideas have come about\nquite randomly at the edges of conferences like this — it’s great that by holding this conference virtually\nwe are able to host such a widely dispersed set of participants and attendees. Though I suspect some of\nyou are regretting missing the opportunity to pad your frequent flyer account balances … which is\nsomething else I can personally attest to.\nAs the president and CEO of the Philadelphia Federal Reserve, it always gives me great pride to tout the\nstellar work of our Consumer Finance Institute. But before I do that, also as president and CEO of the\nPhiladelphia Federal Reserve, there is something else I must do. That is providing the standard Fed\ndisclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on\nthe Federal Open Market Committee or in the Federal Reserve System.\nWe launched the Consumer Finance Institute — CFI to us at the Philadelphia Fed — in 2017 as a\nstrategic initiative dedicated to producing leading-edge, policy-relevant research, and events like this\none. CFI explores how credit markets and payment systems affect consumers and the economy. But\nwhile the institute itself is only 4 years old, it is built on a foundation of two decades of heavy\ninvestment in research centered on how people earn, spend, save, and invest. The Philadelphia Fed’s\ninterest in these topics is not only academic: Our goal at CFI is to develop insights that contribute to a\nhealthy consumer sector, a stable financial system, and a resilient regional and national economy.\n1\n\nFor us, this is personal. Philadelphia is the poorest big city in the United States.\nConferences like this one are a big part of CFI’s strategy to promote a healthier economy — and you’ll\nsoon see why. In the next two days, we’ll be learning about path-breaking research focused on timely\nsubjects such as building wealth through homeownership, consumer bankruptcy, pandemic housing\nrelief, and consumer protection and regulation. These are rich and interesting subjects for rigorous\nresearch in their own right, but they are also vitally important topics that have an impact on all\nAmericans, just about every day.\nWhen I was reviewing the conference materials, I was also struck by how much of the research\npresented at this conference will focus on the racial inequities that continue to bedevil our society. The\nresearch presented will focus, for instance, on racial disparities in bankruptcy filings and housing values,\nimportant examples of the many drivers of our nation’s yawning racial wealth gap.\nAnd this, too, is personal for us. Philadelphia is not only America’s poorest big city, it is also the nation’s\nlargest predominantly Black one.\nIn recent years, CFI researchers have documented new facts about differences in outcomes by race as it\npertains to consumers’ finances, with the ultimate goal of identifying why those disparities exist.\nWithout both — the facts and an understanding of the causal drivers — there is no way to have\nmeaningful discussions about how public policies can improve outcomes.\nIn my view, such research and debate is the right thing to do, morally — and also holds great economic\nimportance. As the nation’s central bank, the Federal Reserve is charged with building an economy that\nmakes opportunity available to everyone and that achieves maximum employment. We can’t do that so\nlong as profound racial inequities persist for reasons we do not fully understand.\nSo just in the past year, CFI has published important new research findings, for instance, that Black,\nHispanic, and Asian mortgage borrowers were significantly more likely than White borrowers to miss\npayments due to financial distress — and significantly less likely to refinance to take advantage of the\nlarge decline in interest rates that was spurred by the Federal Reserve’s mortgage-backed security\npurchase program. We’ve also examined which groups took up mortgage forbearance at which rates,\nand what effect that had on racial disparities. The news there is somewhat more encouraging. And\nwe’ve conducted an ongoing series of surveys focused on how the pandemic has affected different\ngroups of Americans.\n2\n\nCFI scholars have also taken a historical view, examining, for example, the ongoing effects of racial\ncovenants included in housing deeds nearly a century ago. Using a series of geospatial maps, we found\nthat properties with covenants within the city of Philadelphia formed an invisible barrier to less densely\npopulated areas sought after by White residents and around predominantly White neighborhoods\nthroughout the city — and that those effects are still visible.\nThese are just a few examples of the work CFI researchers are doing every day, and I urge all of you —\nonce the conference is over — to please dig into our website at philadelphiafed.org, for much, much\nmore.\nNow, I’m well aware you’ve joined us to hear from our conference presenters rather than me, so I’ll\nleave you. But before I go, I can’t resist one more boast about the fantastic work we’re doing at the\nConsumer Finance Institute. For this conference, we received approximately 140 submissions and\nselected only eight papers to be presented. Super Bowl tickets are easier to get most years. What a\ntestament to the global recognition that CFI is receiving for its important, path-breaking work!\nSo, thank you again for joining us and please enjoy the conference.\n3",
