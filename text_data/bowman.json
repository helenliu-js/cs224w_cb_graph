Bowman\nGovernor\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Gender and Career Progression”\nEuropean Central Bank\nFrankfurt, Germany\nOctober 21, 2019\n\nCongratulations on what I have no doubt was a productive and thought-provoking day,\nthough one, I am sure, that also underscored the many remaining challenges for women and\nminorities in the professions of economics and finance. I want to thank our hosts, the European\nCentral Bank, who put so much work into making this conference a success, as well as the\nconference organizers from all three sponsoring institutions—the ECB, Federal Reserve, and the\nBank of England. I also want to express my appreciation to the many researchers from\nuniversities and from other central banks, as well as the members of women’s and minority\ncommittees of economics and finance associations from around the world, who are attending the\nconference in Frankfurt. I wish that I could have been there with you to participate in the\ndiscussions.\nI found the conference program to be particularly interesting, and I look forward to Federal\nReserve staff coming back to Washington to share what they learned from the research and\ndiscussions. At the Federal Reserve, we greatly value this conference, not only for the\ninteractions that our staff have while they are there, but also when they bring back what they\nlearn and share it with our staff. Last year, we had over 200 staff members from across the\norganization attend summary presentations in DC given by several staff members who had\nattended the conference in London. In fact, staff in Washington had a “watch party” to view the\nwebcast of today’s panels. The topics of today’s conference, including papers on the promotion\nof women, the role of culture and institutions, and the dynamics of publishing, conferences, and\nseminars, will all spur additional conversations and ideas for action among staff at the Federal\nReserve.\nIn my view, central banks have a responsibility to be leaders in addressing diversity and\ninclusion, not only for our own institutions, but also because of our influence on the profession\n\nas a whole. Part of the value of this conference is that we, as central banks, can promote the\nstudy of these issues and discuss concrete steps that we can take together to address them.\nCertainly, we take diversity and inclusion issues to heart at the Federal Reserve.1 We believe\nthat the best ideas, policies and, ultimately, service to the public are the result of diverse\nperspectives, and from a staff that reflects the rich diversity of our nation. Inclusion makes us\nstronger by providing all employees the assurance that they will be working in an environment\nthat welcomes and values their differences, and that recognizes and rewards people according to\nthe contributions they make in advancing the mission of the organization. That is not to say that\nwe have all of the solutions, or that we do not have considerable progress to make. But we have\nmade efforts in a number of areas. These efforts are consistent with the Congressional directive\nto establish the Office of Minority and Women Inclusion, and as articulated in the Board of\nGovernors’ Strategic Plan for Diversity and Inclusion.2\nFirst, we have made a commitment, and have made progress, to make our institution more\ndiverse. That includes efforts to bring greater diversity to the Board of Directors of our Federal\nReserve Banks and Branches as well as to senior leadership in the Federal Reserve System. We\nhave also worked to improve our internal culture. These efforts include re-establishing and\nstrengthening employee resource groups. We are working to come up with codes of conduct\nincluding efforts to make our meetings more inclusive and set rules around behavior in seminars.\nWe are also providing diversity and inclusion as well as bystander training to both new and\nexisting employees.\nSecond, we have broadened our reach in recruiting to provide a more diverse range of\napplicants the opportunity to apply for positions at the Federal Reserve—through strengthening\n1 See https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/diversityinclusion.htm\n2 https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/minority-women-inclusion.htm\n\nour connections to schools that serve diverse populations, hiring an outreach specialist for these\ncommunities, establishing a stronger presence at career fairs for diverse students, and hosting\ncareer events for students to promote jobs in economics and finance at the Federal Reserve.\nThird, we are working with high schools and universities to inspire students’ interest in\neconomics and finance. We are also working to provide them with the tools they need to enter\nthese fields. This has included partnerships with local high schools to teach economics, and with\na local Historically Black University, Howard University, to teach and mentor students in\neconomics and statistical analysis. This last initiative has led to students developing an interest\nand pursuing careers in economics, including as research assistants at the Federal Reserve, and\nseveral are currently employed at the Board as research assistants.\nOf course, these conferences are also an important part of addressing diversity and inclusion\nin central banking, and the economics and finance professions. I look forward to welcoming all\nof you to Washington next fall to attend the third such conference, hosted by the Federal\nReserve. We hope these conferences will inspire further work on these important topics and will\nhighlight the issues that researchers are addressing, and more broadly promote the conversations\nwe are having in the economic and finance professions.\nThank you for your work, and I look forward to seeing you at the Federal Reserve next year.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n10:00 a.m. EDT\nJune 6, 2025\nTaking a Fresh Look at Supervision and Regulation\nRemarks by\nMichelle W. Bowman\nVice Chair for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nGeorgetown University McDonough School of Business\nPsaros Center for Financial Markets and Policy\nWashington, D.C.\nJune 6, 2025\n\nIt is a pleasure to join you today for my first public remarks as the Federal Reserve\nBoard’s Vice Chair for Supervision.1 Today, I will describe my approach to leading the Fed’s\nDivision of Supervision and Regulation in its vital work to promote the safe and sound operation\nof the U.S. banking system. I have spoken extensively in the past about my principles for\nsupervision and regulation, which will continue to guide my approach to supervision and the\nbank regulatory framework.2\nAt the core of these principles is pragmatism, which focuses on first identifying the\nproblem to be solved and then developing efficient solutions.3 Once we have identified a need\nfor reform, or a problem to be solved, our next task is to conduct a careful analysis of the\nintended and unintended consequences of any proposed policy solution, and to consider\nalternative approaches that lead to lower cost or better outcomes.\nThe views I share with you today reflect my initial thoughts about how these principles\nshould be incorporated into the important work that will be required to improve supervision and\nregulation in the future, addressing: (i) enhancing supervision to more effectively and efficiently\nmeet the Fed’s safety and soundness goals; (ii) reviewing and reforming the capital framework to\nensure that it is appropriately designed and calibrated; (iii) reviewing regulations and\ninformation collections to ensure that this framework remains viable; and (iv) considering\napproaches to ensure the applications process is transparent, predictable, and fair.\nEnhancing Supervision\nSupervision focused on material financial risks that threaten a bank’s safety and\nsoundness is inherently more effective and efficient. We should be cautious about the temptation\nto overemphasize or become distracted by relatively less important procedural and\ndocumentation shortcomings. Fundamentally, as I’ve noted in the past, our goal should be to\n\n- 2 -\nprioritize the identification of material financial risks and encourage prompt action to mitigate\nrisks that threaten safety and soundness. There are a number of changes we can adopt in the near\nterm to better enable us to accomplish this goal:\nTailoring. Risks are not uniform, and each bank is unique based on its business model,\ncomplexity, and business profile. I am a long-time proponent of tailoring banking regulations.\nGoing forward we will extend the application of tailoring to our supervisory approach to\nfinancial institutions, not only among bank categories, but also within a particular category.\nIn the past, the Board has “pushed down” requirements developed for the largest firms to\nsmaller banks, often including regional and community banks. One approach that would\npreserve tailoring is to create an independent community bank supervisory and regulatory\nframework to clearly separate these banks from larger bank supervision and regulation. This\nwould serve to insulate these smaller banks from standards designed for larger and more\ncomplex firms. While I have no objection to a deliberate, intentional policy to apply similar\nstandards to firms with similar characteristics as conditions warrant, the gradual erosion of\ndistinct regulatory and supervisory standards among firms with very different characteristics—\nessentially the subtle reversal of tailoring over time—is not a reasonable approach for\nimplementing supervision and regulation.\nBoth regulators and legislators should consider whether the bank regulatory framework\nincludes appropriate thresholds for defining distinct categories of institutions, and whether\nsimple fixes—for example the indexing of thresholds to inflation or growth—could better ensure\na sound, tailored approach that remains durable over time. It is clear that the current $10 billion\nthreshold defining the upper bounds of a “community bank” leaves many institutions that pursue\n\n- 3 -\nthis business model—of community and relationship-based banking—subject to heightened\nrequirements more suitable for larger and more complex firms.\nTo further these objectives, later this year I will host a conference on small and\ncommunity bank issues, to discuss improving the bank regulatory framework to adopt a more\nefficient, tailored approach for these firms. We must demonstrate wisdom and courage by\ncarefully listening to those who are subject to regulatory oversight and considering ways to\nenhance our approaches to both supervision and regulation.\nOne issue that continues to present challenges to smaller banks is check fraud. The\nongoing increase in bank losses to this type of fraud can negatively impact the perceived safety\nof the banking system and result in significant consumer harm. Past efforts by regulators have\nbeen frustratingly slow to advance and seem to have done little to address the underlying root\ncauses of this increase in fraud. I will continue to work to identify specific actions that can be\ntaken to reduce the incidence of fraud, including through expediting the remediation process\nfrom check fraud after it occurs. I expect that the Federal Reserve, in coordination with the OCC\nand FDIC, will soon take action on this front.\nRatings. Ratings must reflect risk, and yet we have seen gradual changes in supervisory\napproaches that have eroded the link between ratings and financial condition.4 Federal Reserve\nsupervisory statistics show that that two-thirds of the largest financial institutions in the U.S.\nwere rated unsatisfactory in the first half of 2024.5 At the same time, the majority of these same\ninstitutions met all supervisory expectations for capital and liquidity.\nThis odd mismatch between financial condition and supervisory ratings requires careful\nreview and appropriate revisions to our current approach. Under the current large bank ratings\n\n- 4 -\nframework, a single component rating can result in a firm being considered not “well-managed,”\nwhich has driven the disparity between well-managed status and financial condition.\nThe Federal Reserve will soon begin to address this mismatch, by proposing changes to\nthe Large Financial Institution ratings framework. The proposed changes will be designed to\nresult in a more sensible approach to determining whether a firm is well-managed, no longer\ndisproportionately weighting a single framework component for a firm that has demonstrated\nresilience under a range of conditions and stresses.\nThis initial change should help address the gap between assessed ratings and material\nfinancial risk for those firms subject to this framework. We have an obligation to ensure that our\nsupervisory ratings are current, credible, and reflect material financial risk. This promotes\neffective supervision and ensures that firms are accurately rated based on their underlying\nfinancial strength, which should increase the public’s confidence in our assessment of the\nbanking system.\nWe must also consider the appropriateness of the broader ratings framework which\napplies to smaller institutions, including the CAMELS framework. Are these frameworks\nappropriately tailored to capture material financial risks, particularly for elements that rely on\nsubjective examiner judgment? While judgment is a legitimate and necessary tool in\nsupervision, it must always be grounded in the materiality of the identified issues as they relate\nto the financial health of each institution and the banking system as a whole. This has been a\nnotable shift in supervision not only for large banks, but also for regional and community banks.\nImproving prioritization. Examiners review a broad range of activities in the\nsupervisory process. A random sample of examination reports demonstrates that supervisory\nfocus has shifted away from core financial risks (credit risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk,\n\n- 5 -\nfor example), to process-related concerns. While process is important for effective management,\nthere is a risk that overemphasis on process and supervisory box-checking can be a distraction\nfrom the core purpose of supervision, which is to probe financial condition and financial risk.\nChecklists should not distract examiners from the central purpose of examinations.\nAnother tool that we will be reviewing with a critical lens is the use of horizontal\nreviews. In theory, horizontal reviews—where examiners conduct a narrow but deep review on a\nparticular topic across multiple banks—can help improve an examiner’s perspective. Horizontal\nreviews, when used effectively, can help supervisors better understand the range of industry\npractices.\nBut these reviews have quickly evolved into oversimplification of complex issues and\noften include “grading on a curve,” where firms are rank-ordered, with an expectation that\nimplementing a simpler approach fails to meet expectations, under the assumption that the more\ncomplex approach is appropriate for all firms. However, this side-by-side comparison fails to\naddress the only question that matters: whether a firm’s approach meets appropriate legal and\nsupervisory standards for the individual firm’s characteristics. Differences in approaches are not\nindicative of shortcomings, particularly since these can often be explained by distinguishing the\nunderlying activities, scope and scale of operations, and risk tolerance of the firm’s board and\nmanagement.\nThere is also a lack of transparency in the results of these exams, and a risk that\nhorizontal reviews will create generally applicable rules without complying with the\nAdministrative Procedure Act (APA). I will be looking closely at whether the continued use of\nhorizontal exams going forward is appropriate, and if so, to ensure that these exams are\n\n- 6 -\nsufficiently transparent, they reflect proper respect for the APA, and do not circumvent our\nresponsibility to provide each regulated institution with a fair, firm-specific evaluation.\nThe role of guidance in supervision. Finally, I will discuss the important role of\nguidance in the supervisory process. Guidance can be an effective tool to promote transparency\nin supervisory expectations, to provide clarity to regulated institutions on the permissibility of\nnew activities and their associated risks, and to provide firms some perspective on how they may\ncomply with statutory and regulatory requirements. Structured with these goals in mind,\nguidance can further the objective of supervisory prioritization.\nWhere guidance does not further these objectives, it is worth revisiting. I think it is\nimportant that we review a wide range of existing guidance, including outstanding Supervision\nand Regulation Letters (SR Letters), topical guidance that addresses issues that may adversely\naffect innovation (like the extensive guidance that has some bearing on third-party risk\nmanagement), and the many other guidance documents that have been issued in recent years.\nFundamentally, guidance should clarify expectations, and provide answers to industry\nquestions, such as our earlier “office hours” guidance that provided a venue for banks and\ninnovators to share information on new products and services like digital asset activities and\nartificial intelligence.\nChanging expectations around the use of guidance, as a tool to promote clarity in\nsupervisory expectations, can encourage innovation in the banking system. Uncertainty in\nsupervisory expectations has long been an obstacle to banks seeking to innovate, including banks\nengaging in digital asset activities or incorporating new technologies like artificial intelligence to\nimprove efficiency and delivery of products and services. Just as it is imperative that banks\n\n- 7 -\ninnovate to remain competitive in the future, it is critical that bank supervisors enable the\nadoption of new technologies in a manner consistent with safety and soundness.\nExaminer training and workforce development. Examiners must engage in a\nchallenging course of study and pass rigorous tests before qualifying to become a commissioned\nbank examiner. Those who have obtained this license have a strong foundation that they can rely\non to conduct appropriate examinations. The commission demonstrates an elevated level of\nexpertise, judgment, and fairness that these examiners bring to their work. As such, they should\nnot shy away from transparency or public accountability.\nCurrently, the Federal Reserve does not require all staff involved in supervision and bank\nexamination to have met or to be on a path to meet this credential. Regulated entities should be\nable to expect that all of our examination and supervisory teams have achieved or are working to\nachieve this level of professional expertise. Going forward, the Fed will prioritize this training,\nparticularly as we face an aging workforce across the Federal banking agencies that will require\nour new examination staff to ensure the safety and soundness of the banking system into the\nfuture. Failure to invest in and plan for examiner training today will result in much less effective\nsupervision in years to come.\nCapital\nCapital requirements are an important component of the prudential regulatory framework\nand are essential for the stability of interconnected banking and financial systems around the\nworld. Yet too often, our efforts to address capital reform take a piecemeal approach to capital\nrequirements. We tend to review individual elements of the capital framework in isolation,\nwithout considering whether proposed changes are sensible in the aggregate and contribute to a\ncapital framework in which all components work together effectively.\n\n- 8 -\nWhile each component is important, the aggregate calibration of requirements is\nultimately the most meaningful, and we must examine whether this approach in totality\nappropriately captures risk. Over-calibrated capital requirements effectively create market\ndistortions, disfavoring some activities over others in a way that is divorced from prudential\nsafety and soundness goals and economic conditions.\nLeverage ratios are one example that illustrates this concern. The Federal Reserve has\nlong acknowledged that leverage ratios are intended to act as a “backstop” to risk-based capital\nrequirements. When leverage ratios become the binding capital constraint at an excessive level,\nthey can create market distortions. This is especially true in the case of the enhanced\nsupplementary leverage ratio (eSLR) which is applicable to the largest banks.\nAs a result of this leverage requirement, banks are less inclined to engage in low-risk\nactivities like Treasury market intermediation and revise their business activities in a way that is\nneither justified nor responsive to their customer needs. These distortions can also create\nbroader financial system impacts like increased stress on Treasury market functioning. To be\nclear, the increasing bindingness of the eSLR on the largest firms did not result from careful\npolicy debate and discussion. Instead, it is an unintended consequence of market and other bank\nregulatory requirements implemented after it was originally put in place.\nThe original calibration of the eSLR was based on forecasts of the level of reserves and\nother so-called “safe assets” in the system that are now far out of line with current levels. I\nexpect that in the near future, the agencies will publish a proposal to help address this concern\nand ensure that the eSLR resumes functioning as a backstop capital requirement.\nWhile this fix to the eSLR is necessary, it may not be sufficient to address issues in the\ncapital framework. In July, the Federal Reserve will host a conference that will broaden our\n\n- 9 -\nperspective in the consideration of capital requirements for large banks. We will bring together\nbankers, academics, and other capital experts to examine whether capital requirements as\ncurrently structured and calibrated are operating as intended—in a complementary fashion.\nI welcome the opportunity to consider a broader range of perspectives as we look to the\nfuture of capital framework reforms. In addition to considering potential changes to leverage\nratio requirements and stress testing, the capital conference will also include a discussion of\npotential reforms to the GSIB surcharge and the Basel III capital requirements.\nThe Board has already proposed a significant change to reduce the volatility in capital\nrequirements resulting from our current stress testing process. The proposal includes providing a\nlonger implementation timeline to phase in the annual stress capital buffer requirement. And\nlater this year, the Board will consider more extensive changes aimed at promoting transparency,\nfairness, and predictability in the stress testing program.\nWhile stress testing is an important supervisory tool, its implementation, outcomes, and\nprocesses have raised significant questions and concerns about its effectiveness in identifying\nsystemic weakness. The lack of transparency around the models used in stress testing prevents\nmeaningful discussions about how the stress tests can be improved.\nCapital has an impact on the business activities of all banks. Although the capital\nframework for the smallest institutions tends to be simpler and more straightforward, calibration\nand design elements play an important role in the functioning of smaller banks just as they do for\nlarger banks. Therefore, it is important that we also take the opportunity to address issues for\nsmaller banks, that provide critical support to their local communities and the economy. On this\nfront, we will review and consider the community bank framework, including capital\n\n- 10 -\nrequirements like the calibration of the community bank leverage ratio, and whether reforms to\nthe capital framework for mutual banks can be improved to promote capital formation.\nI look forward to the results of public engagement on these issues, including through the\nupcoming conferences. As we consider bank capital requirements, the focus should be on\nachieving a capital framework that provides a strong foundation for the banking system,\nappropriately requires banks to hold capital corresponding to risk, and works together with bank\nsupervision to support a safe and sound banking system.\nReview of Regulations and Information Collections\nSince the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act nearly 15 years ago, the body of regulations that\nall banks are subject to has increased dramatically. Many of the reforms made after the 2008\nfinancial crisis were important and essential to ensuring a stronger and more resilient banking\nsystem. Yet, a number of the changes were backward looking—responding only to that\nmortgage crisis—not fully considering the potential future unintended consequences or future\nstates of the world.\nWith well over a decade of change in the banking system now behind us post-\nimplementation, it is time to evaluate whether all of these changes continue to be relevant. Some\nof the regulations put in place immediately after that financial crisis resulted in pushing\nfoundational banking activities out of the regulated banking system into the less regulated\ncorners of the financial system. We need to ask whether this was and continues to be\nappropriate. These tradeoffs are complicated, and we must consider not only the changes that\nwere made but also the evolution of and differences in the banking system today.\nDriving all risk out of the banking system is at odds with the fundamental nature of the\nbusiness of banking. Banks must be able to earn a profit and grow while also managing their\n\n- 11 -\nrisks. Adding requirements that impose more costs must be balanced with whether the new\nrequirements make the correct tradeoffs between safety and soundness and enabling banks to\nserve their customers and run their businesses. The task of policymakers and regulators is not to\neliminate risk from the banking system, but rather to ensure that risk is appropriately and\neffectively managed.\nIn a well-functioning, regulated banking system, banks serve an indispensable role in\ncredit provision and economic stability. The goal is to create and maintain a system that\nsupports safe and sound banking practices, and results in the implementation of proper risk\nmanagement. Our goal should not be to prevent banks from failing or even eliminate the risk\nthat they will. Our goal should be to make banks safe to fail, meaning that they can be allowed\nto fail without threatening to destabilize the rest of the banking system.\nMaintenance of the regulatory framework is necessary to ensure that our regulations\ncontinue to strike the right balance between encouraging growth and innovation, and safety and\nsoundness. One easily identifiable way to achieve this is using the Economic Growth and\nRegulatory Paperwork Reduction Act (EGRPRA) review process, which the agencies initiated in\nFebruary of last year.\nThe EGRPRA review process requires the federal banking agencies to identify any\noutdated, unnecessary, or overly burdensome regulations, eliminate unnecessary regulations, and\ntake other steps to address the regulatory burdens associated with outdated or overly burdensome\nregulations. Prior iterations of the EGRPRA process have been underwhelming in their ability to\nresult in meaningful change, but it is my expectation that this review, and eventually the\naccompanying report to Congress, will provide a meaningful process for stakeholders and the\npublic to engage with the banking agencies in identifying regulations that are no longer\n\n- 12 -\nnecessary or are overly burdensome. It is also my expectation that regulators will be responsive\nto concerns raised by the public.\nAnother area that is ripe for review are several of the Board’s rules that address core\nbanking issues—from loans to insiders, to transactions with affiliates, to state member bank\nactivities, and domestic and foreign activities of bank holding companies. Many of the Board’s\nregulations have not been comprehensively reviewed or updated in more than 20 years. Given\nthe dynamic nature of the banking system and how the economy and banking and financial\nservices industries have evolved over that period, we should update and simplify many of the\nBoard’s regulations, including thresholds for applicability and benchmarks.\nBanking Applications\nThe process to file an application and receive regulatory approval, whether it involves\nbanks seeking a de novo charter, institutions seeking to merge, or any other application for bank\nregulatory approval should reflect both (1) transparency as to the information required in the\napplication itself, and the standards of approval being applied, and (2) clear timelines for action.\nRecent experience with banking applications suggests that revisions would be helpful in\nthis space. Streamlining the applications for de novo formation, and establishing clearer\nstandards for approval, may encourage more de novo activity.\nSimilar problems have affected bank mergers and acquisitions, where there have been\nlengthy processing delays. We need to rethink whether many of the additional requests for\ninformation can be addressed through better application forms or relying on information that is\navailable from bank examinations. We should also consider factors that force applications to be\nmoved from Reserve Bank-delegated processing to requiring consideration by the Board. One\nexample is the perverse effect of “competitive” screens that disproportionately affect transactions\n\n- 13 -\nin rural and underserved banking markets. Another is the treatment of adverse public comments\nthat may lack factual support or rely on matters already considered in the review process,\nincluding existing supervisory records.\nClosing Thoughts\nI am honored to have the opportunity to serve as the Vice Chair for Supervision. The\nwork of supervision and regulation is critical to maintaining a safe and sound banking system\nand protecting U.S. financial stability. Conditions constantly evolve in the banking system, and\nso too must the regulatory and supervisory framework. We must be proactive and responsive in\nthe face of emerging risks and ensure that the framework operates in an efficient and effective\nmanner.\nThe steps I have identified today are intended to further these goals by creating an initial\nroadmap to refocus supervisory and regulatory efforts on the core financial risks most critical to\nmaintaining a healthy and resilient banking system. I look forward to working with my Board\ncolleagues and my counterparts at the other banking agencies as we pursue sensible and\npragmatic reforms.\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 See, e.g., Michelle W.

    "text": "For release on delivery\n8:15 a.m. EST\nFebruary 10, 2020\nEmpowering Community Banks\nRemarks by\nMichelle W. Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nConference for Community Bankers\nsponsored by\nThe American Bankers Association\nOrlando, Florida\nFebruary 10, 2020\n\nThank you to the American Bankers Association for inviting me to address this\nyear’s Conference for Community Bankers. I am delighted to be here with you again.\nLet me begin by stating that the views I express today are my own, and not necessarily\nthose of the Federal Reserve.\nAs community bankers, you have worked hard to develop a deep understanding of\nyour local economies, while also keeping perspective on the broader economic picture.\nThere is little I could tell you about your local communities that you do not already\nknow, but I thought I might say a few words on the national economic outlook before\nturning to my main topic for today.\nMy colleagues and I on the Federal Open Market Committee had our most recent\nmeeting about two weeks ago, when we decided to keep our target range for the federal\nfunds rate unchanged at 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent. This policy setting should help support\nthe economic expansion, which is now in its 11th year. My outlook for the U.S. economy\nis for continued growth at a moderate pace, with the unemployment rate—which is the\nlowest it has been in 50 years—remaining low. I also see inflation gradually rising to the\nCommittee’s 2 percent objective. So on the whole, the national economic backdrop looks\nvery favorable, which should be broadly supportive of your local economies. And of\ncourse, by ensuring that consumers and businesses in your communities have access to\nfinancial services, you are key contributors to the health of our national economy.\nLet me now turn to my main topic for today, the interaction between innovation\nand regulation for community banks. As the Federal Reserve Board’s first designated\ngovernor with experience in community banking, I am committed to maintaining a strong\nand thriving community bank sector. Small banks are the lifeblood of their\n\n- 2 -\ncommunities—and they ensure that consumers and businesses have access to financial\nservices. This capacity to address local needs is fundamental to a strong and stable\nfinancial system. To community bankers, customers are much more than their credit\nscore or their annual income, and small businesses are far more than their most recent\nrevenues. By extending credit and offering specialized products and services that meet\nthe needs of their borrowers, these banks empower communities to thrive.\nWe live in an exciting time, when the face of banking is changing faster and\nperhaps more fundamentally than it ever has. The first digital banks appeared on the\nscene about 25 years ago. Since then, financial technology has evolved rapidly.\nTechnology puts more information in the hands of both the customer and the bank. As\nfinancial institutions succeed in digitizing more of their offerings, customers are able to\nmonitor cash flows, make direct payments, understand changes in their credit scores,\ntrack spending, and budget more easily. Technologies like predictive analytics, when\nsupported with appropriate consumer protections, can improve bank services and\nperformance by enabling continuous tailoring of the customer experience. It also helps\nbanks identify products that are best suited for their customers and their business model\nand strategy. For those account holders who are willing, an analysis of spending habits\nmay indicate that they could benefit from services they hadn’t yet considered.\nBut successful innovation is not just about adopting the latest technologies.\nSuccessful innovation has always required strategic vision and creativity. Community\nbanks thrive when they find creative ways to serve their communities, using everything\nthey know to build relationships, offer solutions, and make lending decisions. We need\n\n- 3 -\nonly look to the performance of community banks during the financial crisis to see how\nwell they leverage this local knowledge and their relationships to make lending decisions.\nAfter the onset of the crisis, community banks’ superior loan quality resulted in\nlower aggregate delinquency and charge-off rates compared to the largest banks. This\nsuperior performance was widespread—community banks in the vast majority of states\noutperformed the largest banks in this way.1\nEven today, community banks continue to perform with distinction. In the third\nquarter of 2019, community banks’ pre-tax return on average assets was 1.5 percent,\nmarking the highest pre-tax return on assets ratio reported by community banks since\n2006. Asset quality also remains strong for community banks and is better than for larger\nbanks. The community bank net charge-off rate for total loans and leases was less than\n0.2 percent at the end of the third quarter 2019. Let me state that again—the net charge-\noff rate was less than 0.2 percent, less than half of the industry average. Community\nbank capital levels remain at continued high and increasing levels. Community banks\nreported a total risk-based capital ratio of nearly 16 percent, as compared to the industry\naverage of less than 15 percent. This type of performance positions the community\nbanking sector for continued success this year and well into the future, helping ensure the\npreservation of the community bank model for future generations of Americans.\nCommunity banks understand their borrowers and their specific needs. While\ntechnology continues to evolve and change the way we live and bank for the better, it still\ncannot by itself fulfill that unique and vital role.\n1 See Jeffrey W. Gunther and Kelly Klemme, Financial Stability: Traditional Banks Pave the Way (Dallas:\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas, 2012),\nhttps://www.dallasfed.org/fed/~/media/documents/fed/annual/2012/1201e.pdf.\n\n- 4 -\nToday, there are more than 4,800 community banks in the United States.2 Nearly\n80 percent of these have assets totaling less than $500 million, with roughly 40 full- and\npart-time employees, on average. The vast majority of these community banks are\nfinancially strong, and are the backbone of the towns and cities they serve, providing\nloans to individuals and businesses in the local area. But as customers’ needs and goals\nevolve, community banks will need to evolve to meet them.\nThe successful integration of financial technology into the community bank\nbusiness model is proving to be enormously valuable to enable community banks to\nenhance the services they’ve already proven they can deliver effectively. Access to\ntechnology and services to meet customer needs is critical to ensuring community banks\nremain vibrant.\nFor the remainder of my remarks, I will focus on my vision for creating pathways\nto responsible community bank innovation. In particular, I will discuss the promise and\nthe challenges that smaller banks face in identifying, integrating, and deploying\ntransformative new technologies, and I will offer some ideas for how the Federal Reserve\ncan help community banks find and manage their relationships with service providers.\nClearing a Path for Innovation\nCommunity banks have always been innovators, but rapid technology adoption is\nchallenging for banks of all sizes. In most cases, realizing the potential that technology\noffers requires community banks to obtain services from other companies or products\nfrom core service providers, which I will refer to collectively as third-party providers. As\nI noted earlier, banks with less than $500 million in assets employ roughly 40 people on\n2 See Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, FDIC Quarterly Banking Profile 13, no. 4 (Third Quarter\n2019), https://www.fdic.gov/bank/analytical/qbp/2019sep/qbp.pdf#page=1.\n\n- 5 -\naverage—nowhere near the number required to exhaustively develop, test, and manage\nevery element of novel technologies. In my discussions with bankers, they note that the\nprocess of selecting, initially vetting, and continuing to evaluate third-party service\nproviders is onerous and presents obstacles to successful innovation.\nI agree that the cost of complying with some of our regulations and expectations\nfor third-party relationships can pose an outsized and undue burden on smaller banks.\nThese compliance costs are in some instances disproportionate to bank size, complexity,\nrisk, and capacity and can be the same for a bank with $10 million in assets and a bank\nwith $10 billion in assets. Further, expectations of due diligence when applied to a\npotential fintech partner may require more financial history or information than that\npartner can provide.\nDue diligence for new third-party relationships, even those that are not start-ups,\ncan require a community bank to collect and analyze a significant amount of complex\ninformation. Also, the annual monitoring that is required adds an additional significant\nand ongoing burden. The process for managing the annual collection and review of the\nfinancials, audit results, and other operational compliance materials for multiple vendors\ncan take weeks of time for several employees. Bank employees must review thousands\nof pages of documentation, and the workload per vendor can be the same for all banks,\nregardless of their asset size and number of employees. And as someone who has been\ninvolved in this compliance work, I know that it’s not as if other responsibilities can\nwait—community bank employees often wear several hats. Community banks must\nweigh the benefit of any third-party relationship against the additional work required to\nevaluate the third party. And even when new product offerings emerge from service\n\n- 6 -\nproviders that already serve the bank, contract terms can be complicated to adjust, adding\nto the costs of obtaining technologies, which may ultimately be prohibitive. Flexible core\nsystems are important for this reason. Collaboration between a bank and its core system\nprovider is critical to ensure that technology solutions can be integrated quickly and cost\neffectively within the core system.\nCreating the Right Regulatory Environment\nResponsible innovation, especially for smaller institutions, requires two key\naspects: a clear idea of how the technology serves a bank’s strategic objectives and a\nregulatory environment that supports innovation. I will touch today on the important\ninterplay between these factors, and in particular, the role that regulators can play in\ncreating a regulatory environment that is conducive to innovation, preserves the safety\nand soundness of the financial system, and protects consumers. As regulators, we need to\nensure that banks uphold sound risk-management practices. Yet we also have\ninformation that can help community banks meet those standards. We should closely\nexamine opportunities to share that knowledge, subject to appropriate safeguards, in\norder to support innovation.\nResponsible innovation begins with a bank’s strategy. Banks need to identify\ntheir goals and then look to identify the kinds of products and services that can help them\nmove forward to implement that strategy. In the past, I have spoken about the\nimportance of considering the impact of new technologies and finding ways to leverage\nthem, if a bank feels that it fits into its business model and strategy. For community\nbanks, a decision to embrace a new technology or innovation is almost always\nsynonymous with third-party engagement.\n\n- 7 -\nRegulators and supervisors can contribute to an environment where banks are\nempowered to achieve these strategic objectives, simplifying and clarifying the process of\nthird-party selection, due diligence, and monitoring.\nA bank may decide that its business model should evolve, and that offering a new\nproduct or partnering with a fintech company will help it position itself for future growth.\nThis decision is an essential one, but what comes next? This is a new world for most\ncommunity banks, and supervisors and regulators can lend their expertise to those banks\nseeking to navigate the unfamiliar landscape.\nTo that end, the Federal Reserve recently launched a web page on innovation and\nannounced several upcoming Reserve Bank events. The innovation page on our website\n(www.federalreserve.gov/innovate) is intended to be a one-stop shop for supervisory\ninformation, publications, research, and international work that is related to technology\ninnovation. Most importantly, the web page also facilitates interaction with Federal\nReserve System specialists, to enable bankers and tech industry participants to submit\nquestions about all aspects of technology in the financial services industry, or to request\nan in-person meeting. Essentially, to open a dialogue.\nWe have also launched a series of Innovation Office Hours events hosted by\nReserve Banks. These events incorporate panel discussions and face-to-face meetings for\nbankers with regulators and supervisors, which are intended to be a resource for both\nstate member banks and fintech companies seeking partnerships with or offering services\nto banks. During these meetings, banks that attend the office hours will have an\nopportunity to share specific projects or proposed partnerships and learn about how\nregulators approach and consider risk management in those contexts. Regulators can also\n\n- 8 -\nshare their observations about effective implementation and risk-management practices\nacross the sector. Equally important, the events provide regulators an opportunity to hear\ndirectly from banks and fintech companies about challenges to innovation. The office\nhours events will also include a panel discussion on innovation topics that will help to\nprovide additional insights into new financial technologies. Our first office hours event\nwill be held at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta later this month. Additional events\nare planned later in the spring and throughout the rest of the year. These are an important\nopportunity for us to learn, and I look forward to hearing your feedback on these events.\nI’d like to turn next to another step in this process—the selection of a third-party\nprovider. This step can be challenging given a lack of information about potential\npartners when many firms, and their product offerings, are new. Notably, in the 2019\nNational Survey of Community Banks, community bankers voiced a desire for more\ntransparency into third-party service providers, to inform decisions about whether to enter\ninto contracts with these providers and the type of contract that may be appropriate.3\nIn this regard, I believe the Federal Reserve should consider several possible\nsteps. First, we should explore the possibility of publishing the list of service providers\nsubject to supervision by the agencies. This could provide a starting point for community\nbanks by sharing information about the types of companies providing services to a large\nnumber of financial institutions.\nSecond, I believe we should increase transparency around our own practices.\nThrough the banking agencies’ service provider program, we regularly conduct\nexaminations for and produce independent evaluations of certain providers of critical\n3See https://www.communitybanking.org/~/media/files/publication/cb21publication_2019.pdf.\n\n- 9 -\nservices. These exams are focused on risk management, audit, and internal controls. The\nFed and other agencies have the statutory authority to oversee third-party providers that\nserve the banks they supervise. Providers that represent a significant level of risk to their\nclients are part of an interagency supervisory program. The agencies make the outcomes\nof those exams available to banks that are clients of a supervised service provider.\nI believe we can take a step further with increasing transparency on our\nsupervisory program by making information that may be useful about our supervision of\nkey service providers available to banks. This could take a number of forms, such as\nbeing more transparent about who and what we evaluate. Of course, moving forward in\nthese areas requires careful consideration and interagency collaboration, and I have asked\nour staff to work with other agencies to develop and propose workable options for giving\nbanks the benefit of the knowledge that supervisors have about their potential providers\nin an appropriate manner.\nOnce banks seeking to innovate have navigated the selection process and\nidentified a partner, they now face a complicated due-diligence process. I believe that\nregulators and supervisors have a role in easing the burden of that process for community\nbanks in several respects.\nFirst, we could help by implementing clear third-party guidance that is consistent\nacross all regulatory agencies. The Federal Reserve is in the process of working with the\nother banking agencies to update our third-party guidance. I believe that the banking\nagencies should all have consistent expectations for third-party relationships, and that the\nFederal Reserve should, as a starting point, move toward adopting the Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency’s (OCC) guidance. It is incredibly inefficient to have banks\n\n- 10 -\nand their potential fintech partners and other vendors try to navigate unnecessary\ndifferences and inconsistencies in guidance across agencies.\nSecond, this guidance should allow banks to conduct shared due diligence on\npotential partners. If several banks use the same third-party service provider and are\nopen to collaborating, they should be allowed to pool resources instead of duplicating one\nanother’s work.\nThird, the guidance should explain what due diligence looks like for a potential\nfintech partner, because the standards applied to other third parties may not be universally\napplicable. For example, many fintech companies lack the kind of long financial history\nassociated with more traditional bank vendors. Perhaps a fintech company has been\naround for only a few years. On its own, the fact that a bank cannot evaluate more than\nfive years of the company’s financials should not necessarily stop this company from\nbeing considered as a partner. Every bank has different objectives, and potential\npartnerships are not one-size-fits-all. Regulators should especially support partnerships\nthat combine the strengths of community banks and fintech companies, which have a\ntrack record of success. The guidance should reflect some supervisory flexibility, and not\nimpede prudent, strategic partnerships between community banks and potential partners.\nFourth, in order to give community banks a better picture of what success in due\ndiligence looks like, and where it begins and ends, I also believe that we should release\nmore information on its necessary elements. This change would provide clarity and assist\ncommunity banks in completing their work. In particular, I believe that regulators can\nprovide more clarity on the types of questions that should be asked of a prospective third-\nparty provider and our view of a satisfactory answer. Such a handbook would not only\n\n- 11 -\nhave the benefit of increasing transparency for community banks but could also be\nbeneficial for fintech companies that hope to become third-party providers.\nFinally, I know from experience that once due diligence has concluded, the\nevaluation of third-party relationships is not over. As I noted earlier, monitoring can take\nweeks of work every year for community bank employees. To be sure, this work is an\nimportant part of risk management. But I believe regulators and supervisors have a role\nto play in ensuring that the burden is tailored to bank size, risk, complexity, and capacity.\nKnowing the burden that third-party monitoring can present to employees of the smallest\nbanks, I have encouraged Federal Reserve staff to consider options for further tailoring\nour expectations for community banks with assets under $1 billion in this area. We\nshould be mindful that when we apply the same expectations to banks with starkly\ndifferent asset sizes, we are creating the same workload for a bank with about 30\nemployees as for a bank with roughly 180 employees, even though their resources and\nrisk profiles are quite different.\nClosing Remarks\nTo conclude, I believe that we can create a regulatory environment in which\ncommunity banks are empowered to innovate, in which supervisors leverage their own\nknowledge to help banks understand what to look for in a service provider. It’s a\nregulatory environment in which guidance is clear and supervisors are appropriately\nflexible, and due diligence and third-party evaluations are appropriately scaled.\nEvery bank must decide for itself whether and how to adapt their business models\nto new technologies, but supervisors and regulators can facilitate innovation at a few key\nmilestones on that path forward. First, supervisors and regulators can serve as a resource\n\n- 12 -\nfor banks navigating the financial technology landscape for the first time, and make\nsubject-matter experts accessible. Second, we can make the process of selecting a partner\nappropriate for a bank’s business strategy a more informed one, by being more\ntransparent about our own supervisory program for certain service providers. Third, we\ncan facilitate vetting of potential partners by allowing shared due diligence, providing in\nour guidance specific expectations for partnerships with fintech companies, and\npublishing a handbook of sound practices in due diligence. Finally, we can reduce\nburden on banks as they continue to evaluate risk at third-party providers, by rightsizing\nour expectations and sharing more information about our supervisory program. Capacity,\nin addition to complexity and size, should be considered as we continue to tailor\nsupervisory expectations.\nAs we work toward the environment I described, communication between\nregulators, supervisors, banks, and fintech partners must be frequent, and confusion about\ncompliance requirements must not be an impediment to banks who wish to partner with\nthird parties. I believe the steps I have laid out today are a promising beginning to\nmaking this regulatory environment a reality.",

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nTexas Bankers Association\nAnnual Convention\nSan Antonio, Texas\nMay 19, 2023\n\nIt is a pleasure to be here with you today.1 I am especially pleased to participate in this\nevent focused on “Building Stronger Communities.” As a former banker, former state bank\ncommissioner, and a member of the Federal Reserve Board that theme really resonates with me.\nWe all know that a safe, sound, and fair financial industry built upon the dual banking system is\nthe foundation of strong and stable communities. All throughout this great nation, and the state\nof Texas, community and regional banks provide financial services and essential credit to assist\nfamilies and businesses achieve their dreams.\nFederal regulators, including the Federal Reserve, in partnership with state banking\ndepartments—like Commissioner Cooper and his team here in Texas—are responsible for\nensuring that banks provide these services in accordance with consumer and safety and\nsoundness laws. State bank regulators help to provide context and an understanding of the\nunique economic conditions that exist within Texas and within the different regions of the state.\nThis context helps our supervisory teams at the Fed better understand the decisions that a bank’s\nmanagement might make in light of particular circumstances and market dynamics.\nToday, I thought I would spend some time following up on a few topics that I have been\nspeaking about recently that provide some insight into the roles of policymakers and regulators,\nbut most importantly highlighting the critical role of bankers in facilitating a strong economy. I\nwill begin with bank supervision and risk-tailored bank regulation, and how I think about\ntailoring in the context of the recent bank failures and ongoing discussions about regulatory\nreform. I will then talk about the benefits of nimble supervision and how that approach supports\n1 The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee or the Board of Governors.\n\n- 2 -\na U.S. financial system with banks of all sizes in every community in every diverse region of this\ncountry.\nAnd finally, I will address the importance of ensuring that both banks and examiners are\nwell prepared and positioned for potential stress in the banking market. Most importantly,\nthough, I want to emphasize the role of due process in the Federal Reserve’s bank supervision.\nWe should not be remotely analyzing your bank and downgrading your rating without\ncommunication and justification. Due process requires formal engagement between examiners\nand the bank. If our examiners believe there is a reason to be concerned with the condition of\nyour institution, the examiners should notify you and engage directly with you to make sure that\nthey have a clear understanding of all of the facts, and that any supervisory actions—including\nany discussion of ratings downgrades—are appropriate based on the unique facts and\ncircumstances of the institution.\nIt's been a while since I’ve felt the need to say this to our state-chartered banks, but the\ntime has come to renew this message today and to emphasize it going forward. I’m sure you are\nnot surprised that our largest bank CEOs do not hesitate to engage directly with the Board and\nReserve Bank presidents. I see one of my many functions and roles as a Member of the Board of\nGovernors as providing that open door and opportunity for direct engagement with a\npolicymaker for our regional and smaller banks, as well. Your Texas ABA executive, Chris\nFurlow, who is a long time friend and colleague, can put you directly in touch with me should\nyou desire to do so. As a former banker, and bank commissioner, I know from experience that\nbuilding a relationship is key to effective communication. And it’s always better to have made\nthat connection before you need it. I look forward to that opportunity to get to know each of\nyou.\n\n- 3 -\nTailored Supervision and Regulation, and the Path Forward for Reform\nAs every banker in this room knows, tailoring is a critical aspect of the federal regulatory\nand supervisory framework. It has continued to be a core principle in strengthening bank\noversight since the 2008 financial crisis. Over the years, as regulators refined and improved the\nregulatory and supervisory framework, the concept of tailoring has evolved. Overseeing banks\nbased on their size, risk, business model, and complexity provides appropriate proportionality to\nour work.\nI’ve often said that risk-based supervision is itself a form of tailoring.2 This approach to\nsupervision and regulation, when it works effectively, allows us to focus supervisory attention on\nareas that pose the greatest risk. It also recommends differences in regulatory requirements and\nsupervisory expectations, based on the size and complexity of the bank. It is simply common\nsense that what works well for the largest global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) is not\nappropriate for regional and community banks. Our tailored approach applies across many areas,\nincluding in the stringency and complexity of capital requirements and for regulatory reporting\nobligations.\nAs regulators consider the appropriate response to the recent bank failures, a renewed\nfocus on the role of tailoring has emerged. From my perspective, there are several important\nsteps we must take. First, we must seriously consider the feedback from a variety of internal and\nexternal viewpoints to identify what went wrong. In my view, one of the most effective steps the\n2 Michelle W. Bowman, “Independence, Predictability, and Tailoring in Banking Regulation and Supervision”\n(speech at the American Bankers Association Community Banking Conference, February 13, 2023),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20230213a.pdf.\n\n- 4 -\nFederal Reserve could take would be to engage an independent third party to analyze the events\nsurrounding the failure of these banks, so that we can fully understand what led to the failures.\nBefore making conclusions about appropriate responses going forward to address causal issues,\nwe need accurate, impartial, and thorough information to inform the debate about what\nspecifically may be needed to fix any problems in our supervision and regulatory framework.\nSecond, supervisors must do a better job of focusing on and identifying key issues and\nrisks to ensure they can be promptly remediated. It is imperative that bank management, the\nboard of directors, and supervisors understand bank business models, and risks that may emerge\nto threaten that model. Where issues are identified, supervisors need to clearly explain the\nconcerns, so that bank management can create a plan to address them. Regulators already have a\ncomprehensive toolkit at their disposal to encourage issue resolution, and frankly, we need to use\nthose tools appropriately, not create more tools because we failed to use the tools at our disposal.\nTo be sure, we do need to consider whether there are necessary, appropriate adjustments\nto improve the bank regulatory and supervisory framework. But our focus in doing so must be\nconcentrated on identified problems and risks with clearly defined goals and outcomes. We\nshould avoid using these bank failures as a pretext to push for other, unrelated changes to bank\nregulation. But, as we engage in this exercise, I think we need to carefully consider both the\nstrength of the current regulatory framework and the effective implementation of tailored\nsupervision.\nOn this last issue—as we consider making changes—we need to carefully consider how\nthese proposals will incorporate tailoring of regulation and supervision—specifically when\nconsidering reforms.\n\n- 5 -\nAre we in the same place today as we were at the onset of the 2008 financial crisis? Of\ncourse not. While we have seen stress in some parts of the banking system, overall the system is\nstrong and resilient. U.S. banks have high levels of capital and liquidity, and banks of all sizes\ncontinue to support the economy. To a large degree, this strength comes from the work done at\nthe direction of Congress, most recently pursuant to the bipartisan Economic Growth, Regulatory\nRelief, and Consumer Protection Act, which better aligned regulation with risk.3 The strong set\nof laws and regulations we have today suggests that the problems in the banking system require a\ntargeted solution, one focused on actual risks, on improvement of supervision and risk\nmanagement, and on prompt remediation of supervisory issues.\nNot only is the current tailoring approach robust, it also results in efficiency. Tailoring\ndistinguishes firms by size, risk, and complexity, and imposes appropriate regulatory\nrequirements in light of these differences. The Board considers a number of factors when\nevaluating the largest firms, including size, cross-jurisdictional activity, reliance on short-term\nwholesale funding, off-balance sheet exposures, and nonbank assets. These characteristics, and\nthe G-SIB scoring methodology more broadly, help distinguish the largest firms that pose the\ngreatest risks from smaller and less systemic firms. Even for smaller firms, we have clear\nregulatory standards and thresholds to ensure that supervision is appropriately tailored for each\ninstitution. This framework provides appropriate scale for both regulators and for banks. It\nstrikes the crucial balance between safety and soundness and ensuring that well-supervised and\nregulated banks are able to continue providing credit to their local and regional businesses and\ncommunities.\n3 Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, Pub. L. No. 115-174, 132 Stat. 1296 (2018).\n\n- 6 -\nFundamentally, we should be careful not to undermine tailoring and risk-based\nsupervision. While there were some clear lapses in the supervision of Silicon Valley Bank, our\nFed supervisors and those with the other banking agencies are dedicated public servants who I\nam confident will embrace the lessons learned from the recent bank failures. We need to provide\nexaminers with direction and support to promote safety and soundness in the banking system.\nThe banks that recently failed were unique in their operations and business models. These\nfailures alone do not justify layering on inefficient and overly complex supervision on a broad\nrange of other banks.\nNimble Supervision\nOne reasonable expectation from the many reviews of the recent bank failures will likely\nbe an analysis of and recommendation for changes in supervision. How do we prioritize these\nissues for improving risk-based supervision? How do we revise those priorities when underlying\neconomic conditions evolve or banks begin to engage in new activities that present new risks?\nWe will need to be sure that whatever approach we adopt, we devote sufficient supervisory\nattention to the areas of highest risk, while not hindering innovation.\nAs I’ve briefly discussed today, we need to have a supervisory system that focuses\nappropriate attention on the traditional risks that are inherent to the business of banking: credit,\nliquidity, concentration, and interest rate risk. Historically, supervision has been an effective\ntool to address these traditional risks. Supervisors can make sure that banks are working to\nmitigate such risks with effective risk management and liquidity planning.\nAs we consider changes to our framework, we need to understand potential unintended\nconsequences and be mindful that we do not inhibit innovation so that banks remain competitive\nand well positioned to effectively serve the needs of their customers.\n\n- 7 -\nIt will continue to be a challenge to ensure the appropriate focus on traditional banking\nrisks while encouraging innovation. But it can be accomplished if we approach it from the need\nfor transparency, transparency by banks about their innovation activities and agenda, and\ntransparency by regulators regarding supervisory expectations and emerging risks. Transparency\ncan help us promote these dual objectives, maintaining a focus on traditional risks, while\nenabling banks to innovate in a safe and sound manner, with a clear understanding of our\nexpectations. At the same time, failure to adopt a transparent approach can lead to adverse\nconsequences for consumers, businesses, and communities by limiting banking products and\nservices and pushing activities outside of the regulated banking system. We need to preserve\nregulatory support for innovation conducted safely and soundly consistent with applicable laws,\nincluding consumer protection.\nPromoting Bank Readiness\nVoices calling for broad, fundamental reforms of the U.S. banking system appear to\nadvocate a shift away from tailoring and risk-based supervision. The view that we extend the\nreach of overly complex and outsized regulatory requirements to banks that are smaller and less\ncomplex ignores some likely results—doing so will lead to bank consolidation, and will\npotentially push banking activities outside of the regulated banking system. This could also lead\nto the elimination of all but the largest too-big-to-fail banks who would then be insulated from\nother competition. This is surely not the outcome that supporters of the 2008 financials crisis\nreforms were seeking.\nIt is also, in my mind, not the right approach. In a time of potential stress, we need to be\nforward focused on bank preparedness so that banks are positioned to address issues of concern.\nThese include being prepared to address contingency funding needs, with a plan in place that has\n\n- 8 -\nbeen tested and is ready to be executed. Regulators need to be supportive of this kind of\nplanning. One of the preliminary lessons learned from the recent bank failures is that bank\nmanagement, and their boards of directors, should be prepared to test the banks’ ability to\nmanage liquidity needs during times of stress.\nThis is one area where I think bankers can make an important, immediate contribution. I\nstrongly encourage bankers to consider creating a plan to handle liquidity needs during times of\nunexpected stress—and then test the ability to execute the plans. Adverse conditions can\nescalate quickly, and influences beyond a bank management’s control, including irrational\nactors, can impact your business in very short order. For example, we know that a number of\nbanks have not registered for or accessed the Federal Reserve’s discount window.\nBut if the bank plans include accessing discount window lending—even if the likelihood\nof that stress is extremely remote—it is critical to understand in advance the steps needed to be\ntaken during the emergency. This could include testing the capacity to pledge collateral or even\njust contacting your local Reserve Bank to learn about or complete the necessary onboarding\nprocedures.\nThe Path Forward\nMy views on the path forward are informed by serving as the bank commissioner for the\nstate of Kansas as its lead regulator and supervisor, my experience as a banker, and especially by\nmy service on the Board of Governors since 2018, during a time when the banking system has\nexperienced many unique stresses including those associated with the COVID pandemic. There\nhave already been some preliminary and expedited internal reports published on the failures of\nSVB and Signature Bank, and I fully expect to see additional reports and analysis of these\n\n- 9 -\nfailures, and the failure of First Republic, in the coming months.4 These preliminary reviews are\nan important first step for the U.S. bank regulators working to identify root causes of these bank\nfailures and holding themselves accountable for supervisory mistakes. There are additional steps\nthat we can take.\nFirst, I believe that the Federal Reserve should engage an independent third party to\nprepare a report to supplement the limited internal review to fully understand the failure of SVB.\nThis would be a logical next step in holding ourselves accountable and would help to eliminate\nthe doubts that may naturally accompany any self-assessment prepared and reviewed by a single\nmember of the Board of Governors.5 This external independent report should also cover a\nbroader time period, including the events of the weekend following the failure of SVB, and a\nbroader range of topics beyond just the regulatory and supervisory framework that applied to\nSVB, including operational issues, if any, with discount window lending, Fedwire services, and\nwith the transfer of collateral from the Federal Home Loan Banks.\nSecond, I believe we need to do a better job identifying the most critical issues and\nmoving quickly to remediate them. It is evident that both supervisors and bank management\nneglected key, long-standing risk factors that should be an area of focus in any examination.\nThese include concentration risk, liquidity risk, and interest rate risk.

The report was prepared in a compressed time frame from March 13, 2023,\nthrough April 28, 2023, and further work over a longer period could draw additional or different conclusions.” Barr,\nReview of the Federal Reserve’s Supervision and Regulation of Silicon Valley Bank.\n\n- 10 -\naddress these issues, but we need to ensure that examiners focus on these core risks and are not\ndistracted by novel activity or concepts.\nFinally, we should consider whether there are necessary—and targeted—adjustments we\nshould make to banking regulation. This will likely include a broad range of topics, including\ntaking a close look at deposit insurance reform, the treatment of uninsured deposits, and a\nreconsideration of current deposit insurance limits.6 We should avoid using these bank failures\nas a pretext to push for other, unrelated changes to banking regulation. Our focus should be on\nremediating known, identified issues with bank supervision and issues that emerge from the\npublic autopsy of these events.\nA debate about regulatory changes must also consider where we are today as compared to\nprior to the 2008 financial crisis. The banking system is strong and resilient despite recent\nbanking stress. The Fed has refined regulatory standards over time at the direction of Congress,\nand through the “tailoring” regulations I discussed earlier that are designed to better align\nregulation with risk. 7 Even with the implementation of these changes, banks today are better\ncapitalized, with more liquidity, and are subject to a new range of supervisory tools that did not\nexist prior to 2008. This banking system is not only strong today but is well prepared to continue\nsupporting the provision of credit and the broader economy.\nRadical reform of the bank regulatory framework—as opposed to targeted changes to\naddress identified root causes of banking system stress—is incompatible with the fundamental\nstrength of the banking system. I am extremely concerned about calls for casting aside tiering\n6 See Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, “Options for Deposit Insurance Reform” (Washington: Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation, May 1, 2023), https://www.fdic.gov/analysis/options-deposit-insurance-\nreforms/report/options-deposit-insurance-reform-full.pdf.\n7 Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, Public Law No. 115-174, 132 Stat. 1296\n(2018).\n\n- 11 -\nexpectations for less complex institutions, given the clear statutory direction to provide for\nappropriately calibrated requirements for these banks.\nI have also heard calls for broad, fundamental reforms for the past several years, shifting\naway from tailoring and risk-based supervision. I believe this is the wrong direction for any\nconversation about banking reform. The unique nature and business models of the banks that\nrecently failed, in my view, do not justify imposing new, overly complex regulatory and\nsupervisory expectations on a broad range of banks. If we allow this to occur, we will end up\nwith a system of significantly fewer banks serving significantly fewer customers. Those who\nwill likely bear the burden of this new banking system are those at the lower end of the economic\nspectrum, both individuals and businesses.\nThe American economy relies on a broad and diverse range of businesses supported by a\nbroad and diverse range of banks. Eliminating regional banks from the U.S. banking system\nwould be devastating to businesses and communities across America. Especially in those\nregions whose communities are not sufficiently served by larger institutions.\nAs I conclude, I want to reiterate that the banking system remains strong and resilient,\nand that bankers across Texas, and the United States, are deeply engaged in their work to support\nand build their local businesses and communities. It is imperative that going forward\npolicymakers preserve a framework that supports a diverse and dynamic banking sector, with\nbanks of all sizes that serve the needs of their unique customers wherever they are located.\nThank you for the opportunity to speak with you today.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n12:15 p.m. EDT (10:15 a.m. local time)\nAugust 9, 2025\nThoughts on the Economy and Community Bank Capital\nRemarks by\nMichelle W. Bowman\nVice Chair for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nKansas Bankers Association\n2025 CEO & Senior Management Summit\nColorado Springs, Colorado\nAugust 9, 2025\n\nThank you for inviting me to speak to you today.1 It is wonderful to join you again this\nyear, now as the Fed’s Vice Chair for Supervision. Since assuming this important financial\nregulatory role, we have hit the ground running—addressing some of the most critical matters in\nthe bank regulatory space, all of which fall under the broad categories of improving efficiency,\ntransparency, and fairness. Often, the “headline” issues coming out of the Federal Reserve and\nthe other banking regulators are ones that affect the largest firms. And many are critical for both\neconomic growth and financial stability.\nBut banks of all sizes, especially community banks, play a vital role in our economy and\nfinancial system, and we are continuing to directly engage as we draft regulatory and supervisory\nreforms. Community banks drive local economic growth, and they play a central role in the\nfinancial health of the customers and communities they serve, but these banks also face unique\nchallenges.\nI will begin today by sharing my outlook on the economy and an update on the recent\nmeeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) before I dig a bit deeper into\ncommunity banking issues.\nUpdate on the Most Recent FOMC Meeting\nAt last week’s FOMC meeting, I dissented from the Committee’s decision to hold the\npolicy rate at its current level. Today I’d like to share some additional perspective about my\nviews on the economy. So far this year, the FOMC has held the target range for the federal\nfunds rate steady at 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent. Earlier this year, I believed our policy stance was\n1 The views expressed in these remarks are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of my colleagues on the\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nappropriate, giving time to allow the Committee to monitor the progress of inflation toward our\ngoal and to better understand the impacts of the Administration’s policies on the economy.\nAt the June FOMC meeting and in a speech shortly following that meeting, I began to lay\nout my reasoning to support the process of beginning to gradually lower the federal funds rate in\nJuly based on my assessment of signs of fragility in labor market conditions.2 In my view,\neconomic conditions appeared to be shifting, and as a result, we should reflect this shift in our\npolicy decisions. Inflation has moved considerably closer to our target, after excluding\ntemporary effects of tariffs, and the labor market has remained near full employment. As my\ndissent statement notes, with economic growth slowing this year and signs of a less dynamic\nlabor market becoming clear, I see it as appropriate to begin gradually moving our moderately\nrestrictive policy stance toward a neutral setting. Taking action at last week’s meeting would\nhave proactively hedged against the risk of a further erosion in labor market conditions and a\nfurther weakening in economic activity.\nEconomic Conditions and Outlook\nThe U.S. economy has been resilient so far this year. Underlying economic growth has\nslowed markedly, but despite increasing signs of fragility as the latest employment report more\nclearly shows, the labor market appears to remain near estimates of full employment.\nSo far this year, consumer spending softened while residential investment declined,\ncontributing to a much slower increase in private domestic final purchases compared to strong\ngains in 2024. Consumer spending on both goods and services has risen only modestly,\nreflecting slow gains in disposable personal income, lower levels of liquid savings, and high\n2 See Michelle W. Bowman, “Unintended Policy Shifts and Unexpected Consequences,” speech at Assessing the\nEffectiveness of Monetary Policy during and after the COVID-19 Pandemic, a research conference sponsored by the\nInternational Journal of Central Banking and the Czech National Bank, Prague, Czech Republic, June 23, 2025,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20250623a.pdf.\n\n- 3 -\ncredit card utilization by lower-income households. Housing activity has declined, including in\nsingle-family home construction and sales, as listings of homes for sale are growing and house\nprices are falling, which suggests weakness in housing demand to a level last seen during the\nfinancial crisis.\nAlthough the unemployment rate remained historically low at 4.2 percent in July, the\nlatest employment report confirmed some of the signs of fragility and reduced dynamism in the\nlabor market that I discussed at last week’s FOMC meeting without the benefit of having seen\nthe July report. The unemployment rate moved back up in July and was close to rounding up to\n4.3 percent, largely reflecting reduced hiring as businesses continue to retain existing workers\ninstead of increasing layoffs. The employment-to-population ratio has dropped significantly this\nyear, suggesting more softening in labor market conditions than the unemployment rate implies.\nPayroll employment growth slowed sharply to only 35,000 jobs per month over the three\nmonths ending in July. This is well below the moderate pace seen earlier in the year, likely due\nto a significant softening in labor demand. The sharp slowdown partly reflects the downward\nrevision to payroll employment in both May and June, which, to put it in perspective, is\ncomparable only to a few other two-month revisions over the past 30 years. In addition, job\ngains have been centered in an unusually narrow set of industries that tend to be less affected by\nthe business cycle. For example, healthcare and social services have more than accounted for\ntotal job gains over the past three months, and the share of industries with job gains over the last\nsix months dropped in July to a historically low level.\nTurning to price stability, the 12-month measure of core personal consumption\nexpenditures (PCE) inflation stood at 2.8 percent in June, a bit lower than at the end of last year.\nHowever, after removing estimates of one-off tariff effects on goods prices, core PCE inflation\n\n- 4 -\nwould have been lower than 2.5 percent in June, which is significant progress and much closer to\nour 2 percent target. This progress reflects a considerable slowing in core services inflation,\nwhich is consistent with recent softness in consumer spending and the labor market no longer\nbeing a source of inflation pressures.\nThe underlying trend in core PCE inflation appears to be moving much closer to our\n2 percent target than is currently shown in the data. With housing services inflation on a\nsustained downward trajectory and other core services inflation already consistent with 2 percent\ninflation, only core goods inflation remains elevated—likely reflecting limited passthrough from\ntariffs.\nIn terms of risks to achieving our dual mandate, as I gain even greater confidence that\ntariffs will not present a persistent shock to inflation, I see that upside risks to price stability have\ndiminished. With underlying inflation on a sustained trajectory toward 2 percent, softness in\naggregate demand, and signs of fragility in the labor market, I think that we should focus on risks\nto our employment mandate.\nWith the memories of pandemic worker shortages still fresh, businesses have chosen to\nmaintain, instead of reducing, their work forces in response to the slowing economic conditions.\nAnd they seem to be more willing to reduce profit margins as they are less able to fully pass\nthrough higher costs and raise prices given the weakness in demand. If demand conditions\ncontinue to soften, businesses may need to begin to lay off workers, recognizing that it may not\nbe as difficult to rehire given the shift in labor market conditions.\nOn trade policy, foreign suppliers are absorbing some of the new tariffs, and importers\nare shifting to lower tariffed sources. Slack in the economy should also allow for only limited\none-time price effects this year and very little, if any, “second-round” effects on inflation in the\n\n- 5 -\nmedium term. I also expect that less restrictive regulations, lower business taxes, and a more\nfriendly business environment are likely to boost supply and offset any tariff-related effects on\neconomic activity and prices over the medium term.\nThe Policy Decision and the Path Forward\nWith tariff-related price increases likely representing a one-time effect, my view is that\ninflation will return to 2 percent after these effects dissipate. Because changes in monetary\npolicy take time to work their way through the economy, it is appropriate to look through\ntemporarily elevated inflation readings and therefore remove some policy restraint to avoid\nweakening in the labor market.\nAs I recognize that economic conditions are shifting, I believe that beginning to move our\npolicy rate at a gradual pace toward its neutral level will help maintain the labor market near full\nemployment and ensure smooth progress toward achieving our dual mandate. I see the risk that\na delay in taking action could result in a deterioration in labor market conditions and a further\nslowing in economic growth.\nBefore our next meeting in September, we will receive a range of additional economic\ndata and information, including another employment and two inflation reports. A proactive\napproach in moving policy closer to neutral, from its current moderately restrictive stance, would\nhelp avoid a further unnecessary erosion in labor market conditions and reduce the chance that\nthe Committee will need to implement a larger policy correction should the labor market\ndeteriorate further.\nIn my view, it is also important that the Committee’s approach to monetary policy\ndecision making is consistent over time—especially when we face shifting economic conditions.\nI recognize and appreciate that other FOMC members may see things differently and that they\n\n- 6 -\nwere more comfortable with leaving the target range for the policy rate unchanged. I am\ncommitted to working together with my colleagues to ensure that monetary policy is\nappropriately positioned to achieve our dual goals of maximum employment and price stability.\nIn the meantime, I will continue to carefully monitor the incoming data and information as the\nAdministration’s policies, the economy, and financial markets continue to evolve.\nI have discussed many times in the past that, in recent years, the monthly labor market\ndata have become increasingly difficult to interpret, in part, reflecting declining survey response\nrates and the changing dynamics of immigration and net business creation. It is crucial that\nU.S. official data accurately capture cyclical or structural changes in the labor market in real time\nso that we can more confidently rely on these data for monetary and economic policymaking.\nSo, I remain cautious about taking too much signal from data releases, but I see the latest news\non economic growth, the labor market, and inflation as consistent with greater risks to the\nemployment side of our dual mandate.\nMy Summary of Economic Projections includes three cuts for this year, which has been\nconsistent with my forecast since last December, and the latest labor market data reinforce my\nview. I want to reiterate, though, that monetary policy is not on a preset course. At each FOMC\nmeeting, my colleagues and I will make our decisions based on each of our assessments of the\nincoming data and the implications for and risks to the outlook, guided by the Fed’s dual-\nmandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices. I will also continue to meet with a\nbroad range of contacts to discuss economic conditions as I assess the appropriateness of our\nmonetary policy stance going forward.\n\n- 7 -\nPrioritizing Community Banking Issues\nTurning back to community banking, I’d like to share some thoughts about how we\nidentify the key issues facing community banks and prioritize them in our regulatory and\nsupervisory reform efforts.\nMy approach to prioritizing these issues remains consistent and clear—it starts with\noutreach. Throughout my time as a member of the Board, I have focused on meeting with and\nlistening to community bankers to better understand the unique challenges they face. What are\nthe most significant threats to their business? How have regulations harmed or improved their\nability to operate safely and soundly? How have competitive factors evolved within their\ncommunities? How do they see the business of banking evolving with the introduction of new\ntechnologies? Engaging with you and other community bankers has been a critical input to\ninforming my views on the current state of bank regulation and supervision, which also shapes\nmy priorities for regulatory and supervisory initiatives.\nAs regulators seek to identify problems in the bank regulatory system and craft\napproaches to address them, it is imperative that we focus on issues that impact community\nbanks. And I am very pleased to announce that the Board will host a conference focused on\ncommunity banking in Washington, D.C., on October 9th to ensure that our work is fully\ninformed. We will bring together bankers, industry experts, academics, and other stakeholders to\ndiscuss and identify matters targeted to support our ongoing work.\nWe will continue to fully engage and to understand these banks’ concerns. And, apart\nfrom fraud, which I’ll discuss in more detail in a moment, the Federal Reserve has already\nstarted looking at elements of the bank regulatory framework unique to community banks. This\n\n- 8 -\nincludes the community bank leverage ratio (CBLR), liquidity sources and regulatory\nexpectations, and rethinking capital options and operations for mutual banks.\nThe CBLR is a good example of a well-intentioned measure that underachieved in\nproviding regulatory relief. The CBLR is an optional framework that was designed as an\nalternative to risk-based capital measures for community banks. A community bank that\ncomplies with the CBLR is deemed to comply with risk-based capital requirements.3\nStatutory limitations on the CBLR restricted the framework to between 8 and 10 percent\nfor qualifying community banks.4 The agencies initially established the CBLR at 9 percent just\nas I joined the Board in late 2018.5 In rationalizing this setting, the agencies focused primarily\non how many banks would be eligible to opt into the framework at their current capital levels\nand whether it could essentially retain the same high level of capital in the system.\nImplicit in this approach seems to be a view that Congress intended the agencies to keep\nthe same overall amount of capital supporting community banks. However, by statute, Congress\nprovided a range, and the low end is double the standard leverage ratio capital requirement of 4\npercent. The regulators also retained many of the same restrictive definitions, like the definition\nof qualifying tier 1 capital with associated exclusions and caps, that apply more generally to the\nlargest institutions. While there were 4,022 community banks as of the first quarter of 2025,\nonly 1,662 had opted into the CBLR.6\n3 Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, Pub. L. No. 115-174, 132 Stat. 1296 (2018),\n§ 201, https://www.congress.gov/115/statute/STATUTE-132/STATUTE-132-Pg1296.pdf.\n4 Id. The CBLR framework is available only for more traditional community banks, taking into account off-balance\nsheet exposures, trading assets and liabilities, total notional derivatives exposures, and other factors determined by\nthe banking agencies.\n5 84 Fed. Reg. 61,776 (November 13, 2019), https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2019-11-13/pdf/2019-\n23472.pdf.\n6 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Quarterly Banking Profile, 2025, Volume 19, Number 2, at 20-21,\nhttps://fdic.gov/quarterly-banking-profile/q1-2025-full-qbp-report.pdf.\n\n- 9 -\nNotably, data show that smaller community banks are more likely to have adopted the\nCBLR framework. About 53 percent of eligible community banks with assets less than $1\nbillion have opted in, compared to 26 percent of community banks with assets exceeding $1\nbillion. These smaller community banks play a significant and unique role in the U.S. economy\nthrough their support of local businesses, job creation, and investing in their communities.\nIn my view, it is time to consider modifications to the CBLR framework that make it a\nmore attractive framework and will encourage more banks to adopt it. We should also consider\nwhether it was appropriately designed and calibrated to fulfill the Congressional intent to achieve\nregulatory relief. For example, reducing the CBLR requirement from 9 percent to 8 percent\ncould not only allow more community banks to adopt the framework but also increase balance\nsheet capacity for all CBLR firms, facilitating additional support for local economies through\nlending.\nSince the 2023 failure of Silicon Valley Bank, there has been increased scrutiny on the\nliquidity sources banks use. Some policymakers have expressed skepticism of long-established\nand reliable sources of liquidity, particularly liquidity provided by the Federal Home Loan\nBanks. One proposal, which is perhaps a solution in search of a problem, is to push for an\nexpanded use of the discount window. Under this view, regulators (through requirement or\nsupervisory pressure) would require banks to pledge and maintain assets at the discount window.\nBanks would be expected to use the discount window as a daily liquidity source, even when\nother, lower-cost liquidity sources are available like FHLB. But this solution seems to have\nbypassed the threshold question of whether there is a problem. Effective reform efforts require\nactual identification of a problem and a practical approach relying on an informed view of the\nbusiness of banking.\n\n- 10 -\nOther small bank concerns have persisted for even longer. Mutual banks have existed\nsince the early 1800s but have long faced limited capital options and restrictions on managing\ncapital distributions.7 I have spoken about these issues in detail in the past, so I will not rehash\nthem today. In the past, when regulators prioritized regulatory reform by asset size alone, they\nneglected critical issues that affect smaller institutions. Our responsibilities as prudential\nregulators should be broadly focused on banks of all sizes, ensuring relief across the broad range\nof asset sizes.\nWhat I have discussed so far today is not an exhaustive list of the work underway at the\nBoard and in partnership with the other agencies. On June 23, the Board announced that\nreputational risk would no longer be considered in the examination process.8 To implement this\nlasting change, we are updating guidance, examination manuals, handbooks, and other\nsupervisory materials to ensure the durability of this approach, which is a critical step in\naddressing the problem of de-banking. A few additional initiatives include changes to provide\ntransparency and efficiency in the supervisory process, better defining “safety and soundness,”\nreviewing and updating relevant asset thresholds used in establishing supervisory categories and\nregulatory requirements, and rationalizing and updating Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money-\nlaundering requirements.\nWe have reached a point of opportunity for community banks. It is time to build a\nframework that supports their strength and vitality, recognizing their unique characteristics so\nthey can prosper long into the future.\n7 See Michelle W. Bowman, “Brief Remarks on the Economy, and Perspective on Mutual and Community Banks,”\nremarks at the New England CEO Summit, Portsmouth, New Hampshire, January 31, 2025,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20250131a.pdf.\n8 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Federal Reserve Board Announces That Reputational\nRisk Will No Longer Be a Component of Examination Programs in Its Supervision of Banks,” press release, June\n23, 2025, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20250623a.htm.\n\n- 11 -\nFraud in the Financial System\nWhile the upcoming community bank conference will enable us to explore a number of\nnew and longstanding challenges, we are already aware of many that demand attention. Direct\noutreach with the banking industry has provided insight into economic and financial conditions\nacross a wide range of communities and a close-up perspective of bankers’ concerns. A common\ntheme from these discussions is that fraud continues to pose material challenges and risks to\nbanks and their customers. The sophistication of the techniques fraudsters use has greatly\nexpanded, yet the tools to detect fraud have not kept pace.\nConsider the fraud risks introduced by artificial intelligence (AI). During a recent\nbanking conference at the Fed, Sam Altman, the CEO of Open AI joined me for a fireside chat\non AI in the banking and financial industry.9 The discussion highlighted how AI can be used to\nundermine common multifactor security measures. Banks must be able to identify new types of\nfraud where AI tools mimic customer voices and images, including by video. It is important that\nAI developers, bankers, and regulators focus on developing tools that can detect this type of\nactivity enabling them to confirm a customer’s identity in real time, training their teams to spot\nsigns of AI-driven impersonation.\nWhile banks have important responsibilities to detect and prevent fraud, we should also\nconsider proposals to help mitigate the risks of fraud. For example, liability for fraud may not\nalways rest with those best positioned to prevent or detect it. Limits on information sharing\namong firms may leave them more vulnerable to fraud threats and activities. This vulnerability\ncould be addressed through better socialization of the methods and approaches criminals use to\n9 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Fireside Chat, Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle W.\nBowman and Sam Altman, OpenAI CEO (July 22, 2025), https://www.federalreserve.gov/conferences/integrated-\nreview-of-the-capital-framework-for-large-banks.htm.\n\n- 12 -\nperpetrate fraud, and more effective enforcement and information sharing among law\nenforcement and financial institutions.\nIn addition, in mid-June, the Federal Reserve, FDIC, and OCC published a request for\ninformation (RFI) seeking comment on addressing payments and check fraud.10 Check fraud has\ngrown substantially over the past several years, resulting in financial harm to banks, especially\ncommunity banks, and the consumers and businesses who are the victims of fraud. While this\nhas been a well-known problem for several years, efforts by regulators have been slow to\nadvance and seem to have done little to address this growing threat.\nWhile the RFI is an important first step, addressing fraud will require a coordinated\nstrategy involving banks, federal and state regulators, law enforcement, bank customers, the\npostal service, and others in the payments and tech industry. We must improve communication,\nensure that there’s appropriate accountability and that responsibility for preventing fraud and\nliability are appropriately assigned, and revise outdated regulations like Regulation CC\nimplementing the Expedited Funds Availability Act.\nThe RFI comment period closes on September 18, and I encourage all stakeholders to\nshare their views. We must have a comprehensive strategy to develop and implement an\neffective, coordinated approach, and your input is vital to getting that approach right. I look\nforward to reviewing these comments.\n10 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation, “Federal Bank Regulatory Agencies Seek Comment to Address payments and\nCheck Fraud,” press release, June 16, 2025,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20250616a.htm.\n\n- 13 -\nClosing Thoughts\nCommunity banks are the cornerstone of the banking and financial system, supporting\nlocal communities and their customers. Too often, these banks have been overlooked, with too\nlittle attention paid to longstanding and emerging issues and industry and consumer concerns.\nThe Fed’s upcoming community bank conference will provide a welcome opportunity to\nhear from bankers, industry, and academics about the unique issues and challenges they face.\nLooking ahead, I will continue to include and prioritize a review, refinement, and reform of\nregulations to address these concerns.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n11:00 a.m. EDT\nSeptember 30, 2022\nLarge Bank Supervision and Regulation\nRemarks by\nMichelle W. Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe Institute of International Finance\nWashington, D.C.\nSeptember 30, 2022\n\nToday, I would like to talk about the future of supervision and regulation of the\nlargest banks, which changed significantly after the financial crisis 14 years ago and has\nevolved more gradually over the past 5 years. As the backdrop for this look into the\nfuture, it is important to recognize that this recent past for supervision and regulation has\nbeen a success, resulting in a banking system that is safer, stronger, better capitalized, and\nmore resilient. This is particularly true for oversight of the largest banks, including\nglobal systemically important banks (GSIBs), and their central role in the financial\nsystem. As supervision and regulation have been refined in recent years, the largest\nbanks have maintained high levels of capital, and their resilience has been repeatedly\nconfirmed by both supervisory and real-life stress tests. Most notably, the U.S. financial\nsystem faced the onset of the pandemic in the spring of 2020, which disrupted financial\nmarkets and raised fears of a severe crisis. During this time, banks performed very well,\ncontinuing to keep credit flowing throughout the financial system as governments and\ncentral banks responded to the crisis, setting the stage for a rapid recovery from the\nsharpest economic contraction that the U.S. economy has ever experienced.\nThis outcome is a recognition, in my view, of the gradual and experiential\napproach to changing large bank supervision and regulation over the past several years.\nAfter the rush of regulation and the supervisory overhaul of large banks in the wake of\nthe financial crisis, the Board of Governors took time to observe how the changes were\nworking, and how things might be improved. Input was solicited from the public, and the\nchanges made were incremental and carefully calibrated. I think the evidence is very\nclear that these changes have preserved and, in many cases, strengthened supervision and\nregulation, and that our gradual and evolutionary approach was wise. As I look ahead,\n\n- 2 -\nthat record of success is a testament to the progress we have made to date and argues for\nthe same incremental approach to ongoing refinements in supervision and regulation.\nI am looking forward to working with Michael Barr, the Board’s Vice Chair for\nSupervision, on the dual goals of making the financial system safer and fairer, two\nobjectives that I strongly support. In doing so, I am not opposed to changes that make\nsense, based on the experience we have gained from applying existing rules and\napproaches, or prompted by new and emerging issues. As always, we should ensure that\nany further changes yield significant improvement to safety and soundness at reasonable\ncost and seek to avoid approaches that fail to consider the tradeoffs between cost and\nsafety.\nIn forming my judgments about whether proposed changes in regulation meet the\nstandard I have just laid out, I will be guided by the four principles I described in 2021,\noutlining my perspective on bank regulation and supervision.1 I would like to briefly\ndiscuss these four principles, and then talk about how they have guided and will guide my\nthinking on a number of issues important to large bank supervision and regulation.\nThe first principle is that bank regulation and supervision should be transparent,\nconsistent, and fair. Combined, these three elements, which we can think of collectively\nas due process, build respect for supervisory practices, and in doing so, make supervision\nmore effective and encourage open communication between banks and supervisors. This\nprinciple applies equally to regulation. Supervision cannot replace—and should never\nsupersede—rulemaking. Published regulations that have gone through the rulemaking\n1 See Michelle Bowman, “My Perspective on Bank Regulation and Supervision” (speech at the Conference\nfor Community Bankers sponsored by the American Bankers Association, February 16, 2021),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20210216a.htm.\n\n- 3 -\nprocess, with solicitation of public comment and bona fide engagement with the issues\nraised, are the best and clearest way for banks to understand the rules of the road and for\nthe bank regulatory agencies to ensure banks satisfy safety-and-soundness objectives.\nThis brings me to the second fundamental principle for regulation and\nsupervision: striking the right balance between ensuring safety and soundness, on the one\nhand, and promoting acceptable and manageable risk-taking, including encouraging\nresponsible innovation. To put it simply, this means matching regulatory and supervisory\nrequirements to the risks presented. For the largest banks, this naturally includes an\nincreased focus on financial stability risks.\nThere are obvious risks from under-regulation, and it is those risks that were\naddressed in the wake of the financial crisis 14 years ago. But we sometimes overlook\nthe significant costs to our economy, and risks to safety and soundness, from over-\nregulation, where rules are not designed and calibrated to address the actual risks. In a\ntime of rising interest rates that could constrain credit, it is especially important to ensure\nthat regulation and supervision not add costs and burdens for banks with little or no\nbenefits to safety and soundness.\nMy third principle is that effective regulation and supervision needs to be\nefficient. Efficiency is key to effective regulation. In the design of a regulatory\nframework, there is flexibility in how to achieve a desired outcome, and there are often\nmultiple approaches that would be effective in doing so. Once a decision has been made\nto regulate an activity, the next objective should be to ensure that the regulation achieves\nits intended purpose and that there are not more efficient alternatives that can yield those\nbenefits at a lower cost.\n\n- 4 -\nMy fourth and final principle is that regulation and supervision should serve a\nlegitimate prudential purpose, like promoting safety and soundness, or reducing financial\nstability risk. After the last financial crisis, there was strong public support for enhancing\nregulation and supervision over the banking system, with a particular focus on the largest\nbanks. And many of the steps taken after the last financial crisis have improved the\nresiliency of the U.S. financial system. While the need for robust regulation and\nsupervision remains as true today as it was after the last financial crisis, regulation and\nsupervision must also allow banks to continue providing credit and other financial\nproducts and services.\nCollectively, these principles guide my thinking about the future of supervision\nand regulation. With that framework in mind, I would like to turn to some critical issues\nthat are relevant to large banks.\nStress Testing\nAs I just discussed, a critical element of due process is that rules and supervision\nshould be consistent among firms, and over time. This can be a challenge because of the\nvariability in the business models of banks, especially among the largest banks. Each\nbank is different in terms of its balance sheet, business lines, and risk profile, so\nregulators must be vigilant that both regulations and supervisory practices are being\napplied consistently.\nOne area where this need for consistency is clear is in the Board’s stress testing\nframework. Since 2013, stress testing has been used to assess banks’ capital positions\nand determine whether they have sufficient capital to both absorb losses and continue\nlending during stressed conditions. This process has evolved considerably since its\n\n- 5 -\ninception, and that evolution is important to ensure that stress testing continues to be\nrelevant and effective.\nMuch of the stress testing framework is designed to encourage consistency—we\nhave a common scenario design for firms, and similarly situated firms are subject to\nstress testing on the same frequency. However, the stress tests produce results that vary\nconsiderably from year to year due to how a specific scenario interacts with a specific\nfirm’s business model, and this volatility flows through to the stress capital buffers that\napply to the largest firms. Although the stress scenarios are approved by the Board and\nchange in some ways that are predictable over time or relate to changes in the underlying\neconomy, how a scenario will affect a particular firm is not always predictable. These\nyear-to-year variations are often not based in underlying changes to banks’ business\nmodels and can create short-term challenges for capital management. There are likely\nmany ways to limit this volatility while maintaining the value of the Board’s stress tests,\nincluding by averaging results over multiple years.\nAs the stress testing framework continues to evolve over time, we should take into\naccount what we learn from past tests, feedback from the public and the banks\nthemselves, and ensure that the test evolves in a way that improves consistency and\nfairness over time.\nCapital\nNext, let’s consider capital regulation. This is an area where requirements were\nquickly bolstered without extensive analysis in response to the 2008 financial crisis,\nresulting, in some cases, in redundant methods of calculating capital and demands that\nfirms of all sizes and risk profiles comply with the highest requirements. The goal of\n\n- 6 -\nefficiency dictates that over time this needs to be addressed. This is indeed what has\nhappened over the past five years. In addition, the principle of balancing safety and\nsoundness with the need for appropriate risk-taking is reflected in the extensive tailoring\nframework that the Board adopted over this time period, which carefully and deliberately\nmatched regulation and supervision to the actual risks presented by different institutions.\nOften, the rules adopted immediately after the financial crisis applied a one-size-fits-all\napproach framed around the largest banks whose activities presented the most significant\nrisks. This approach ignores the importance of bank size and business model.\nObviously, expectations for the smallest banks with simple business models should not\nbe equivalent to the expectations for large regional banks, or for large and complex bank\nholding companies engaged in significant securities or cross-border activities beyond\ntaking deposits and retail lending.\nAs we look into the future to potential changes to the capital framework,\nincluding those expected under the Basel III endgame rulemaking, capital is a topic that\nis helpful to approach holistically. From my perspective, capital requirements should\nstrike an appropriate balance for each relevant tier of firm, with requirements that\nappropriately address risks, including financial stability risks, while recognizing the costs\nof over-regulation. Calibrating capital requirements is not a zero-sum game, where more\ncapital is necessarily always better. Regulation is not cost-free. Over-regulation can\nrestrain bank lending, which becomes a burden for individual borrowers and a potential\nthreat to economic growth.\nThinking about capital holistically also provides an opportunity to consider\nadjustments to the components of the capital requirements for the largest institutions,\n\n- 7 -\nincluding the supplementary leverage ratio, the countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB),\nand, as I already discussed, the stress capital buffer, particularly where specific actions\nmay have unintended consequences.\nSince the onset of the pandemic, the banking system has seen a significant inflow\nof reserves due to the Federal Reserve’s asset purchases in support of the economic\nrecovery. For some firms, the influx of reserves resulted in leverage ratios becoming\nbinding capital constraints, rather than serving as backstops to risk-based capital\nrequirements. While these firms’ leverage ratios may become less binding as the Federal\nReserve reduces the size of its balance sheet and reserves are drained from the banking\nsystem, leverage ratios that discourage banks from intermediation in the Treasury market,\nor from holding ultra-safe assets such as Treasuries and reserves, can distort incentives\nand disrupt markets. Addressing these issues could improve market functioning and\nfinancial stability.\nThe CCyB is another component of the capital stack that deserves careful thought.\nIn theory, the CCyB is a tool that could raise capital requirements in boom times to build\nresiliency and reduce capital requirements during times of stress to facilitate lending. In\npractice, the Board has not yet utilized the CCyB. While having releasable capital\nbuffers shouldn’t necessarily be ruled out, in my view, after a decade of stress testing and\nrecent real-life stress experience, we have seen that the existing level of capital\nrequirements has proven to be adequate for banks to deal with significant stress.\nBalancing safety and soundness with the need for appropriate risk-taking means that we\nshould not simply assume that the further layering on of capital requirements, including\nthrough the application of the CCyB, would be beneficial.\n\n- 8 -\nThe key is to strike an appropriate balance over time that addresses risks,\nincluding financial stability risks, without impeding the ability of the banking industry to\nextend credit and provide other financial services that are critical to our economy. The\ncapital structure must also be predictable, to facilitate banks’ longer-term capital\nplanning, while preserving capital to allow firms to respond to unforeseen circumstances.\nBank Mergers and Acquisitions\nI now want to turn to the review of bank mergers and acquisitions, specifically to\ndiscuss how the need for transparency, and to pursue legitimate prudential purposes,\nshould guide our analysis of banking transactions under the established statutory\nframework.\nThe regulatory consideration of mergers is guided by the statutory factors\nprescribed by Congress—all of which are grounded in legitimate prudential purposes.\nThe factors considered generally include the competitive effects of the proposed merger,\nfinancial and managerial resources, future prospects of the merged institutions,\nconvenience and needs of the communities to be served, compliance with money\nlaundering laws, and the effect of the transaction on the stability of the U.S. banking or\nfinancial system.2 This analytical merger framework works best when it is accompanied\nby transparency, both in timelines and expectations, that allows firms to know and\nunderstand what is expected of them, and what they can fairly expect during the merger\napplication process. The rules of the road should not change during the application\nprocess.\n2 See 12 U.S.C. §§ 1828(c)(5), (11); 1842(c).\n\n- 9 -\nWe should be vigilant to be sure that other factors, like the idea that mergers are\nharmful or that increased bank size is inherently problematic, do not infiltrate that\nstatutory analytical framework. The analysis and approval of mergers and acquisitions\nshould be based on the reality of how customers and the financial system would be\naffected. For larger banks in particular, the evolution of the merger review framework\nshould also factor in the evolution of markets, industry, and customer preferences.\nA merger can have a significant impact on local communities, in terms of the\nquality and availability of products and services. The effects of a merger can be\nbeneficial to communities, enhancing the safety and soundness of a firm, and leading to\nsignificant public benefits. The consequences of getting these policies wrong can\nsignificantly harm communities, in some instances creating banking “deserts,” especially\nin rural and underserved markets.3\nResolution\nNext, I would like to discuss resolution planning, or so-called living wills.4 Each\nlarge banking organization is required to periodically submit a resolution plan to the\nBoard of Governors and the FDIC, describing the organization’s plan for an orderly\nresolution in the event of material financial distress or failure. The requirements for these\nplans are established by statute and regulation, with additional guidance published to give\nfirms appropriate notice of regulatory expectations. For the U.S.-based GSIBs, resolution\nplans are also informed by other regulatory requirements, including the requirement that\nsuch firms issue a minimum amount of total loss-absorbing capacity, which includes both\n3 See Michelle W. Bowman, “The New Landscape for Banking Competition” (speech at the 2022\nCommunity Banking Research Conference, St. Louis, MO, September 28, 2022),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20220928a.htm.\n4 See 12 U.S.C. § 5365.\n\n- 10 -\nequity and long-term debt.5 The requirements that establish and support the orderly\nresolution of firms are important to supporting the financial stability of the United States.\nOf course, these requirements have evolved over time, most recently with a\nproposal intended to increase the efficiency of living wills by alternating between data-\nintensive full plans and risk-focused targeted plans. I expect that further evolution will\nbe considered in response to ongoing changes in the financial landscape and the risks\nfacing the largest firms. In doing so, I believe that fairness dictates that broad\nsupervisory powers should not displace rulemaking.\nIn my view, the need for fairness and due process in resolution planning is\nparticularly critical when it comes to considering whether and how to address concerns\nabout the resolvability of regional banks. This question of fairness and due process is\nimportant, and it involves, among other things, a debate about the merits of a single point\nof entry resolution strategy on the one hand (more common among the GSIBs), and on\nthe other hand, established bankruptcy and FDIC bank resolution procedures. This issue\ntranscends particular firms, and particular transactions. It is an issue that affects a broad\nrange of institutions of similar size. And policy actions in this area will require working\nwith colleagues at other bank regulatory agencies and seeking public comment. Fairness\ndictates that this debate occurs in the arena of regulation, with all the appropriate due\nprocess protections that this entails, and not on an ad hoc basis for a single firm that\nchooses to make an acquisition subject to regulatory approval. If the regulatory\nframework for resolution needs to be improved, we should look at the framework, and\nidentify and remediate any areas of concern. It is hard to understand why banks that\n5 12 C.F.R. pt. 252, subpart G.\n\n- 11 -\nchoose to grow through acquisition should be subject to different resolution expectations\nthan banks that grow organically. This strikes me as a clear example where requirements\nand expectations should only evolve through appropriate rulemaking processes,\nconsistent with underlying law, in order to promote a level playing field.\nOther Areas\nThere are a number of other areas where I think these principles can help frame a\nproductive conversation about the future of regulation and supervision, including around\nbanks engaging in crypto-asset-related activities, and improving the transparency of\nsupervisory standards.\nAnother area where regulation and supervision continues to evolve is around\nbanks engaging in crypto-asset activities. These activities raise a number of significant\nissues. When I think about the evolution of supervision and regulation of these activities,\nI ask myself whether the rules are clear in the current rapidly evolving environment, and\nwhether the rules as they evolve are serving a legitimate prudential purpose. Banks seek\nto understand and comply with rules because, above all, they value predictability and\nconsistency. When a bank understands the legitimacy of a rule and establishes internal\nincentives to comply with it, the bank itself becomes the strongest supervisory tool that\nthere is. But sometimes, rules are difficult to apply. This can be due to quickly evolving\ntechnologies, particularly when it comes to digital assets, but it can also be due to a lack\nof experience with new rules, or when the rules are not that clear in a particular context.\nBanks should be able to know what the supervisory expectations are with respect to these\nnew technologies in order to responsibly take advantage of them. The adoption and use\nof new technologies may present novel supervisory concerns, but the best way to address\n\n- 12 -\nthese concerns and encourage innovation is dialogue between bankers and supervisors\nbefore and during the development and implementation of those technologies.\nI believe the goal with digital assets should be to match oversight to risk, and to\nprovide clarity in supervisory expectations for banks seeking to engage in the crypto-\nasset ecosystem. As fluctuations in crypto-asset prices have shown, there clearly are\nmaterial risks associated with these assets. However, it is also an area where there has\nbeen and continues to be intense consumer demand, and we should consider whether\nthere is a stabilizing role for banks to play in intermediation, or ensure that the\ncompetitive landscape does not create a financial stability risk by pushing activities\noutside the banking system, as we have seen with the mortgage industry. To be effective\nin this space, any clarity regulators provide will need to recognize that this is not a risk-\nfree activity, but I believe we should allow banks to participate as long as the risks can be\nidentified and managed appropriately and responsibly.\nAnother way to promote consistency is to continue improving the disclosures\naround supervisory standards. While doing so improves transparency, it also improves\nfairness, another of my core principles. Like the due process protections enshrined in the\nU.S. Constitution and embedded in regulatory law, fairness is fundamental to the\nlegitimacy and effectiveness of financial oversight, including supervision. In the context\nof bank regulation and supervision, fairness means being transparent about expectations,\nwhich should be clearly laid out in advance (and I want to emphasize that “in advance”\npart). Supervision should not be adjusted in specific situations to displace or alter\nregulations, or without appropriate notice and opportunity for public comment, and\nshould be accompanied by clear communication with regulated firms. Where we have\n\n- 13 -\nestablished precedents, we should respect them. Banks rely on our precedents in making\ntheir business decisions, so not respecting precedents can interfere with the ability of\nfirms to plan and to fairly compete. If changes to precedents are appropriate, we should\nexplain those intentions and employ a transparent and accountable administrative process\nto ensure fairness and appropriately implement the change.\nTake, for example, the supervision criteria implemented by the Large Institution\nSupervision Coordinating Committee (the LISCC manual). Currently, these materials are\nnot public. Making these materials public would not only improve transparency, doing\nso would also provide some assurance to the banks subject to them that they are being\nheld to the same supervisory expectations as their peers over time. Without this clarity, it\nis far more challenging to build trust in this aspect of the supervisory process.\nImproving transparency around supervisory standards promotes safety and\nsoundness, both encouraging compliance, and limiting the role of formal and informal\nenforcement actions and penalties in addressing serious issues. In my view, success\nshould not be measured by penalties or enforcement, but by how well banks are\nfollowing the rules.\nThe principles I’ve articulated today reflect my approach to considering whether\nand how the regulation and supervision of the largest banks should evolve in response to\nchanging economic and financial conditions. The regulation and supervision of financial\ninstitutions must be nimble to address new risks to safety and soundness and financial\nstability, but should always consider tradeoffs and potential unintended consequences,\nlike increasing the cost of lending or pushing financial activities outside of the regulatory\nperimeter into the shadow banking system. I look forward to working with Vice Chair\n\n- 14 -\nBarr, my fellow Board members, and colleagues at the other bank regulatory agencies, as\nwe consider the evolution of supervision and regulation for the largest financial\ninstitutions.",

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe American Bankers Association Community Banking Conference\nOrlando, Florida\nFebruary 13, 2023\n\nI would like to thank the American Bankers Association for the invitation to speak to you\ntoday. It is a pleasure to be with you and to have the opportunity to share some of my views on\nbanking regulation and supervision. Of course, as you know, the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC) recently held its first meeting of the year. So, before getting into the\nsubstance of my remarks, I’ll provide some brief thoughts on the economic outlook and\nmonetary policy.1\nMonetary Policy\nLet me begin with the FOMC’s effort to lower inflation, which continues to be much too\nhigh. Stable prices are necessary for a healthy economy and to support a labor market that works\nfor everyone. As a member of the FOMC, I remain focused on bringing inflation down to our 2\npercent goal.\nOver the past year, the Committee has taken forceful actions to address unacceptably\nhigh inflation by significantly raising the federal funds rate and reducing our balance sheet\nholdings of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities. At our most recent meeting, we\ncontinued on that path by further increasing the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis\npoints to 4½ to 4¾ percent. I expect that ongoing increases will be appropriate to bring the\nfederal funds rate to a sufficiently restrictive level and that it will need to remain there for some\ntime to restore price stability.\nThe economic outlook and the outlook for inflation continue to be highly uncertain.\nGlobal and domestic factors are contributing to heightened uncertainty, and I expect that we will\ncontinue to be surprised by economic and geopolitical developments and by the incoming data.\nWhile we have seen modestly lower inflation readings in recent months, overall inflation remains\n1 These views are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board or the\nFederal Open Market Committee.\n2\n\nhigh. Measures of core services inflation have been persistently elevated, and labor demand\nexceeds the supply of available workers, which is leading employers to increase wages in an\neffort to retain and attract workers. The ongoing tightness in the labor market puts upward\npressure on inflation, even if some components of inflation moderate due to improvements in\nsupply-side factors. The longer high inflation persists, the more likely it is that households and\nbusinesses may come to expect higher inflation in the longer term. Should that be the case, the\nFOMC’s job of lowering inflation would be even more challenging.\nGiven the highly uncertain environment, my views on the future path of monetary policy\nwill continue to be informed by the incoming data and its implications for the outlook. I will\ncontinue to look for consistent evidence that inflation remains on a downward path when\nconsidering further rate increases and at what point we will have achieved a sufficiently\nrestrictive stance for the policy rate.\nWe are still far from achieving price stability, and I expect that it will be necessary to\nfurther tighten monetary policy to bring inflation down toward our goal. Doing so will likely\nlead to subdued growth in economic activity and some softening in labor market conditions.\nWhile there are costs and risks to tightening monetary policy to lower inflation, I see the costs\nand risks of allowing inflation to persist as far greater. Restoring price stability is essential to\nsupport a sustainably strong labor market.\nTurning to the focus of my remarks today, I would like to share my thoughts on several\ncurrent aspects of banking supervision and regulation.\nWhat I say next will certainly not surprise you: I expect there will be meaningful\nchanges in regulations, guidance, and supervisory expectations over the coming year. While\n3\n\nsome of these changes will affect only the largest institutions, many will affect community\nbankers like you and may impact your work to support your local communities.\nTo be clear, the issues facing the banking industry continue to evolve over time, and the\nregulatory response to these changes must adapt as well. But as we continue to review and\nrevisit the regulatory framework, I’d like to share a few thoughts about how the Federal Reserve\ncan best fulfill its missions of furthering the safety and soundness of banks and promoting the\nstability of the financial system. Specifically, I will discuss three topics that are more\ninterconnected than they may appear: (1) Federal Reserve independence, (2) predictability in\napplications, and (3) tailoring of regulations and supervision.\nFederal Reserve Independence\nMost often, the independence of the Federal Reserve is discussed in terms of\nindependence in the setting of monetary policy. While the value of independent decision making\nin monetary policy is vital, and research shows that it leads to better policy outcomes in the long\nrun, it is also important to emphasize the value of independence in banking supervision and\nregulation.\nYou may have seen Chair Powell’s recent speech on this topic, in which he noted that\nindependence in our bank regulatory function helps to ensure that our decisions are driven\nprimarily by the goals of promoting a safe and sound financial system and safeguarding the\nstability of the U.S. financial system stability.2 In this context, independence also means that we\nare not influenced by political considerations in making policy decisions. The Federal Reserve’s\nindependence in bank regulation also provides stability and consistency to regulated institutions.\nI am not suggesting that bank regulation remain static in the face of change. To the contrary, the\n2 Chair Jerome Powell, “Panel on Central Bank Independence and the Mandate—Evolving Views” (speech at the\nSymposium on Central Bank Independence, Sveriges Riksbank, Stockholm, Sweden, January 10, 2023).\n4\n\nFederal Reserve’s regulatory approach must be capable of addressing and adapting to new\nactivities and new risks but also must be constantly directed towards furthering our statutory\nobjectives.\nOf course, this independence in bank regulation must be accompanied by accountability,\nto both Congress and the American public.\nExisting law provides a number of mechanisms to ensure this accountability to Congress.\nFirst, members of the Board of Governors are appointed by the President, subject to the advice\nand consent of the Senate. Second, the Board also regularly communicates with Congress, both\nthrough in-person testimony to relevant banking and financial services committees and by\nproviding regular reports on key areas within the Federal Reserve’s areas of responsibility,\nincluding semiannual reports on banking applications activity, supervision and regulation,\ncybersecurity and financial system resilience, and financial stability. This regular cadence of\ntestimony and public reporting provides visibility into the inner working of the Federal Reserve,\nnot just for Congress, but also for the public.\nBeyond these measures though, accountability also means having transparent policies and\nprocedures and conducting supervision in a way that is predictable and fair. Transparency builds\nlegitimacy and helps demonstrate that the Fed is executing its responsibilities in a fair way for all\nregulated institutions. One area I think we are always looking to improve is the publication of\nclear, appropriate guidance, especially for community banks. I think there are examples where\nwe have done a pretty good job, for instance providing tools to help community banks estimate\ntheir losses under the Current Expected Credit Loss, or CECL, accounting standard. We owe\nthis duty of transparency to all regulated institutions. For example, I expect the Board will soon\npublish the supervision criteria implemented by the Large Institution Supervision Coordinating\n5\n\nCommittee—the LISCC manual. Banks should have some assurance that they are being held to\nthe same standards as their peers over time. While publication of the manual may be only a\nmodest improvement in transparency, I think it will be an important step.\nTransparency helps us not only with accountability, but also with building legitimacy and\npublic trust. To be clear, I do not consider transparency to mean leniency. We hold banks of all\nsizes to high standards, commensurate with their size and risk, and being transparent does not\ndilute the rigor of our regulatory standards. Transparency helps ensure that banks are aware of\nthese standards and expectations so that they can work more effectively and efficiently to meet\nthem.\nPerhaps most importantly, though, we must implement the laws that Congress has passed\nas they are written and not stretch that authority to venture into other areas of policymaking.\nFor example, consider the distinction between (1) making sure institutions are managing\nall of their material risks and (2) instructing banks to make certain credit allocation decisions,\nthat is, telling banks to make or not make loans to certain industries. The first objective—\nmaking sure financial institutions manage their material risks—is one of the central functions of\na bank supervisor, and is fundamental to safety and soundness. But it is equally clear that the\nsecond objective—influencing a bank to make certain credit allocation decisions—is not the role\nof a banking regulator. If you look across the regulated banking sectors, you will find that each\nbank makes different credit decisions, reacting not only to market demand and economic\nconditions, but also implementing the bank’s strategy. And to be clear, I share the widely held\nview that the appropriate role of the Federal Reserve is not to make credit allocation decisions\nfor banks.\n6\n\nThe Fed’s role as a banking supervisor is not to replace a bank’s management and board\nof directors in adopting a banking strategy and risk appetite. Instead, it is to apply appropriate,\ntargeted regulation and supervision, in order to be able to assess that when a bank engages in an\nactivity, it does so in compliance with applicable laws and in a safe and sound manner. This can\nbe a difficult balance to strike but it is something I believe we must always bear in mind\nwhenever the Fed uses or proposes using its regulatory or supervisory tools. Banking regulation\nand supervision should not be the place to implement new policies that are not mandated by\nCongress.\nIn the past, I have shared my views about the Fed’s rulemaking agenda, which remain the\nsame today. I continue to support changes based on our experience applying existing rules or\nprompted by new and emerging issues. However, any incremental changes to regulation should\nyield significant improvements to safety and soundness at reasonable cost, in consideration of the\ntradeoffs between cost and safety. And of course, any changes should be to further our\nregulatory responsibilities as mandated by Congress.\nI’ll turn now to a few examples of “how” the Federal Reserve should regulate and\nsupervise financial institutions in the context of merger applications and in the tailoring of our\nregulations and supervision.\nPredictability in Reviewing Bank Mergers\nRecently, there has been significant attention focused on the role of federal bank\nregulators in reviewing merger applications, with scrutiny of not only the rigor of the review, but\nalso on how the review process impacts the merger applicants. I certainly welcome this\ndiscussion and hearing public feedback, to see if the process can be improved.\n7\n\nCongress established the factors that must be considered when the Federal Reserve and\nother regulators review bank applications. These include the competitive effects of the proposed\nmerger, financial and managerial resources, future prospects of the merged institutions,\nconvenience and needs of the communities to be served, compliance with money laundering\nlaws, and the effect of the transaction on the stability of the financial system. Although the\nreview framework is the same for all applications, the facts of each case can vary widely, from\ncommunity bank mergers to mergers of much larger institutions that can affect markets across\nlarge regions of the country. While this variability necessitates an in-depth review of each\ntransaction on its own merits, these reviews are most effective when the expectations of the\nregulators are clear in advance and the parties can reasonably anticipate the application review\nprocess.\nThe agencies are required to review the statutory factors, but it is also important that we\nunderstand that timing matters in merger transactions. There are significant consequences to\nfirms when applications are not acted on in a timely manner, including increased operational\nrisk, the additional expense associated with running two institutions in parallel over a longer\nperiod of time, employee retention issues, and perceived reputational risk. Congress has also\nrecognized the need for prompt action, imposing a variety of time limits for agency action on\nbank applications.3 Recently, we have seen an increase in average processing times in the\nmerger review process.4 I am concerned about delays in the applications process and am\nconcerned that the increase in average processing times will become the new normal.\n3 See, e.g., 12 U.S.C. 1842(b)(1); 4807(a).\n4 See Banking Applications Activity Semiannual Report, January 1-June 30, 2022, Vol. 9, No. 2, Table 1,\n“Dispositions and processing times of proposals, 2018-2021 and 2021:H1 and 2022:H1” (December 2022).\n8\n\nI think it’s helpful to consider the source of delays in processing applications and\nconsider whether there are opportunities for improvement. This is another area where increased\ntransparency can help. The legal standards we apply have not changed, and yet the review of\napplications can be affected by incomplete or inaccurate information or information that does not\nmeet the expectations for an approvable transaction. Filling this information gap with clearer\nguidance, and making sure applicants understand our expectations could meaningfully improve\nthe process. New supervisory information that comes to light during the examination process\ncan also lead to delays, particularly if new supervisory issues need to be remediated before the\napplication can be approved. In these cases, transparency between the regulator and the\napplicant helps ensure clear expectations about potential delays.\nThat being said, improved transparency only goes so far. I think it will come as no\nsurprise to the bankers here today that often, the key difference in processing times is whether\nthe application will be acted on by the Reserve Banks on a delegated basis or will require Board\naction. While an application can come to the Board for many reasons, the most common reason\nis that the Board has received a protest on the application from a member of the public. I think it\nis helpful to consider whether this process could be improved, so that bona fide concerns raised\nby the public are appropriately considered, while still ensuring timely decision-making.\nFinally, to reiterate a point I’ve made in the past, I continue to believe that the application\nprocess should not be used as a substitute for rulemaking. If the rules applicable to a firm or\ngroup of firms needs to be updated, we should follow the rulemaking process to update those\nrules.\n9\n\nTailoring\nFinally, I would like to emphasize the role of tailoring in regulation and supervision.\nTailoring was a core feature of the response to the 2008 financial crisis and since then has been\nthe subject of a concerted effort to refine and improve the regulatory and supervisory framework\nbased on experience since the framework was implemented.5 Tailoring has proven to be an\neffective and efficient way to regulate and supervise banks of all sizes.\nOf course, all of you here today are very familiar with risk-based supervision, which is\nitself a form of tailoring, focusing supervisory attention on areas that pose the greatest risks. But\ntailoring also helps us adopt meaningful differences in regulatory requirements and supervisory\nexpectations, depending on the size and complexity of the regulated institution, from the largest\nG-SIBs to the smallest community banks. This tailored approach manifests itself across the\nspectrum from the stringency of capital requirements, the regulatory reporting obligations, and\nthe frequency of examination, among many others.\nTime has demonstrated the virtues of this tailored approach. The U.S. banking system\nentered the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic with high levels of capital and liquidity, and\nbanks of all sizes supported the economy during the darkest days of the pandemic and have\ncontinued to support the economy ever since. This tailored approach should continue to feature\nprominently in upcoming proposed revisions to the capital framework. While I expect the Board\nwill propose new capital requirements for the largest institutions, including the Basel III\n5 Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, Pub. L. No. 115-174, 132 Stat. 1296 (2018);\nChris Dodd and Barney Frank, interview by David Brancaccio, Marketplace, September 12, 2018,\nhttps://features.marketplace.org/politicsofcrisis/#transcript; Daniel K. Tarullo, “Departing Thoughts” (speech at the\nWoodrow Wilson School, Princeton, NJ, April 4, 2017),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/tarullo20170404a.htm; Randal K. Quarles, “Between the Hither\nand the Farther Shore: Thoughts on Unfinished Business” (speech at the American Enterprise Institute, Washington,\nDC, December 2, 2021), https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/quarles20211202a.htm.\n10\n\n“endgame” reforms, I do not expect every tier of firms to be subject to the same changes. And\nmy understanding is that there are no plans to propose changes to the community bank capital\nframework as part of this capital review.\nThis tailored approach is sensible not only by matching regulation to risk, but it is\nembedded in the statutory framework. For example, the bipartisan Economic Growth,\nRegulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act included several elements designed to tailor\nregulatory requirements. For the largest firms, this law instructs the Board to tailor its “enhanced\nprudential standards” framework—the strictest standards—to firms based on the risks they pose.\nThis statute also reduced the burden on smaller institutions, including through the community\nbank leverage ratio, the creation of short-form call reports for smaller community banks and a\nlonger examination cycle for small, well-capitalized banks. In my view, the current community\nbank capital requirements, including the community bank leverage ratio, are functioning well.\nIn practice, tailoring requires a framework that both distinguishes firms by size, risk, and\ncomplexity, and imposes appropriate regulatory requirements in light of these differences. The\nlargest institutions are classified by a number of factors including size, cross-jurisdictional\nactivity, reliance on short-term wholesale funding, off-balance sheet exposures, and nonbank\nassets. These factors, and the G-SIB scoring methodology more broadly, help contrast the\nlargest firms that pose the greatest risks with the smaller and less systemic firms. This translates\ninto a regulatory regime where the G-SIBs are subject to the most stringent standards,\nincorporating enhancements like a GSIB-specific risk-based capital surcharge and the enhanced\nsupplementary leverage ratio. Even the smallest banks are subject to size and risk considerations\nin their supervisory expectations, like a longer examination cycle, and straight forward capital\nand liquidity requirements and expectations.\n11\n\nThis very intentional approach accomplishes utility and efficiency, for both regulators\nand the regulated institutions, that would be otherwise impossible. Tailoring our regulatory\napproach enables us to strike an appropriate balance for each relevant bank tier, with\nrequirements that address risks, including financial stability risks, while recognizing the costs of\nover-regulation.\nClosing\nWe have a dynamic financial system in the United States, a system that has long been\nsupported by having independent and accountable regulators. As the financial system has\nevolved over time, so has the regulatory and supervisory framework designed to further the goals\nof safety and soundness, and financial stability. In my view, it is important that we continue to\nemphasize the value of accountability and transparency, while continuing to improve the fairness\nand efficiency of this framework.\n12",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n4:15 a.m. EDT (9:15 a.m. local time)\nOctober 11, 2023\nFinancial Stability in Uncertain Times\nRemarks by\nMichelle W. Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe Reinventing Bretton Woods Committee and Policy Center for the New South Marrakech\nEconomic Festival\nMarrakech, Morocco\nOctober 11, 2023\n\nIt’s a pleasure to join you today to discuss the role of central banks and financial\nregulators in effectively promoting a stable and resilient global financial system.1 Before I begin\nmy remarks, let me first take a moment to express my deepest sympathies to those who have\nbeen impacted by last month’s earthquake. I especially wish to recognize the Moroccan\nauthorities for their efforts to host this important gathering under such challenging\ncircumstances. We are grateful for your determination and inspired by your resilience and\nhospitality.\nToday, I will discuss some of the financial system vulnerabilities and risks that I see as\nmost salient. These risks and vulnerabilities are top of my mind but are by no means exhaustive\nof those monitored by the Federal Reserve.2 I will then offer some thoughts on how the Federal\nReserve, and other financial regulators and central banks, may be able to address and mitigate\nthese financial system vulnerabilities and risks so that monetary policymakers are able to\ncontinue to pursue their monetary policy mandates.\nThe recent macroeconomic experience has presented both monetary policy and financial\nstability challenges for central banks. In many economies during the pandemic, supply chain\ndisruptions coupled with strong demand as economies emerged from pandemic restrictions acted\nas catalysts pushing inflation up to very high levels. Aggregate demand was also supported by\naccommodative monetary and fiscal policies, which served to bolster the balance sheets of\nhouseholds, businesses, and local governments; increased excess savings; and contributed to\nvery tight labor markets.\n1 These remarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve Board or\nthe Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 See, for example, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Financial Stability Report (Washington:\nBoard of Governors, May 2023), https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/2023-may-financial-stability-report-\npurpose-and-framework.htm.\n\n- 2 -\nMany central banks facing these dynamics have tightened monetary policy in an effort to\nbring demand and supply into better balance and to bring inflation back down to their targets. In\nthe United States, over the past year and a half, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)\nhas increased the federal funds target range by 5¼ percent and has been reducing the Federal\nReserve’s securities holdings, which had increased substantially during the pandemic period.\nWe have seen some progress on lowering inflation over that time. However, inflation remains\nwell above the FOMC’s 2 percent target. Domestic spending has continued at a strong pace, and\nthe labor market remains tight. This suggests that the policy rate may need to rise further and\nstay restrictive for some time to return inflation to the FOMC’s goal.\nAs they have confronted price stability challenges, central banks have also faced new\nfinancial stability risks, with some related to the sizable moves in interest rates in an environment\nwith persistent, elevated inflation. The recent experience has also highlighted how geopolitical\ntensions can pose financial stability risks, for example, through greater financial market volatility\nor, more indirectly, through their possible effects on economic activity and inflation.\nFinancial System Vulnerabilities and Risks\nLike many other central banks, the Federal Reserve continually monitors for a wide range\nof emerging risks and vulnerabilities in the financial system. It is critical to acknowledge that we\nneed to be responsive to changing conditions in our assessment of and response to financial\nstability risks. As a case in point, in recent years, it seemed that many underappreciated interest\nrate risk and yet, it was poor management of this risk that created significant disruptions in the\nfinancial system this spring. With that in mind, I will discuss in more detail the financial\nstability risks and vulnerabilities on which I am currently most focused.\n\n- 3 -\nBanking sector\nStarting with the banking sector, the events of earlier this year have underscored the\nstrength and resilience of the overall U.S. banking system. The vast majority of U.S. banks are\nadequately managing their interest rate and credit risk and maintaining prudent capital and\nliquidity positions.\nWhile the banking sector is expected to experience higher funding costs and some deposit\noutflows as a result of tighter monetary policy and higher interest rates, these outcomes can\ncreate vulnerabilities for some banks. Banks relying on more expensive deposits and that also\nhave large holdings of long-term assets like longer-dated loans or securities with low, fixed rates\nwill likely continue to experience a drag on earnings, especially if interest rates stay higher for\nlonger. Should a bank be forced to sell long-term assets, the realized losses can negatively\nimpact regulatory capital. A rising interest rate environment may also erode the credit quality of\nbank loan portfolios should economic activity and incomes soften, posing an additional source of\nrisk to bank earnings and capital. It is important to monitor these evolving risks, and if\nnecessary, take action to minimize the possible spillover effects on the wider banking and\nfinancial system. In the United States, the Federal Reserve’s recent stress test of the largest\nbanks’ capital positions featured a scenario with extreme declines in asset valuations and a steep\nrise in unemployment. All banks subject to this test passed.3\nIn March of this year, we saw a run on the deposits of Silicon Valley Bank and other\nrelated banking sector stresses which highlighted banking system vulnerability to an erosion of\nconfidence. This erosion of confidence—even when it starts at a single institution with its own\nunique and isolated issues—can pose risks to a larger set of institutions based on, among other\n3 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Dodd-Frank Act Stress Tests 2023,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/dfa-stress-tests-2023.htm.\n\n- 4 -\nthings, similarities in size, business model, or customer base. As we have seen in the past, an\nerosion of confidence can lead to sudden large deposit outflows. Today, social media and\ntechnology can accelerate the spread of fear among depositors and bank investors, exacerbating\ncontagion risk.\nCommercial real estate\nAnother concern relates to the potential decline in commercial real estate (CRE) property\nvalues and a resulting degradation of CRE loan quality in certain markets. Low return-to-office\nrates and a current trend toward businesses opting to reduce office footprints may lead to higher\nvacancy rates, which may put downward pressure on property values, especially in certain\nlocalities and sectors, including city centers and retail properties. Should the economy slow\nconsiderably, CRE loan quality could deteriorate as interest rates stay high or property values\nsoften. Since 2008, underwriting standards and loan-to-value ratios on most U.S. CRE loans\nhave become much more conservative. However, there is still a risk that a decline in property\nvalues, reduced rental income cash flows, or other shocks could impair CRE portfolios,\nespecially if those loans mature and are refinanced at higher interest rates.\nWhile many banks are well-positioned to work with their borrowers to restructure loans\nor to mitigate risks of related losses, some banks with large undiversified and geographically\nconcentrated CRE portfolios may be at greater risk. I am also monitoring the potential financial\nstability implications of nonperforming CRE loans that are packaged as part of commercial\nmortgage-backed securities (CMBS). It is much more difficult to restructure a nonperforming\nloan that is part of a CMBS pool when compared with nonperforming loans held directly by the\nlender. Pooled CMBS investments are often held in significant volumes or in concentrated\nshares by institutions that include large insurance companies and pension plans. Were these\n\n- 5 -\ninstitutions to suffer significant losses on their CMBS holdings, there could be broader effects on\nthe securitization pipeline for CMBS and on the CRE market.\nNonbank financial institutions\nI am also closely watching other financial stability vulnerabilities posed by large nonbank\nfinancial institutions. Hedge fund leverage remains elevated and prime money market funds,\ninsurance companies, and some corporate bond mutual funds remain vulnerable to run risks. In\naddition to this risk, it is also important to monitor the interest rate and funding vulnerabilities of\nthese entities in the current macroeconomic and interest rate environment. These are not novel\nvulnerabilities, however, as the nonbank financial institution sector continues to expand,\nmonitoring these risks has become especially important.\nU.S. Treasury markets\nU.S. Treasury market stress events—including the repo-market stress in September 2019\nand the March 2020 dash for cash—have raised concerns about the resiliency of U.S. Treasury\nmarkets. Last year’s government securities market stress in the United Kingdom also\nhighlighted how disruptions in the functioning of these markets can disrupt central bank plans\nincluding the path of balance sheet reduction, even if temporarily. Indicators of U.S. Treasury\nmarket liquidity have remained stable, and Treasury markets have continued to function, but\nrisks remain.4 It will be important to watch for signs of impaired Treasury market functioning,\nespecially as the Federal Reserve continues to reduce its holdings of Treasury securities and\nTreasury auction volumes expand to meet issuance needs.\n4 For example, dealer balance sheet capacity may become strained, especially in times of volatile financial markets,\nlimiting market funding in Treasury markets. See, for example,\nDarrell Duffie, Michael J. Fleming, Frank M. Keane, Claire Nelson, Or Shachar, and Peter Van Tassel, “Dealer\nCapacity and U.S. Treasury Market Functionality,” Staff Report 1070 (New York: Federal Reserve Bank of New\nYork, August 2023), https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr1070.\n\n- 6 -\nDesigning and Calibrating Policies to Promote Financial Stability\nAs a general principle, central banks and other regulatory authorities may choose to\nproactively use supervisory and regulatory tools to mitigate financial stability risks and\nvulnerabilities. Should financial stability risks be realized, it may become necessary to\nimplement central bank and other targeted emergency liquidity or lending facilities. A central\nbank’s implementation of monetary policy may influence the financial stability risks that are\nmost salient. In many jurisdictions, including the United States, financial stability tools separate\nand distinct from monetary policy tools may be most effective to mitigate and address financial\nstability risks. The separation of these tools can allow monetary policy decisionmaking to\nremain focused on achieving central bank monetary policy goals.5\nThat said, not all of the financial stability risks and vulnerabilities that I have highlighted\nrequire policy changes. In fact, it is possible that an overreaction in adjusting policies in light of\nrecent stresses could worsen conditions rather than ameliorate them.\nBalance of bank supervision and regulation\nAs we learned from the recent U.S. bank failures, responsive, efficient, and effective\nbank supervision is a strong mitigant for financial system risks and vulnerabilities. The failures\nrevealed that shortcomings in bank supervision can heighten financial stability risks.\nThe primary focus of supervision should be to address a bank’s critical shortcomings in a\ntimely way.6 To effectively support financial stability, bank supervision cannot simply rely on\npinpointing compliance issues, failed processes, or rule violations. It must go further to examine\n5 Of course, should a financial stability risk event affect the economy or the economic outlook, for example, through\na slowdown in economic activity, monetary policymakers might take this into account when determining appropriate\nmonetary policy.\n6 This timeless principle was recently discussed in the current context by Tobias Adrian, Marina Moretti, Ana\nCarvalho, Hee Kyong Chon, Katharine Seal, Fabiana Melo, and Jay Surti, “Good Supervision: Lessons from the\nField,” Working Paper 23/181 (Washington: International Monetary Fund, September 2023), https://www.imf.org/-\n/media/Files/Publications/WP/2023/English/wpiea2023181-print-pdf.ashx.\n\n- 7 -\na bank’s risk exposures while prioritizing core safety and soundness issues in the context of the\nbank’s financial condition. If the supervisory process fails to identify and escalate critical risks,\nor to hold management accountable for known deficiencies, such as excess interest rate risk-\ntaking, this raises the potential for supervisory shortcomings, including the ability to anticipate\nhow the evolving macro-financial landscape can affect a bank’s condition.\nAs the regulatory framework becomes more complex, we must ensure that supervisors\nand examiners are adequately equipped to implement and maintain the highest quality of\nsupervision. Even as we focus on improvements to the bank regulatory framework, we should\nalso ensure that supervision includes bank management and their boards of directors. As\nchanges are made to supervisory activities, these changes should be open and transparent, and\nshould be implemented with an appropriate consideration of the tradeoffs and unintended\nconsequences. No regulatory or supervisory framework can be effective without accountability.\nRegulatory capital requirements, no matter how conservatively calibrated they may be,\nare simply no substitute for sound risk management and strong, effective, efficient, and\ntransparent supervision. The vast majority of improvements to supervisory functions could be\naccomplished without broad changes to the regulatory framework.\nWhile some changes to the regulatory framework may be appropriate to promote\nfinancial stability, we should be careful to ensure that changes do not harm the long-term\nviability of banks, especially midsized and smaller banks. In my view, regulatory reform can\npose significant financial stability risks, particularly if those changes to regulation fail to take\nsufficient account of the incentive effects and potential consequences. Regulatory actions also\nhave the capacity to depress economic activity through the reduced availability of credit or by\nlimiting the availability of financial products or services. These concerns are most acute when\n\n- 8 -\nthe reforms themselves may be inefficient or poorly targeted. For example, policymakers should\ncarefully consider whether the contemplated significant increases in capital requirements in the\nUnited States related to the finalization of Basel III capital standards meet this standard for being\nefficient and appropriately targeted.\nRegulatory approaches in the banking sector must also allow for innovation. Inhibiting\ninnovation in the banking sector could push growth of certain products and services further into\nthe nonbank sector, leading to much less transparency and potentially greater financial stability\nrisk. A comprehensive regulatory approach must include enforcing existing regulation through\neffective supervision, expanding the regulatory perimeter, and addressing regulatory gaps.\nNonbank financial institution supervision and regulation\nA key component of fostering financial stability is to ensure that every institution that\nengages in similar financial activities with similar risks is treated similarly under supervisory and\nregulatory authorities. Many nonbank financial institutions and products are subject to differing\ndegrees of regulation, oversight, and monitoring. While it is important that the banking system is\nwell-regulated and supervised, it is equally important that this is the case for other types of\nfinancial institutions, products, or services. Developing effective frameworks for regulating and\nsupervising common financial markets and products is important for ensuring the protection of\nconsumers and for the stability of the financial system. The Federal Reserve appreciates the\nwork that the Financial Stability Board (FSB) has undertaken in this area and the strong support\nmy co-panelist Governor Klaas Knot has provided in his role as chair of the FSB.\nWith respect to Treasury market functioning, it is also important that the U.S. continues\nto carefully consider proposals that could support Treasury market resilience and reduce the\nlikelihood that the Federal Reserve would need to step in to restore market functioning during\n\n- 9 -\nstressed conditions. For example, in the U.S. the largest banks are subject to a leverage ratio and\nglobal systemically important bank (G-SIB) surcharge that are set much higher than the\ninternational standard. These higher levels need to be reconsidered to ensure that dealers have\nadequate balance sheet capacity to intermediate Treasury markets in times of stress. Likewise,\nincreasing data transparency on market pricing and flow should also be considered to encourage\nintermediary entry and competition.7\nCentral bank liquidity provision and lending facilities\nShould financial stability risks materialize, central banks must be prepared to provide\ntargeted liquidity to financial institutions during times of stress to restore market functioning and\nfinancial stability. The use of these lending programs during the pandemic demonstrated their\neffectiveness in serving as backstops to support market functioning and the flow of credit in\ntimes of stress.8 When appropriately calibrated, these programs can help promote market\nfunctioning but limit the Federal Reserve’s overall footprint in financial markets in the longer\nterm. It is also important to clearly distinguish any temporary central bank asset purchase\nprograms to promote core financial market functioning from monetary policy actions.9\nIn the banking system, it is also important that tools to support bank liquidity and\npayments—including discount window operations and Fedwire® within the Federal Reserve—\n7 See, for example, Inter-Agency Working Group for Treasury Market Surveillance (IAWG), Enhancing the\nResilience of the U.S. Treasury Market: 2022 Staff Progress Report (Washington: U.S. Department of the Treasury,\nNovember 10, 2022), https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/2022-IAWG-Treasury-Report.pdf; as well as,\nDarrell Duffie, “Resilience Redux in the U.S. Treasury Market” (Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Jackson\nHole Symposium Paper, August 13, 2023),\nhttps://www.kansascityfed.org/Jackson%20Hole/documents/9726/JH_Paper_Duffie.pdf.\n8 For details on these programs, see “Funding, Credit, Liquidity, and Loan Facilities,” Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System, last modified July 7, 2023, https://www.federalreserve.gov/funding-credit-liquidity-and-\nloan-facilities.htm.\n9 See Michelle W. Bowman, “Panel on ‘Design Issues for Central Bank Facilities in the Future’” (speech at the\nChicago Booth Initiative on Global Markets Workshop on Market Dysfunction, Chicago, Illinois, March 3, 2023),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20230303a.htm.\n\n- 10 -\nare available for extended operating hours and are prepared to provide support during times of\nstress. We should also consider what further steps are needed to ensure that banks have access to\nliquidity support. In addition, we should encourage, but not mandate, the exercise of\ncontingency funding plans and testing capabilities, requiring bank management to ensure\nadequate plans are in place.\nIn the Treasury markets, the Federal Reserve should ensure that tools like the standing\nrepurchase agreement (repo) facility are available to serve as backstops in money markets to\nsupport the effective implementation of monetary policy and smooth market functioning. Well-\ncalibrated international swap lines and repo facilities can also be helpful in promoting both\nTreasury market and dollar market functioning. Of course, all central bank lending tools should\nserve as temporary backstops. Central banks and other agencies should ensure that regulations\nand market oversight foster prudent financial institution behavior and resiliency in core financial\nmarkets. Doing so can increase the ability of private markets and institutions to function during\ntimes of stress and reduce the likelihood of future market interventions by the central bank.\nConclusion\nMany central banks are facing challenging and uncertain times as they strive to restore\nprice stability and promote financial stability. A stable and resilient financial system is essential\nfor the effective transmission of monetary policy and for a healthy economy. Healthy economies\nfoster financial stability and financial stability fosters healthy economies. It is essential that\ncentral banks facing high inflation bring inflation back to target. A failure to do so would only\nlead to greater financial stability risks through less certain and unstable economic conditions and\nthrough reduced central bank credibility.\n\n- 11 -\nIt is, therefore, necessary that central banks, in collaboration with other financial\nregulators as appropriate, develop and use supervisory and prudential regulatory tools to promote\nfinancial stability. Effective supervision and regulation, in turn, will support the effective\nconduct of monetary policy in achieving central banks’ macroeconomic objectives. As these\nissues transcend national borders, central banks and regulatory authorities must also aim to build\nan international perspective that is complementary to or informed by global collaboration. This\nperspective has never been more important.",

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat a\nFed Listens Event on Transitioning to the Post-Pandemic Economy, hosted by\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of Boston\nBoston, Massachusetts\nMay 31, 2023\n\nIt is very good to be here, and to be part of this Fed Listens event and discussion\nabout the effects of the pandemic experience on the U.S. economy, highlighting\nchallenges in the labor and housing markets.\nWhile there are many ways to think about the impact of these effects, I find it\nhelpful to consider both the cyclical or temporary factors and those that are structural and\nlonger term. As monetary policymakers, we are primarily focused on the cyclical\nmatters—meaning how the pandemic and the measures taken to address it complicated\naccomplishing our dual-mandate objectives of maximum employment and stable prices.\nMaking the best monetary policy decisions over the business cycle requires\ndistinguishing between temporary effects and lasting, structural changes.\nToday’s agenda includes the employment recovery following the high\nunemployment during the spring of 2020 leading to the current tight labor market.\nToday’s labor market strength reflects policy decisions taken in light of the pandemic\nexperience, including the widespread lockdowns, reliance upon remote work, and other\nfactors that may have structurally altered the labor market. I am very much looking\nforward to the discussion.\nI also look forward to learning from the perspectives of today’s participants from\naround New England about the issues that will be discussed today. I find it especially\nhelpful to participate in regional discussions to broaden my understanding of economic\nconditions throughout the country. This local perspective is one of the great advantages\nof the Federal Reserve System’s regional structure, and of the Fed Listens initiative,\nwhich complements the Board’s efforts to understand national economic conditions.\n\n- 2 -\nIn 2019, the Board launched Fed Listens with a year of listening sessions with the\npublic focused on monetary policy and, specifically, on how the Federal Open Market\nCommittee uses interest rates and other tools to promote a healthy economy. While data\ncan tell us a lot, learning about the experiences behind those data helps bring economic\ndata to life for me and for my colleagues. Through Fed Listens and other engagements\nwith the public, we hear about how Americans are faring in the economy and about how\nour policy decisions affect individuals, businesses, and communities. So our efforts to\nenhance our ability to listen have continued and have become what I expect will be, and\ncertainly should be, a permanent feature of the Federal Reserve’s decisionmaking.\nSince the pandemic, and with the onset of high inflation, we have seen shifts in\nthe availability of affordable housing and in the housing market more generally. I’m\ninterested to hear how these impacts are being felt in New England. The availability and\naffordability of housing are critical for families and for communities seeking to attract\nnew jobs and the workers to fill those new employment opportunities. Distinguishing\nbetween the short-term effects of the pandemic and longer-term structural shifts in the\neconomy is crucial in making the near-term policy decisions to achieve our dual-mandate\ngoals.\nIn the near term, higher interest rates intended to lower inflation work most\ndirectly in the housing market. While we expect lower rents will eventually be reflected\nin inflation data as new leases make their way into the calculations, the residential real\nestate market appears to be rebounding, with home prices leveling out recently, which\nhas implications for our fight to lower inflation.\n\n- 3 -\nThe pandemic abruptly changed the lives of most Americans and their families,\nand it fed a surge of demand for those who sought larger homes. It ushered in a wave of\nhomebuilding and renovation that was a significant contributing factor for inflation and\nsupply chain challenges. Much of that initial inflation has moderated, but it will be\nimportant to understand the long-term effect of the pandemic environment on household\nformation and housing demand going forward.\nThank you again, President Collins, for hosting this Fed Listens event and for the\nopportunity to be part of this discussion.",

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nIndependent Community Bankers of America\nICBA Live 2023 Conference\nHonolulu, Hawaii\nMarch 14, 2023\n\nI would like to thank the ICBA for the invitation to speak with you today. It is a pleasure\nto be with you to discuss innovation in the U.S. financial system, the emerging trends that are\nshaping the industry, and the influence of regulatory approach on this evolution.1\nBefore turning to the main theme of my remarks, I would like to take a moment to\nacknowledge the events of the past week, and the actions taken by regulators in response. As\nyou are aware, last Friday, March 10, the California Department of Financial Protection and\nInnovation closed Silicon Valley Bank. On March 12, the New York Department of Financial\nServices closed Signature Bank. In both cases, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\n(FDIC) has been appointed as receiver. One significant factor leading to the stress and\nsubsequent closure at each institution was the rapid outflow of deposits, specifically uninsured\ndeposits above the FDIC-guaranteed amount of $250,000 per depositor, per account type.\nOn Sunday, several specific actions were announced that are intended to limit the direct\nand indirect risks to the U.S. financial system resulting from the closure of these two financial\ninstitutions. The Federal Reserve Board announced that it will make additional funding available\nto eligible depository institutions through a newly created Bank Term Funding Program.2 This\nprogram will offer one year loans to institutions that pledge U.S. Treasury securities, agency debt\nand mortgage-backed securities, and other qualifying assets as collateral. The facility will\nprovide an additional source of liquidity to banks and eliminate the need for institutions to\nquickly sell these securities during a time of stress. The FDIC also took action to protect all\ndepositors, including uninsured depositors, of both Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.\n1 The views expressed in these remarks are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of my colleagues on the\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Federal Reserve Board Announces It Will Make Available\nAdditional Funding to Eligible Depository Institutions to Help Assure Banks Have the Ability to Meet the Needs of\nAll Their Depositors,” news release, March 12, 2023,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20230312a.htm.\n\n- 2 -\nBeginning Monday morning, these depositors were able to access all of their funds on deposit\nwith these banks. The federal regulators, including the FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board and\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen approved the actions to protect depositors.\nThe U.S. banking system remains resilient and on a solid foundation, with strong capital\nand liquidity throughout the system. The Board continues to carefully monitor developments in\nfinancial markets and across the financial system.\nNow, turning to the main theme of my remarks today, I will discuss the imperative of\nfostering innovation in the banking system.\nOften, when innovation is discussed within the context of the banking system, the focus\nis not on traditional banks engaged in core banking activities, like taking retail deposits and\nmaking loans. I think this perception misses the mark. Innovation has always been a priority for\nbanks of all sizes and business models, from small community banks to the largest global\nsystemically important banks (G-SIBs), and for good reason. Banks in the U.S. have a long\nhistory of developing and implementing new technologies. Innovation has the potential to make\nthe banking and payments systems faster and more efficient, to bring new products and services\nto customers, and even to enhance safety and soundness. Yet, some have criticized the banking\nregulators for being hostile to innovation, at least when that innovation occurs within the\nregulated financial system. Regulators are continually learning about and adapting to new\ntechnologies, just as banks are, and regulators can play an important, complementary role,\nmaking the regulatory rules of the road clear and transparent to foster bank innovation.\nInnovation does pose challenges within the regulated banking system, which can be\namplified for community banks. Along with presenting new opportunities, innovation can\nintroduce new risks and create new vulnerabilities. Banks, and really, any business today that\n\n- 3 -\nadopts new technologies must be prepared to make corresponding improvements to manage\nthese risks and vulnerabilities, including improvements to risk management, cybersecurity, and\nconsumer compliance. Regulators must continue to promote efforts that are consistent with safe\nand sound banking practices and in compliance with applicable laws, including consumer\nprotection laws. As I am sure you appreciate, this is not always an easy task, and the regulatory\nresponse to innovation must reflect the changes in how banks engage in this process.\nIt is absolutely critical that innovation not distract banks and regulators from the\ntraditional risks that are omnipresent in the business of banking, particularly credit, liquidity,\nconcentration, and interest rate risk.3 These more traditional risks are present in all bank\nbusiness models but can be especially acute for banks engaging in novel activities or exposed to\nnew markets, including crypto-assets.4 Whatever the cause, many traditional risks can be\nmitigated with appropriate risk-management and liquidity planning practices, and effective\nsupervision, and without stifling the ability of banks to innovate.\nToday, I will address three issues related to innovation. First, I will briefly discuss how\nbank regulation and supervision can best support responsible innovation. Second, I will touch on\nthe unique challenges that apply to smaller and community banks pursuing innovation. Finally, I\nwill mention a few key actions that the federal banking regulators have taken to date, and how I\nthink about future regulatory and supervisory actions to support innovation. And before I\nconclude, I will also quickly touch on a few other issues that may be of interest to you.\n3 As part of our ongoing outreach and dialogue to community banks, I along with colleagues at the Federal Reserve\nBank of Kansas City conducted an “Ask the Fed” session this past December, discussing unrealized losses at\ncommunity banks in a rising rate environment. Ask the Fed, a Program of the Federal Reserve System, “A\nDiscussion of Unrealized Losses at Community Banks in a Rising Interest Rate Environment” (December 16, 2022).\n4 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency, “Joint Statement on Liquidity Risks to Banking Organizations Resulting from Crypto-\nAsset Market Vulnerabilities,” news release, February 23, 2023,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/bcreg20230223a1.pdf.\n\n- 4 -\nSupporting Responsible Innovation\nIn the past, I have spoken about the principles that I believe should guide bank regulation\nand supervision.5 I have noted the value of independence—tempered by public accountability—\nin the Fed’s role as a bank supervisor. I have also stressed the need for clear rules of engagement\nand predictability in the bank applications process. And I have emphasized that transparency of\nexpectations in rules and guidance are critical to a bank regulatory system that is fair and\nefficient. I think these principles are instructive when it comes to how regulators should address\ninnovation.\nAs both consumer needs and their preferences in accessing financial services change, so\ntoo must the banking industry. Banks of all sizes see new opportunities to develop enhanced and\ncustomized products for their customers, introduce faster payments, and improve efficiency.\nIf our goal is a banking system that leverages the many benefits of innovation, regulators\nneed to make deliberate choices about how we regulate and supervise. Further, we need to be\naware of and sensitive to the unintended consequences of our regulatory framework. The\nFederal Reserve and the other federal banking agencies have an important role to play in helping\nensure banks can innovate in a safe and sound manner, and that role includes transparency in\n5 See Michelle Bowman, “Welcoming Remarks” (speech at the Midwest Cyber Workshop, organized by the\nFederal Reserve Banks of Chicago, Kansas City, and St. Louis, February 15, 2023),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20230215a.htm; “Independence, Predictability, and\nTailoring in Banking Regulation and Supervision” (speech at the American Bankers Association Community\nBanking Conference, February 13, 2023),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20230213a.htm; “Brief Remarks on the Economy and\nBank Supervision” (speech at the Florida Bankers Association Leadership Luncheon Events, January 10, 2023),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20230110a.htm; “Large Bank Supervision and\nRegulation” (speech at the Institute of International Finance Event: In Conversation with Michelle Bowman,\nSeptember 30, 2022), https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20220930a.htm; “Technology,\nInnovation, and Financial Services” (speech at the VenCent Fintech Conference, August 17, 2022),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20220817a.htm; “My Perspective on Bank Regulation\nand Supervision” (speech at the Conference for Community Bankers sponsored by the American Bankers\nAssociation, February 16, 2021), https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20210216a.htm.\n\n- 5 -\nexpectations. And of course, we must ensure that regulation and supervision do not place\nunnecessary burdens on small banks. The vast majority of banks want to meet regulatory\nexpectations. By publishing clear guidance and developing tools to help assist these banks,\nregulators can improve regulatory transparency and facilitate compliance.\nTransparency is a tool that can serve the supervisory goal of promoting a safe, sound, and\nfair banking system, particularly when it comes to innovation. In exercising supervisory and\nregulatory authority, the federal banking agencies must be aware of not only the risks to the U.S.\nfinancial system, but also the harm that can be caused to U.S. consumers and businesses when\nwe don’t achieve sufficient clarity and transparency in our expectations and when our regulations\nare disproportionately burdensome to the risks they are intended to address. With innovation, the\nrisk is that a regulatory approach based on subjective, ad hoc judgments—as opposed to clear\nguidance and regulatory expectations—could cause new products and services to migrate to the\nshadow banking system. We have already seen a similar phenomenon in some markets, as with\nnonbank lending, which has proportionately increased when compared to bank lending in recent\nyears.\nA lack of transparency, and the corresponding limits on bank innovation, has adverse\nconsequences for consumers, businesses, and communities. Therefore, it should be a regulatory\npriority to ensure our approach continues to support innovation that is conducted in a safe and\nsound manner and is consistent with applicable laws, including consumer protection.\n\n- 6 -\nThe Innovation Challenges for Community Banks\nI think everyone here today recognizes the valuable role that small banks play in the U.S.\nfinancial system, and just as important, in the communities they serve.6 Small banks provide\ncredit and financial services to businesses and individuals through personalized services and\nrelationship banking. Small banks have a deep commitment to their communities and understand\ntheir unique customers, including how they may weather the ups and downs of economic cycles.\nIf we look at the financial health of small banks today, we see an industry that is well-\npositioned to support economic growth. Across a broad range of metrics, including capital,\nliquidity, earnings, credit quality, and loan growth, small banks have been performing well.\nBut small banks also face unique challenges, especially when it comes to innovation.\nSmall banks tend to have fewer resources to devote to these activities and fewer staff members\nwith the technological expertise to develop products in-house. Therefore, small banks tend to be\nmore reliant on third-party relationships to support innovation, including the critical relationship\nbetween small banks and their core service providers. However, third-party relationships can\nalso increase operational risk, data security and cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and create other\ncompliance issues. And of course, a bank’s use of third parties does not diminish its\nresponsibility with respect to the activities conducted by the third-party service provider.\nI think the principles I mentioned earlier can be particularly relevant when thinking about\nhow regulators can support small bank innovation. Transparency in expectations is important for\nthe smallest banks, who may view innovation as a strategic priority, but may lack the resources\nof larger peers to engage in innovation and third-party partnerships or cover costs of legal advice\n6 For purposes of these remarks, I will refer to regional banking organizations and community banking\norganizations as “small banks.”\n\n- 7 -\nto address ambiguous regulatory expectations. One way we can adopt a tailored approach is by\nproviding additional resources and tools for smaller institutions to assist with compliance.\nRegulators have already successfully developed compliance tools. These include the Board’s\nrecently developed tools to assist community banks estimate their losses under the Current\nExpected Credit Loss, or CECL, accounting standard. The federal banking agencies also\npublished a guide for community banks on conducting due diligence for financial technology\ncompanies.7\nI think these types of efforts are very important as we introduce new regulations and\nrequirements. Clear guidance and practical implementation tools can reduce the burden of\nregulation while also promoting compliance.\nThe Evolving Regulatory Response to Innovation\nInnovation allows banks to become more efficient and better meet customer demands.\nSo, while bank regulators do not want to hinder innovation, we also have a responsibility to\nensure that the banking industry adopts new technologies appropriately. To help balance these\ntwo goals, it is incumbent upon regulators to prioritize clear guidance to banks. Having clear\n(and public) regulatory expectations not only supports public accountability, but also gives banks\ngreater flexibility to innovate and experiment with new technologies.\nAcross a range of activities, both banks and regulators are working to make innovation\naccessible to all banks, with clear guidance and additional tools and resources to help small\nbanks. I’ll now turn to a few specific examples where regulators have been working to develop\ntransparency and clear expectations.\n7 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, FDIC, and OCC, “Conducting Due Diligence on Financial\nTechnology Companies: A Guide for Community Banks” (Washington: Board of Governors, FDIC, OCC, August\n2021), https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/conducting-due-diligence-on-financial-technology-firms-\n202108.pdf.\n\n- 8 -\nCrypto-asset activities\nMany bank customers have expressed interest in crypto-assets over the past several years,\nwith some banks exploring how they can meet this customer demand. There are a multitude of\ndesign and use cases for new and innovative technologies, such as distributed ledger technology\nand crypto-assets, which can pose unique challenges for regulators. The variability of these\nactivities complicates the development of clear regulatory expectations around safety and\nsoundness and risk management, and raises questions about legal permissibility. The lack of\nclear and timely regulatory guidance creates a real challenge for banks interested in exploring\nthese activities.\nCrypto-asset activities remain an important focus for the Federal Reserve and other bank\nregulators. While some banks continue to explore offering crypto-asset-related products and\nservices to their customers, the extreme volatility of these assets creates significant challenges\nfor banks. These assets also vary widely in terms of their structure, the markets for trading, and\nwhether they are backed by any assets. Until clear statutory and regulatory parameters exist to\ngovern these types of assets and the exchanges on which they are traded, I think some of the\nuncertainties about how the banking system can engage in crypto activities will remain unsettled.\nWhile there is more to do, there have been some helpful initial steps to provide clarity on\nregulatory expectations. First, the Board published guidance clarifying that all state member\nbanks should notify their lead supervisory point of contact prior to engaging in crypto-asset-\nrelated activities.8 The letter also clarified the broad requirements of a firm’s obligations,\nincluding the need to analyze the legal permissibility of the activities, and to develop adequate\n8 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “SR 22-6 Letter / CA 22-6 Letter: Engagement in Crypto-\nAsset-Related Activities by Federal Reserve-Supervised Banking Organizations,” August 16, 2022,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/srletters/SR2206.htm.\n\n- 9 -\nsystems, risk management, and controls to conduct these activities in a safe and sound manner\nand consistent with all applicable laws.\nMore recently, the bank regulators published additional guidance to highlight the risks of\ncrypto-asset-related activities. In January, the federal agencies released a statement highlighting\ncrypto-asset risks and recently issued a statement on liquidity risks resulting from crypto-asset\nmarket vulnerabilities.9 Federal Reserve staff continues to develop guidance on crypto-asset\nactivities, including on custody, trade facilitation, loans collateralized by crypto-assets, and the\nissuance and distribution of stablecoins. I think these are critical next steps to provide clarity\naround regulatory expectations.\nThird-party risk management\nThird-party relationships can provide smaller banks access to new products, services, and\ntechnology. The scope of these partnerships can be quite broad, including fintech companies,\npartners who use the bank’s “Banking as a Service” products, cloud service providers, and many\nothers. But third-party partnerships designed to bring innovation into a bank can also create risk-\nmanagement and due diligence challenges, particularly with respect to identifying the risks that a\nthird-party partner may pose and to managing these risks.\nFor small banks, these compliance problems can be amplified by a number of factors.\nSmall banks may have limited experience and in-house expertise conducting due diligence on\nthird-party partners like fintech companies. And small banks likely have limited leverage in\nnegotiating contracts and informational rights with third-party partners. Small banks may also\n9 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, FDIC, and OCC, “Joint Statement on Crypto-Asset Risks to\nBanking Organizations” (Washington: Board of Governors, FDIC, OCC, January 3, 2023),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/bcreg20230103a1.pdf; “Joint Statement on Liquidity\nRisks to Banking Organizations Resulting from Crypto-Asset Market Vulnerabilities,” February 23, 2023,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/bcreg20230223a1.pdf.\n\n- 10 -\nencounter friction with nonbank partners who fail to understand the bank’s ongoing\nresponsibilities to ensure that even outsourced activities are conducted in a safe and sound\nmanner and in compliance with consumer protection laws.\nThe Federal Reserve and other federal banking agencies can play an important role in\nhelping banks continue to innovate through third-party partnerships. Specifically, the agencies\nhave been working to develop joint guidance to clarify regulatory expectations around third-\nparty risk management, which will be an important step in supporting innovation built on third-\nparty partnerships.\nThis guidance could be particularly helpful for small banks. But clearer guidance and\nregulatory expectations will not fully address these challenges. Guidance alone cannot address\nthe challenges that a small bank faces in conducting due diligence on third parties and the\ndifficulty in negotiating a contract with larger nonbank service providers and partners.\nICBA has taken some important first steps in determining if there are opportunities to fill\nthese knowledge gaps by leveraging collective action to help with due diligence. In addition,\nsome interesting preliminary work has been done to consider whether a standards-setting\norganization, in the form of a public–private partnership, could expedite due diligence on third-\nparty fintech partners. A centralized, standards-setting organization could help develop\nminimum standards to ensure better consistency in the diligence banks apply to these\npartnerships. I see a great deal of promise in these efforts, and I support continued work to\ndevelop these mechanisms to help small banks innovate through third-party partnerships.\nAnother area in need of attention is in assisting small banks achieve similar treatment in their\ncontracts in comparison to larger nonbank service providers and partners.\n\n- 11 -\nAll banks should understand regulatory expectations with respect to due diligence, risk\nmanagement, and ongoing compliance when engaging in third-party relationships. Banking\nregulators can support this approach by providing clear expectations and the tools smaller banks\nmay need to help them meet these expectations. For example, in 2021 the Federal Reserve began\nproviding state member banks with supervisory reports on their third-party partners that are\nsubject to supervision under the Bank Service Company Act. These reports contain information\nthat may provide helpful insight in assessing the performance of bank service providers,\ndepending on the services used and the risk the services pose. As we are considering additional\nopportunities to provide resources in this space, your feedback and experience would be helpful\nto understand where we should focus our future efforts.\nBank service company oversight\nAnother area that complements third-party risk management is the agencies’ regulatory\nauthority over bank service companies. While banks who engage in partnerships with third\nparties continue to bear responsibility for due diligence and compliance, we should also consider\nwhether the bank itself, or the third-party service provider, is best positioned to address risks.\nThe regulatory burden of third-party relationships falls heavily on banks (particularly\nsmall banks), and sometimes bleeds over to their core service providers, because the core service\nproviders often make the technical changes to core systems to enable integration with innovative\nnew products and services. Core service providers are already subject to activities-based\nsupervision under the Bank Service Company Act. But with the expansion of third-party\nrelationships, it is worth considering whether this allocation of responsibility remains sound, or\nwhether additional parties—like fintechs and other technology companies—should be subject to\ncloser scrutiny for the products and services they provide to banks. If third parties provide\n\n- 12 -\nproducts and services to bank customers, it also may be appropriate for these providers to bear\ngreater responsibility for their own products and services, including to ensure that they are\nprovided in a safe and sound manner and in compliance with financial and consumer laws and\nregulations.\nCybersecurity\nWe do not often talk about cybersecurity in the context of innovation, but improving\ncybersecurity can complement innovation. When a bank is planning to develop new technology\nor pursue innovation, those new activities often bring new risks. As you know, bankers often\nrefer to cybersecurity as one of the top risks facing the banking industry, and the Federal Reserve\nhas issued guidance and examination procedures on a range of cybersecurity issues to help banks\nprepare for cyber events when they occur.\nCyber threats constantly evolve, and banks’ cybersecurity efforts must be dynamic in\nresponse. Banks must respond to emerging threats by adapting risk-management practices,\nengaging with regulators and law enforcement when an attack occurs, and participating in\ntraining and exercises to ensure cyber preparedness. As I have noted in the past, the Federal\nReserve continues to work closely with banks to support these efforts.10\nOther Important Trends\nAlthough I won’t be able to take questions today, I would like to address a few other\nissues that may be of interest to this group related to bank regulation and supervision.\nCommunity Reinvestment Act reform. As you all know, last May, the federal banking\nagencies issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would amend the Community\n10 See Michelle W. Bowman, “Welcoming Remarks” (speech at the Midwest Cyber Workshop, organized by the\nFederal Reserve Banks of Chicago, Kansas City, and St. Louis, February 15, 2023),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20230215a.htm.\n\n- 13 -\nReinvestment Act. The agencies received extensive comments on the proposal, including\ncomments describing the costs and benefits of the proposal and how it would impact banks.\nChair Powell noted last week that there is essentially agreement among the three agencies.\nWhile we are hard at work, it is expected that it will take some months to complete.\nI am continuing to review and understand this proposal and the costs it will impose.\nFrom my perspective, it will be important to consider how the costs imposed by any final rule\ncompare to the benefits of the rule, not just in the aggregate, but for institutions of different sizes\nand engaged in different banking activities.\nClimate risk management and regulation. Climate risk-management and regulation\nefforts include the recent launch of a climate scenario exercise for the largest firms and a climate\nguidance proposal for a broader range of large firms. The Federal Reserve’s role in this space is\nvery limited and generally is confined to ensuring banks operate in a safe and sound manner,\nrelying on appropriate risk management.\nWith respect to climate change risks, it is important to think carefully about the costs and\nbenefits of any guidance and the scope such guidance may include. As proposed, the climate\nrisk-management guidance would apply only to the largest firms. Of course, all banks below this\nthreshold, including small banks, would remain subject to robust risk-management expectations,\nwhich includes managing all material risks. In many instances, these expectations may require\nbanks to manage a range of related risks, especially from extreme weather and natural disasters.\nCapital. As you know, the banking agencies are currently engaged in a holistic bank\ncapital standards review and are working to implement the Basel III “endgame” reforms. With\nrespect to the Basel III capital reforms, the agencies recently reaffirmed their commitment to\nimplement these standards to strengthen the resilience of the U.S. financial system. As I think\n\n- 14 -\nyou all know, there are no plans to propose changes to the community bank capital framework as\npart of this capital review. It remains to be seen how broad the proposal will be, and for the\nlarger firms, which firms will be affected.\nBank merger policy. There are significant consequences for firms when applications are\nnot acted on in a timely manner, including increased operational risk, the additional expense\nassociated with running two institutions in parallel over a longer period, employee retention\nissues, and perceived reputational risk. In my mind, this is an area that we need to improve;\ndelays in the processing of applications are not exclusively an issue for large banks.\nSmall banks are also subject to timing issues when engaged in bank merger transactions.\nIn fact, small banks that operate in more rural areas with few competitors who try to merge with\nother local banks can raise competitive concerns under the Federal Reserve’s traditional merger\nstandards. As I’ve previously noted, one way to improve the timing of small bank merger\ntransactions is by considering all competitors when evaluating the competitive effects of\nmergers.11 In many rural markets, credit unions, farm credit system institutions, banks without a\nbranch presence, and nonbank lenders can all be significant competitors in different product\nmarkets. In some cases, these smaller banks face greater issues in pursuing merger transactions\nthan larger banks that operate in dense urban centers with many bank competitors. For all banks\nengaged in merger transactions, delays should be the exception, not the rule.\nEfforts to support minority depository institutions. Minority depository institutions, or\nMDIs, play an important role in our financial system. MDIs often provide credit and financial\nservices to low and moderate income and minority communities. The Federal Reserve is\n11 See Michelle W. Bowman, “The New Landscape for Banking Competition” (speech at the 2022 Community\nBanking Research Conference, sponsored by the Federal Reserve, the Conference of State Bank Supervisors, and\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, St. Louis, Missouri, September 28, 2022),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20220928a.htm.\n\n- 15 -\ncommitted to preserving minority ownership of depository institutions, and providing technical\nassistance to MDIs, through the Fed’s Partnership for Progress program. Federal Reserve staff\nfrequently meets with MDI management teams to discuss emerging issues, provide technical\nassistance, explain supervisory guidance, and respond to management concerns. This\nengagement not only furthers our efforts to support these banks, but also provides valuable\ninsight and feedback on the challenges facing MDIs. It is also an opportunity to gather feedback\non regulatory proposals.\nOverdraft fees. Banks often provide limited overdraft protection to customers and\nhistorically have charged a fee for this service. Recently, as you know, this practice has come\nunder some regulatory scrutiny. For example, many banks have taken a close look at their\npractices to ensure that they are subject to appropriate disclosures and are operated in a way that\nis fair to consumers.\nThe Federal Reserve’s approach in evaluating overdraft practices has been to prioritize\ncompliance through the review of these practices, ongoing engagement with bank management,\nand most importantly, transparency in our regulatory expectations. Regulatory expectations\nshould never come as a surprise to regulated institutions, and our examiners find that\ntransparency is an effective tool to promote compliance.\nI would like to address one specific overdraft practice that has been the focus of recent\nattention—authorize positive, settle negative (or APSN) transactions. These transactions occur\nwhen a bank authorizes a consumer’s point-of-sale transaction based on sufficient funds in the\nconsumer’s account, but at the time the transaction posts, the consumer’s account has insufficient\nfunds. In some cases, the institution imposes an overdraft fee on the consumer when this occurs.\n\n- 16 -\nOver the past decade, the Federal Reserve has focused on this issue as part of our\nsupervisory activities. For example, in July 2018, we published an article in the Consumer\nCompliance Supervision Bulletin that explained our concerns that charging consumers overdraft\nfees based on APSN can constitute an unfair practice.12\nAt the same time, we recognize that some of this risk is driven by system limitations of\nthe core service providers, which can pose a real challenge to community banks confronting this\nissue in their own transaction processing operations. In some cases, core service providers need\nto implement changes to their systems to allow banks to avoid charging these fees. While this\nissue is a narrow one in the context of broader discussions about overdraft fees, it is important.\nWe encourage banks to continue working with their service providers to implement fixes to\nsystem-based issues, and we encourage service providers to support their bank clients in\nproviding compliant products.\nConclusion\nInnovation has long been a high priority for banks, and I expect it will continue to be a\nkey issue for the future. New technologies have created significant opportunities for banks to\nbecome more efficient and competitive and to provide improved products and services for\ncustomers. While innovation brings new opportunities, it also introduces additional risks.\nBut a transparent regulatory posture for these activities can help banks of all sizes\nembrace new technologies, to the benefit of their customers and the broader economy. The\nspecific innovations I mentioned today only scratch the surface of the technologies and\ninnovations that banks are exploring, which also include the use of artificial intelligence and\nmachine learning; efforts to develop faster payments, clearing, and settlement technologies; and\n12 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Consumer Compliance Supervision Bulletin, (July 2018),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/201807-consumer-compliance-supervision-bulletin.pdf.\n\n- 17 -\nmany others. For all areas of innovation that banks are interested in pursuing, regulators should\ncontinue to prioritize timely, clear, and transparent guidance.\nI would like to again thank the ICBA for the invitation to speak to you today, and also to\nrecognize the incredible commitment and efforts of the bankers in this room and beyond in\nsupport of their communities and the ongoing strength of the U.S. economy.",

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nPolicy Exchange\nLondon, England\nJune 25, 2024\n\nI would like to thank Policy Exchange for the invitation to speak with you today.1\nEngagement abroad is essential for gaining a better understanding of the common forces\nshaping the global economy and financial system. It also promotes a better\nunderstanding of the drivers of differences between the economic and financial\nenvironments across countries and jurisdictions. My remarks will offer some\nperspectives on recent developments in monetary policy and bank regulatory policy—\nspecifically, bank capital reform—in the U.S. These are two areas in which I am actively\nengaged as a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\nMonetary Policy\nI’ll begin with monetary policy. The Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC)—the monetary policymaking body of the Federal Reserve System—has been\nkeenly focused on restoring price stability following the surge in inflation during 2021\nand in 2022 in the aftermath of the global COVID-19 pandemic. During this time,\ninflation reached levels not seen in the U.S. since the 1970s and 1980s. The high\ninflation experienced in the U.S. in the wake of the pandemic was also experienced in\nmany economies around the world, reflecting, in part, the common global nature of the\nshocks that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn many economies during the pandemic, supply constraints related to social-\ndistancing measures, reduced labor supply, and supply chain disruptions, coupled with\nstrong demand for goods as economies emerged from pandemic restrictions, acted as\ncatalysts, pushing inflation up to very high levels. Aggregate demand was also supported\nby accommodative monetary and fiscal policies, which served to bolster the balance\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee or the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n- 2 -\nsheets of households, businesses, and local governments, and contributed to very tight\nlabor markets.\nThe global inflation experience since the pandemic was highly synchronized\nacross the major world economies, reflecting similar shocks that acted to reduce supply,\nwhile fiscal and monetary policy interventions stimulated demand. Early in the\npandemic, many economic sectors, especially in services, were affected by lockdowns\nand both mandatory and voluntary social distancing. Many workers also transitioned to\nworking remotely. Aggressive fiscal policies helped support personal and business\nincome, and monetary policy became highly accommodative. The large shift in the\ncomposition of demand toward goods resulted in rising supply bottlenecks and higher\ngoods prices.\nReduced immigration and lower labor force participation led to very tight labor\nmarkets as the economy reopened and demand recovered. Consumer spending was\nsupported by excess savings accumulated from extraordinary fiscal support and reduced\nspending during lockdowns. Wage growth and services price inflation also picked up and\nhave remained persistently elevated, reflecting a tight labor market and the protracted\nadjustment of prices and wages to the shocks during the pandemic.\nA sharp rise in food and energy price inflation, and their pass-through to core\ninflation, also contributed to a more synchronous inflation dynamic across major\nadvanced foreign economies in recent years. Food and energy prices are mostly set in\nglobal markets, and their sharp increases also reflected the effects of Russia’s invasion of\nUkraine in early 2022, especially for major European economies including the U.K.\n\n- 3 -\nMany central banks facing these dynamics tightened monetary policy in an effort\nto better balance demand and supply and to bring inflation back down to target. In the\nU.S., by late 2021, it became clear that the FOMC’s monetary policy stance was too\naccommodative in the presence of growing inflationary pressures, due to broader and\nmore persistent supply constraints, and that the Committee needed to move toward a\ntighter policy. It seems likely to me that the U.S. experience during the years leading up\nto the pandemic, when inflation was persistently low, made it hard for many to foresee\nhow quickly that situation could change. Additionally, the domestic inflation and labor\ndata did not accurately reflect the economic conditions prevailing at the time and were\nsubsequently substantially revised.2\nIn my view, these factors, combined with new forward guidance introduced in the\nSeptember and December 2020 FOMC statements following the revisions to the\nCommittee’s monetary policy strategy consensus statement in August 2020, contributed\nto a delay in the removal of monetary policy accommodation in 2021.3,4 In late 2021, the\n2 For example, both the August and September 2021 employment reports suggested much lower job growth\nthan did consensus forecasts, and these initial estimates were subsequently sizably increased. Similarly,\ntotal personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation for nearly all quarters in 2021 has been revised\nhigher than initially reported. See the real-time data on the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis’s ALFRED\nwebsite at https://alfred.stlouisfed.org/series/downloaddata?seid=PAYEMS (job growth) and\nhttps://alfred.stlouisfed.org/series/downloaddata?seid=PCECTPI (PCE inflation).\n3 See Michelle W. Bowman (2024), “Risks and Uncertainty in Monetary Policy: Current and Past\nConsiderations,” speech delivered at “Frameworks for Monetary Policy, Regulation, and Bank Capital”\nSpring 2024 Meeting of the Shadow Open Market Committee, hosted by the Manhattan Institute, New\nYork, New York, April 5, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240405a.htm.\n4 The new forward guidance in the September 2020 FOMC statement emphasized that the federal funds rate\nwould remain near zero until “inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed\n2 percent for some time” (paragraph 4) and “labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with\nthe Committee’s assessments of maximum employment” (paragraph 4). In the December 2020 FOMC\nstatement, the FOMC added forward guidance regarding asset purchases that stated that the Federal\nReserve would continue to purchase Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities at the then current\npace of $80 billion and $40 billion per month, respectively, “until substantial further progress has been\nmade toward the Committee’s maximum employment and price stability goals” (paragraph 4). (The\nSeptember and December 2020 FOMC statements are available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.) The September and December 2020\n\n- 4 -\nFOMC did begin to move toward tightening the stance of monetary policy and, beginning\nin 2022, increased the policy rate rapidly to bring monetary policy into restrictive\nterritory. Since March 2022, the FOMC has raised the target range of the federal funds\nrate by 5-1/4 percentage points. The target range has remained at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent\nsince July 2023. Since June 2022, the Federal Reserve has also been reducing its\nsecurities holdings, which had increased substantially during the pandemic period.\nThe tightening in monetary policy has had an effect. Over 2023, we saw\nsignificant progress on lowering inflation in the U.S. while the economy and labor market\nhave remained strong. The 12-month change in core personal consumption expenditures\n(PCE) prices slowed to 2.9 percent in December 2023, nearly 2 percentage points less\nthan one year earlier. The restrictive stance of monetary policy reduced demand-side\ninflation pressures. Rising interest rates continued to act as a drag on growth of\nresidential and business investment, outside of an increase in construction of new electric\nvehicle battery and microprocessor factories. Labor demand also moderated, contributing\nto some loosening of labor market tightness. The job openings and quits rates fell and\npayroll employment gains slowed significantly throughout last year.5\nSome of the progress on inflation last year also reflected favorable supply-side\ndevelopments, including the resolution of supply chain disruptions and increased labor\nforward guidance followed the August 2020 revisions to the FOMC’s Statement on Longer-Run Goals and\nMonetary Policy Strategy, which are described on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/guide-to-changes-in-statement-on-longer-run-goals-\nmonetary-policy-strategy.htm.\n5 The Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) report for the fourth quarter of 2023 suggests\nthat the slowdown in payroll employment gains was likely more pronounced than currently reported by the\nCurrent Employment Statistics (CES) establishment survey. The Q4 QCEW administrative data show\nemployment gains that are about 110,000 per month lower than what the CES survey reported from March\n2023 to December 2023. Although the BLS benchmarks CES payroll employment based on the\nQ1 QCEW, to be released on August 21, the Q4 QCEW data point to a substantial downward revision to\nCES employment gains last year.\n\n- 5 -\nsupply—both from higher immigration and higher labor force participation of prime-age\nworkers—as well as lower energy prices.\nSince the beginning of 2024, however, we have seen only modest further progress\non inflation. The 12-month measures of total and core PCE inflation have moved\nroughly sideways or slightly down since December and remained elevated at 2.7 percent\nand 2.8 percent, respectively, in April. The consumer price index (CPI) report for May\nshowed 12-month core CPI inflation slowing to 3.4 percent from 3.6 percent in April.\nHowever, with average core CPI inflation this year through May running at an annualized\nrate of 3.8 percent, notably above average inflation in the second half of last year, I\nexpect inflation to remain elevated for some time.\nRecent data suggest some moderation in economic activity early this year. First-\nquarter gross domestic product growth was slower than in the second half of last year,\nthough private domestic final purchases continued to rise at a solid pace. Continued\nsoftness in consumer spending and weaker housing activity early in the second quarter\nalso suggest less momentum in economic activity so far this year.\nPayroll employment continued to rise at a solid pace in April and May, though\nslightly slower than in the first quarter, partly reflecting increased immigrant labor\nsupply. Despite some further rebalancing between supply and demand, the labor market\nremains tight. The unemployment rate edged up to 4.0 percent in May, while the number\nof job openings relative to unemployed workers declined further to near its pre-pandemic\nlevel. Labor force participation dropped back to 62.5 percent in May, which suggests no\nfurther improvement in labor supply along this margin, as labor force participation\namong those aged 55 or older has been persistently low.\n\n- 6 -\nIn contrast to the past two years, it is possible over the coming months that the\npath of monetary policy in the U.S. will diverge from that of other advanced economies,\nincluding the U.K., as the underlying economic developments and outlooks across\njurisdictions exhibit greater heterogeneity. Inflation and labor market developments in\nthe U.S. have unfolded differently in recent quarters compared to many other advanced\neconomies, likely reflecting a more open immigration policy and significantly larger\ndiscretionary fiscal stimulus since the pandemic.\nEconomic activity in the U.S. has recovered considerably more than in other\nadvanced foreign economies, including in the U.K. This likely reflects higher levels of\nfiscal support and productivity growth in the U.S. compared to other major economies.6\nA more flexible labor market in the U.S. likely allowed for greater movement of workers\nacross sectors following the COVID-19 shock, with higher unemployment in the early\nstages of the pandemic followed by stronger job creation during the recovery.\nA rebound in new business formation in the U.S. also likely enhanced\nproductivity growth in recent years. With economic activity remaining weaker in other\nadvanced foreign economies than in the U.S. and given differing economic and inflation\noutlooks in their own jurisdictions, central banks in these economies may ease monetary\npolicy sooner or more quickly than in the U.S.\nInflation in the U.S. remains elevated, and I still see a number of upside inflation\nrisks that affect my outlook. First, it is unlikely that further supply-side improvements\nwill continue to lower inflation going forward, as supply chains have largely normalized,\n6 See Francois de Soyres, Joaquin Garcia-Cabo Herrero, Nils Goernemann, Sharon Jeon, Grace Lofstrom,\nand Dylan Moore (2024), “Why Is the U.S. GDP Recovering Faster Than Other Advanced Economies?”\nFEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, May 17),\nhttps://doi.org/10.17016/2380-7172.3495.\n\n- 7 -\nthe labor force participation rate has leveled off in recent months below pre-pandemic\nlevels, and an open U.S. immigration policy that added millions of new immigrants in the\nU.S. over the past few years may become more restrictive.\nGeopolitical developments could also pose upside risks to inflation, including the\nrisk that spillovers from regional conflicts could disrupt global supply chains, putting\nadditional upward pressure on food, energy, and commodity prices. There is also the risk\nthat the loosening in financial conditions since last year, reflecting considerable gains in\nequity valuations, and additional fiscal stimulus could add momentum to demand, stalling\nany further progress or even causing inflation to reaccelerate.\nFinally, there is a risk that increased immigration and continued labor market\ntightness could lead to persistently high core services inflation. Given the current low\ninventory of affordable housing, the inflow of new immigrants to some geographic areas\ncould result in upward pressure on rents, as additional housing supply may take time to\nmaterialize. With labor markets remaining tight, wage growth has been elevated at\naround or above 4 percent, still higher than the pace consistent with our 2 percent\ninflation goal given trend productivity growth.\nIn the U.S., the FOMC pursues monetary policy in support of price stability and\nmaximum employment. These goals mandated to the Federal Reserve by the U.S.\nCongress are focused on domestic economic conditions. However, international\neconomic and financial developments can influence U.S. monetary policy to the extent\nthat these developments affect the economic outlook for the U.S. For example, weaker\nforeign activity and an appreciation of the dollar driven by easier monetary policy abroad\nwould both reduce foreign demand for U.S. exports and lower the outlook for economic\n\n- 8 -\ngrowth in the U.S. Likewise, geopolitical developments or trade restrictions could affect\nthe outlook for the prices of energy, food, and goods.\nLooking ahead, I will be closely watching the incoming data as I assess whether\nmonetary policy in the U.S. is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to our\n2 percent goal over time. The extent and frequency of revisions to U.S. economic data\nsince the pandemic have made the task of assessing the current state of the economy and\nthe outlook even more challenging. My baseline outlook continues to be that U.S.\ninflation will return to the FOMC’s 2 percent goal, with the target range of the federal\nfunds rate held at its current level of 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent for some time. Should the\nincoming data indicate that inflation is moving sustainably toward our 2 percent goal, it\nwill eventually become appropriate to gradually lower the federal funds rate to prevent\nmonetary policy from becoming overly restrictive.\nHowever, we are still not yet at the point where it is appropriate to lower the\npolicy rate. In my view, we should consider a range of possible scenarios that could\nunfold when considering how the FOMC’s monetary policy decisions may evolve. I\nremain willing to raise the target range for the federal funds rate at a future meeting\nshould progress on inflation stall or even reverse. Given the risks and uncertainties\nregarding my economic outlook, I will remain cautious in my approach to considering\nfuture changes in the stance of policy. Reducing our policy rate too soon or too quickly\ncould result in a rebound in inflation, requiring further future policy rate increases to\nreturn inflation to 2 percent over the longer run.\n\n- 9 -\nBank Capital Reform\nI will now briefly touch on bank capital reforms, which are particularly important\nwhen it comes to our global and interconnected banking and financial systems. The U.S.\nhas lagged its EU and U.K. counterparts in fully implementing the Basel III capital\nstandards. In July 2023, the U.S. federal banking agencies issued a public consultation\non implementing what we call the Basel III “endgame” capital reforms.7\nThe U.S. proposal was notable for a number of reasons, but I would highlight two\nin particular. First, the U.S. proposal would significantly expand the scope of application\nand calibration of these capital requirements. And, second, this proposal went beyond the\nBasel framework in several areas, undermining the goal of increasing consistency in\ncapital standards across jurisdictions and potentially creating competitive concerns. The\nresponse to the U.S. capital proposal was overwhelmingly negative from a broad range of\ncommenters.\nCalibration and scope\nA key consideration in evaluating reform efforts is whether the benefits of a\nchange outweigh the costs, both for the financial institutions subject to these reforms and\nfor the broader economy. The benefits of reform, like Basel III, are clear—on a basic\nlevel, higher capital can make the banking system safer. At a minimum, this increased\nsafety comes at a cost; in its more extreme forms, it can actually increase financial\nstability risks.\n7 See Governor Bowman’s dissenting statement on the proposed rule to implement the Basel III endgame\nagreement for large banks; Michelle W. Bowman (2023), “Statement by Governor Michelle W. Bowman,”\npress release, July 27, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bowman-statement-\n20230727.htm.\n\n- 10 -\nThe Basel III proposal in the U.S. is complex and, if it were to apply today as\nproposed, could have very significant, detrimental impacts. Federal Reserve staff\nestimated that the proposed changes would result in an aggregate 20 percent increase in\ntotal risk-weighted assets across bank holding companies subject to the rule, with some\ncommenters projecting much greater effects.8 And, instead of these standards applying\nonly to large, internationally active banks, the U.S. proposal would “push down” these\nstandards to a much broader range of domestic institutions.\nA change of this significance could impact U.S. market liquidity and lending as\nwell as force firms that lack sufficient economies of scale to stop providing certain\nproducts and services. Capital increases of this scale could reduce the cost and\navailability of credit, particularly for certain types of loans, and could disproportionately\nharm underserved markets, businesses, and communities. In my view, the proposal\ninsufficiently considered these direct costs. These are costs that would ultimately be\nimposed on bank customers.\nOf course, the evaluation of reforms should not end at their direct costs. Many of\nthe costs are indirect or unintended and may be substantial, creating further concerns,\nincluding risks to financial stability. These reforms could create an exodus of activities\nand products from the banking system due to the indirect costs and unintended\nconsequences.\n8 See, for example, Financial Services Forum, American Bankers Association, Bank Policy Institute, and\nSecurities Industry and Financial Markets Association (2023), “Comments on Regulatory Capital Rule:\nLarge Banking Organizations and Banking Organizations with Significant Trading Activity,” December 22,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/SECRS/2023/December/20231229/R-1813/R-\n1813_122223_156400_337982526593_1.pdf (noting that for the largest U.S. firms, the proposal would\nresult in a greater than 30 percent increase in capital requirements, and a greater than 33 percent increase in\nrisk-weighted assets).\n\n- 11 -\nOver time, activity tends to migrate to where it can be conducted efficiently and at\nthe least cost. Capital requirements can play a significant role in determining where and\nby whom an activity is conducted. Banks are often best positioned to provide financial\nproducts and services due to their expertise and experience as well as their requirement to\noperate safely and soundly. When the over-calibration of regulatory costs becomes too\nsignificant, activities often migrate out of banks and into the nonbank financial system,\npotentially leading to greater systemic risks.\nUp until this point, I have focused primarily on the “cost” side of the analysis, and\nI think it is fair to characterize the direct and indirect costs of the proposed Basel III rule\nas substantial. But we must also measure these costs against the benefits such capital\nincreases could provide.\nAs a starting point for this analysis, we must evaluate the current state of the\nbanking system. In the U.S., given the increase in capital following the 2008 financial\ncrisis, I do not see undercapitalization of large banks as a current vulnerability. While\nsome have argued that large capital increases should be part of the regulatory response\nfollowing the 2023 U.S. banking stress, I think this argument lacks a solid foundation.\nFirst, as we know, the Basel reforms were being developed long before last year’s\nbanking stress. The U.S. proposal included regulatory changes that had previously been\nconsidered and rejected as part of the Basel III implementation—specifically, a\nsignificant accounting change regarding the treatment of unrealized losses on securities\nportfolios.9 While revisiting this one element of Basel III has been used to try tying the\n9 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency\n(2013), “Regulatory Capital Rules: Regulatory Capital, Implementation of Basel III, Capital Adequacy,\nTransition Provisions, Prompt Corrective Action, Standardized Approach for Risk-weighted Assets, Market\n\n- 12 -\nrulemaking initiative to the regulatory response to the bank failures last spring, the\nmajority of the proposed changes are unrelated to last spring’s banking stress.\nSecond, linking this rulemaking to the banking stress implies that the causes of\nindividual bank failures in the spring of 2023 were in some way a signal of broader\nbanking system weakness, which could best be addressed by significant capital increases.\nThis argument seems to rely on the philosophy that more capital makes stronger\nbanks, regardless of costs and tradeoffs, or possible more efficient approaches. Linking\nthe proposed capital increases to the bank failures in the spring of 2023 should not be\nused as a pretext to avoid the challenges of identifying and evaluating the tradeoffs\ninvolved with setting capital requirements, nor should it excuse regulators from taking a\nhard look at the root causes of the bank failures with the goal of identifying more targeted\nsolutions than across-the-board capital increases.\nIn the case of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), both bank management and supervisors\nfailed to appreciate, appropriately identify, and mitigate the known, significant, and\nidiosyncratic risks of a business model that relied on a highly concentrated, uninsured\nbase of depositors. They also overlooked the buildup of interest rate risk without\nappropriate risk management. These management failures arguably support an honest\nand critical look at how supervision was conducted in the lead-up to the firm’s failure.\nAnd it would then be appropriate to propose changes to remediate those deficiencies. But\nthe failures did not suggest either that “capital” was the major problem contributing to\nSVB’s failure or that undercapitalization was a broader problem in the banking system.\nDiscipline and Disclosure Requirements, Advanced Approaches Risk-Based Capital Rule, and Market Risk\nCapital Rule,” final rule, Federal Register, vol. 78 (October 11), pp. 62018–291.\n\n- 13 -\nBasel III capital reforms and international consistency\nBefore discussing the path ahead, I will also address one of the factors that should\nbe a focus for regulatory reforms that may resonate in this forum: the issue of\ninternational comparability and competitive disadvantages. One of the primary purposes\nof the Basel capital standards is to promote minimum standards across jurisdictions that\nnot only improve competitive equity in banking markets, but also result in making the\nfinancial system safer.\nWhile I have expressed some skepticism of the U.S. Basel III proposal, I see\nvalue in engaging in ongoing discussions about international coordination through\nmultilateral organizations like the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. Some\ndegree of consistency in international banking and financial markets can be helpful in\nfostering a cross-border level playing field for internationally active banking\norganizations while establishing minimum standards that can help mitigate global\nfinancial stability risks.\nIn internationally active banking and financial markets, there are often “choices”\nabout where activity can be conducted. Financial products and services are offered\naround the world in different markets, and there is often some degree of flexibility as to\nhow a customer can access a product or service. This competitive “choice” aspect of\ninternational banking and financial markets can itself create downward pressure on\nregulatory standards and create opportunities for forum shopping.\nIn the absence of some degree of international coordination, there is a risk of\ncreating a regulatory “race to the bottom,” as regulators compete to grow their banking\nand financial systems by lowering regulatory and supervisory standards below levels that\n\n- 14 -\nare appropriate based on risk. But this desire for greater international consistency can be\nequally frustrated when U.S. regulators excessively calibrate requirements. As I\npreviously noted, the U.S. proposal was calibrated at a level well in excess of other\ninternational jurisdictions as well as without sufficient analytical support and evidence\nthat the proposed increases were proportionate to risk.\nThis is not only a problem for international competitive equity, but also a concern\nfor global financial stability. Significant banking activities occur in the international and\ncross-border context, and we know that financial stability risks can spread throughout\nglobal financial markets. The U.S. Basel proposal reflects elements of the agreed-upon\nstandards, but it far exceeds them. Adjusting the calibration could have the important\nsecondary benefit of enhancing this international consistency.\nThe path forward\nNotwithstanding what has brought us to this point, I do see a path forward to\nimplement Basel III, one that addresses not only the overall calibration as well as\ninternational consistency and comparability, but also makes more granular changes that\nwill improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the rule.\nIn October 2023, the Federal Reserve launched a data collection to gather\ninformation from the banks affected by the U.S. proposal. I am hopeful that this data will\nallow regulators to better understand the impact of the proposal and to identify areas for\nrevision. Any next step in this rulemaking process will require broad and material\nchanges. It should also be accompanied by a data-driven analysis of the proposal and\ninformed by the significant public input received during the rulemaking process. This\nshould assist policymakers in creating a path to improve the rulemaking. My hope is that\n\n- 15 -\npolicymakers pay closer attention to the balance of costs and benefits and consider the\ndirect and indirect consequences of the capital reform.\nI have previously identified a number of specific areas and procedural steps that\nwould be necessary to address in any future efforts to revise this proposal. Some of these\nissues include\n• addressing redundancy in the capital framework (for example, between the new\nmarket risk and operational risk requirements, and the stress capital buffer)\n• recalibrating the market risk rule specifically, where some of the biggest outlier\nincreases in risk-weighted assets would appear (for example, these revisions alone\nwill increase risk-weighted assets from $430 billion to $760 billion for Category I\nand II firms, and from $130 billion to $220 billion for Category III and IV firms)\n• adopting a more reasonable treatment for non-interest and fee-based income\nthrough the operational risk requirements, which could deter banks from\ndiversifying revenue streams, even though such diversification can enhance an\ninstitution’s stability and resilience\n• reviewing the impact of capital requirements, including leverage ratio\nrequirements, on U.S. Treasury market intermediation and liquidity\n• incorporating tailoring in the applicability of Basel III capital reforms, specifically\nlooking at whether each element of the Basel III capital proposal is appropriate\nfor non-G-SIB firms that are not internationally active\n\n- 16 -\n• re-proposing the Basel III standards to address the broad and material reforms that\nI believe should be included in any final rule, including granular changes to\naddress the specific issues raised by commenters, as appropriate.10\nWhile these steps would be a reasonable starting place, they are not a replacement for a\ndata-driven analysis and a careful review of the comments submitted. This would result\nin a better proposal that includes changes to address not only these concerns, but also\nmany other concerns raised by the public.\nClosing Thoughts\nI would like to thank you again for the opportunity to speak with you today. My\nexperience over the past five and a half years at the Federal Reserve highlights the\nenduring challenge of setting monetary policy amid a wide and evolving range of risks\nand uncertainties in the global economy. An important question I will be considering is\nhow to make monetary policy durable to a wide range of possible shocks and changes in\nthe macroeconomy, such as those experienced globally during the pandemic.\nWe will continue to learn about the post-pandemic global economy, and, if history\nis any guide, new shocks to and changes in the economy will eventually and inevitably\noccur. While the economic outlook is uncertain, the FOMC’s mandate of fostering price\nstability and maximum employment in the U.S. remains very clear. Restoring price\nstability is essential for achieving maximum employment over the longer run.\n10 See Bowman, “Statement by Governor Michelle W. Bowman,” in note 7; Michelle W. Bowman (2023),\n“Remarks on the Economy and Prioritization of Bank Supervision and Regulation,” speech delivered at the\nNew York Bankers Association’s Financial Services Forum, Palm Beach, Florida, November 9,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20231109a.pdf; Michelle W.

Bank capital policy is an\nimportant measure to control these risks, but we know that capital is only one of many\ntools in our supervisory arsenal. And it is insufficient without the complement of other\nregulatory tools.\nSo, as we continue the process of considering regulatory reform, I hope that we\napproach every issue with a broader lens, focusing on data-driven identification of the\nproblems we are trying to solve, and with an openness to solving these problems in a\nmore targeted and efficient way.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n3:45 p.m. EDT\nOctober 9, 2025\nCommunity Banking: Looking Toward the Future\nRemarks by\nMichelle W. Bowman\nVice Chair for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe Community Bank Conference\nHosted by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nWashington, D.C.\nOctober 9, 2025\n\nAs we wrap up today’s conference, I would like to thank all of the moderators and\npresenters on today’s panels. And of course, Secretary Bessent for sharing his perspectives on\ncommunity banks, and the many community bankers, and state bank regulators and others who\nattended today’s event in person or virtually. I would also like to recognize our staff whose hard\nwork made today’s conference possible.\nCommunity banks drive local and regional economic growth, and they play a central role\nin the financial health of the customers and communities they serve.1 These banks often pursue\nunique business models—ones that are not easily replicated by larger banks, including the\nrelationship banking model that is a central tenet of community banking. In today’s\nenvironment, many community banks are embracing innovation and continuing to evolve to\nbetter serve their customers in the current and future financial system. The focus of today’s\nconference has been on community banks, how they continue to innovate, and how they rise to\nthe challenge to support their customers as the financial landscape continues to change.\nLegislators and regulators are also rising to the challenge to ensure that the community\nbanking system continues to thrive, through the critical task of ensuring that supervision and\nregulation are appropriately tailored. Our support for community banks cannot just be lip\nservice; it must translate into specific actions that right-size regulation and apply appropriate\nsupervisory standards, specifically in identifying the appropriate definition of a community bank,\nin establishing appropriately tailored regulatory thresholds, and in approaching supervision\nfocused on material financial risk.\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nSo, what is a community bank for this purpose? Generally, the regulatory framework\nuses the blunt tool of fixed asset thresholds. We know that relying solely on fixed asset\nthresholds is imperfect, at best. They fail to account for economic growth and inflation over\ntime, resulting in firms with stable growth, consistent business models, and no change in risk\nprofile crossing asset thresholds. These firms become subject to increasingly complex and\nburdensome regulatory requirements and supervisory expectations. This is clearly not the\nintended or desired outcome, in that crossing these fixed thresholds has the unintended\nconsequence of “pushing down” standards designed for larger and more complex banks to\nsmaller and less complex ones. Compounding this problem is the overlapping and inconsistent\nthresholds used to define banks of different sizes and engaged in different activities. We should\nask whether this additional complexity is necessary or even helpful, and to what extent it impairs\neconomic growth.\nA simple fix would be for policymakers to adjust the community bank and other\nthresholds based on growth—and apply that adjusted threshold consistently—indexed to adjust\nfor future growth. This approach would preserve the policy choice established when the\nthreshold was initially set.\nDefining a community bank is an important first step, but it is just that, a first step. The\nnext question is how to appropriately tailor regulations for these and other firms. Over the years,\nI have supported an approach to regulation grounded in asking some simple—but critical—\nthreshold questions. What problem does each new and existing regulation solve? What are the\ncosts of this approach? And importantly, what alternative approaches are available? When we\nlook back at existing regulations, we can clearly identify areas for improvement. For example,\nthe community bank leverage ratio, or “CBLR,” was designed as an optional alternative\n\n- 3 -\nframework to risk-based capital requirements for community banks. A community bank that\nopts into the CBLR framework and complies with the established ratio is deemed to comply with\nrisk-based capital requirements.\nBut if we look back at the history of the CBLR, the agencies approached the task of\ncalibration primarily by evaluating how many banks would be eligible to opt in and calibrating\nthe requirement to maintain the same high level of capital in this population of banks. In my\nview, this approach failed to achieve the relief Congress intended, and more fundamentally,\nfailed to answer the critical questions we must consider in the rulemaking process.\nLet me turn to another area that needs to be addressed, the applications process. This\nprocess can also negatively impact community banks. It requires banks to seek approval from\nthe Federal Reserve and other state and federal regulators for regulatory permission to engage in\na transaction or activity. But this process can be unpredictable in terms of timing and\ninformation necessary to be ripe for consideration and approval. The costs of delay can be\nsignificant, damaging the value of the target bank, creating uncertainty for bank employees and\ncustomers, and resulting in costly delays for critical systems, integration contracts, and service\nagreements, potentially damaging the reputation of both firms.\nThe remedy is simple—regulatory application review should be effective, timely, and\nefficient. Banks should have a clear understanding of the information they must provide to\ncomplete the application well in advance. The standards for approval must be clearly defined\nand available to the public. And regulators should be prepared to act on a complete application\nwithin the statutory time frames. We have an opportunity to take a new approach, and we are\ndoing so. We cannot accept the opacity of the status quo, especially when the “fix” is as simple\nas clear standards, clear forms, and prompt attention to and action on applications.\n\n- 4 -\nOne area where we have improved transparency relates to mutual bank capital, which I\nhave spoken about a number of times. Yesterday, the Board issued a series of frequently asked\nquestions and two templates for mutual banks to use as they consider engaging in raising capital.\nThese provide options for mutual banks to issue capital instruments that could qualify as tier 1\ncommon equity or as additional tier 1 equity. These approaches are just a start—we are open to\nfurther refinement and improvement once mutuals have an opportunity to review and work to\nimplement this new approach.\nI will conclude with a discussion about how we ensure that the supervisory process is\nappropriate for community banks. Regulators are once again working to incorporate “tailoring”\nto more effectively allocate supervisory and bank staffing resources. This allows the calibration\nof supervisory activities that are appropriate to a bank’s size, risk, complexity, and business\nmodel. This approach is not new, but it has simply been ignored in recent years. Regulators\nhave significant leeway in designing supervisory approaches, which may include issuing\nguidance that is technically non-binding but often plays a role similar to a regulatory\nrequirement.\nHow do we address this problem?\nFirst, through greater transparency. Supervisory practices often escape public and\ninternal scrutiny. They are developed with little public input, and they are not subject to public\nnotice and comment requirements under the Administrative Procedure Act. Supervisory\npractices are not scrutinized after an exam because of the activity’s designation as “confidential\nsupervisory information” (CSI). “CSI” includes a broad array of bank and supervisory materials\nand actions taken in an exam context. The Fed continues to revise and redirect our supervisory\npractices, including the shift in focus toward material financial risk. These efforts would be most\n\n- 5 -\neffective if accompanied by revisions to the definition and scope of CSI, which would promote\ngreater public transparency and accountability.\nSecond, calibration of supervisory standards. Supervisory findings inform bank ratings,\nwhich can have follow-on effects like limiting options for mergers and acquisitions activity;\nraising the cost of liquidity; or diverting resources away from other, more important bank\nmanagement priorities. We need to ensure that supervisory practices are appropriately calibrated\nso that a bank’s supervisory ratings reflect its financial condition and material financial risks.\nClosing Thoughts\nBefore we close out today’s conference, I would like to again thank all of our attendees,\nboth those here with us and those online. We appreciate the continued support for community\nbanks across the United States. I would especially like to thank the community bankers who\nwork tirelessly to support their customers, businesses, and local economies. Thank you for\njoining us today.\nIn my role as the Vice Chair for Supervision, my responsibilities extend across banks of\nall sizes, from the largest GSIB to a single-branch community bank operating in an underserved\nrural market. The Fed’s regulatory and supervisory approaches to this wide range of firms must\nbe tailored to address the unique characteristics of each type and size of institution. A one-size-\nfits-all approach that pushes down requirements from the larger banks to the smallest ones results\nin overregulation and excessive supervision that is not appropriate for the size, risk, complexity,\nand business model of community banks. Today, we have the opportunity to right-size the\nframeworks for each size of institution, and I look forward to working together with my\ncolleagues at the FDIC and OCC to accomplish this goal, through sensible reforms and more\nappropriate supervisory approaches.",

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe American Bankers Association Community Banking Conference\nPalm Desert, California\nFebruary 21, 2022\n\nBefore we get to our conversation on community banking, I would like to briefly\ndiscuss my outlook for the U.S. economy and my view of appropriate monetary policy.1\nAs I see it, the main challenge for monetary policy now is to bring inflation down without\nharming the ongoing economic expansion.\nInflation is much too high. Last year I noted that inflationary pressures associated\nwith strong demand and constrained supply could take longer to subside than many\nexpected. Since then, those problems have persisted and inflation has broadened,\nreaching the highest rate that Americans have faced in forty years. High inflation is a\nheavy burden for all Americans, but especially for those with limited means who are\nforced to pay more for everyday items, delay purchases, or put off saving for the future. I\nintend to support prompt and decisive action to lower inflation, and today I will explain\nhow the Fed is pursuing this goal.\nIn the near term, I expect that uncomfortably high inflation will persist at least\nthrough the first half of 2022. We may see signs of inflation easing in the second half of\nthe year, but there is a substantial risk that high inflation could persist. In January, the\nConsumer Price Index rose to a 12-month rate of 7.5 percent, which, consistent with\nother recent monthly readings, was even higher than expected. Employment costs for\nbusinesses, as measured by average hourly wages, also rose last month. And continued\ntightness in the labor market indicates that upward pressure on wages and other\nemployment compensation is not likely to moderate soon.\nMy base case is that inflation will moderate later this year, which will depend, in\npart, on appropriate actions by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). But with\n1 My views on the outlook and monetary policy are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of my\ncolleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nwage growth lagging behind inflation for the past year, many families may find it\nchallenging to make ends meet and continued rising home prices will likely prevent many\nfrom entering the housing market. In addition, rising costs and hiring difficulties\ncontinue to be burdens for small businesses.\nTurning to the labor market, which continues to tighten, indications are that the\nOmicron infection surge earlier this year has not left a negative imprint on the economy\nor slowed job creation. I expect to see continued strength in the job market this year,\nwith further gains in employment, and my hope is that more Americans return to the\nlabor force and find work. The strength in job creation is a big positive for those seeking\nemployment and for their families. Even with the improving labor market, I still hear\nfrom businesses that qualified workers are difficult to find, and labor shortages remain a\ndrag on hiring and on economic growth.\nNow let me turn to the implications of this outlook for monetary policy. In my\nview, conditions in the labor market have been and are currently consistent with the\nFOMC’s goal of maximum employment, and as such, my focus has been on the\npersistently high inflation. In part, the high inflation reflects supply chain disruptions\nassociated with the economic effects of the pandemic and efforts made to contain it.\nUnfortunately, monetary policy isn’t well-suited to address supply issues. But strong\ndemand and a very tight labor market have also contributed to inflation pressures, and the\nFOMC can help alleviate those pressures by removing the extraordinary monetary policy\naccommodation that is no longer needed.\nIn our most recent monetary policy statement—which was released following our\nJanuary meeting—we indicated that “with inflation well above 2 percent and a strong\n\n- 3 -\nlabor market,” we expected that it would “soon be appropriate to raise the target range for\nthe federal funds rate.”2 I fully supported that assessment, and the data we have seen\nsince then have only increased the urgency to get on with the process of normalizing our\ninterest rate stance and significantly reducing the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance\nsheet. I support raising the federal funds rate at our next meeting in March and, if the\neconomy evolves as I expect, additional rate increases will be appropriate in the coming\nmonths. I will be watching the data closely to judge the appropriate size of an increase at\nthe March meeting. In early March, the FOMC will finally stop expanding the Federal\nReserve’s balance sheet. The resulting end of our pandemic asset purchases will remove\nanother source of unneeded stimulus for the economy. In the coming months, we need to\ntake the next step, which is to begin reducing the Fed’s balance sheet by ceasing the\nreinvestment of maturing securities already held in the portfolio. Returning the balance\nsheet to an appropriate and manageable level will be an important additional step toward\naddressing high inflation.\nI expect that these steps will contribute to an easing in inflation pressures in the\ncoming months, but further steps will likely be needed this year to tighten monetary\npolicy. Looking beyond this spring, my views on the appropriate pace of interest rate\nincreases and balance sheet reduction for this year and beyond will depend on how the\neconomy evolves. I will be particularly focused on how much progress we make on\nbringing down inflation. My intent would be to take forceful action to help reduce\n2 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement,” press\nrelease, January 26, 2022,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20220126a.htm.\n\n- 4 -\ninflation, bringing it back toward our 2 percent goal, while keeping the economy on track\nto continue creating jobs and economic opportunity for Americans.\nI appreciate the opportunity to share my views on monetary policy with you this\nmorning. But since we are here to talk about community banking, let’s get back to that\nimportant topic. Certainly prior to, but especially over the course of the pandemic, we\nhave seen a heightened focus and urgency in incorporating technology and innovation\ninto community banking. The adoption of technology and innovation is really at the\nheart of the major issues facing community banks. We see banks, fintech companies, and\ntech firms exploring various technologies to enhance their payments systems, expand\nconsumer access, improve back-office operations, and create new financial products and\nservices.\nThis interest and the increasing interest in crypto- and digital assets have created a\nneed to work together with the other federal banking agencies to give the industry better\nand more useful regulatory feedback as banks consider approaches to integrating crypto-\nand digital asset related activities into their service offerings. Given the popularity of\nthese types of assets, and the growing interest of banks in participating in the market, it’s\nincreasingly necessary for regulators to be able to engage with the industry on these\nissues.\nEvolving financial services, a sharper focus on efficiency and timeliness in the\nindustry, and the rapid increase in technology advances have also led the Federal Reserve\nto explore the potential benefits and risks of a central bank digital currency (CBDC). We\nrecently issued a discussion paper as a first step in fostering a broad and transparent\n\n- 5 -\npublic dialogue about CBDCs.3 The paper is not intended to advance any specific policy\noutcome and no decisions have been made at this time. We are genuinely committed to\nhearing a wide range of voices on this issue. The paper was published earlier this year\nwith a 120-day comment period. We encourage your comments and feedback—\ngenerally, and in response to specific questions posed in the paper. As we engage in this\ndialogue and evaluation process, and throughout this initiative, I intend to keep an open\nmind about the usefulness of and potential business case for a CBDC. I strongly\nencourage community bankers and all of the other stakeholders who would be impacted\nby the creation of a CBDC to submit your comments and views to the Fed by May 20, the\nend of the scheduled public comment period.\nAnother area of intense interest is the expansion of financial activities beyond the\ntraditional chartered banking institution construct. We are seeing an increase in the\nproposal of novel charter types under consideration across the country. These changes,\nand the coming availability of the Fed Now instant payment service, have the potential to\nvastly change the landscape of financial services and opportunities in the market. In\nanticipation of this evolution, our Federal Reserve Banks are receiving an increased\nnumber of requests for membership and access to Reserve Bank master accounts from\ninstitutions with these novel charters. Recognizing the importance of clarity and\ntransparency in this space, and to facilitate and evaluate these activities in a consistent\n3 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Money and Payments: The U.S. Dollar in the Age of\nDigital Transformation” (January 2022), https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/money-and-\npayments-discussion-paper.htm.\n\n- 6 -\nmanner, the Board is in the process of issuing clearer guidance around the application and\nreview process for novel bank charters and account access at the Federal Reserve.\nI look forward to discussing these and other issues with you in just a few minutes,\nso I will stop there. It’s such a pleasure to be in person with you again at the ABA’s\nConference for Community Banks, and I am looking forward to our conversation.",

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nMoney Marketeers of New York University\nNew York, New York\nOctober 12, 2022\n\nThanks to the Money Marketeers for inviting me to share my perspective on the\nconduct of monetary policy in the current environment of unacceptably high inflation. It\nis a pleasure to be here with you this evening.\nI will focus my remarks today on the use of explicit forward guidance as a tool for\nmonetary policy.1 Before I start, let me briefly discuss near-term monetary policy. You\nlikely already know that I have fully supported the Federal Open Market Committee’s\n(FOMC) decisions over the past several meetings. Those decisions were to increase the\ntarget range for the federal funds rate in 75 basis point increments, and the federal funds\nrate now stands at 3 to 3-1/4 percent. Inflation is much too high, and I strongly believe\nthat bringing inflation back to our target is a necessary condition for meeting the goals\nmandated by Congress of price stability and maximum employment on a sustainable\nbasis.\nNaturally, the focus is now on what will happen at the next FOMC meeting and\nbeyond. At this point, for me, it comes down to what the incoming data and other\neconomic information will tell us about the outlook for inflation. If we do not see signs\nthat inflation is moving down, my view continues to be that sizable increases in the target\nrange for the federal funds rate should remain on the table. However, if inflation starts to\ndecline, I believe a slower pace of rate increases would be appropriate. To bring inflation\ndown in a consistent and lasting way, the federal funds rate will need to move up to a\nrestrictive level and remain there for some time. However, it is not yet clear how high we\nwill need to raise the federal funds rate and how much time will pass before we begin to\nsee inflation moving back down in a consistent and lasting way.\n1 I want to thank Antulio Bomfim and Rebecca Zarutskie for their assistance in preparing these remarks.\n\n- 2 -\nMy general point is that inflation is much too high, and the outlook for inflation\nremains significantly uncertain. This uncertainty makes it very challenging to provide\nprecise guidance on the path for the federal funds rate. With this in mind, I will turn to\nthe main topic I’d like to discuss today, which is the potential role that explicit forward\nguidance can play as a monetary policy tool.\nForward guidance is official FOMC communication that is intended to signal to\nthe public the likely future path of monetary policy. In my remarks today, I will refer to\nexplicit forward guidance as forward guidance that references specific economic\noutcomes that would need to be achieved, or a specific amount of time that would need to\npass, before the Committee would take or consider taking a particular policy action.2\nTo be considered forward guidance, a statement does not need to be explicit about future\npolicy actions or the timing of potential actions. It may be more qualitative in describing\nlikely policy actions that may be taken in the future and, in some cases, may only\ndescribe how the FOMC will be thinking about its future decisions rather than signaling\nthe likely future direction of policy actions. The intent of all forward guidance is to\ninfluence the public’s expectations about the FOMC’s future monetary policy actions,\nand in doing so, affect longer-term interest rates and broader financial conditions to help\n2 It is important to note that the dates and ample reserves outcome specified in the Plans for Reducing the\nSize of the Balance Sheet issued by the FOMC in May 2022 are not considered explicit forward guidance\nin this context. Explicit forward guidance, defined here in the case of asset purchases, entails specifying\neconomic outcomes, such as labor market or inflation conditions, that must be achieved before the\nCommittee would consider altering the pace or other details of its asset purchases. For example, in its\nDecember 2012 statement, the FOMC issued forward guidance on its asset purchases by noting, “If the\noutlook for the labor market does not improve substantially, the Committee will continue its purchases of\nTreasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until\nsuch improvement is achieved in a context of price stability”; see Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System (2012), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement,” press release, December 12,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20121212a.htm.\n\n- 3 -\nsupport a path for inflation and economic activity that would be consistent with\naccomplishing t the Committee’s price-stability and maximum-employment goals.\nAs you know, over the past 20 years or so the Federal Reserve has increased the\ntransparency and the frequency of its communications with the public, including through\nmore frequent use of forward guidance in describing its monetary policy decisions. Let\nme stress here that I view clear and transparent communication with the public from the\nFederal Reserve as crucial to enable a better understanding of and to reinforce the\neffectiveness of our monetary policy actions, all of which help keep us accountable to the\npublic. Over about the past 10 years, the use of explicit forward guidance has become an\nintegral part of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy toolkit. In fact, explicit forward\nguidance is generally seen by many as especially helpful when use of the Committee’s\nmain monetary policy tool (changes to the federal funds rate) is constrained. This is\nwhen the rate has been lowered to zero, which we also call the effective lower bound.\nIt is important to note that the degree of specificity contained in the Committee’s\nforward guidance comes with tradeoffs. Explicit forward guidance hasn’t always been\nviewed as a helpful addition to the monetary policy toolkit, particularly before the 2008\nfinancial crisis. Before that time, while there was some acknowledgement that forward\nguidance could meaningfully affect financial conditions, there was a great deal of\nconcern about the “costs and risks” of providing this type of guidance.3 These costs and\nrisks included the confusion and potential financial market volatility that could result if\nthe public did not fully understand the Committee’s forward guidance. Another common\n3 For a discussion of the evolution of Federal Reserve officials’ views regarding the use of forward\nguidance in the period before 2008, see Edward Nelson (2021), “The Emergence of Forward Guidance as a\nMonetary Policy Tool,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2021-033 (Washington: Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System, May), https://doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2021.033.\n\n- 4 -\nconcern was that, if the Committee had to alter its forward guidance too frequently in\nresponse to rapidly changing economic conditions, its forward guidance could become\nineffective (meaning that the public could heavily discount or simply disregard the\nguidance) or, worse, the public could come to question the Committee’s overall\ncredibility.\nA related worry was that if the Committee were too slow to alter its forward\nguidance—perhaps because it feared an outsized market reaction or a loss of credibility—\nmonetary policy could be more likely to fall behind the curve. In this regard, one cost of\nproviding explicit forward guidance would be a loss of the flexibility needed to respond\nto changes in economic conditions as required by the pursuit of our price-stability and\nmaximum-employment goals. On the whole, there was a consensus before the turn of the\ncentury that cost-benefit considerations did not favor the use of explicit forward guidance\nas a monetary policy tool. This was especially true when the benefits from providing\nsuch guidance—tightening or easing financial conditions—could be achieved in a more\nstraightforward way. This could be accomplished in two ways—first, through simple\nchanges in the federal funds rate and second, relying on the public to infer any future\nmoves in the policy rate based on their own assessments of the FOMC’s likely policy\nreactions to developments in inflation and economic activity.\nOver time, Federal Reserve officials began to more seriously consider the possible\nbenefits that forward guidance could provide to the effectiveness of the FOMC’s\nmonetary policy decisions by influencing longer-term interest rates in a way that aided\nthe Committee’s achievement of its statutory price stability and maximum-employment\ngoals. Starting in 1999, the FOMC began to release a public statement after each of its\n\n- 5 -\nmeetings. And beginning in 2000, in addition to describing the current policy decision,\nthe post-meeting statement contained a paragraph on the “balance of risks” that was\nmeant to indicate how the Committee “assesses the risks of heightened inflation pressures\nor economic weakness in the foreseeable future.”4 The time frame in the new language\nwas intended to cover a period extending beyond the next FOMC meeting and was meant\nto give an indication of the likely direction of future policy decisions based on the\nCommittee’s assessment of the economic outlook. Beginning in 2003, the FOMC post-\nmeeting statement began to include more direct, but still qualitative, forward guidance\nregarding the future path of the federal funds rate.5 Notably, this forward guidance did\nnot reference explicit outcomes or specific timelines that would guide the FOMC’s future\npolicy decisions. Evidence suggests that the shift toward more transparent\ncommunication by the FOMC in the early 2000s, including its use of forward guidance,\nallowed financial market participants to better anticipate changes in the stance of\nmonetary policy, which were then reflected in broader financial conditions.6\n4 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2000), “The FOMC Announced Today That It\nApproved Modifications to Its Disclosure Procedures at Its December 21 Meeting,” press release, January\n19, https://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/press/general/2000/20000119/default.htm. The first such\n“balance of risks” language appeared in the February 2000 post-meeting statement: “Against the\nbackground of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information\ncurrently available, the Committee believes the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may\ngenerate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future”; see Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System (2000), “FOMC Statement and Board Discount Rate Action,” press release, February 2,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/press/general/2000/20000202.\n5 The first instance of this type of qualitative forward guidance appeared in the August 2003 FOMC\nstatement. In particular, the statement included the following language: “The Committee judges that, on\nbalance, the risk of inflation becoming undesirably low is likely to be the predominant concern for the\nforeseeable future. In these circumstances, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be\nmaintained for a considerable period”; see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2003),\n“FOMC Statement,” press release, August 12,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/press/monetary/2003/20030812/default.htm.\n6 Meade and others (2015) find that, due to FOMC communications, financial market participants\nanticipated the 2004 monetary policy tightening in advance, but that in the absence of such\ncommunications they did not anticipate the policy tightening that occurred in 1994. See Ellen E. Meade,\nYoshio Nozawa, Lubomir Petrasek, and Joyce K. Zickler (2015), “The Effects of FOMC Communications\nbefore Policy Tightening in 1994 and 2004,” FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal\n\n- 6 -\nThe 2008 financial crisis significantly altered most assessments of the costs and\nbenefits of providing more explicit forward guidance. With the federal funds rate\nremaining at near-zero levels for several years after that crisis, the Committee had to look\nfor new tools to change its policy stance and affect financial conditions. Explicit forward\nguidance and large-scale asset purchases quickly emerged as the two main new tools of\nmonetary policy.\nIn a way, explicit forward guidance was seen as providing monetary policy\naccommodation when the current setting of the federal funds rate could not.7 By\nproviding guidance on specific outcomes that would need to be achieved before the\nFOMC would consider raising the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee\ncould help reduce uncertainty regarding its future policy decisions and keep longer-term\ninterest rates low as the economic recovery progressed.8 In addition, with the risks to the\noutlook generally seen as tilted to the downside in the years that followed the financial\ncrisis, using explicit forward guidance to signal a “low for longer” policy was not seen as\nReserve System, September 24), https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/notes/feds-\nnotes/2015/effects-of-fomc-communications-before-policy-tightening-in-1994-and-2004-20150924.html.\n7 The FOMC employed both date-based and outcome-based explicit forward guidance in the period\nfollowing the 2008 financial crisis, as well as more qualitative forward guidance. For a more detailed\ndiscussion of the forward-guidance language employed by the FOMC during the period from 2008 to 2015\nand a review of the evidence of the effects of such forward guidance, see Jeffrey Campbell, Thomas B.\nKing, Anna Orlik, and Rebecca Zarutskie (2020), “Issues regarding the Use of the Policy Rate Tool,”\nFinance and Economics Discussion Series 2020-070 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System, August), https://doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2020.070.\n8 The FOMC introduced outcome-based forward guidance in its December 2012 statement. From August\n2011 to November 2012, the FOMC used date-based explicit forward guidance. For example, the August\n2011 FOMC statement noted that the FOMC would likely keep the federal funds rate at exceptionally low\nlevels “at least through mid-2013.” The date in the forward guidance was updated to “at least through late\n2014” at the January 2012 meeting and updated again to “at least through mid-2015” at the September 2012\nmeeting. See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2011), “FOMC Statement,” press\nrelease, August 9, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20110809a.htm;\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2012), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement,”\npress release, January 25,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20120125a.htm; Board of Governors of\nthe Federal Reserve System (2012), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement,” press release, September\n13, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20120913a.htm.\n\n- 7 -\nposing significant risks to the Committee’s credibility, because short-term interest rates\nwere generally expected to remain unusually low during those years. I should note,\nhowever, that even then, low-for-long policies did raise some financial stability concerns,\nsuch as those related to reach-for-yield behavior. In addition, the outcome-based forward\nguidance employed by the FOMC in the years following the financial crisis explicitly\nrecognized the possibility that inflationary pressures could emerge. It incorporated a\nversion of an “escape clause” in its forward guidance that would prompt a\nreconsideration of the policy stance should such inflationary pressures emerge. In\nparticular, in its December 2012 statement, the Committee noted that it expected the\ntarget range for the federal funds rate to remain at 0 to 1/4 percent for “at least as long as\nthe unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years\nahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee’s 2\npercent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well\nanchored.”9\nOf course, today’s circumstances are much different from those we faced during\nmost of the decade that followed the 2008 financial crisis. I will focus here on two\nfeatures of our current environment that I see as especially relevant for assessing the role\nof explicit forward guidance as a monetary policy tool in the current conduct of monetary\npolicy. The first is that with inflation unacceptably high and the resulting urgent need to\nremove monetary policy accommodation, the federal funds rate is no longer near zero.\nThe Committee can now indicate its intended stance of monetary policy through changes\n9 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2012), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC\nStatement,” press release, December 12,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20121212a.htm.\n\n- 8 -\nto the target range for the federal funds rate—its stated primary tool of monetary policy—\nrather than relying on more unconventional monetary policy tools, such as forward\nguidance and balance sheet policy, to serve as the main indicators of the stance of\nmonetary policy. The second is that the outlook for inflation and economic activity is\nespecially uncertain, with significant two-sided risks. Gone are the days when the risks\nto the outlook were skewed to the downside, especially with respect to inflation. And\ntwo-sided risks to economic activity are also widely recognized by the public, with press\nreports of an overheating labor market often featured alongside discussions of high or\nrising recession risks.\nIn our current environment, I view the benefits of providing explicit forward\nguidance as lower than they were in the years immediately after the 2008 crisis. Given\nthat the federal funds rate is now well above zero, the FOMC can communicate changes\nin the stance of monetary policy through changes in the target range for the federal funds\nrate and not rely on explicit forward guidance as it did when the federal funds rate was at\nthe effective lower bound.\nAnd I would argue that the costs and risks of providing explicit forward guidance\nare now higher than they were in the decade that followed the last financial crisis. For\nexample, relative to current conditions, it was easier and less risky to provide explicit\nforward guidance back then (especially guidance of the low-for-longer variety). After all,\nback then, the economy was still weighed down by the after-effects of the 2008 financial\ncrisis, and inflation was running persistently below our 2 percent target.\nLet’s contrast those conditions with the ones we face today. With uncertainty\nabout the economic outlook unusually high today, the pre-2000s concerns about\n\n- 9 -\nproviding explicit forward guidance have regained their relevance. High uncertainty\nabout the outlook puts a premium on flexibility, and—to the extent that the Committee\nsees a cost to frequent changes to its forward guidance—the provision of explicit forward\nguidance could reduce the Committee’s flexibility to respond to unexpected changes in\neconomic conditions.\nThe Committee’s experience in the second half of last year illustrates this point.\nLooking back, one might reasonably argue that during that time the Committee’s explicit\nforward guidance for both the federal funds rate and asset purchases contributed to a\nsituation where the stance of monetary policy remained too accommodative for too\nlong—even as inflation was rising and showing signs of becoming more broad-based\nthan previously thought. The facts on the ground were changing quickly and\nsignificantly, but the communication of our policy stance was not keeping pace, which\nmeant that our policy stance was not keeping pace.\nAs late as November 2021, our forward guidance still indicated that the\nCommittee intended to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent\n“until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s\nassessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track\nto moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.”10 And we were still purchasing assets at\nthe same pace we had earlier in the year, although we did announce in November 2021\nthat we would start slowing the pace of our purchases in December.11 With the benefit of\n10 This outcome-based forward-guidance language regarding the target range for the federal funds rate was\nintroduced in the September 2020 FOMC statement; see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem (2020), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement,” press release, September 16,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200916a.htm.\n11 The December 2020 FOMC statement included forward guidance regarding asset purchases that\nspecified that the Committee would continue its purchases at the same pace until “substantial further\nprogress has been made toward the Committee’s maximum employment and price stability goals”; see\n\n- 10 -\nhindsight, one might ask whether we would have moved sooner to remove monetary\npolicy accommodation if we hadn’t been so explicit about our forward guidance in prior\nmonths—particularly forward guidance that had set such a high bar for slowing our asset\npurchases and starting to raise rates. Of course, the fact that some of the data that were\ndirectly relevant to our decision-making did not accurately reflect the economic\nconditions prevailing at the time—and which were subsequently revised—likely also led\nto a delay in the removal of monetary policy accommodation in 2021.\nMore generally, I will note that high uncertainty and two-sided risks to the\noutlook raise some practical questions for the use of explicit forward guidance in the\ncurrent monetary policy environment. For example, how can the Committee provide\nexplicit forward guidance about the path of the federal funds rate when overall\nmacroeconomic uncertainty makes it more challenging for the Committee to know\nbeforehand the size and timing of its future policy moves?\nPutting it all together, what lessons can we take for the use of explicit forward\nguidance in today’s economic environment? A key point to me is that a cost-benefit\nanalysis similar to that which I’ve just discussed here suggests that the case for explicit\nforward guidance is much less compelling today than it was in the years that immediately\nfollowed the 2008 financial crisis. My own view is that discussions about the use of\nexplicit forward guidance as a policy tool should be limited. It should be used during\nperiods when the Committee cannot adjust the federal funds rate any lower due to the\neffective lower bound, and when the Committee also has reasonable confidence that that\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2020), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement,”\npress release, December 16,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20201216a.htm.\n\n- 11 -\nthe federal funds rate will need to remain near zero for a period of time to stimulate\ngrowth and when inflationary pressures are expected to be subdued. Even in such\nperiods, the Committee should recognize possible risks to a low-for-long monetary policy\nstance, including upside risks to inflation, and provide escape clauses that would detail\nthe circumstances that would cause the Committee to reevaluate its policy stance.\nOutside of such periods, our focus should be on changes in the target range for the\nfederal funds rate—the Committee’s primary tool for implementing monetary policy\ndecisions—in communicating the stance of monetary policy and in providing more\nqualitative guidance regarding how the Committee will be thinking about its future policy\ndecisions. Our recent experience with using qualitative forward guidance in our post-\nmeeting statements illustrates this point. In the first half of this year, when the\nCommittee began to signal that it would increase the target range for the federal funds\nrate and that it anticipated that “ongoing increases in the target range will be\nappropriate,” longer-term interest rates rose and financial conditions tightened.12\nHowever, being more explicit in our communications regarding the likely size of the\nincreases in the target range at each future meeting was not helpful during this time,\nbecause our decisions depended on the incoming data and its implications for the outlook.\nBefore I conclude, I will emphasize, again, that, my reservations about explicit\nforward guidance notwithstanding, I am a strong believer in the role of communication in\nthe conduct of monetary policy. Clear and transparent communications with the public\nreinforce the effectiveness of our monetary policy and keep us accountable to the public.\n12 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2022), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC\nStatement,” press release, March 16,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20220316a.htm.\n\n- 12 -\nUnder current circumstances, however, the best we can do on the public communications\nfront is, first, to continue to stress our unwavering resolve to do what is needed to restore\nprice stability. Second, as Chair Powell noted recently, we should acknowledge that the\noutlook for inflation and economic activity is subject to unusual uncertainty, and that, as\na result, we will be making our policy decisions on a meeting-by-meeting basis. Third,\nwe should continue to reiterate that we will remain “highly attentive to inflation risks.”13\nThis is probably the best and clearest forward guidance we can provide at this point.\nThank you again for the opportunity to share my views with you today.\n13 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2022), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC\nStatement,” press release, September 21,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20220921a.htm.",

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nProtect Main Street\nSponsored by the Center for Capital Markets at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce\nWashington, D.C.\n(virtual)\nJanuary 17, 2024\n\n“More is better.” This axiom often holds true in many respects, but experience also\nteaches us that there are limits. Today, I’m happy to join you here at the U.S. Chamber of\nCommerce to talk about proposed changes to bank capital rules in the United States and to probe\nthe limits of the notion that “more is better” when regulators seek to apply it to bank capital\nrequirements.1\nIn July 2023, the federal banking agencies proposed changes to implement the Basel III\n“endgame” capital reforms.2 The published capital rulemaking proposal incorporated an\nexpansive scope and a notable shift in approach by pushing down new Basel capital requirements\nto all banks with over $100 billion in assets, regardless of their international activities. The\nproposal would substantially increase regulatory capital buffer and minimum capital\nrequirements for the covered firms. The comment period closed yesterday, January 16th. We’ve\nseen a robust response from commenters, with a large number of comments submitted during the\nlatter part of the comment period. As a policymaker, I am pleased to see the careful attention\nstakeholders have paid to this proposal and the thoughtful feedback that has been provided\nduring the comment period. Public input should help to improve the efficiency and effectiveness\nof the proposal.\nFrom my perspective, given the significant response from a number of industries and\nperspectives, as a bank regulatory policymaker, the agencies are obligated to think carefully\nabout the best path forward for this proposal. This should include making substantive changes to\naddress known deficiencies with the proposal and giving the public an opportunity to comment\n1 The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee or the Board of Governors.\n2 See dissenting statement, “Statement by Governor Michelle W. Bowman” on the proposed rule to implement the\nBasel III endgame agreement for large banks, news release, July 27, 2023,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bowman-statement-20230727.htm.\n\n- 2 -\non any reformulated proposal, to ensure the best possible outcome for the Basel capital reforms.\nThat path should ensure that sufficient consideration is given to the wide-reaching consequences\nof capital reform to the U.S. banking industry, the U.S. economy, and, importantly, U.S.\nbusinesses. We should consider tradeoffs in addressing scope, calibration, and tailoring. And\nwe should appropriately adjust the excessive calibrations and eliminate regulatory overreach in\nthe proposed rule.\nToday, I’d like to briefly discuss what I see as the consequences of miscalibration of\ncapital reforms—and testing the “more is better” principle—through a discussion of the impacts\nof finalizing the proposed capital reforms without significant revisions. I will then outline ideas\nfor a path forward and highlight what I see as the two most pressing problems in the proposal,\nissues that we must address before finalizing these and other pending rules. And finally, at the\nrisk of lulling those to sleep who do not eat, drink, and breathe bank capital rules 24/7, I will\nidentify a few important technical issues for resolution because they lead into the two\noverarching problems that I referenced a moment ago.\nConsiderations in Capital Policy\nCapital plays a critical role in the U.S. banking system, promoting the safe and sound\noperation of banks and supporting confidence in the broader banking system. Capital helps\nbanks provide financial products and services, including credit, that support American\nbusinesses. I think we can all agree that higher levels of capital enhance financial resilience—up\nto a point. At the time of a bank’s failure, capital—especially common equity capital, as the first\ntype of funding to absorb losses—protects depositors and other creditors. Capital allows banks\nto continue providing products and services, promoting a well-functioning financial system, even\nduring times of stress.\n\n- 3 -\nBut capital is not costless. Capital does not come into existence only at the point of\nfailure—capital is an ongoing requirement, and an ongoing cost, for all banks. The cost of\ncapital— both the required minimum amount of capital and buffers and the market price of\ncapital—influences every aspect of the business of banking, including the business lines a bank\npursues, the products and services it offers, and the cost and availability of those products and\nservices. Banks are not obligated to offer the same financial products or services over time.\nBanks also are not obligated to maintain the same costs of products and services. Indeed, it\nwould be irresponsible for a bank to ignore the cost of capital in managing its business, just as it\nwould be irresponsible for a bank to ignore market preferences and forces when choosing its\nlines of business. Increases to the cost of capital do not simply evaporate on a bank’s balance\nsheet, they are passed through to customers in various ways, including in the form of higher costs\nfor financial services or in reduced availability of services available in the market.\nThe cost of bank capital also influences where activities occur, either within the\nregulatory perimeter of the banking system or in non-bank entities and the broader shadow-\nbanking system. When the cost of a bank engaging in an activity exceeds the cost of performing\nthe same activity in a non-bank, that cost differential creates pressure that over time leads to a\nshift in these activities to non-bank providers.\nWhere does that leave us? Achieving good policy requires acknowledging and balancing\nthe benefits and costs of capital requirements, since it is one of the most important inputs\npolicymakers can use to enhance the safety and efficiency of the banking system. Relying\nsimply on the “more is better” approach downplays or ignores these critically important\ntradeoffs. When policymakers consider changes to the capital framework, particularly increases\nof the magnitude contemplated in the proposal, we must carefully weigh the benefit of increased\n\n- 4 -\nsafety from higher capital levels, with the direct costs to banks, and the downstream effects on\nconsumers, businesses, and the broader economy. We must also consider the broader regulatory\nlandscape and how changes to capital regulations may complement, overlap, or conflict with\nother regulatory requirements. And importantly, we must consider the broader implications for\nthe structure of the U.S. financial system and for financial stability. While these considerations\nmay caution us against capital increases of the magnitude contemplated in the proposal, I do see\na potential path forward for capital reform.\nThe Path Forward\nAs I consider next steps, I am cautiously optimistic that policymakers can work toward a\nreasonable compromise, one that addresses two of the most critical shortcomings of the proposal:\nover-calibration and the lack of regulatory tailoring. Public feedback has also assisted in\nidentifying the aspects of the proposal that result in the most severe unintended consequences. In\nmy mind, it will be necessary for policymakers to modify the proposal to mitigate these issues\nand concerns as we move forward.\nCalibration\nFirst, I would like to address calibration. The costs of this proposal, if implemented in its\ncurrent form, would be substantial. As the proposal describes, Federal Reserve staff estimates\nthese changes to result in an aggregate 20 percent increase in total risk-weighted assets across\nbank holding companies subject to the rule, although some commenters have projected much\ngreater effects on some firms.3 While the actual impact on binding capital requirements will\n3 See, e.g., Financial Services Forum, American Bankers Association, Bank Policy Institute, and Securities Industry\nand Financial Markets Association, “Comments on Regulatory Capital Rule: Large Banking Organizations and\nBanking Organizations with Significant Trading Activity” (December 22, 2023), R-\n1813_122223_156400_337982526593_1.pdf (federalreserve.gov) (noting that for the largest U.S. firms, the\nproposal would result in a greater than 30 percent increase in capital requirements, and a greater than 33 percent\nincrease in risk-weighted assets).\n\n- 5 -\nvary by firm, it is apparent even with the incomplete information available today that this will\nrepresent a large increase in capital requirements.\nIn October of 2023, the Federal Reserve launched a data collection to gather more\ninformation from the banks affected by the Basel III capital proposal.4 The purpose of this\nquantitative impact study was to help better understand the estimated effects of the proposal. My\nunderstanding is that the Federal Reserve will release its analysis of those findings and some\naggregated information for comment. And just as for the initial proposal, stakeholder feedback\non this quantitative impact study and staff analysis will be very instructive as we seek to analyze\nand understand the expected impacts of the proposed capital reforms. Based on the information\navailable, increasing capital requirements as initially proposed could result in significant harm to\nthe U.S. economy through the impact on U.S. businesses, while failing to achieve the intended\ngoals of improving safety and soundness and promoting financial stability.\nMuch of the public feedback and concern focused on the calibration of the proposal and\nthe corresponding impact across a number of industries. Farmers, ranchers, and agricultural\nproducers that use derivatives to hedge price risks in agricultural supply chains have noted that\nthe increased costs of providing these services from the proposal could lead banks to limit their\navailability in the marketplace.5 Small-business owners (including builders, manufacturers,\n4 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Federal Reserve Board Launches Data Collection to\nGather More Information from the Banks Affected by the Large Bank Capital Proposal It Announced Earlier This\nYear,” press release, October 20, 2023,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20231020b.htm.\n5 See National Council of Farmer Cooperatives, Commodity Markets Council, National Cattlemen’s Beef\nAssociation, National Grain and Feed Association, American Farm Bureau Federation, National Milk Producers\nFederation, National Pork Producers Council, American Cotton Shippers Association, Farm Credit Council,\n“Comments on Regulatory Capital Rule: Large Banking Organizations and Banking Organizations with Significant\nTrading Activity and Regulatory Capital Rule: Risk-Based Capital Surcharges for Global Systemically Important\nBank Holding Companies” (December 11, 2023),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/SECRS/2023/December/20231229/R-1813/R-\n1813_121123_156411_319900252084_1.pdf.\n\n- 6 -\nrestaurant owners, and others) have indicated that the proposal could “make borrowing costs\nunaffordable and capital inaccessible.”6 These real-world examples only scratch the surface of\nthe harmful effects of this proposal as described by a broad range of stakeholders noting the\nimpact on a wide array of businesses. My initial observation is that, in the aggregate, the\ncomments reflect a spectrum of concerns that are largely driven by calibration.\nThese well-founded concerns and the risks they highlight are not surprising in light of the\nscale of the proposed capital increase. In addition, this direct independent feedback provides a\nnew lens through which to view the proposal, enabling us to specifically identify and confront\nthe predictable effects: higher costs of capital for banks and services for customers, less\navailability and narrower selection of services, and increased concentration in the providers of\nfinancial products and services. These consequences could disproportionately harm underserved\nmarkets, businesses, and communities, as bank customers will bear the cost of these increased\ncapital requirements.\nIn addition to the direct impacts of excessive calibration, policymakers must also\nconsider international comparability and competitive disadvantages. A key element of the Basel\ncapital rules is to promote greater international comparability, a goal that is frustrated when U.S.\nregulators over-calibrate requirements, at a level in excess of international peers and not\nsupported by proportionate levels of risk. Significant banking activities occur in the international\nand cross-border context, and we know that financial stability risks can spread throughout global\nfinancial markets. One approach to mitigate the spread of financial stability risks is to promote\n6 10,000 Small Businesses Voices, “Comments on Regulatory Capital Rule: Large Banking Organizations and\nBanking Organizations with Significant Trading Activity” (November 21, 2023),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/SECRS/2023/December/20231229/R-1813/R-\n1813_112123_156602_328107635870_1.pdf.\n\n- 7 -\nminimum standards across jurisdictions that not only improve competitive equity in banking\nmarkets but that also make the financial system safer.\nThe capital proposal reflects elements of the agreed upon Basel standards, but it far\nexceeds those agreed standards. Adjusting the calibration of the Basel capital reform proposal\nwould have the important secondary benefit of enhancing this international consistency.\nTo address this issue of calibration, policymakers must develop and work toward a target,\na top-line aggregate capital level that would best promote safety and soundness and one that has\na broad consensus among policymakers. Earlier efforts on the Basel proposal would have\nresulted in something closer to “capital neutrality”—with essentially minimal top-line change in\naggregate capital requirements across the U.S. banking system.7 I would note that the U.K.\napproach contemplates an average increase in the low single digits.8 I look forward to learning\nmore about stakeholder views on calibration from the comments we have received.\nTailoring\nNext, I will turn to the role of tailoring in bank capital reform efforts.\nThe U.S. banking system is now much better capitalized than after the 2008 financial\ncrisis, with substantially more liquidity. The current capital framework represents a risk-based,\ntailored approach, with the goal of aligning regulation with risk. The largest firms are divided\ninto four categories based on size and complexity, with the largest and most complex firms\n7 See Randal K. Quarles, “Between the Hither and the Farther Shore: Thoughts on Unfinished Business” (speech at\nthe American Enterprise Institute, Washington, D.C., December 2, 2021), (“A major issue that we are grappling with\nis how to implement these [Basel III endgame capital] reforms, which reduce the role of bank internal models on\nbank capital requirements, while maintaining the overall level of aggregate capital requirements.”) (emphasis\nadded), https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/quarles20211202a.htm.\n8 See Bank of England, “The PRA Publishes the First of Two Policy Statements for the Implementation of the Basel\n3.1 Standards,” press release, December 12, 2023, (“Based on its latest data, the PRA estimates that the impact of\nBasel 3.1 requirements will be low and result in an average increase in Tier 1 capital requirements for UK firms of\naround 3% once fully phased in….”), https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/2023/december/pra-publishes-first-of-\ntwo-policy-statements-for-basel-3-1-standards-implementation.\n\n- 8 -\nsubject to the most stringent requirements. Regional banks, with $10 billion to $100 billion in\nassets, are subject to a somewhat more streamlined capital framework. And finally, the simplest\nrules are reserved for community banks that rely on a less complex, relationship-based business\nmodel.\nDespite the past success in this approach, tailoring has recently come under attack in\nregulatory reform efforts and applications.9 Some have argued that the bank stress last spring\nwas the result of changes Congress made several years ago to promote risk-based and tailored\nsupervision.10 The theory is that following the implementation of tailoring rules, regulators\nadopted a less assertive supervisory approach, and that regulators should instead move toward a\nregime that imposes uniform standards to firms with significant variability in size, risk,\ncomplexity, and business model—shifting back to a one-size-fits-all regulatory approach.\nI have still not seen compelling evidence that removing tailoring is a productive\nregulatory approach. To the contrary, the existing capital framework demonstrates how the\ntailored approach can help support appropriate requirements based on firm characteristics.\nIn my mind, the failure to apply tailoring is a fundamental flaw of the Basel capital\nreforms as proposed, and one that must be addressed. The application of today’s capital\nrequirements can be illustrated as an incline, with different or enhanced requirements kicking in\nat specific levels of size and complexity.11 By contrast, if you were to superimpose the current\n9 See Michelle W. Bowman, “Statement by Governor Bowman on Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on\nResolution Requirements for Large Banks and Application by U.S. Bancorp,” press release, October 14, 2022,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bowman-statement-20221014.htm.\n10 Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, Pub. L. No. 115-174, 132 Stat. 1296 (2018).\n11 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Federal Reserve Board Finalizes Rules That Tailor Its\nRegulations for Domestic and Foreign Banks to More Closely Match Their Risk Profiles,” press release, October 10,\n2019, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20191010a.htm; Tailoring Rule Visual\n(October 10, 2019), https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/boardmeetings/files/tailoring-rule-visual-\n20191010.pdf.\n\n- 9 -\nBasel proposal on the tailoring framework, you would see something in the capital space that\nlooks more like a single step, with a broad set of capital requirements kicking in at the $100\nbillion threshold. It is easy to see the difference between a slope and a cliff, and it is reasonable\nto expect that this cliff effect could become even more pronounced if we abandon tailoring in\nother areas, like liquidity regulation and long-term debt requirements.\nAs I have noted in the past, incorporating graduated requirements not only helps to\neffectively allocate limited supervisory resources, but it also avoids creating regulatory\nincentives that could unintentionally alter the banking landscape. Capital requirements are a\nprime example of a regulatory requirement that could have a transformative effect on the\nstructure of the banking system. Banks near the $100 billion asset size are already carefully\nconsidering the ongoing viability of remaining at an asset size near that threshold. Firms just\nabove the threshold will face strong pressure to shrink or to merge with other firms to achieve\neconomies of scale to comply with the breadth and complexity of the existing and proposed\nrequirements. Firms just below the threshold will need to be very intentional about approaching\nthe $100 billion threshold, and it would be reasonable to expect that they may consider revising\nbusiness strategies and activities to remain well below. While these distortive effects on the\nbanking system may be unintended, they are a predictable consequence of pushing down\nrequirements designed and calibrated for larger and more complex banks to those that are smaller\nand less complex.\nThe critical role of tailoring must be incorporated as a foundational element of these\nregulatory reforms. In practice, I think this requires us to take a hard look in a more granular\nway at the banks that should be subject to different elements of the capital requirements—such\nas market-risk and credit valuation adjustment (CVA) requirements, credit and operational risk\n\n- 10 -\nrequirements, and the revised treatment of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI).\nSplitting out elements of the rule—thinking about the appropriate application of each—can result\nin more targeted revisions that improve the effectiveness of the capital framework, while\nminimizing unnecessary burden and costs.\nTechnical Areas of Change\nI would also like to highlight a few important technical issues that should be addressed in\nongoing reform efforts. To be sure, this is not an exhaustive list, but as policymakers consider\nthe path that lies ahead, these are areas in the proposal where I see room for significant\nimprovement.\n• Recognizing the Benefits of Diversification, Particularly in Operational Risk.\nDiversification in revenue streams can enhance the stability and resilience of a financial\ninstitution, and excessive capital charges for these revenue-generating activities could\ncreate incentives for banks to roll back the progress they have made to diversify\nrevenues. Basel capital reforms should not penalize noninterest and fee-based income\nthrough the proposed operational risk requirements. There are a number of different\napproaches that could effectively address this concern.\n• Calibration of the Market Risk Capital Rule. Based on the information presented in the\nproposal, the revisions to the market risk rule alone will increase risk-weighted assets\nfrom $430 billion to $760 billion for Category I and II firms and from $130 billion to\n$220 billion for Category III and IV firms. These increases are significant, with broad-\nbased impacts, affecting business and municipal bond issuance and other forms of debt\nfinancing, risk management, hedging of foreign exchange and interest rate risk, or\nmanaging the risks of fluctuating commodity prices through hedging activities. The\n\n- 11 -\ncalibration of these changes could have a disproportionate impact on important derivative\nend-users: the farmers, manufacturers, small businesses, and others who rely on financial\nproducts to hedge some of their production cost and other business risks. While this\ncalibration point may be a mere subset of the broader calibration concerns about Basel\nIII, the significance of the capital charges in this area warrants attention.\no Address Redundancy or “Over-Calibration.” I have heard some interesting\nphilosophical debate about how to characterize the interaction of the Basel III\ncapital proposal and stress testing. Are there elements of “overlapping”\nrequirements, which implies redundancy in capital charges? Or are these rules\nseeking to identify and mitigate different risks, with stress testing focusing a\nnarrower subset of tail risks? This debate, while interesting, seems to miss the\nbroader calibration point. When looking at both the global market shock as\napplied in stress testing and the calibration of elements of the market risk rule that\ncapture similar risks, the aggregate calibration is simply too high to accomplish\nthe goals of capturing baseline risks and tail risks.\n• Better Alignment of Risk Weights and Credit Risk. Credit risk weights should correspond\nto underlying credit risk—this matching of credit risk and capital requirements helps to\npromote safety and soundness. I think there are a number of areas where the proposal\nmissed the mark in meeting this objective, including credit risk weighting for privately\nheld companies and small businesses, residential real estate, and retail credit exposures.\n• Looking Beyond Basel III: Leverage Ratio Requirements. Capital requirements are\nintended to be complementary—risk-based capital rules require banks to hold capital\nagainst more granular and specific risks, while leverage requirements operate as a\n\n- 12 -\nbackstop in the ordinary course of business. This arrangement works by design, but we\nhave seen some cracks emerge, particularly around the impact of the 5 percent leverage\nratio that applies to U.S. global systemically important banks at the holding company,\ncommonly referred to as the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio (or eSLR). While\nrisk-based and leverage capital requirements are intended to be complementary and\npromote the safe and sound operation of the banking system, the eSLR can disrupt banks’\nability to engage in Treasury market intermediation, which we saw occur in the early\ndays of market stress during the pandemic. I consider reform of the eSLR to fall in the\ncategory of “fixing what is broken.” This is an issue that would be prudent to address\nbefore future stresses emerge that could disrupt market functioning.\nClosing\nIn closing, I would like to thank the Center for Capital Markets at the U.S. Chamber of\nCommerce for the invitation to speak with you today about bank capital reform. Bank capital\npolicy involves tradeoffs and policy decisions, and as you all know, policymakers have different\nviews about how to strike the right balance. But as I view the landscape today, I do not view\nthese differences as insurmountable obstacles to achieving a more effective and efficient set of\nBasel capital reforms. Unlike many other areas of reform, the impact of changes to bank capital\ncan be analyzed and understood, which provides a much better ability to compare and reconcile\nthe tradeoffs of specific reforms. In many ways, this is one of the empowering aspects of capital\nreform. In considering a reform, we have a greater capacity to understand and assess the true\ncosts, including both the direct costs to banks and their customers, but also the potential harm to\nU.S. bank competitiveness in the global economy. The impact data collected from financial\ninstitutions subject to this rule describing effects directly linked to the proposed capital reforms\n\n- 13 -\nwill allow us to consider the combined and aggregate impact, to help us avoid a capital “end\nstate” that is overlapping, inefficient, contradictory, and potentially harmful to banks, their\ncustomers, and the broader economy.\nAs I have noted, my understanding is that the Federal Reserve will release its analysis of\nits findings and some aggregated information for comment. The data collected and released\nshould help public commenters and policymakers assess the impact of the proposal. It should\nalso serve as a guide to assist in shaping the next iteration of this proposal, whether that be in the\nform of a re-proposal or significantly revised final rule.",

In my conversations with bankers, some note\nthe difficulty in attracting and retaining the staff needed to mitigate cyber risks. While\nthere are no easy solutions in the defense against cyberattacks, close coordination among\nall of the groups represented at this conference is a good first step.\nAs I consider the Federal Reserve’s role in supervising cybersecurity, it is\nimportant to identify where our engagement can be most effective to enhance the security\nof our regulated entities. Our efforts must be focused on both banks and their third-party\nservice providers.\nIn my remarks today, I will briefly discuss four topics. First are the implications\nof evolving technologies and their impacts on the cyber risk landscape. Second, I will\ndiscuss how customer demand for innovation and personalized products has increased\nreliance on third parties. Third, I will cover the recently effective computer security\nnotification rule, and how that rule can benefit regulators through notification of cyber\nincidents and banks in monitoring their third-party service providers. And finally, I will\nbriefly address some of the Federal Reserve’s recent actions related to cyber risk.\n1 The views expressed in these remarks are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of my colleagues\non the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n- 2 -\nEvolving Technologies and Their Associated Risks\nI’ll begin with technology and the risks presented by the implementation and\nintegration of new technologies. As the pace of technology innovations continue to\naccelerate, companies are engaging in business in new ways. New products and services\npresent new risks.\nSince the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen greater interest in customer\nadoption of digital banking products and utilization of remote work tools by bank\nemployees, both of which have created new opportunities for cyberattacks. Some of\nthese risks are best addressed directly by the bank with assistance from law enforcement,\nif necessary. Other risks may best be addressed by service providers.\nRansomware\nOne of these risks is from ransomware, which continues to be an prevalent threat\nto financial institutions. Reports of these kinds of attacks have increased significantly\nover the past five years, with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN)\nreporting more than 1,400 ransomware-related Bank Secrecy Act filings in 2021, worth\nnearly $1.2 billion. This represents a nearly 200 percent increase over 2020 and\ncoincides with elevated geopolitical risk. Moreover, the frequency of ransomware\nattacks has escalated due to the emergence of ransomware-as-a-service, enabling easier\ndeployment of these types of attacks. Although ransomware impacts financial\ninstitutions of all sizes, it disproportionately impacts smaller banks that may not have\nsufficient resources to protect against these attacks.2\n2 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Cybersecurity and Financial System Resilience\nReport (Washington: Board of Governors, July 2022),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/cybersecurity-report-202207.pdf.\n\n- 3 -\nRansomware is often delivered through phishing emails or through the\nunauthorized installation of malicious programs onto an organization’s systems, known\nas “drive-by-downloads.” These tactics take advantage of those with access to a bank’s\ninternal systems, whose actions, while perhaps well-intentioned, enable the ransomware\ncyberattack to occur. According to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security\nAgency, eight out of 10 organizations had at least one user fall for a phishing attempt,\nand one out of 10 phishing emails resulted in a user opening a malicious attachment or\naccessing a malicious internet link.3 Banks regularly perform exercises testing employee\nvulnerability to these kinds of targeted attacks. Banks should continue efforts to educate\nthose with systems access about these risks.\nRansomware attacks can be mitigated by bank management. By using a robust,\nformal risk assessment process, bank management can develop a comprehensive action\nplan to prevent a ransomware attack from occurring, or to reduce the impact on the bank\nshould such an attack occur. Banks that have planned ahead for a ransomware attack will\nbe better positioned to respond when an attack occurs.\nUse of Internal and External Applications\nSoftware and public-facing applications are also potential targets for exploitation,\nrequiring effective planning and implementation of patch management to address\nemerging and existing vulnerabilities. Hackers constantly seek opportunities to exploit\nsoftware holes and risks exist even with a bank’s best efforts to install the most up-to-\ndate security patches. For example, often when vulnerabilities are identified, providers\n3 See “Phishing,” Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency,\nhttps://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/phishing-infographic-508c.pdf.\n\n- 4 -\nhave not yet provided patches to address these issues, leaving the bank vulnerable to what\nis referred to as zero-day exploits. Supply chain attacks, like the SolarWinds incident,\noccur when a bad actor compromises software, or software updates, before the vendor\ncan provide it to customers for installation. While there are some mechanisms to mitigate\nthe risk of these attacks, defenses are limited because organizations rarely control their\nentire software supply chain.4\nThis is an example of a threat that a bank on its own may not be best equipped to\naddress. Therefore, regulators should carefully consider the appropriate entity for the\nfocus of regulatory attention.\nThird-Party Risk Management\nCustomer demand for innovative and personalized products and services has\nincreased community banks’ reliance on third-party relationships to enable them to\nprovide new technologies. These relationships position small banks to remain\ncompetitive and demonstrate their commitment to serving the needs of their customers\nand communities. At the same time, greater reliance on third parties could create\nadditional opportunity for cyber criminals. The federal banking agencies recognize the\nincreasing role third parties play in providing banks with a multitude of services\nincluding access to new technologies, human capital, delivery channels, products,\nservices, and markets. In July 2021, in recognition of this trend, together the Federal\nReserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency jointly released proposed interagency guidance for the risk\n4 See Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Risk Review (Washington: Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation, June 2022), https://www.fdic.gov/analysis/risk-review/2022-risk-review/2022-risk-review-\nfull.pdf.\n\n- 5 -\nmanagement of third-party relationships. Although each of these federal banking\nagencies had already published separate third-party risk management guidance, the intent\nof the additional proposed guidance is to create consistency across the regulatory\nagencies and to consider whether further risks should be considered, given the evolving\nnature of the industry.5 The banking agencies are currently in the process of considering\nthe comments received on that proposal.\nA bank’s use of third parties does not diminish its responsibility to oversee those\nactivities in a safe and sound manner and in compliance with applicable laws and\nregulations, including consumer laws. To assist banks in their oversight of third parties\nin implementing risk management programs, in 2021 the Federal Reserve began\nproviding state member banks with reports relevant to their third-party partners. These\nreports contain information that may provide helpful insight in assessing the performance\nof bank service providers, depending on the services used and the risk the services pose.\nAs a former banker, I see this as a valuable resource; having access to these supervisory\nreports helps to ensure that banks are receiving the information necessary to most\neffectively manage exposure to the risks posed by their service providers.\nIn August 2021, the agencies also released a guide for community banks titled\n“Conducting Due Diligence on Financial Technology Firms.” This guide was drawn\nfrom existing guidance, and, while voluntary, it is intended to be a helpful resource for\n5 See Proposed Interagency Guidance on Third-Party Relationships: Risk Management, 86 Fed. Reg. 38182\n(July 19, 2021).\n\n- 6 -\ncommunity banks when performing due diligence on prospective relationships with\nfintech companies.6\nThe third-party service provider landscape has continued to evolve and expand.\nAs a result, we should consider the appropriateness of shifting the regulatory burden from\ncommunity banks to more efficiently focus directly on service providers. The Bank\nService Company Act gives the federal banking agencies significant regulatory authority\nover outsourced banking services. In a world where third parties are providing far more\nof these services, it seems to me that these providers should bear more responsibility to\nensure the outsourced activities are performed in a safe and sound manner. The computer\nsecurity notification rule is one example that makes appropriate use of this authority.\nComputer Security Notification Rule\nGiven the escalating frequency and severity of cyberattacks, the agencies\npublished a final rule in late 2021 establishing computer-security incident notification\nrequirements for banks and, importantly, also for their service providers. The rule\nrequires a bank to notify its primary federal regulator as soon as possible but no later than\n36 hours after the bank determines that an incident requiring notification has occurred.\nAn incident requiring notification is defined as a computer-security incident that disrupts\nor degrades, or is reasonably likely to disrupt or degrade, the viability of the banking\norganization’s operations, resulting in customers being unable to access their deposits and\nother accounts, or impacting the stability of the financial sector.\n6 See “SR 21-15 / CA 21-11: Guide for Community Banking Organizations Conducting Due Diligence on\nFinancial Technology Companies,” Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, last modified\nSeptember 15, 2021, https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/srletters/sr2115.htm.\n\n- 7 -\nIn addition, this rule requires a bank service provider to notify a bank-designated\npoint of contact at each affected customer bank. The notification must occur as soon as\npossible after the service provider determines that a computer-security incident has\noccurred that materially disrupted or degraded, or is reasonably likely to disrupt or\ndegrade, covered services provided to the bank for four or more hours. Since community\nbanks are largely reliant on bank service providers, the notification requirement is meant\nto assist in the process of a bank’s assessment of the severity of the incident, including\nthe breadth and depth of impact and the necessity to implement internal response\nprotocols. This rule is also a good example of efficient regulation, since bank service\nproviders are often best positioned to identify computer-security incidents.\nSince May 2022, banks and bank service providers have been required to comply\nwith the computer-security incident notification rule. The Federal Reserve continues to\nexpect banks to report breaches of sensitive customer information consistent with\napplicable law.7 The new service provider reporting requirement together with the Fed’s\nefforts to improve access to service provider reports should help to streamline small\nbanks’ efforts to monitor their technology service providers.\nThe Federal Reserve System Focus on Cyber Risk\nThe financial system is deeply interconnected. As a result, the Federal Reserve\ncoordinates with industry and a number of domestic and international agencies,\ngovernance bodies, and state and federal regulators to share information and best\npractices to prevent, detect, and recover from cyberattacks. These efforts enable the\n7 See Computer-Security Incident Notification Requirements for Banking Organizations and\nTheir Bank Service Providers, 86 Fed. Reg. 66424 (effective April 1, 2022).\n\n- 8 -\nFederal Reserve to work closely with other regulatory agencies to issue consistent\nguidance and updated examination procedures on critical areas including IT risk\nmanagement and cybersecurity.\nOf course, a critical element of the Fed’s focus on cybersecurity risk is the\nexpectation that a bank will continue to develop internal expertise and build upon that\nexpertise over time. Similarly, the Federal Reserve is committed to ensuring that our\nsupervision is well positioned with appropriate staffing, training, and resources to\nunderstand and effectively examine cyber risk. We recognize that expertise in this area is\ncritical for our success as well, and the Reserve Banks have been actively recruiting\nseasoned cybersecurity and IT specialists, while also working to develop in-house\nexpertise.\nExaminer training is frequently updated to align with current and emerging\nthreats, and the Federal Reserve actively prepares examiners when new cyber risk\nmanagement guidance is released. IT examiners also get industry perspective through\nparticipating in external conferences and training events from cybersecurity experts and\norganizations. In short, the Federal Reserve is committed to ensuring that examiners are\nwell-positioned to supervise the efforts of state member banks and bank holding\ncompanies to address cyber-risks, and to provide more effective outreach and\ncommunication.8 Today’s workshop is just one of the many ways we engage with banks\non cyber-related issues.\nBecause cyber threats evolve quickly, cybersecurity must be equally dynamic in\nits response. Banks must continuously refine their risk management processes. We\n8 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Cybersecurity and Financial System.\n\n- 9 -\nrecognize the importance of regular communication and outreach through events like this\none today. While we expect banks to be in touch with us when an event happens, cyber\nevents should not be the first time a cyber-risk conversation occurs between a bank and\nits regulator. We look forward to working with you to assist in clarifying expectations,\napplying regulatory guidance or seeking feedback on cyber-risk management strategies.\nWe encourage bank management teams to engage with regulatory points of contact\nwhenever questions arise on cyber security matters just as with any other regulatory\nmatter.\nClosing Remarks\nIn closing, the pace of technological change continues to accelerate. We\nrecognize that banks need to adopt new technologies to meet customer demands, to take\nadvantage of efficiencies and cost savings, and to remain competitive in the marketplace.\nAlthough third-party relationships are one avenue for community banks to bring new\ntechnologies online, they must do so with a thorough understanding of the associated\nrisks.\nThe Federal Reserve is committed to working together with the other regulators to\ncontinue providing guidance and resources, like this workshop, to ensure that banks are\nappropriately managing cyber risk.\nThank you again for the invitation be with you today. I hope this workshop\ndemonstrates the value of open communication between bankers, regulators, industry,\nand law enforcement so that we may continue to work together in building resilience in\nthe financial system to ever-evolving cyber risks.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n1:00 p.m. EDT\nSeptember 9, 2021\nCommunity Bank Access to Innovation\nRemarks by\nMichelle W. Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nGovernment Relations Council (GRC) meeting\nsponsored by\nThe American Bankers Association\nWashington, D.C.\n(virtual conference)\nSeptember 9, 2021\n\nIntroduction\nThank you to the American Bankers Association for inviting me to address this\nyear’s Government Relations Council meeting. Although we had all hoped that this\nmeeting would be in person, we will have to settle for the opportunity to convene\nvirtually once again. As we do so, I continue to reflect on the way the pandemic has\ntransformed businesses and sectors of the economy, much as it has changed life for all of\nus. Unfortunately, some aspects of the way we live and interact may be significantly\naltered for some time. But focusing on today, I will share some of my perspectives about\nthe impact of the pandemic on the community bank sector and the potential of technology\nto help meet the challenges of this new environment.\nThe financial services industry has experienced rapid technological change over\nthe past few years, and there is no sign that this change will slow any time soon.\nInnovative technologies were already driving greater efficiency and creating\nopportunities for banks and their customers before the onset of the pandemic. In the past\nyear and a half, these trends have accelerated, and I expect this level of performance to\nestablish a new threshold of industry expectation. Let’s look at education as another\nexample of an industry that has been transformed. We saw schools throughout the\ncountry quickly leverage technology to shift to online learning last year. Schools\nimplemented innovative technology solutions to continue curriculum, and to creatively\nengage students and build virtual student-teacher relationships. While the implications of\na period of prolonged online learning are not yet clear, technology enabled the expansion\nof the range of learning alternatives and essentially prevented the American education\nsystem from grinding to a halt. Some of these new tools will likely continue to be used\n\neven as in-person instruction returned this fall. We are seeing service providers in a\nvariety of industries leverage technology to engage with their customers—from\neducation, to retail shopping, to fitness training and beyond.\nIn the banking industry, technology continues to encourage new ways of\ninteracting with and serving customers that can help banks meet the needs and\npreferences of their customers and communities. Such innovation creates important\nopportunities for banks of all sizes and business models. As regulators, it is also\nimportant that we monitor how banks are adapting and evolving in response to these\nchanges, and that we offer insights and clear expectations to help banks manage\nassociated challenges.\nBroad Innovation Considerations\nCommunity banks continue to play a vital role in supporting local communities.\nTheir ability to thrive in an increasingly digital landscape is critical to the economic well-\nbeing of those communities. Through my regular engagement with community bank\nleaders, I do see innovation thriving. When banks can be agile in developing\nrelationships with third-party providers to meet unique customer needs, they can find\ntheir own paths to innovation. For example, community banks approach the evolving\npayment needs of tech savvy customers from many different angles. Their solutions\ninclude partnering with financial technology (or fintech) companies, developing peer-to-\npeer payment solutions with their core providers, and even hiring outside developers to\ncreate their own apps that will best serve customers’ needs.\nWhile positive trends in community bank innovation are encouraging, I am also\nattuned to the challenges community banks face when seeking to innovate. I have heard\n\nfrom many community bankers about the constraints they face in taking advantage of\nnew technologies—both in terms of the resources and the expertise required to adopt\ninnovative technologies in a responsible manner. The cost of conducting due diligence\non prospective partners can be high for community banks already facing capacity\nconstraints. Seeking a partnership with a newly established fintech company may\nintroduce additional complications. For example, a less experienced partner may be able\nto offer a product that fits a community bank’s needs but may not understand the bank’s\nregulatory obligations or have fully developed operational or compliance frameworks.\nGaps in the ability to demonstrate or guarantee compliance can introduce risk that a\ncommunity bank will need to fully understand and ultimately to manage.\nIn December 2020, I spoke about several initiatives being pursued by the Federal\nReserve targeted at promoting access to innovation for community banks and overcoming\nrelated challenges. Today I am happy to provide updates and announcements about those\ninitiatives. I hope that each provides additional clarity and serves as a valuable resource\nto community banks as they pursue their own innovation strategies.\nCommunity Bank/Fintech Partnership Paper\nThe first initiative is the publication of a paper highlighting some of the promising\nways that community banks are partnering with fintech companies. It lays out some\nimportant issues that banks must consider to maximize the effectiveness of the\npartnership. This paper is the product of an extensive outreach effort with community\nbanks, fintechs, and industry stakeholders. It involved discussions focused on the\nstrategic and tactical decisions that support effective partnerships in a responsible\nmanner.\n\nCommunity banks engage in a range of partnerships with fintechs, each pursued\nfor different reasons, with varying levels of investment of time and resources. The paper\ndescribes key partnership types and the associated benefits, risks, and challenges that\ncommunity banks experience with each type. The paper also identifies fundamental\nconsiderations for effective partnerships as described by community bankers.\nSome valuable insights emerged from our outreach, which may benefit\ncommunity banks at various stages of the innovation process. Two important themes\nstood out: the first is establishing trust and aligning with fintech partners, and second,\nbuilding a long-term culture committed to innovation. Let me elaborate on each of these\nthemes.\nIn our outreach, bankers noted that it is critical for partnerships to be built upon a\nfoundation of mutual trust and alignment of values. In some cases, due diligence efforts\nreveal that potential partners do not share the banks’ values or objectives. One bank, for\nexample, began discussions with a fintech company that could assist it with the bank’s\nPaycheck Protection Program loan originations by providing a customer-facing\napplication portal. After learning that this partner intended to sell the small business\ncustomer information it would obtain, the bank opted out of the partnership. Instead, the\nbank looked to other fintech partners with values more closely aligned with its own.\nHarnessing the full potential of technology innovation also requires a long-term,\nstrategic commitment to innovation. Many bankers spoke of the importance of knowing\nexactly what new technology is solving for, building a team they trust, and securing buy-\nin from both senior management and the staff responsible for implementation. Bankers\nwho have forged successful partnerships don’t innovate for the sake of being innovative\n\nbut instead have a clear vision of their goals. For example, one bank partnered with a\nfintech company to roll out limited banking services to teenagers. Its intention was to\npromote financial literacy among young people in the community and to prepare the bank\nto accommodate the preferences of a new generation. The bank also hired local college\nstudents to work with staff, combining the technological expertise of these more recent\nhires with the deep compliance background of the bank’s long-standing employees.\nInteragency Fintech Due Diligence Guide\nIn addition to the paper, the Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the\nCurrency (OCC), and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) have recently\npublished a vendor due diligence guide to assist community banks with their risk\nassessment when considering a new relationship with a fintech. I have often heard from\ncommunity bankers that the manpower and other costs related to due diligence are\nformidable barriers for banks seeking to establish new third-party relationships. A recent\nsurvey of community banks confirms that burdens related to due diligence are indeed an\nimpediment to new third-party relationships, including those with fintechs.1 This guide\nwas developed to help reduce these burdens by providing a practical resource for\ncommunity banks when assessing the risks of potential fintech partnerships.\nThis optional and customizable resource does not establish new regulatory\nexpectations but it can serve as a starting point for banks in their due diligence process.\nA community bank can tailor how it uses the guide to meet its unique circumstances and\nthe specific risk-management needs posed by each fintech relationship. A community\nbank can also share the guide with potential partners to help them understand the bank’s\n1 Conference of State Bank Supervisors, 2020 CSBS National Survey of Community Banks, 2020 Research and\nPolicy Conference, https://www.csbs.org/system/files/2020-09/cb21publication_2020.pdf.\n\nrisk-management requirements. Specifically, the guide contains relevant considerations,\nsources of information, and illustrative examples within six key areas of due diligence.\nThese include, but, of course, are not limited to, business experience and qualifications,\nfinancial condition, and legal and regulatory compliance. I hope this guide will\nencourage responsible innovation that takes into account the range of potential risks of a\npartnership in addition to its potential benefits.\nRequest for Comment on Interagency Third-Party Risk Management Guidance\nWhile the Federal Reserve will continue to focus on developing resources for the\ncommunity bank sector, it is also important to ensure that guidance is up to date, it\nsupports the evolving range of partnerships, and it is consistent across all banking\nagencies. In July, the Federal Reserve, the OCC, and the FDIC published for comment\nproposed guidance for banks managing the risks of third-party relationships, including\nthose with fintechs. This guidance should reduce unnecessary burden by eliminating\nvariation in supervisory views. It is also my hope that this guidance will better address\nthe landscape of the third-party relationships that exist today. I am particularly interested\nin hearing from a wide range of community banks on whether the guidance is clear,\nhelpful, and appropriately calibrated to address the risks associated with these\narrangements.\nUse of Artificial Intelligence\nThe final topic for my remarks today is the use of artificial intelligence (AI).\nThrough clear, consistent supervisory guidance combined with useful tools and resources,\nsupervisors can continue to support community banks in their efforts to navigate an\nincreasingly complex world. In pursuit of this goal, in March of this year, the agencies\n\npublished a request for information on financial institutions’ use of artificial intelligence.\nAs part of this request for information, the agencies sought details about banks’\nchallenges in developing, adopting, and using this technology, including those challenges\nrelated to third-party services.\nWhile we are still reviewing and processing the feedback, initial reactions from\nFederal Reserve staff indicate that these responses are very helpful in our consideration\nof next steps. So, I would like to thank those who provided comments in response to the\nagencies’ request, especially those pertaining to the use of artificial intelligence by\ncommunity banks. Comment letters confirmed our understanding that at times\ncommunity banks choose to engage with fintech partners and their models to tap into the\nbenefits of AI. We have also heard loud and clear that acting on an interagency basis to\nensure regulatory consistency is very important. As we consider the information\ncollected and the potential next steps, I will encourage Federal Reserve staff to continue\nexploring opportunities to provide supervisory clarity on this topic and more generally to\nconsider ways to help community banks innovate in the application of new technologies.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, I welcome comments and feedback not only on the resources the\nFederal Reserve and other agencies have published recently but also regarding additional\nresources that may be helpful for community banks as they continue to pursue access to\ninnovation. And in the coming weeks, I look forward to participating in two upcoming\ninnovation-focused programs oriented toward community banks. The Federal Reserve\nwill host an “Ask the Fed” program later this fall focused on community banks and\n\nservice providers, and the Board and the Kansas City Reserve Bank will jointly host an\nInnovation Office Hours event later this month.\nFrequent and continued engagement with bankers, fintechs, and other third parties\nhas demonstrated the nuance, complexity, and many considerations involved in\npromoting community bank access to innovation. It is my sincere intention that the\ncommunity bank/fintech partnership paper, the vendor due diligence guide, and proposed\nthird-party, risk-management guidance serve as a foundation upon which the Federal\nReserve will continue to build.",

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Fed Listens: Transitioning to the Post-Pandemic Economy,” a plenary session at\nPolicy Summit 2023: Communities Thriving in a Changing Economy, hosted by\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nCleveland, Ohio\nJune 22, 2023\n\nThank you, President Mester. It is really a pleasure to be here in Cleveland to join\nyou for this Fed Listens event. I’m especially pleased to be a part of today’s discussions\nabout how the economy continues to evolve in the post-pandemic environment.1\nI find that I learn the most valuable information about economic conditions from\nthose who are actually on the ground and working directly in the economy, so I am really\nlooking forward to hearing from today’s panelists to learn from their experiences and\nperspectives.\nAs those of you here today know, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)\nmet last week to discuss the economy and expectations for economic activity. I’ll begin\nthe discussion with my views on the evolution of the U.S. economy since the onset of the\npandemic and on the implications of those developments for the FOMC’s congressionally\nmandated goals of maximum employment and stable prices.\nAfter the initial phases of the pandemic and the lockdowns and forced closures of\nmost businesses, we saw strengthening economic activity accompanied by unacceptably\nhigh and persistent inflation. Over the past several years, as economic activity has\ncontinued to normalize, one consistent strength has been the resilience of the labor\nmarket. Jobs have grown at a solid pace, wages have increased for many workers, and\nwe’ve seen continued low unemployment.\nOn the other side of our mandate, price stability, the U.S. economy experienced\nthe most significant inflation in 40 years, reaching a peak of over 9 percent last year. The\nFOMC has made progress in lowering inflation, but despite the significant tightening of\nmonetary policy, we continue to see unacceptably high levels of inflation.\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nRecent research has argued that pandemic-related supply and demand factors, in\naddition to unusually expansionary fiscal policy, contributed to high inflation. And\nglobal and U.S. supply chain disruptions and shipping and logistics challenges drove up\nprices for a number of goods.2 Many of the supply-side issues have now abated, and the\nFOMC has rapidly increased the federal funds rate to bring demand into better balance\nwith supply. But while headline inflation has declined substantially, it remains far too\nhigh. Therefore, I believe there is more work to do to bring inflation down.\nI supported the FOMC’s decision last week to hold the federal funds rate target\nrange steady and to continue to reduce the Fed’s securities holdings; however, I believe\nthat additional policy rate increases will be necessary to bring inflation down to our target\nover time. Although tighter monetary policy has had some effect on economic activity\nand inflation to date, we have seen core inflation essentially plateau since the fall of\n2022, and I expect that we will need to increase the federal funds rate further to achieve a\nsufficiently restrictive stance of monetary policy to meaningfully and durably bring\ninflation down. I will continue to monitor the incoming data and to look for signs that\ninflation is on a consistent downward path as I consider appropriate monetary policy at\nfuture meetings.\nI’m pleased to see that today’s agenda for the Policy Summit includes a\ndiscussion of small businesses, which are a critical component of a thriving economy.\nOne of the most dramatic changes in the economy since the pandemic has been a\n2 Both points, about the roles of fiscal and the supply side, are addressed in a new study by Bernanke and\nBlanchard. See Ben Bernanke and Olivier Blanchard (2023), “What Caused the U.S. Pandemic-Era\nInflation?” paper presented at “The Fed: Lessons Learned from the Past Three Years,” a conference held at\nthe Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy, Brookings Institution, Washington, May 23,\nhttps://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Bernanke-Blanchard-conference-\ndraft_5.23.23.pdf.\n\n- 3 -\nsustained increase in the creation of new businesses, most of them small. Small\nbusinesses were severely tested during the pandemic, and many stayed in business with\nsubstantial help from the Paycheck Protection Program. In the early stages of the\npandemic, new business formation plunged and then surged as the economy reopened.\nThis surge was followed by another sharp drop in the second half of 2020, and it seemed\nlike business creation was headed back toward its long-term trend. Instead, new business\nformation again accelerated and now runs about 30 percent above its pre-pandemic\ntrend.3 Often, a tight labor market is associated with elevated rates of new business\nformation, but the extent of business startups has been highly unusual. Some have\nspeculated that the shift to more remote work has encouraged more experimentation.\nWhatever the reason, entrepreneurship is the lifeblood of the U.S. economy, and I\nconsider this to be a positive development.\nAnother topic on tomorrow’s agenda is workforce development. Traditionally,\nbusinesses and educational institutions partner to identify skills and develop training\nprograms for the skills needed in the workforce. Community development organizations\nand government can also play a role in enhancing worker skills to meet the demands of a\nhigh-tech economy and increase the labor supply. Since the vast majority of workforce\ndevelopment is financed by the private sector, it is critical to develop enduring\nrelationships to identify and evolve skills training to meet the needs of today’s and\ntomorrow’s workforce.\nThroughout the various stages of the economic recovery, due to the limited\nnumbers of skilled job seekers, businesses reported a willingness to invest in providing\n3 See Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (2023), “Business Applications: Total for All NAICS in the\nUnited States,” Federal Reserve Economic Data, https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BABATOTALSAUS.\n\n- 4 -\nrequired worker training. It appears that now is a good time to identify opportunities for\ninvolvement and investment in these efforts. And I am interested to learn from those of\nyou engaged in workforce development, those who work with small businesses, and\neveryone working to help your communities thrive in the post-pandemic economy.\nHearing this perspective is why the Federal Reserve Board started Fed Listens in\n2019. While economic data can tell us a lot, learning about the experiences behind the\ndata helps bring the economic data to life for me and for my colleagues.

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe 2023 Community Banking Research Conference\nSponsored by the Federal Reserve System, the Conference of State Bank Supervisors, and the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation\nSt. Louis, Missouri\nOctober 4, 2023\n\nIt’s a pleasure to be back in St. Louis for the annual Community Banking Research\nConference. I am grateful for the continued partnership between the Federal Reserve, the\nConference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\n(FDIC), and I would like to thank the conference organizing committee for putting together this\nimportant forum, now in its 11th year. This conference provides an excellent opportunity for\npolicymakers to pause and reflect on the impact of current U.S. bank regulatory policies on the\nfinancial system. At the same time, we should also consider how alterations to these policies\nwill influence the future of the broader banking system.\nWe get a view into these questions—the effectiveness of past policy choices and insights\nthat can help shape future policy reforms—from several aspects of this conference, including, of\ncourse, the research that will be presented and from the results of the CSBS Annual Community\nBank Survey. We also gain insight from the experience and perspectives of our participants:\nyour questions and commentary throughout the next few days can provide important context\nabout the intended and unintended consequences of past policy decisions. And the combined\nperspectives from the wide range of experts gathered here—the researchers, regulators,\npolicymakers, and bankers—will provide us with valuable insights into how to better establish\nand calibrate bank regulatory and supervisory policy in the future.\nResearch, data, and analysis are essential to thoughtful bank regulatory reform. These\ntools can be used to identify issues that must be addressed or remediated; they can help us\nevaluate which elements of the current bank regulatory framework may be effective or\nineffective, and they can help us craft reforms with a clearer understanding of the intended and\nunintended consequences. Together, these tools can help us develop and implement appropriate\nregulatory reforms that do not impair the long-term health or impede the future growth of our\n\n- 2 -\ndiverse U.S. banking system, enabling us to avoid the pitfalls of reforms that fail to accomplish\nthese important goals.\nToday I will begin by discussing some of the research around community banks and the\nrole they play in the U.S. banking system. I will then discuss how this research can inform\npolicy, including by helping us be more sensitive to the unintended consequences of reform, and\ndiscuss how this perspective can be applied to the evaluation of bank mergers and acquisitions.\nFinally, I will mention a few additional areas where I think research could be valuable as an\ninput to the rulemaking process.\nThe Role of Research, Data, and Analysis in Rulemaking\nGood research leads to good policy. This statement will likely sound familiar to many of\nyou, as it was how Jim Bullard, the former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis,\nwould describe one of the key purposes of this conference in past years. Over the years, many of\nthe conference speakers and presenters have echoed that same sentiment since this conference\nfirst launched in 2013.\nIn my remarks today, I will discuss the importance of using an evidence-based approach\nto bank regulatory policy, which has been a long-standing theme and goal of this conference.\nWhile research can provide valuable insights to inform revisions to bank regulatory policy,\nresearch is particularly important when it comes to regulatory efforts that directly affect\ncommunity banks, including changes to modernize the Community Reinvestment Act\nregulations, or reforms to the supervisory standards and expectations for community banks.\nResearch also plays an important role in helping us understand policy reforms that affect\ncommunity banks indirectly, such as the potential that regulatory requirements designed to apply\nonly to larger banks could eventually be pushed down to smaller and community banks.\n\n- 3 -\nResearch and evidence-based rulemaking can insulate the banking system from wide\nswings in policy over time. The banking system faced significant challenges this year, triggered\nby the failures of three large banks in the early spring. As I noted at the time, the policy choices\nmade in responding to these failures will have important, long-term consequences for the U.S.\nbanking system.1 The potentially far-reaching consequences of policy choices we make during\nthis time highlight the importance of clearly identifying the problems we are attempting to\naddress using data to craft solutions that are effective, targeted, and efficient. Bank failures\ndemand scrutiny, but bank failures alone do not justify wholesale revisions to the bank\nregulatory framework. Before we undertake reforms intended to address issues that led to bank\nfailures, we need to develop a comprehensive understanding not only of those root causes, but\nalso of the costs and unintended consequences of potential reforms. Research can protect against\nover-reactive regulation, especially that which is not efficient, calibrated and tailored to address\nthe actual risks and challenges facing the banking system.\nMy insistence upon being guided by evidence does not imply that I am opposed to\nregulatory reforms, but rather that policymakers should be expected to show their work. The\nbanking system is not perfect, and policymakers should continually ask themselves if there are\nways to improve regulation and supervision. I am always open to considering evidence-based\nproposals that address known deficiencies and shortcomings in our regulatory and supervisory\nframework, but any such proposals must stop short of interfering with or stepping into the role of\nmanaging the financial institution.\n1 Michelle W. Bowman, The Evolving Nature of Banking, Bank Culture, and Bank Runs, speech at the 21st Annual\nSymposium of Building the Financial System of the 21st Century: An Agenda for Europe and the United States,\nEuropean Central Bank, Frankfurt, Germany, May 12, 2023,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20230512a.htm.\n\n- 4 -\nI am very pleased that this research and policy conference has continued to thrive and\ngrow over the 11 years since its inception. The research work you all do, especially your efforts\nto develop data and analysis to inform policy, is a critical input to the rulemaking process.\nWhile research is a foundation of prudent regulatory policy, the community banks that\noperate under this framework are the reason we are gathered together at the Saint Louis Federal\nReserve Bank. So, let’s build upon that foundation to highlight the role of community banks in\nthe U.S. banking system.\nThe role of community banks in the U.S. banking system\nAs is necessary and appropriate when speaking at a research conference, let’s start with\nthe research. Research can help reinforce a statement that policymakers often make, which is\nthat banks of all sizes—including community banks—are a critical part of a healthy and vibrant\nbanking system. Today, there are around 4,200 community banks in the United States.2 What\nrole do these community banks play in the current U.S. banking system and in the communities\nthey serve?\nWhile my discussion could not possibly do justice to the vast body of research addressing\nthe important role of community banks in providing credit and supporting their communities, I\nwould like to highlight a few research findings that will likely resonate with community bankers\nand researchers.\nA classic 2002 paper from economist Allen Berger and his co-authors looked at how\nbanks process information to make credit allocation decisions, with the goal of evaluating the\n2 See Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Quarterly Banking Profile, Second Quarter 2023, at 14,\nhttps://www.fdic.gov/analysis/quarterly-banking-profile/qbp/2023jun/qbp.pdf#page=1.\n\n- 5 -\ndifferences between small and large banks.3 The paper provided empirical evidence that small\nbanks have a comparative advantage over large banks in making small business loans due to\ntheir specialized ability to effectively produce “soft information” on smaller firms and make\neffective credit decisions based on this information. In contrast, the paper finds that larger banks\nare at a comparative advantage when lending to larger firms that can produce more “hard\ninformation” that can be easily verified and documented. This research validates and confirms\nthat community banks leverage the power of “relationship banking,” and in doing so, are an\nimportant source of credit to a critical segment of the economy. This finding also helps explain\nwhy community banks were able to more effectively and on a large scale implement the\nPaycheck Protection Program during the pandemic in comparison with large banks.\nAs another, more recent example, a paper published last year by economist Elizabeth\nBerger provides additional context to the role of community banks and the policy issues\ncurrently being debated. This paper focuses on the role community banks play in the creation of\nservice sector jobs. We’ve seen the important role of service-oriented jobs for job growth the\nU.S., as our economy has moved away from manufacturing- and production-based employment\nover the course of many decades. The paper looks at both the extent to which small businesses’\nphysical access to a local, relationship lender supports growth in service sector jobs and explores\nwhether this growth is the result of access to local banking institutions. She found that service\nsector job creation is not only supported by relationship lending from local community banks but\n3 Allen N. Berger, Nathan H. Miller, Mitchell A. Petersen, Raghuram G. Rajan, and Jeremy C. Stein, Does Function\nFollow Organizational Form? Evidence from the Lending Practices of Large and Small Banks, National Bureau of\nEconomic Research, Working Paper 8752 (Cambridge, MA: NBER, February 2002),\nhttps://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w8752/w8752.pdf.\n\n- 6 -\nalso depends on smaller, relationship lenders for growth. Her key finding is unambiguous:\n“finance [providers] must be local to facilitate service job creation.”4\nThese research findings will certainly not surprise community bankers, state bank\nregulators, or those who directly see the positive impact of community banks on their local\ncommunities. But equally important from a policymaker’s perspective is what these papers tell\nus about the impact of a community bank exiting its local community and the surrounding\nmarket. What happens when a small business has no local, community banker that takes the time\nto understand its business, whose business model is based on developing long-term banking\nrelationships? Would small businesses be better served if their banking relationships are with\nlarge, non-relationship-based banking institutions? Or if the only alternative source of credit for\nsmall businesses were from nonbank lenders that are not subject to the same regulatory oversight\nas banks?\nUnderstanding these issues can provide important context, not only to understand the\ncurrent banking landscape, but also to evaluate the merit of reform proposals. Reforms that\nresult in impairing the future of the community banking industry or the elimination of\ncommunity bank charters to mergers or acquisition because of over-regulation or excessive\ncompliance burden can have a significant, adverse impact on small business formation in local\ncommunities given the hurdles new small businesses face when seeking credit. And, while it\nmight be tempting to assume that alternative sources of credit would arise to fill a gap left by\ncommunity banks, this is not a given. For example, while credit unions compete with banks in\n4 E. A. Berger, “Finance in the New U.S. Economy: Local Finance and Service Job Growth in the Post-Industrial\nEconomy,” Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, September 9, 2020, 57(5), 1987–2021,\nhttps://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3718458.\n\n- 7 -\nmany banking markets, credit unions are not, by design, by structure, and by regulation, small\nbusiness lenders.\nSome of the research that will be presented later today and tomorrow explores different\naspects of community banking and the role community banks play in the current banking market.\nI look forward to learning more about this research and how it can serve to inform current and\nfuture bank regulatory reform efforts.\nImplications of the evidence for regulatory policy\nThe research I mentioned earlier has important implications for policymakers, as it\nsuggests that factors that contribute to a reduction in the number and lending footprint of\ncommunity banks could lead to a number of negative impacts, including credit constraints for\nsmall businesses and small business start-ups. This issue could be especially acute when a\nmarket—an underserved market—is left without a community bank as a source of credit. The\nresearch highlights that a banking desert does not only affect individuals, but also can have a\ndevastating impact on small businesses, local job formation, and local economies.\nOne important influence on banking market competition is bank mergers and acquisitions\n(M&A), including the important role of regulators in reviewing and approving these transactions.\nWhile one might naturally assume that approving mergers would always lead to a reduction of\ncommunity bank lending, this result may not always be the case, as in markets viewed as less\nattractive or undesirable to large or regional banks, where the only option for community banks\nto survive may be to consolidate with other community banks in the same geographic area.\nSurely, some level of consolidation is preferable to the closure of community banks and the\nperpetuation of banking deserts or zombie banks.\n\n- 8 -\nAt this conference last year, I described what I called the “New Landscape for Banking\nCompetition” and stressed the urgency of updating and modernizing the framework the federal\nbanking regulators and the Department of Justice use to evaluate the competitive effects of\nproposed bank mergers.5 I offered several commonsense proposals that should guide our\nthinking about how we evaluate bank mergers in the future and underscored how calibrating our\nguidelines correctly is critically important for community banks, given the evidence we have on\ntheir role and impact in providing credit in local communities.\nAmong those ideas was a more systematic inclusion of nonbank competitors and credit\nunions in our competitive landscape. I also proposed factoring in digital banks, and those more\ntraditional banks who have established a strong national digital presence, in our competition\nanalysis. These institutions have proven to be very effective at attracting deposits from\nanywhere in the country and therefore clearly compete with banks in urban and rural markets\nacross the U.S.\nWhy is this important?\n• First, in our current analytical framework, more than 65 percent of banking\nmarkets, as currently defined, would be considered noncompetitive or\n“concentrated” in the language of antitrust, yet the intense competition for\nbanking products and services has only grown, principally from nonbanks. We\nneed to reconcile that.\n• Second, in our current framework, only 5 percent of the currently defined banking\nmarkets are considered highly competitive or “unconcentrated.” In fact, today\n5 Michelle W. Bowman, The New Landscape for Banking Competition, speech at the 2022 Community Banking\nResearch Conference, sponsored by the Federal Reserve, the Conference of State Bank Supervisors, and the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation, St. Louis, Missouri, September 28, 2022,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20220928a.htm.\n\n- 9 -\nthere are 19 states in the U.S. that do not have a single market that would be\nclassified as highly competitive, and only 2 states have one-quarter or more of\ntheir markets designated as highly competitive.6\nIn our current system, many of the competitors and new entrants that we do have\n(nonbanks, fintech firms, credit unions), are systematically ignored. The baseline assumption in\nour current framework is that credit unions do not compete with banks, and yet, just last month\nwe saw five announced acquisitions of community banks by credit unions.7 Despite this trend,\nafter a community bank has been acquired by a credit union, the resulting credit union is no\nlonger viewed as a baseline competitor with other community banks in the market. I think it is\nfair to question whether this view is consistent with reality.\nWe have also seen significant changes in how consumers access banking products and\nservices and observed the migration of many types of loans from the banking sector to nonbanks,\nincluding 1–4 family residential mortgage loans. In fact, the top three mortgage lenders in the\ncountry are nonbanks. Even the largest U.S. banks are behind these nonbanks when it comes to\nmortgage originations.8 But we do not consider these entities as competitors when evaluating a\nmerger involving a community bank.9\n6 Reports of Condition and Income (Call Reports) and the Competitive Analysis and Structure Source Instrument for\nDepository Institutions (CASSIDI).

Many merger proposals are\nregularly forced to go through an extensive, lengthy, and ultimately costly review process. As\nwe’ve seen in recent months, this can result in extending the processing of the underlying\nmerger, sometimes by as much as a year. While there is a lag in the reporting of applications\ndata, data from 2022 show that the average processing time for applications has increased\nsignificantly from 2019 through 2022 for banks of all sizes.10 Information published by the\nFederal Reserve suggests that this increase was primarily the result of the Board’s concurrent\nconsideration of several relatively large and complex M&A proposals requiring Board action.\nData through the first half of 2023 showed some improvement in average processing times, but\nthe volume of approved M&A applications were down substantially from a year ago, while the\nnumber of M&A applications withdrawn in the first half of 2023 has already exceeded the total\nnumber withdrawn in all of calendar year 2022.11\nReported information highlights that community banking organizations also experienced\nincreased processing time for M&A proposals from 2021 to 2022, with the average time\nincreasing from 63 days to 72 days for banks under $1 billion in assets, and from 51 days to 96\n10 See Banking Applications Activity Semiannual Report, July 1–December 31, 2022, (10, 1), table 2 (May 2023),\nhttps://www.communitybanking.org/-\n/media/files/communitybanking/2021/session2_paper2_jorring.pdf?sc_lang=en (showing that for mergers and\nacquisitions proposals considered by the Board, the average processing time for applications increased from 60 days\nin 2019 to 87 days in 2022).\n11 Banking Applications Activity Semiannual Report, January 1–June 30, 2023, (10, 2), table 2 (September 2023)\n(showing 46 M&A applications approved and 12 applications withdrawn in the first half of 2023, compared to 87\nM&A applications approved and 4 applications withdrawn in the first half of 2022, with 11 withdrawn M&A\napplications for the entire calendar year of 2022).\n\n- 11 -\ndays for banks from $1 billion to $10 billion in assets.12 While this average processing timeline\nimproved slightly for community bank M&A applications in the first half of 2023, the most\nrecent semiannual report on banking applications acknowledges that there were fewer M&A\napplications by community banks in the first half of 2023 as compared with the first half of\n2022.13 Applications of any size can raise novel issues or concerns, but this should raise\nconcerns with policymakers.\nWhile the cause of such delays may vary—for example, receiving an adverse comment\non a proposal can also result in a longer application processing period—lengthy review periods\ncan have significant adverse consequences to firms and the banking system. Long delays can\nlead to a number of negative outcomes, including loss of key staff, pauses on new investment\nand development of new consumer and business products, expensive delays in systems\nintegration, reputational risk, and shareholder losses. We’ve also seen that when a merger is\neither approved or denied after a lengthy process, the institutions involved are generally weaker\nthan they would have been had a determination been made in a more reasonable time frame.\nThis is not the recipe for a responsible regulatory system or a healthy banking system.\nOf course, there are alternatives to this view of competition in rural markets. As noted in\nthe research I cited earlier, when looking at the competitive effects of a potential bank merger, it\nmight be more appropriate to look at the extent to which small businesses in a market would\nhave choices that include a community bank when seeking credit, rather than looking only at the\noverall share of deposits an institution would have in a given banking market.\n12 Banking Applications Activity Semiannual Report, July 1–December 31, 2022, (10, 1), table 4,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/semiannual-report-on-banking-applications-20230522.pdf.\n13 Banking Applications Activity Semiannual Report, January 1–June 30, 2023, (10, 2), table 4,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/semiannual-report-on-banking-applications-20230929.pdf.\n\n- 12 -\nThe research sends a strong signal that preserving local relationship-based community\nbanks is vital to local economies. This suggests that a regulatory review framework should not\nbe designed to obstruct mergers that result in stronger, more diversified community banks, with\nrelationship business models. Clearly, these policies need to change, unless the goal is to\nfacilitate further consolidation of banking products and services into the hands of a few national\nplayers.\nThis research has implications beyond just bank merger policy. For example, while bank\nregulatory reform proposals may consider the incremental additional burden on regulated\ninstitutions, this approach may be too narrow a lens, particularly for community banks. The\ncumulative burden of regulations coupled with extensive supervisory guidance can be a\nsignificant headwind for community banks, and local communities and customers served by\ncommunity banks often bear the consequences.\nFuture Areas of Research\nAfter nearly five years serving on the Board of Governors in the seat designated for\nsomeone with community banking or state bank supervisory experience, I am inspired by the\npotential of research to shape policy to reflect the practical reality. Many of you in this room\nhave contributed important research that has energized policy discussions and debates. I am\nconfident that this year’s lineup of research papers will spark similar conversations.\nYear after year, researchers have presented evidence that a banking system with diverse\nbusiness models and sizes is better for business formation and leads to better penetration of\nfinancial services products across all industry sectors. You’ve demonstrated direct benefits to\nsmall businesses (including agriculture-based businesses) and to nontraditional mortgage\n\n- 13 -\nborrowers when smaller, local lenders operate in a market.14 You’ve shown how community\nbanks provide a window into local economies and local industries and provide an overall view of\nthe health of the U.S. economy.\nAs we look past this conference, I’d like to suggest a few areas that warrant further\nresearch and debate.\nReconsideration of the community bank asset threshold\nFirst, our regulatory system is very complex, and one thing that adds to this complexity is\nthe often-inconsistent definitions we use, including the definition of a “community bank.” These\ndefinitions are important—they are used to clarify which requirements and rules apply to a\ncertain type of institution. Policymakers should strive to avoid unnecessary complexity or\nconfusion around these thresholds.\nMost commonly, when we refer to a community bank, we are referring to an institution\nwith less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets. This threshold was referenced in several\nsections of the Dodd-Frank Act as a way to differentiate requirements among banks and was\nexplicitly referred to in the subsequent Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer\nProtection Act.15 Of course, the reality is that our regulatory system applies different rules to\ndifferent institutions across a wide range of asset sizes. For example, the Community\nReinvestment Act regulation includes asset thresholds well below any common understanding of\n14 Daniel Rabetti, Non-Information Asymmetry Benefits of Relationship Lending, working paper, Coller School of\nManagement (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv University, August 2022), https://www.communitybanking.org/-\n/media/files/communitybanking/2022/session1_paper3_rabetti.pdf?sc_lang=en; Claire Brennecke, Stefan Jacewitz,\nand Jonathan Pogach, Shared Destinies? Small Banks and Small Business Consolidation, working paper, July 2020,\nhttps://www.communitybanking.org/-\n/media/files/communitybanking/2020/session1_paper1_pogach.pdf?sc_lang=en.\n15 Dodd-Frank Act, P.L. 111-203, §§ 165(h)(2)(A), (i)(2)(A), 723(a)(3), 763, 1025(a), 1026(a); Economic Growth,\nRegulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, P. L. 115-174, §§ 201 (defining a qualifying community bank as\none with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion), 203 (giving relief to community banks from the Volcker\nrule).\n\n- 14 -\nwhat a community bank is. It simply makes sense that the definition would be rationalized\nacross the bank regulatory framework.\nAre these asset size thresholds properly calibrated, and are the impacts, costs, and\nbenefits to institutions and to customers when banks cross these different thresholds rational?\nAre these thresholds creating the right incentives to promote prudent lending while appropriately\nbalancing risk?\nWe also need a better framework to understand whether we should move beyond simple\nasset size thresholds when tailoring our regulatory rules to the risks that different banks pose\nbased, perhaps not on size, but on business model. Further, is it possible to move beyond asset\nsize thresholds and still apply our dual banking system’s tailored supervisory and regulatory\napproach in a way that is clear and transparent to all stakeholders?\nAgain, research continues to show the benefits that relationship-based commercial\nlenders provide to communities. I believe it is of paramount importance to develop a clear and\ntransparent framework for defining who these lenders are so we can tailor our regulations\nappropriately.\nInsured and uninsured deposits in bank funding models\nA second area that deserves additional research is how banks fund themselves, and\nwhether the deposit infrastructure—including deposit insurance—could be improved, including\nto make the banking system more resilient during times of financial stress. As we saw earlier\nthis year, the speed at which customers can move money using modern technology is\nunprecedented. Much like our competition framework, we need to ensure that the framework\nthat we put in place today supports the banking system of tomorrow and not the banking system\nof yesterday.\n\n- 15 -\nWith respect to deposit insurance reform, the FDIC laid an important foundation when it\nreleased its report on the Options for Deposit Insurance Reform in May 2023.16 The framework\nshared the FDIC’s views of the pros and cons of either providing unlimited deposit insurance\ncoverage or targeted coverage based on different account types. The report suggested that\ntargeted coverage might be the best option for maintaining financial stability and protecting\ndepositors. We need to ensure that our deposit insurance infrastructure can support banking\nsector stability in the face of the challenges posed by today’s technology.\nThis report, however, should not just serve as a call for policymakers to react to a narrow\nscope of options developed in reaction to a bank run crisis but should be seen as a call to the\nresearch community to provide evidenced research and analysis on these and other options. I see\nan opportunity for extensive stakeholder engagement and public dialogue on the topic of deposit\ninsurance and the evolution of deposit practices. In my conversations with community bankers\nthis spring, I learned that a large number of concerned customers called their local community\nbanker with questions about deposit insurance. Community bankers have direct experience and\ninsights into the benefits and challenges of our current deposit insurance infrastructure. Their\ninsights can complement research on this topic and can bring a valuable and realistic\npractitioner’s perspective to this significant matter of public policy.\nConclusion\nAs I reflect on the past seven years of my participation in this conference, first as a state\nbank commissioner, and now as a member of the Board of Governors, I am struck by how the\napproach taken by this conference is, in some ways, a smaller scale model of what I see as an\neffective approach to policymaking:\n16 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Options for Deposit Insurance Reform, (Washington: FDIC, May 1,\n2023), https://www.fdic.gov/analysis/options-deposit-insurance-reforms/index.html.\n\n- 16 -\n• bring researchers and practitioners together to discuss important policy issues that\nare grounded in research, and\n• leverage the insights and experiences from a wide range of stakeholders to\nimprove our understanding of both the key issues and of the policy options.\nI’d like to commend all who have gathered today for participating in person to discuss the\nresearch and to learn from the work and experiences of one another. This conference contributes\na wealth of insights and evidence that lead to better policy choices and can help us understand\nwhere future challenges to the banking industry might emerge.\nOur call to action coming from this conference, in my view, is to resist the urge to act in a\nreactionary way when addressing policy matters. Instead, policymakers should choose to\nexercise restraint and patience, consider the evidence, and strive for well-calibrated policies that\nfully incorporate the costs, benefits, and impacts of reform and complement, rather than\ncomplicate or contradict, the existing regulatory framework.",

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nFlorida Bankers Association Leadership Luncheon Events\nMiami, Florida\nFebruary 27, 2024\n\nI would like to thank the Florida Bankers Association and your new President and CEO,\nKathy Kraninger, for the invitation to share my thoughts with you today.1 It is really a pleasure\nto join you here in Florida to discuss current trends in bank regulation, and to learn the issues on\nyour mind, especially about the path of regulatory reform, and your views on local banking and\neconomic conditions in the communities you serve. I find great value in spending time outside\nof Washington, D.C. These conversations provide valuable insights to inform my work at the\nFederal Reserve—both for my understanding of the economy and the banking environment.\nBefore discussing bank regulation, I would like to briefly touch on the economy and\nmonetary policy.\nMonetary Policy\nOver the past two years, the Federal Open Market Committee has significantly tightened\nthe stance of monetary policy to address high inflation. At our most recent meeting in January,\nwe voted to continue to hold the federal funds rate target range at 5¼ to 5½ percent and to\ncontinue to reduce the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings.\nWe have seen progress on inflation over the past year, with the 12-month readings\nthrough December of total and core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation both\nbelow 3 percent for the first time since the spring of 2021. However, the latest consumer price\nindex (CPI) and producer price index (PPI) inflation data through January suggest slower\nprogress in bringing inflation down toward our 2 percent target. Throughout this time, economic\nactivity has remained strong with ongoing strength in consumer spending. We had also seen\nsigns of the labor market coming into better balance, but recent strong jobs reports—including\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nupward revisions to employment growth—show a continued tight labor market. Last year, the\naverage pace of job gains slowed and the labor force participation rate rose through November,\nwith the unemployment rate edging up to 3.7 percent. In recent months, however, job growth\nhas rebounded and the labor force participation rate declined, retracing some of its earlier gains.\nAt its current setting, our monetary policy stance is restrictive and appears to be\nappropriately calibrated to reduce inflationary pressures. As I’ve noted recently, my baseline\noutlook continues to be that inflation will decline further with the policy rate held steady, but I\nstill see a number of upside inflation risks that affect my outlook. These include risks from\ngeopolitical developments, including the risk of spillovers from geopolitical conflicts and the\nextent to which food and energy markets and supply chains remain exposed to these influences.\nThere is also the risk that a loosening in financial conditions and additional fiscal stimulus could\nadd momentum to demand, stalling any further progress or even causing inflation to reaccelerate.\nFinally, there is a risk that continued labor market tightness could lead to persistently high core\nservices inflation, as illustrated by the uptick in 12-month core services CPI inflation in January.\nRecent labor market data suggest ongoing elevated wage growth as some businesses continue to\nreport above-average wage increases to compensate for elevated prices and high inflation.\nGiven these risks, and the general uncertainty regarding the economic outlook, I will\ncontinue to watch the data closely as I assess the appropriate path of monetary policy. The\nfrequency and extent of data revisions over the past few years, as seen in the most recent\nemployment report, make the task of assessing the current state of the economy as well as\npredicting how the economy will evolve even more challenging, and I will remain cautious in my\napproach to considering future changes in the stance of policy. Should the incoming data\ncontinue to indicate that inflation is moving sustainably toward our 2 percent goal, it will\n\n- 3 -\neventually become appropriate to gradually lower our policy rate to prevent monetary policy\nfrom becoming overly restrictive. In my view, we are not yet at that point. Reducing our policy\nrate too soon could result in requiring further future policy rate increases to return inflation to 2\npercent in the longer run.\nIt is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course. My colleagues and I\nwill make our decisions at each meeting based on the incoming data and the implications for the\noutlook. While the current stance of monetary policy appears to be at a restrictive level that will\nbring inflation down to 2 percent over time, I remain willing to raise the federal funds rate at a\nfuture meeting should the incoming data indicate that progress on inflation has stalled or\nreversed. Restoring price stability is essential for achieving maximum employment and stable\nprices over the longer run.\nNotable Developments in Bank Regulation\nTurning back to bank regulation and supervision, as I look at the bank regulatory\nframework agenda, I am struck by the sheer volume of matters that have recently been\ncompleted, that have been proposed, and that are in the pipeline. These reforms touch on a wide\nrange of topics that directly or indirectly impact banks of all sizes. I expect that the regulatory\nagenda will remain very active for the foreseeable future, adding further to the already\nsignificant collection of rules, guidance, and supervisory changes made to date. While I\nsupported some of these recent changes, the vast number of finalized, proposed, and potential\nchanges suggest a lack of prioritization—whether we have effectively identified actual risks to\nthe banking system and devoted resources to the most pressing of these issues. The significant\nvolume of revisions also poses a real problem for banks that must review, provide feedback, and\nimplement changes.\n\n- 4 -\nThe primary goal of prudential bank regulation and supervision is to promote a safe and\nsound banking system. Although policymakers may agree on this shared objective, we\nsometimes disagree on the best path to achieve it. As we consider modifications to our\nregulatory framework, an important question arises about how we identify and implement areas\nfor change. To be sure, we should focus on the areas of greatest risk, addressing known\nvulnerabilities and shoring up the framework to address emerging risks. But we also need to\nfocus on efficiency, efficiency in how we deliver on our safety and soundness goals, and how\nregulatory reforms affect the banking market, the economy, and those who use banking services.\nWe should also ensure, in our pursuit of reform, that our efforts result in a bank framework that\nis appropriately tailored and calibrated.\nSo today, I will offer my reflections on bank regulation, focusing on notable recent\ndevelopments. As I have said in the past, more is not always better when it comes to the rules,\nguidance, expectations, and supervisory standards that apply to banks.2 In many ways, more can\nbe counterproductive and harmful when it comes to regulatory reform. When reforms are\ndisproportionate to risk or fail to promote safety and soundness in an efficient way, those\nchanges can harm the competitiveness of the U.S. banking system, impede the ability of banks to\nmanage their risks, and even result in the allocation of capital by regulators instead of by bank\nmanagement. Even if the consequences of reforms are unintended, we must consider those\nconsequences and how they may shape the future of the banking system.\n2 See Michelle W. Bowman, The Path Forward for Bank Capital Reform, (speech at Protect Main Street, sponsored\nby the Center for Capital Markets at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Washington, D.C., January 17, 2024),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20240117a.pdf.\n\n- 5 -\nRecently, we have seen many rule revisions, proposals, and ideas for reform, including\nsupervisory reform. I expect that this activity will continue to feature prominently in the coming\nmonths.\nCapital Reform\nStarting with the proposed changes to bank capital requirements, as you all know, the\nfederal banking agencies have published several proposed reforms to the capital framework.\nThese include proposals to implement Basel III “endgame” capital reforms, to reform the G-SIB\nsurcharge, and to introduce new long-term debt requirements for all banks with over $100 billion\nin assets. These reforms pose real challenges in striking the right balance between safety and\nsoundness on the one hand, and efficiency and fairness on the other. Capital plays a critical role\nin promoting the safe and sound operation of banks and supporting confidence in the broader\nbanking system. Higher levels of capital improve a bank’s resilience to stress and increases the\ncapacity of a bank to absorb losses, protecting depositors, the deposit insurance fund, and other\ncreditors.\nAt the same time, capital has a cost, and regulatory capital requirements apply to all\nbanks, not just to those that fail. Higher capital requirements generally are passed through to\ncustomers in the form of increased costs for financial services, or ultimately reduced availability\nof these services in the market. The cost of bank capital also influences whether activities\noccur within the banking system or in non-bank entities outside the banking system.\nSo, the question then becomes, what’s next? The Basel comment period has closed, as\nhas the comment period for submission of information for the quantitative impact study. The\nagencies continue to review the extensive stakeholder feedback and identify key areas of\nconcern. This deliberative process should help regulators better understand the implications of\n\n- 6 -\nthe proposed capital changes—both the scale of the proposed change in capital requirements and\nthe tradeoffs between the benefits of increased safety and soundness compared to the intended\nand unintended consequences.\nSince the proposal was published, the agencies received numerous comments identifying\nelements of the proposal that will have significant downstream effects on consumers, businesses,\nand the broader economy. Therefore, regulators need to thoroughly understand these\nconsequences in a comprehensive way before moving forward with changes of the scope and\nmateriality contemplated in the proposal. The agencies also have an obligation to consider\nchanges to enhanced risk-based capital rules in the broader context of other existing and\ncontemplated regulatory requirements, which requires a clear understanding of the cumulative\nimpacts and the implications for U.S. economic activity, the structure of the financial system,\nand financial stability, and whether any reforms are consistent with our requirement to tailor\nregulation.\nMy hope is that policymakers will take this opportunity to make significant revisions to\nthe proposal to address the concerns raised by the public, and that I will be able to support the\nnext step on Basel capital reforms.\nCommunity Reinvestment Act\nShifting away from capital, last year, the federal bank regulators adopted a new final rule\nto implement the Community Reinvestment Act. Unfortunately, I was not able to support the\nfinal rule. While the final rule included several positive changes from the proposal, those\nchanges ultimately did not outweigh the rule’s extensive shortcomings. The final rule is\nunnecessarily complex, overly prescriptive, and directs outcomes that result in disproportionately\ngreater costs than benefits, adding significantly greater regulatory burden for all banks, but\n\n- 7 -\nespecially for community banks. Even the foundational question—are banks doing enough to\nsupport their communities?—is left unanswered in the final rule, perhaps because there is no\nevidence to support the agencies’ assumption that banks are falling short.\nFirst and foremost, the final rule applies the same regulatory expectations for small banks\nas it does for the largest banks. For example, a wide range of community banks—those with\nmore than $2 billion in assets—are treated as “large banks” under the final rule, forcing these\nbanks to comply with the same CRA evaluation standards as a bank with $2 trillion in assets.\nThe sheer lack of recognition that these banks are fundamentally different, with different balance\nsheets, customers, and business models, misses an important opportunity to appropriately tailor\nCRA expectations to a bank's size, risk, service area, and business model. This approach is a\nradical departure within the regulatory framework where no other provision considers a bank\nwith $2 billion in assets as “large.”\nAs a result, many community banks will be subject to new and materially enhanced\nrequirements, including a new retail lending test, significantly expanded assessment areas, and\nincreased data and reporting obligations. This intentional blurring of commonly accepted\nregulatory standards for large banks and community banks is problematic as it will result in\nincreased regulatory expectations for smaller banks and a more one-size-fits-all approach to\nbanking regulation rather than a tailored and calibrated system. The unsupported increases in\nburden and cost associated with these changes are simply disproportionate when applied to\ncommunity banks, in a way that will undoubtedly constrain the resources that community banks\ncan devote to supporting their communities.\nIf the final rule’s new standards were in place today, based on data from 2018 through\n2020, there would be a nearly tenfold increase in banks with a “Needs to Improve” CRA rating.\n\n- 8 -\nIn some ways, this highlights a fallacy underlying these rule changes: that the low number of\nbanks with a “Needs to Improve” rating itself demonstrates that the standards of the CRA\nregulations have been too lax historically, ignoring the more plausible explanation that banks are\ncommitted to supporting their communities. It is unwarranted for the federal banking agencies to\nmaterially increase these requirements on banks, resulting in a downgrade of currently\nsatisfactory performance to “Needs to Improve,” without a thorough, data-supported analysis\nthat justifies a recalibration evidenced by actual shortcomings in bank activities.\nPerhaps most concerning about the CRA rule is that it may incentivize banks to reduce\ntheir support for certain communities, forcing them to pare back lending in areas where there is a\nneed for credit accessibility. The addition of retail lending assessment areas and outside retail\nlending areas, coupled with a new requirement for large banks to include an entire county instead\nof a partial county as an assessment area, may ultimately incentivize firms to pull back lending\nor even to close branches.\nI am confident that banks will attempt to make the best of this new rule, and I am certain\nthat they will continue to support their communities regardless of the rule’s requirements. But I\nregret that this new final rule may complicate, and in some instances frustrate, the important\ngoals of the CRA.\nRegulation II and Debit Card Interchange Fees\nAlongside the rule changes to the CRA, one of the other most significant proposals this\npast year would significantly lower the debit card interchange fee cap under Regulation II.3 The\nDodd-Frank Act mandates that the Federal Reserve establish a cap on debit interchange fees that\n3 Debit Card Interchange Fees and Routing, 88 Fed. Reg. 78,100-132 (November 14, 2023),\nhttps://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2023-11-14/pdf/2023-24034.pdf.\n\n- 9 -\nis reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer with respect to debit\ntransactions.4 I am concerned about the data underpinning this proposal, and the potential\nunintended consequences of moving forward with such a change, including the proposal to\nautomatically adjust the cap every two years based on an incomplete formula that may not\naccount for all of the relevant variables.\nAs published, the Board’s proposal was based on survey data collected by the Board.5 I\nremain concerned that the analysis underpinning this rulemaking overlooks gaps in the reported\ndata and ignores the broader context—the wide range of business models and sizes of issuers\nsubject to the rule, the potential effect of the rule on bank capital and earnings, the benefits and\ncosts to consumers, and the cumulative effect of regulatory changes, particularly those that affect\nthe pricing and availability to consumers of low-cost or no-cost debit card programs. The data\nalso does not take into account recent revisions to Regulation II, revisions that may have the\nunintended consequence of increasing the incidence of fraud in bank debit card programs, trends\nthat are not reflected in the data due to the timing of the change, and also would not be taken into\naccount in calibrating the new debit interchange fee cap.6 As proposed, the rule would also\nadopt a “rough justice” approach by establishing a single cap that applies to all issuers, which\nwill leave nearly one third of issuers unable to recover even the subset of costs that are taken into\naccount in calculating the debit interchange fee.\nOn January 22, 2024, the Board announced that the comment period on the proposed\nrevisions to Regulation II has been extended until May 12, 2024, and concurrently published\n4 15 U.S.C. § 1693o-2.\n5 Debit Card Interchange Fees and Routing, 88 Fed. Reg. 78,105-6; Form FR 3064a, FR 3064b.\n6 See dissenting statement, “Statement on Final Amendments to Regulation II to Clarify the Prohibition on Network\nExclusivity by Governor Michelle W. Bowman,” news release, October 3, 2022,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bowman-statement-20221003.htm.\n\n- 10 -\nadditional data to inform the public about the basis for the proposal.7 I look forward to\nreviewing the comments and hearing feedback from stakeholders on this proposal, specifically as\nit relates to identifying any issues or concerns with the data that informed the original calibration\nof the proposal, and any potential gaps in this data or the supporting analysis. I remain\nconcerned about the unintended consequences of this proposal.\nWithout question, an ongoing, permanent decrease in debit card interchange fees will\nhave consequences for banks of all sizes, and more importantly, for their customers that rely on\ndebit card products for payments. Banks may be reluctant to discontinue their retail debit card\nprograms, even with revisions to the interchange fee cap. However, I think it is likely that if this\nproposal is finalized, banks may need to make some tough decisions about the path forward.\nWill they need to recover the lost income by imposing higher borrowing costs on bank\ncustomers, or where possible increasing other fees? To the extent banks are relying on fee\nincome to support debit card programs, will this be a long-term, sustainable source of revenue if\nthe banking agencies continue to target other fees for elimination? How will this change impact\nlow- and moderate-income (LMI) individuals and families? For example, will banks be forced\nto discontinue their lowest margin products that target underserved populations, and what will\nthe cost of such changes mean for financial inclusion? How would this change impact the\nsuccess of financial inclusion efforts encouraged by federal banking agencies, such as Bank On\nprograms?\n7 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Federal Reserve Board announces it will extend the\ncomment period on its interchange fee proposal until May 12, 2024 and published additional related data,” news\nrelease, January 22, 2024, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20240122a.htm.\n\n- 11 -\nThe pain here will likely be felt broadly by banks and their customers, and will continue\nto trickle down to smaller institutions, including community banks, even if those banks are not\ndirectly subject to the interchange fee cap. The consequences for bank debit card programs, and\nthe customers who rely on those programs, may be significant.\nBank Mergers and Acquisitions\nAnother policy area where I expect to see ongoing federal regulatory attention is in the\nbank merger application process. Some policymakers and the Department of Justice have\nstrongly signaled an intent to revisit and significantly tighten the existing standards and the\nrelated economic analysis used in that process. This ongoing scrutiny of mergers has encouraged\na growing public focus on the role of federal banking regulators in reviewing merger\napplications, and sparked a concern about whether that process is fair, transparent, and consistent\nwith the applicable statutory requirements. This public scrutiny is increasing in light of the\ngrowing interest of bank regulators in revisiting standards and processes for approval.8\nThe past year certainly has not improved the outlook for the bank merger process. While\nthe idiosyncratic features of each bank merger transaction can make it difficult to predict how\nlong the regulatory approval process may take, I remain concerned about delays in average\nprocessing times and that subsequent regulatory actions could lead to further delays. The\nreported data on merger processing timelines may also understate the true timeline for\nprocessing, particularly to the extent reported data may not reflect preliminary discussions with\nregulators, pre-filings with regulators, and may not reflect technical agency “acceptance” of an\n8 See, e.g., Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, “Business Combinations Under the Bank Merger Act: Notice\nof Proposed Rulemaking,” OCC Bulletin 2024-4, January 29, 2024, https://occ.gov/news-\nissuances/bulletins/2024/bulletin-2024-4.html.\n\n- 12 -\napplication—thereby triggering the regulatory processing clock—until well after an application\nhas been received by the agency.9\nAs all bankers know, application processing delays can be quite harmful, resulting in\ngreater operational risk, increased expenses due in part to contract delays, reputational risk, and\nstaff attrition due to the prolonged uncertainty. In the broader context, reducing the efficiency of\nbank mergers and acquisitions may also act as a deterrent to a healthy evolution of the banking\nsystem. Taken together, reducing merger or acquisition activity could have the consequence of\nprohibiting transactions that may preserve the presence of banks in rural or underserved areas;\ntransactions that may further prudent growth strategies or that may result in increased\ncompetition with larger peers.\nAnd yet, there has been little discussion or recognition of how the regulatory process can\nbe enhanced to improve the speed and timeliness of regulatory decision-making on these\napplications. In my view, the regulators would be well-served by evaluating the merger review\nprocess with the goal of promoting efficiency and fairness. Stakeholders who are concerned\nabout the current bank merger review procedures and policies should consider direct engagement\nwith regulators on these issues, including the recently launched mandatory review of regulatory\nburden under the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act of 1996.10\nClimate Change\nBanks face many well-known, material risks, including credit risk, interest rate risk,\nliquidity risk, cyber risk, and many others. New risks continue to emerge as the banking system,\n9 See, e.g., Hurry v. FDIC, 589 F. Supp. 3d 100 (D.D.C. 2022).\n10 Statement by Governor Michelle W. Bowman, “Federal Bank Regulatory Agencies Seek Comment on\nInteragency Effort to Reduce Regulatory Burden,” news release, February 6, 2024,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20240206a1.htm.\n\n- 13 -\ntechnology, and customer preferences evolve. In the aftermath of the bank failures last spring,\nboth bank management and bank regulators have refocused their efforts related to managing\nmaterial risks to improve early identification and to facilitate prompt actions to mitigate the\nbuildup of risks.\nLast October, following on an earlier proposal in 2022, the agencies issued principles for\nclimate-related financial risk management for large institutions.11 While climate change is a\npublic policy issue in the U.S. and globally, the unique focus on this particular risk could lead\none to believe that financial risk associated with climate change is a key risk facing the banking\nindustry, or that somehow banks with exposures to these risks have not been appropriately\nconsidering climate-related financial risks in managing their material risks. The supporting\ndocuments published in connection with the principles do not support this view, however, and\nraise questions about whether they further the goal of appropriate risk management at regulated\ninstitutions.\nBanks of all sizes have long been expected to manage all material risks associated with\ntheir activities. Bankers know that their risks vary based on their business models and loan\nportfolios, among other things—banks that make loans in drought or flood-prone areas, or\ntornado-prone areas, or areas that experience wildfires, take those risks into consideration in the\nunderwriting and ongoing monitoring of loans and loan portfolios. Risk management as applied\nto weather-related financial risks is not new, and this recent approach misses the larger context of\nhow banks manage all material risks.\n11 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency, “Agencies issue principles for climate-related financial risk management for large\nfinancial institutions,” joint press release, October 24, 2023,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20231024b.htm.\n\n- 14 -\nSpecifically, the prescription to address this perceived deficiency in risk management,\nrather than providing clarity and concrete expectations, creates unclear expectations and, as a\nresult, gives examiners almost unlimited supervisory discretion to interpret what expectations are\nappropriate for regulated institutions. We will need to be vigilant to ensure these expectations\nare appropriate and proportionate.\nUnder the guidance, banks are expected to monitor and measure climate-related risks\nover indefinite time horizons—or put another way, engage in expensive, ongoing data collection\nand speculate about very uncertain effects far into the future—in the context of their lending\nactivities. Banks are also expected to engage in scenario analysis, without a clear roadmap as to\nwhat such an analysis should consider. This will likely lead to detrimental impacts on low- and\nmoderate-income communities by increasing the cost of or reducing the availability of credit in\nthose communities. I think we can all agree that examiners should not criticize banks for prudent\nlending in LMI communities. I am concerned that the net effect of this guidance will be\nincreased costs for banks subject to it, creating further differences between banks and non-bank\nlenders engaged in the same activities.\nThe effects of this guidance—and follow-on efforts by other regulators—could be\nmaterial even for banks that are not directly subject to the rules. The principles themselves note\nthat “all financial institutions, regardless of size, may have material exposures to climate-related\nfinancial risks….”12 Notwithstanding the carveout in the principles for institutions with less than\n$100 billion in assets, I suspect banks may take little comfort from this nominal carveout in light\nof the language in the principles, and other government agencies focused on escalating climate\nrisk above many other more material and present-tense risks. For example, the U.S. Treasury\n12 88 Fed. Reg. 74,183-184 (October 30, 2023).\n\n- 15 -\nhas published principles for net-zero financing and investment that focus on indirect greenhouse\ngas emissions included in a creditor company’s “value chain.”13 While these principles are\ndescribed as wholly voluntary, they too could exert significant pressure on banks to reprioritize\ntheir risk management function, prioritizing climate change risks that may be immaterial to a\nbank over more pressing risks.\nThe Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has also published a report that suggests\nFederal Home Loan Banks (FHLB) must assess risks related to climate and natural disasters “on\nthe FHLBanks’ businesses, their members, and the communities they serve.”14 The vast majority\nof FHLB member banks fall well below the $100 billion threshold, but now may fall within\nFHLB’s climate assessment requirements, even while being excluded from the scope of their\nprimary regulator’s climate guidance. In the context of these many competing directives, banks\nmay be puzzled about supervisory expectations, particularly when a “carveout” in supervisory\nguidance from a bank’s primary banking regulator seems to be at odds with the guidance itself,\nand with expectations from other government agencies.\nBanks of all sizes are likely to continue facing regulatory pressure to collect increasing\namounts of data. While it is imperative that banks manage all material risks that they face,\nfocusing on climate risk—independent of the many other risks banks must manage in\nsuccessfully running their businesses—could force banks to reallocate resources to meet unclear\nand confusing regulatory expectations related to perceived nebulous climate-related financial\n13 “Principles for Net-Zero Financing & Investment,” U.S. Department of the Treasury, September 2023,\nhttps://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/NetZeroPrinciples.pdf.\n14 “FHLBank System at 100: Focusing on the Future,” Federal Housing Finance Agency, p. 38,\nhttps://www.fhfa.gov/AboutUs/Reports/ReportDocuments/FHLBank-System-at-100-Report.pdf.\n\n- 16 -\nrisks. This approach has the potential to undermine safety and soundness, creating an expensive\ndistraction from more pressing areas of concern.\nLiquidity\nFollowing the bank failures last spring, significant attention has been paid to the alleged\n“lessons learned” creating a path for regulatory reform efforts. This has generated discussion\namong both policymakers and the public on how to think about liquidity regulation: Should\nthese requirements be expanded to a broader range of institutions? Should the calibration or\noperation of liquidity requirements like the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), and Net Stable\nFunding Ratio (NSFR) be modified? Should we consider new liquidity requirements, and if so,\nwhat form should they take?\nWhile these are important policy questions, and are certainly worthy of discussion, it is\nimportant to identify exactly what problem we are trying to solve. To those ready to march\nsteadily forward without fully considering the cumulative impacts of change currently being\nconsidered, this may seem like a step backwards in the policymaking process. But it is not\nprudent policymaking to create solutions to solve perceived problems that have not been\nidentified, researched, and supported with evidence and data. We must clearly understand and\nagree upon the problem before seriously proposing and considering solutions.\nAnswering this question has been complicated by the long shadow of the banking stress\nlast spring, and the hurried and incomplete analyses prepared in the aftermath of those failures.\nThese early efforts—efforts that relied on admittedly incomplete analyses and limited\nperspective—have generated many policy prescriptions, without fully diagnosing the problem.\nAs a threshold matter, we must recognize that liquidity regulation alone is not a panacea.\nLiquidity regulation does not result in more focused and nimble supervision. Liquidity\n\n- 17 -\nregulation alone does not improve the risk management at regulated institutions. Liquidity\nregulation also has the potential to impose significant costs and limit the lending capacity and\nbusiness operations of banks, which we must recognize and take into account before imposing\nany new requirements.\nBut even with these caveats, liquidity regulation should be part of the overall reform\ndiscussion. We must think about liquidity broadly, including the sources and uses of liquidity\nthat institutions use today, including the Federal Reserve’s Discount Window and its role as\nlender of last resort, advances from the FHLBs, and other sources that may be available in the\nmarket. In this context, we must be honest about the capability and capacity of these resources,\nand the challenges and limits of these tools. For example, in considering the effective operations\nof the Fed’s Discount Window, recent anecdotes from bankers suggest there is significant room\nfor improving the efficiency of Discount Window operations. We must acknowledge and\naddress such shortcomings if we are truly committed to effective solutions. This requires\nhumility and deference from policymakers, and a willingness to listen to those with a practical\nunderstanding of and familiarity with these tools in the context of managing banks.\nRevisions to the liquidity framework must also be coordinated, to ensure that reform\nefforts are complementary and can support the banking system’s liquidity needs. When\nconsidering new liquidity requirements, we must think about not only calibration and scope, but\nalso the unintended consequences of any such requirements, and whether these measures will be\neffective during stressed conditions. We may not know whether aggregate reforms to the\nliquidity framework are effective until they are tested under stress, but before that point, we can\nimprove the effectiveness of liquidity reforms by following a serious, methodical approach.\n\n- 18 -\nClosing Thoughts\nAs bankers focused on ensuring your business continues to support your customers and\nlocal economy, it may be tempting to distance yourself from this relatively recent wave of\nregulatory reforms. And frankly, I wouldn’t blame you if your initial reaction is to focus on your\nbank and hope that this regulatory tidal wave passes by. But I urge you to resist that temptation.\nPolicymakers cannot fulfill the responsibility of promoting a safe and sound banking\nsystem if we ignore efficiency, tailoring, and appropriate calibration of requirements in the\nreform agenda. These tenets should be central to the reform process. But to ensure that we\nappropriately prioritize these goals, policymakers must have the benefit of your engagement and\nfeedback about what is working, what is not, and what are the consequences of regulations that\ndo not support safety and soundness in an efficient and fair way.\nYour engagement identifies and clarifies the real-world consequences of these far-\nreaching proposals, enabling us to pursue data-driven reforms, those directed at the most salient\nrisks and issues facing the banking system. Thank you for your engagement, the engagement of\nyour banking associations, and for working to ensure a thriving banking system in the great state\nof Florida.\nThank you, and I look forward to our conversation.",

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe American Bankers Association Community Banking Conference\nOrlando, Florida\nFebruary 13, 2023\n\nI would like to thank the American Bankers Association for the invitation to speak to you\ntoday. It is a pleasure to be with you and to have the opportunity to share some of my views on\nbanking regulation and supervision. Of course, as you know, the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC) recently held its first meeting of the year. So, before getting into the\nsubstance of my remarks, I’ll provide some brief thoughts on the economic outlook and\nmonetary policy.1\nMonetary Policy\nLet me begin with the FOMC’s effort to lower inflation, which continues to be much too\nhigh. Stable prices are necessary for a healthy economy and to support a labor market that works\nfor everyone. As a member of the FOMC, I remain focused on bringing inflation down to our 2\npercent goal.\nOver the past year, the Committee has taken forceful actions to address unacceptably\nhigh inflation by significantly raising the federal funds rate and reducing our balance sheet\nholdings of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities. At our most recent meeting, we\ncontinued on that path by further increasing the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis\npoints to 4½ to 4¾ percent. I expect that ongoing increases will be appropriate to bring the\nfederal funds rate to a sufficiently restrictive level and that it will need to remain there for some\ntime to restore price stability.\nThe economic outlook and the outlook for inflation continue to be highly uncertain.\nGlobal and domestic factors are contributing to heightened uncertainty, and I expect that we will\ncontinue to be surprised by economic and geopolitical developments and by the incoming data.\nWhile we have seen modestly lower inflation readings in recent months, overall inflation remains\n1 These views are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board or the\nFederal Open Market Committee.\n2\n\nhigh. Measures of core services inflation have been persistently elevated, and labor demand\nexceeds the supply of available workers, which is leading employers to increase wages in an\neffort to retain and attract workers. The ongoing tightness in the labor market puts upward\npressure on inflation, even if some components of inflation moderate due to improvements in\nsupply-side factors. The longer high inflation persists, the more likely it is that households and\nbusinesses may come to expect higher inflation in the longer term. Should that be the case, the\nFOMC’s job of lowering inflation would be even more challenging.\nGiven the highly uncertain environment, my views on the future path of monetary policy\nwill continue to be informed by the incoming data and its implications for the outlook. I will\ncontinue to look for consistent evidence that inflation remains on a downward path when\nconsidering further rate increases and at what point we will have achieved a sufficiently\nrestrictive stance for the policy rate.\nWe are still far from achieving price stability, and I expect that it will be necessary to\nfurther tighten monetary policy to bring inflation down toward our goal. Doing so will likely\nlead to subdued growth in economic activity and some softening in labor market conditions.\nWhile there are costs and risks to tightening monetary policy to lower inflation, I see the costs\nand risks of allowing inflation to persist as far greater. Restoring price stability is essential to\nsupport a sustainably strong labor market.\nTurning to the focus of my remarks today, I would like to share my thoughts on several\ncurrent aspects of banking supervision and regulation.\nWhat I say next will certainly not surprise you: I expect there will be meaningful\nchanges in regulations, guidance, and supervisory expectations over the coming year. While\n3\n\nsome of these changes will affect only the largest institutions, many will affect community\nbankers like you and may impact your work to support your local communities.\nTo be clear, the issues facing the banking industry continue to evolve over time, and the\nregulatory response to these changes must adapt as well. But as we continue to review and\nrevisit the regulatory framework, I’d like to share a few thoughts about how the Federal Reserve\ncan best fulfill its missions of furthering the safety and soundness of banks and promoting the\nstability of the financial system. Specifically, I will discuss three topics that are more\ninterconnected than they may appear: (1) Federal Reserve independence, (2) predictability in\napplications, and (3) tailoring of regulations and supervision.\nFederal Reserve Independence\nMost often, the independence of the Federal Reserve is discussed in terms of\nindependence in the setting of monetary policy. While the value of independent decision making\nin monetary policy is vital, and research shows that it leads to better policy outcomes in the long\nrun, it is also important to emphasize the value of independence in banking supervision and\nregulation.\nYou may have seen Chair Powell’s recent speech on this topic, in which he noted that\nindependence in our bank regulatory function helps to ensure that our decisions are driven\nprimarily by the goals of promoting a safe and sound financial system and safeguarding the\nstability of the U.S. financial system stability.2 In this context, independence also means that we\nare not influenced by political considerations in making policy decisions. The Federal Reserve’s\nindependence in bank regulation also provides stability and consistency to regulated institutions.\nI am not suggesting that bank regulation remain static in the face of change. To the contrary, the\n2 Chair Jerome Powell, “Panel on Central Bank Independence and the Mandate—Evolving Views” (speech at the\nSymposium on Central Bank Independence, Sveriges Riksbank, Stockholm, Sweden, January 10, 2023).\n4\n\nFederal Reserve’s regulatory approach must be capable of addressing and adapting to new\nactivities and new risks but also must be constantly directed towards furthering our statutory\nobjectives.\nOf course, this independence in bank regulation must be accompanied by accountability,\nto both Congress and the American public.\nExisting law provides a number of mechanisms to ensure this accountability to Congress.\nFirst, members of the Board of Governors are appointed by the President, subject to the advice\nand consent of the Senate. Second, the Board also regularly communicates with Congress, both\nthrough in-person testimony to relevant banking and financial services committees and by\nproviding regular reports on key areas within the Federal Reserve’s areas of responsibility,\nincluding semiannual reports on banking applications activity, supervision and regulation,\ncybersecurity and financial system resilience, and financial stability. This regular cadence of\ntestimony and public reporting provides visibility into the inner working of the Federal Reserve,\nnot just for Congress, but also for the public.\nBeyond these measures though, accountability also means having transparent policies and\nprocedures and conducting supervision in a way that is predictable and fair. Transparency builds\nlegitimacy and helps demonstrate that the Fed is executing its responsibilities in a fair way for all\nregulated institutions. One area I think we are always looking to improve is the publication of\nclear, appropriate guidance, especially for community banks. I think there are examples where\nwe have done a pretty good job, for instance providing tools to help community banks estimate\ntheir losses under the Current Expected Credit Loss, or CECL, accounting standard. We owe\nthis duty of transparency to all regulated institutions. For example, I expect the Board will soon\npublish the supervision criteria implemented by the Large Institution Supervision Coordinating\n5\n\nCommittee—the LISCC manual. Banks should have some assurance that they are being held to\nthe same standards as their peers over time. While publication of the manual may be only a\nmodest improvement in transparency, I think it will be an important step.\nTransparency helps us not only with accountability, but also with building legitimacy and\npublic trust. To be clear, I do not consider transparency to mean leniency. We hold banks of all\nsizes to high standards, commensurate with their size and risk, and being transparent does not\ndilute the rigor of our regulatory standards. Transparency helps ensure that banks are aware of\nthese standards and expectations so that they can work more effectively and efficiently to meet\nthem.\nPerhaps most importantly, though, we must implement the laws that Congress has passed\nas they are written and not stretch that authority to venture into other areas of policymaking.\nFor example, consider the distinction between (1) making sure institutions are managing\nall of their material risks and (2) instructing banks to make certain credit allocation decisions,\nthat is, telling banks to make or not make loans to certain industries. The first objective—\nmaking sure financial institutions manage their material risks—is one of the central functions of\na bank supervisor, and is fundamental to safety and soundness. But it is equally clear that the\nsecond objective—influencing a bank to make certain credit allocation decisions—is not the role\nof a banking regulator. If you look across the regulated banking sectors, you will find that each\nbank makes different credit decisions, reacting not only to market demand and economic\nconditions, but also implementing the bank’s strategy. And to be clear, I share the widely held\nview that the appropriate role of the Federal Reserve is not to make credit allocation decisions\nfor banks.\n6\n\nThe Fed’s role as a banking supervisor is not to replace a bank’s management and board\nof directors in adopting a banking strategy and risk appetite. Instead, it is to apply appropriate,\ntargeted regulation and supervision, in order to be able to assess that when a bank engages in an\nactivity, it does so in compliance with applicable laws and in a safe and sound manner. This can\nbe a difficult balance to strike but it is something I believe we must always bear in mind\nwhenever the Fed uses or proposes using its regulatory or supervisory tools. Banking regulation\nand supervision should not be the place to implement new policies that are not mandated by\nCongress.\nIn the past, I have shared my views about the Fed’s rulemaking agenda, which remain the\nsame today. I continue to support changes based on our experience applying existing rules or\nprompted by new and emerging issues. However, any incremental changes to regulation should\nyield significant improvements to safety and soundness at reasonable cost, in consideration of the\ntradeoffs between cost and safety. And of course, any changes should be to further our\nregulatory responsibilities as mandated by Congress.\nI’ll turn now to a few examples of “how” the Federal Reserve should regulate and\nsupervise financial institutions in the context of merger applications and in the tailoring of our\nregulations and supervision.\nPredictability in Reviewing Bank Mergers\nRecently, there has been significant attention focused on the role of federal bank\nregulators in reviewing merger applications, with scrutiny of not only the rigor of the review, but\nalso on how the review process impacts the merger applicants. I certainly welcome this\ndiscussion and hearing public feedback, to see if the process can be improved.\n7\n\nCongress established the factors that must be considered when the Federal Reserve and\nother regulators review bank applications. These include the competitive effects of the proposed\nmerger, financial and managerial resources, future prospects of the merged institutions,\nconvenience and needs of the communities to be served, compliance with money laundering\nlaws, and the effect of the transaction on the stability of the financial system. Although the\nreview framework is the same for all applications, the facts of each case can vary widely, from\ncommunity bank mergers to mergers of much larger institutions that can affect markets across\nlarge regions of the country. While this variability necessitates an in-depth review of each\ntransaction on its own merits, these reviews are most effective when the expectations of the\nregulators are clear in advance and the parties can reasonably anticipate the application review\nprocess.\nThe agencies are required to review the statutory factors, but it is also important that we\nunderstand that timing matters in merger transactions. There are significant consequences to\nfirms when applications are not acted on in a timely manner, including increased operational\nrisk, the additional expense associated with running two institutions in parallel over a longer\nperiod of time, employee retention issues, and perceived reputational risk. Congress has also\nrecognized the need for prompt action, imposing a variety of time limits for agency action on\nbank applications.3 Recently, we have seen an increase in average processing times in the\nmerger review process.4 I am concerned about delays in the applications process and am\nconcerned that the increase in average processing times will become the new normal.\n3 See, e.g., 12 U.S.C. 1842(b)(1); 4807(a).\n4 See Banking Applications Activity Semiannual Report, January 1-June 30, 2022, Vol. 9, No. 2, Table 1,\n“Dispositions and processing times of proposals, 2018-2021 and 2021:H1 and 2022:H1” (December 2022).\n8\n\nI think it’s helpful to consider the source of delays in processing applications and\nconsider whether there are opportunities for improvement. This is another area where increased\ntransparency can help. The legal standards we apply have not changed, and yet the review of\napplications can be affected by incomplete or inaccurate information or information that does not\nmeet the expectations for an approvable transaction. Filling this information gap with clearer\nguidance, and making sure applicants understand our expectations could meaningfully improve\nthe process. New supervisory information that comes to light during the examination process\ncan also lead to delays, particularly if new supervisory issues need to be remediated before the\napplication can be approved. In these cases, transparency between the regulator and the\napplicant helps ensure clear expectations about potential delays.\nThat being said, improved transparency only goes so far. I think it will come as no\nsurprise to the bankers here today that often, the key difference in processing times is whether\nthe application will be acted on by the Reserve Banks on a delegated basis or will require Board\naction. While an application can come to the Board for many reasons, the most common reason\nis that the Board has received a protest on the application from a member of the public. I think it\nis helpful to consider whether this process could be improved, so that bona fide concerns raised\nby the public are appropriately considered, while still ensuring timely decision-making.\nFinally, to reiterate a point I’ve made in the past, I continue to believe that the application\nprocess should not be used as a substitute for rulemaking. If the rules applicable to a firm or\ngroup of firms needs to be updated, we should follow the rulemaking process to update those\nrules.\n9\n\nTailoring\nFinally, I would like to emphasize the role of tailoring in regulation and supervision.\nTailoring was a core feature of the response to the 2008 financial crisis and since then has been\nthe subject of a concerted effort to refine and improve the regulatory and supervisory framework\nbased on experience since the framework was implemented.5 Tailoring has proven to be an\neffective and efficient way to regulate and supervise banks of all sizes.\nOf course, all of you here today are very familiar with risk-based supervision, which is\nitself a form of tailoring, focusing supervisory attention on areas that pose the greatest risks. But\ntailoring also helps us adopt meaningful differences in regulatory requirements and supervisory\nexpectations, depending on the size and complexity of the regulated institution, from the largest\nG-SIBs to the smallest community banks. This tailored approach manifests itself across the\nspectrum from the stringency of capital requirements, the regulatory reporting obligations, and\nthe frequency of examination, among many others.\nTime has demonstrated the virtues of this tailored approach. The U.S. banking system\nentered the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic with high levels of capital and liquidity, and\nbanks of all sizes supported the economy during the darkest days of the pandemic and have\ncontinued to support the economy ever since. This tailored approach should continue to feature\nprominently in upcoming proposed revisions to the capital framework. While I expect the Board\nwill propose new capital requirements for the largest institutions, including the Basel III\n5 Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, Pub. L. No. 115-174, 132 Stat. 1296 (2018);\nChris Dodd and Barney Frank, interview by David Brancaccio, Marketplace, September 12, 2018,\nhttps://features.marketplace.org/politicsofcrisis/#transcript; Daniel K. Tarullo, “Departing Thoughts” (speech at the\nWoodrow Wilson School, Princeton, NJ, April 4, 2017),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/tarullo20170404a.htm; Randal K. Quarles, “Between the Hither\nand the Farther Shore: Thoughts on Unfinished Business” (speech at the American Enterprise Institute, Washington,\nDC, December 2, 2021), https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/quarles20211202a.htm.\n10\n\n“endgame” reforms, I do not expect every tier of firms to be subject to the same changes. And\nmy understanding is that there are no plans to propose changes to the community bank capital\nframework as part of this capital review.\nThis tailored approach is sensible not only by matching regulation to risk, but it is\nembedded in the statutory framework. For example, the bipartisan Economic Growth,\nRegulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act included several elements designed to tailor\nregulatory requirements. For the largest firms, this law instructs the Board to tailor its “enhanced\nprudential standards” framework—the strictest standards—to firms based on the risks they pose.\nThis statute also reduced the burden on smaller institutions, including through the community\nbank leverage ratio, the creation of short-form call reports for smaller community banks and a\nlonger examination cycle for small, well-capitalized banks. In my view, the current community\nbank capital requirements, including the community bank leverage ratio, are functioning well.\nIn practice, tailoring requires a framework that both distinguishes firms by size, risk, and\ncomplexity, and imposes appropriate regulatory requirements in light of these differences. The\nlargest institutions are classified by a number of factors including size, cross-jurisdictional\nactivity, reliance on short-term wholesale funding, off-balance sheet exposures, and nonbank\nassets. These factors, and the G-SIB scoring methodology more broadly, help contrast the\nlargest firms that pose the greatest risks with the smaller and less systemic firms. This translates\ninto a regulatory regime where the G-SIBs are subject to the most stringent standards,\nincorporating enhancements like a GSIB-specific risk-based capital surcharge and the enhanced\nsupplementary leverage ratio. Even the smallest banks are subject to size and risk considerations\nin their supervisory expectations, like a longer examination cycle, and straight forward capital\nand liquidity requirements and expectations.\n11\n\nThis very intentional approach accomplishes utility and efficiency, for both regulators\nand the regulated institutions, that would be otherwise impossible. Tailoring our regulatory\napproach enables us to strike an appropriate balance for each relevant bank tier, with\nrequirements that address risks, including financial stability risks, while recognizing the costs of\nover-regulation.\nClosing\nWe have a dynamic financial system in the United States, a system that has long been\nsupported by having independent and accountable regulators. As the financial system has\nevolved over time, so has the regulatory and supervisory framework designed to further the goals\nof safety and soundness, and financial stability. In my view, it is important that we continue to\nemphasize the value of accountability and transparency, while continuing to improve the fairness\nand efficiency of this framework.\n12",

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nto the\nConference for Community Bankers, sponsored by\nthe American Bankers Association\nSan Diego, California\nFebruary 11, 2019\n\nGood morning. It is a pleasure to be here today to talk about the Federal\nReserve’s commitment to and oversight of community banking. I appreciate the\ninvitation to attend the American Bankers Association’s Conference for Community\nBankers, as community banking has been a focus of my career and plays a vital role in\nsupporting our economy. I believe it is particularly important to bring together\ncommunity bankers at conferences like this to discuss issues impacting your banks and\nthe communities that you serve.\nAs many of you know, before joining the Federal Reserve, I was a community\nbanker and more recently had the privilege to serve as the Kansas State Bank\nCommissioner. While I’m not the first community banker to serve on the Board, I now\nhave the honor of being the first governor to fill the role designated for someone with\ncommunity banking experience on the Federal Reserve Board, a position that was created\nby statute in 2015.1 I plan to fulfill this unique responsibility by traveling widely and\nlistening closely to community bankers, consumers, small business owners, community\nleaders--all of the stakeholders with an interest in this area. I will take back the\nknowledge I gain from these discussions and use it to improve our work. And in the\nprocess, I hope to help you better understand what the Federal Reserve is doing and what\nwe are trying to accomplish. In doing so, I am confident our work will be more effective\nand efficient.\nAs you all know well, community banks are a critical engine of the economy, and\nthey play a key role in providing access to credit in communities of all sizes--big, small,\nrural, and every size in between. Community bankers not only assist in making people’s\n1 Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015, Pub. L. No. 114-1, 129 Stat. 3.\n\n- 2 -\ndreams come true--whether the dream is starting a small business, buying a home or\nfarm, or financing a car. They also provide critical leadership in their communities in\nmany ways--including serving on local boards of schools and hospitals, donating to\nnonprofits, and volunteering in the community. For all of these reasons, and more, I\nfirmly believe a thriving community banking sector is important to the health of the\neconomy.\nLike many of you, I witnessed firsthand how community banks were significantly\naffected by the Global Financial Crisis, a crisis they did not cause. In my work as state\nbank commissioner, I learned how bank failures affected cities and towns across the\ncountry, and in my home state of Kansas I saw the profound effects a single failure can\nhave on a community. To ensure that community banks can continue to meet the credit\nneeds of their communities, the Federal Reserve and other banking agencies strive to\nachieve a fair balance between safety and soundness and reducing unnecessary regulatory\nburden. Given the straightforward nature of community banking, regulators have an\nobligation to develop and refine approaches to supervision that fit the smaller size and\nless-complex risk profiles of these banks. If we keep our focus on appropriately tailoring\nregulatory requirements for community banks so they may continue to prudently thrive,\nthen community bankers should be able to devote more resources and time to serving\ntheir customers and communities.\nUltimately, when access to credit is limited, communities suffer and so does the\nlarger economy. In view of these goals and contributions, and an understanding that\nsystemic risk is not likely to be posed by any single community bank, the Federal\nReserve continues to tailor supervision and refine our approach to risk-focused\n\n- 3 -\nexaminations of community banks. We are also charged with supervising financial\ninstitutions to make sure they comply with applicable federal consumer protection laws\nand regulations. Here too, we apply a risk-focused approach to consumer compliance\nsupervision, focusing most intensely on those areas involving the greatest compliance\nrisk. Similarly, we want to ensure that rules that address the risks posed by the business\nmodels of the largest banks do not unintentionally create barriers to entry or unnecessary\nburden for community banks.\nDuring the remaining time with you today, I will touch on the condition of\ncommunity banks, and supervision and regulation of community banks. I am also\ninterested in hearing your perspective on the challenges and opportunities in the current\ncommunity bank landscape.\nCondition of Community Banks\nWhen I analyze how community banks are faring, I always keep in mind that the\nrange of institutions we call community banks is remarkably diverse. As Kansas State\nBank Commissioner, I oversaw banks that had four employees and less than $20 million\nin assets up to institutions with more than 100 employees and more than $1 billion in\nassets. It’s the same picture nationwide. Though if we look more closely, we can see\nthat three out of four community banks hold assets of less than $500 million. As a\nregulator, I am particularly interested in how our work affects institutions of this size.\nOne good reason for this interest is the distinct contribution community banks\nmake to economic activity. For example, while community banks account for just 17\npercent of financial industry assets, they are responsible for some 53 percent of bank\nlending to small businesses.\n\n- 4 -\nFurther, the health of the community banking sector has improved significantly\nsince the financial crisis. Over the past decade, the majority of community banks have\nmaintained high common equity tier 1 capital levels--consistent with the “well-\ncapitalized” designation under regulatory capital standards. Though there are\nconsiderable challenges to the community bank model, these banks continue to post\nstrong earnings, which, in turn, contribute to healthy capital accounts.\nIn fact, given the sound condition of the banking industry, there were no\ncommunity bank failures in 2018. Our job now is to ensure that community banks\ncontinue to remain strong. That requires bankers and supervisors alike to stay vigilant in\nthe management and supervision of risks facing these institutions and the community\nbank model.\nWhile banks are performing well and loan portfolios are growing, we want to\nensure that loans are underwritten prudently. We also want bankers to actively manage\nconcentrations of credit risk, and be mindful that strong lending activity can strain\nliquidity. For example, concentrations of commercial real estate are rising, and are quite\nhigh at some banks, prompting us to remind bankers of the difficulties that such\nconcentrations presented in the past.\nWe also continue to focus on concentrations of agricultural credit. In an ongoing\neffort to understand the emerging risks related to agricultural lending, the Federal\nReserve Bank of Kansas City facilitates a National Agricultural Credit meeting\nsemiannually. In late March of this year, the Federal Reserve will be hosting this\nmeeting in Washington, D.C. In April, the Board will meet with the Community\nDepository Institution Advisory Council. I view meetings like these as important\n\n- 5 -\nlearning opportunities where I can hear directly from leaders in the field about the\nchallenges and opportunities in community banking.\nThese meetings and direct lines of communication with community bankers help\nto inform one of the Board’s primary goals of ensuring that both supervisory programs\nand regulations are appropriately tailored to the size, complexity, and risk of a financial\ninstitution.\nSupervision and Regulation of Community Banks\nThe Federal Reserve and other federal banking agencies have demonstrated a\ncommitment to reducing regulatory burden, especially on community banks, while\nmaintaining safety and soundness. In particular, the Federal Reserve has acted to\nimplement provisions of S. 2155 that provide relief to community banks.\nSeveral proposals were issued at the end of last year, and I’d like to encourage\nthis group to submit your views and comments on these proposals. It is important for the\nFederal Reserve and other regulatory agencies to receive input directly from community\nbankers. One of these important proposals is to implement the community bank leverage\nratio. While the community bank leverage ratio proposal would increase the minimum\nleverage ratio for banks that opt in to the new framework, the proposal would allow\nqualifying community banks to opt out of the more complicated risk-based capital\nframework. Other proposals include raising to $400,000 the threshold for determining\nwhen an appraisal is required for a residential real estate transaction, and excluding\ncommunity banks from the Volcker rule.\nThe Federal Reserve also acted to raise the asset threshold from $1 billion to $3\nbillion of total consolidated assets for the Small Bank Holding Company and Savings and\n\n- 6 -\nLoan Holding Company Policy Statement. This change allows more banking companies\nthat have limited access to the capital markets to take advantage of using debt in bank\nacquisitions. This helps foster local ownership of small banks. The change also exempts\neligible small holding companies from consolidated risk-based capital rules, a significant\nburden reduction.\nIn December, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule allowing qualifying\ninsured depository institutions with less than $3 billion in total assets to benefit from an\nextended 18-month on-site examination cycle. This increases the former threshold of $1\nbillion and provides examination burden relief to a substantial number of community\nbanks with relatively simple risk profiles.\nWith respect to supervision, the Federal Reserve continues to tailor and reduce\nburden by conducting portions of community bank examinations offsite. However, we\nalso understand the importance of face-to-face interaction and continue to be responsive\nto bankers’ requests for on-site examinations.\nThe Federal Reserve has also implemented a risk-focused supervisory program--\nthe Bank Exams Tailored to Risk (BETR) program--which aims to identify low-risk\nactivities within state member banks and apply appropriately streamlined examination\nwork programs to these activities, and conversely, to identify high-risk activities within\nstate member banks for prompt supervisory attention.\nThis enhanced tailoring of supervision minimizes regulatory burden for the many\ncommunity banks that are well managed, and directs supervisory resources to higher-risk\nactivities where they are most needed to contain the risks that can result from aggressive\n\n- 7 -\nbanking strategies. Similarly, the Federal Reserve tailors its supervision of holding\ncompanies based on the size, complexity, and risk profile of each institution.\nClosing Remarks\nAs I conclude, I would emphasize how crucial it is to balance effective regulation\nand supervision to ensure the safety and soundness of community banks while also\nensuring that undue burden does not constrain the capacity of these institutions to support\nthe communities they serve.\nAs I previously noted, one of the most important aspects of my job, as I see it, is\nto have open lines of communication and feedback between regulators and community\nbanks and bankers. As a former community banker and state regulator, I understand how\nclear communication can help us all do our jobs better. So, I encourage you--and\neveryone with a stake in this work--to share your thoughts on the impact of regulation on\ncommunity banks and the communities they serve. This dialogue is especially important\nas we continue to work to tailor our supervision and regulation to the size and risk profile\nof the institutions we oversee. Although we have different responsibilities, I believe we\ncan agree that we must keep our financial system strong, while maintaining the ability of\ncommunity banks to fulfill their important role in our economy.",

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe 157th Assembly for Bank Directors,\nSouthwestern Graduate School of Banking\nMaui, Hawaii\nFebruary 2, 2024\n\nThank you for the invitation to join you today at the Southwestern Graduate School of\nBanking’s 157th Assembly for Bank Directors.1 In light of the recent direction of public policy\naffecting the financial system and bank regulation, my remarks today will discuss the potential\nimpact of this current approach on the long-term future of banking. Too often, when we think\nabout the future of banking, we focus only on today’s most pressing issues and problems, some\nof which will be fleeting and may not have long-term impacts on the banking system. So today,\nI would like to take a higher-level view to think about the future of banking over a longer time\nhorizon. My framing will focus on how the past can shed some light on the dynamics that bank\nleadership must consider in running their banks and that regulators should consider as we\nregulate and supervise institutions. My hope is that this broader perspective can help to provide\nbank directors—and even regulators—with some perspective on how today’s choices may shape\nthe banking system.\nBefore I delve into the “future” of banking, I want to spend a moment on the “present” of\nmonetary policy and the economy.\nAt our meeting earlier this week, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) kept the\ntarget range for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent and continued the run-off of the\nFed’s securities holdings. Inflation readings over the past six months indicate that the\nCommittee’s past policy actions are having the intended effect of reducing inflationary pressures.\nThe most recent 12-month readings through December for total and core personal consumption\nexpenditures (PCE) inflation came in at 2.6 and 2.9 percent respectively, the first time both\nmeasures have been below 3 percent since the spring of 2021. I view the slowdown in inflation\nreadings over recent months as encouraging. In addition to this progress on inflation, economic\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nactivity has continued to expand at a strong pace while the labor market has remained tight.\nFurther evidence of economic strength showed in the advance report of fourth quarter real gross\ndomestic product (GDP) with an increase of 3.3 percent, partly reflecting ongoing strength in\nconsumer spending, and also in today’s employment report with an acceleration in job gains to a\nvery strong pace of around 350,000 for both December and January. The unemployment rate\nremained low at 3.7 percent. This appears to reverse the trend from last year, when the average\npace of job gains slowed and the labor force participation rate rose through November, a sign\nthat labor market demand and supply may have been coming into better balance. That said,\ntoday’s jobs report with markedly stronger job growth and a labor force participation that has\nretraced some of its earlier gains suggests that progress has stalled over the past two months.\nConsidering these developments, I voted to maintain the policy rate at its current level\nwhile we continue to monitor the incoming data and assess the implications for the inflation and\neconomic outlook. My baseline outlook is that inflation will decline further with the policy rate\nheld at the current level. Should the incoming data continue to indicate that inflation is moving\nsustainably toward our 2 percent goal, it will eventually become appropriate to gradually lower\nour policy rate to prevent monetary policy from becoming overly restrictive. In my view, we are\nnot yet at that point. And a number of important upside inflation risks remain.\nThese include risks from geopolitical conditions, including the prominent risk of\nspillovers from geopolitical conflicts and the extent to which food and energy markets and\nsupply chains remain exposed to these influences. There is also the risk that continued easing in\nfinancial conditions could add momentum to demand, stalling any further progress in lowering\ninflation, or even causing inflation to reaccelerate. Finally, there is a risk that continued labor\nmarket tightness could lead to persistently high core services inflation. Today’s labor market\n\n- 3 -\ndata, which indicated a pickup in wage inflation in recent months, suggests ongoing elevated\nwage growth as some businesses continue to report above-average wage increases to compensate\nfor inflation.\nGiven these risks, and the general uncertainty regarding the economic outlook, I will\ncontinue to watch the data closely—especially the inflation data revisions next week and\nupcoming inflation reports—as I assess the appropriate path of monetary policy. The frequency\nand extent of data revisions over the past few years, as illustrated in today’s employment report,\nmake the task of predicting how the economy will evolve even more challenging, and I will\nremain cautious in my approach to considering future changes in the stance of policy. Reducing\nour policy rate too soon could result in requiring further future policy rate increases to return\ninflation to 2 percent in the longer run.\nIt is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course. My colleagues and I\nwill make our decisions at each meeting based on the incoming data and the implications for the\noutlook. While the current stance of monetary policy appears to be sufficiently restrictive to\nbring inflation down to 2 percent over time, I remain willing to raise the federal funds rate at a\nfuture meeting should the incoming data indicate that progress on inflation has stalled or\nreversed. Restoring price stability is essential for achieving maximum employment and stable\nprices over the longer run.\nThe Future of Banking\nTurning back to the future of banking, today we find ourselves at an interesting juncture\nin the evolution of the banking system. Some traditional risks—like interest rate risk and\nliquidity risk—have become a higher priority concern for banks and regulators, while other\nrisks—like cybersecurity and fraud—continue to evolve and pose challenges. And of course,\n\n- 4 -\nbanking regulation and proposed reforms exert pressure on important elements of the banking\nsystem, affecting both the size and activities of banks. At the same time, I see important\nopportunities—and a critical need—for banks to continue supporting their communities and to\nfind new and innovative ways to deliver financial products and services.\nBankers and regulators alike must think about these dynamics and how they will impact\nthe future of the banking system, including safety and soundness, U.S. financial stability, the\nfuture role of banks in the U.S. financial system, and how our actions today could have long-\nterm consequences.\nThe Risk of Complacency\nBanks have an obligation to manage all material risks, and yet we see that even with\ntraditional risks—interest rate and liquidity risk, for example—long periods of calm, such as\nthose that followed the prolonged period of low interest rates following the 2008 financial crisis,\ncan lull both bankers and regulators into a state of complacency.\nOften, this complacency stems from false assumptions, assumptions that prove to be\ninaccurate over time. For example, leading up to the 2008 financial crisis there was an\nunrealistic expectation that housing values would continue to appreciate. Those who relied on\nthis expectation made choices that proved to be ill-advised in the long run resulting in severe\neconomic consequences. Likewise, the persistently low interest rates that were a legacy of the\npost-2008 financial crisis period led some to chase yield in their securities investment portfolios,\nover-investing in fixed-rate, long-term securities relying on the belief that long-term interest\nrates would remain low in perpetuity. Regulators themselves—while increasingly aware of and\nfocused on these risks over time—were late to the game in terms of taking strong, proactive\n\n- 5 -\naction, both in the lead-up to the 2008 financial crisis, and more recently, in the lead-up to the\nbanking stress in the spring of 2023.\nIn each of these cases, false assumptions led to complacency, which resulted in an\ninability to appropriately recognize and appreciate the early signs of risk that ultimately stressed\nthe banking system and the broader economy. But how do we protect the banking system\nagainst the risks that come from complacency? For bankers, I think this requires a constant\nfocus on risks, both traditional and emerging. To be clear, many bankers live with this mindset\nevery day; they know their borrowers and communities, and they carefully monitor traditional\nand emerging risks—and manage those risks—on an ongoing basis.\nIn many ways, complacency can result in overlooking risks even on matters that are\nuniversal in the management of all banks, like succession planning and information technology\nmanagement. We know that many banks, particularly those in rural markets, face significant\nchallenges when planning effective leadership succession. Absent appropriate succession\nplanning, often the only options for a bank can be a sale to a competitor or ceasing operations,\nboth of which can harm the bank’s local community. Even the management of information\ntechnology can pose significant risks if a bank fails to devote sufficient resources to maintaining\nand updating systems, or if a bank fails to appropriately integrate and update legacy systems,\nsuch as after a bank acquisition or merger.2\nFor regulators, the cure for complacency is consistent attention even to dormant risks,\nand an appropriately robust response when issues are identified. Complacency is not always the\n2 Notably, information technology issues continue to be one of the most frequently cited findings in supervisory\nexaminations of regional banking organizations and community banking organizations. See Board of Governors of\nthe Federal Reserve System, Supervision and Regulation Report (Washington: Board of Governors, November\n2023), https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/202311-supervision-and-regulation-report.pdf, figure 16,\n“Outstanding supervisory findings by category, CBO firms,” and figure 17, “Outstanding supervisory findings by\ncategory, RBO firms.”\n\n- 6 -\nproduct of inattention but can also arise because of mis-prioritization, such as when regulators\nfocus on risks that are tangential to statutory mandates and critical areas of responsibility. This\nkind of misprioritization can increase the risk that regulators overlook areas that require more\nimmediate attention.\nSometimes, familiar risks emerge in new ways. Having a concentrated, monoline\nbusiness model and experiencing rapid growth are both well-known risks to ongoing viability,\neven though the particulars may vary over time. During the banking stress in 2023, several\nbanks that experienced particularly acute stress had concentrated exposures or monoline business\nmodels, for example, with a heavy exposure to customers in the crypto-asset industry.\nThe cyclical nature of regulatory issues itself presents a challenge for regulators. Over\ntime, examiner attrition and retirements that come along with an aging workforce erode\ninstitutional knowledge, expertise, and experience, making it more difficult to maintain an\nappropriate focus on longstanding risks.\nAs we look to the future of banking, we should consider the dynamic nature of the\nbanking system and know that we must be assertive in identifying known and emerging risks,\nand nimble in responding to them, keeping in mind that risks that appear to be extinct may only\nbe hibernating.\nBanking Changes Bring New Risks\nOf course, even with a relentless focus on the known risks that affect the banking\nsystem—credit risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, cyber risk, and others—we also know that as\nthe banking system evolves, the risks evolve as well. Even though change in the banking system\nis constant, many banking services have stayed relatively similar over time. The use of paper\nchecks, while helpful to consumers in many ways, have re-emerged as a source of increased\n\n- 7 -\nfraud risk. The advent of the automated teller machine (ATM) and electronic banking opened up\nnew avenues for banks to bring convenience and access to their customers, but also gave\ncriminals new opportunities to attack the banking infrastructure. Even the legal and regulatory\nchanges that allowed interstate banking to flourish fundamentally altered the composition of the\nbanking sector, bringing both greater efficiencies of scale as banks took advantage of\nopportunities to consolidate, but also putting pressure on some banking models—and perhaps\nperversely resulting in less availability of local banking options in some geographic and\nsocioeconomic areas.\nOf course, recent changes provide consumers with enhanced options for services,\nincluding improvements to the U.S. payment system. Recent enhancements in real-time\npayments services have made them more widely available. But with this growth comes\nadditional risk, including limitations on the ability to detect and prevent fraud. Banks also\nincreasingly rely on important relationships with third parties, including service providers and\npartners who provide services to customers through “banking-as-a-service” arrangements. As\nthird-party relationships continue to play an increasingly critical role in the banking system, they\npresent another new avenue for risks that must be managed.\nEmerging risks often arise in the context of a new mindset we see among some bank\ndirectors and management. This mindset is often associated with the culture of technology\ncompanies—a “move fast and break things” philosophy that can be incompatible with prudent\nbanking practices. Prudent banking, in contrast with a start-up culture, requires a cautious\napproach to new business models, a recognition of and respect for operating in a regulated\nindustry, and an appropriate degree of expertise and oversight. Merging these philosophies—the\nneed to innovate in an increasingly competitive banking industry, and the need to have\n\n- 8 -\nmanagement and board oversight that is appropriate in the highly regulated banking system—can\nbe difficult but is critical for long-term success. Having appropriate expertise to engage in new\nactivities within a bank can be particularly challenging with the seemingly constant advent of\nnew technologies, like artificial intelligence, that have the potential to transform banking. While\ninnovation in banking is important, banks may have difficulty attracting relevant expertise. But\nwith the potential of new technologies comes grave responsibilities to ensure that they are well\nunderstood, well-managed, and used appropriately when they are introduced in a banking\nenvironment. The banking system is not an unregulated petri dish.\nRegulators play a vital role in making sure the banking system is safe and sound in light\nof these evolving risks. At a threshold matter, regulators must consider the many tradeoffs\ninvolved in how to support banks in their quest to be agile in offering new services and\nresponding to new and evolving risks, and in how to appropriately identify, supervise, and\nregulate these risks. In my view, one of the most important roles of regulators in the face of\nchanges to the banking system is to support responsible innovation as banks provide credit to\ntheir communities and customers.3 In doing so, they must provide clear guidance to regulated\ninstitutions to help facilitate effective risk management, and support safety and soundness. The\n“start-up” mindset can be a particular challenge for regulators, as the communication of\ntraditional supervisory messages may not resonate when delivered to directors and bank\nmanagement that are not accustomed to interacting with examiners, or who are unfamiliar with\noperating a business in a regulated industry. In these situations, regulators must communicate\nclearly to ensure bank leadership understands and recognizes that safety and soundness must\n3 See Michelle W. Bowman, “The Innovation Imperative: Modernizing Traditional Banking,” speech at the\nIndependent Community Bankers of America ICBA Live 2023 Conference, Honolulu, Hawaii, March 14, 2023,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20230314a.htm.\n\n- 9 -\nalways be a key priority. The approach of asking forgiveness instead of permission is not\ncompatible with the banking system.\nNeither regulators nor banks have the ability to predict the future, and yet as we look\nback on large structural shifts in the banking system, many of these longer-term trends were\nforeseeable. As we consider these ongoing evolutions in terms of both risks and opportunities,\nwe must remember the fundamental role of banks in providing credit to consumers and\nbusinesses, including small- and medium-sized businesses.\nRegulatory Dynamics and the Regulatory Perimeter\nEarlier this year, I shared three resolutions that will guide my approach to regulation in\nthe coming year, and beyond:\n1. prioritize safety and soundness in the execution of our regulatory responsibilities\nwhen it comes to both enacting regulation and conducting supervisory examinations,\n2. renewing our commitment to tailoring, and\n3. increasing transparency in supervisory expectations.4\nI continue to believe that adherence to these principles will help buttress the safety and\nsoundness of banks.\nIn some ways, these priorities focus on the “how” of regulation and supervision—how we\nengage in prioritization of supervision, how we make policy decisions, and how we engage with\nregulated institutions and the public. Of course, another equally important consideration—\nrelevant for regulators and those who run banks—is the “why,” which goals and objectives\nshould be kept in mind in the execution of these responsibilities. An awareness of the impacts of\n4 See Michelle W. Bowman, “New Year’s Resolutions for Bank Regulatory Policymakers,” speech at the South\nCarolina Bankers Association 2024 Community Bankers Conference, Columbia, South Carolina, January 8, 2024,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240108a.htm.\n\n- 10 -\nregulation and supervision—the intended and unintended consequences of changes to the bank\nregulatory framework—must underpin the regulatory process.\nPolicymakers often acknowledge that the diversity of banks—with a wide range of sizes,\nlocations, and activities—contributes to the strength of the banking system. As I have noted in\nthe past, research supports this perspective.5 Banking reforms that result in over-regulation, or\nexcessive compliance burdens that are disproportionate to risk, can threaten the banking system,\nand by extension, the U.S. economy. The cyclical nature of risks—and the perception that\nfundamental transformation of the regulatory framework is the only cure—can often contribute\nto instability in the regulatory approach and in the financial system. Targeted changes—changes\nthat ensure ongoing attention to long-recognized risks and nimbleness to deal with emerging\nrisks—can often be more efficient and effective in addressing the concerns on a permanent basis.\nI do not envy bankers that have to deal with regulatory whiplash. Establishing a consistent\nframework to deal with regulatory risks, a framework that is broadly supported through\nconsensus and analysis, is often a better and more permanent solution to enhance safety and\nsoundness than more pronounced swings of the regulatory pendulum.\nAs the role of banks continues to evolve, we must continue to ask difficult questions\nabout the functioning of the regulatory framework, and whether it requires adjustments: How do\nwe define a “community bank” for purposes of tailoring regulations to risks? What are the\nimplications of regulatory cliff effects, like those around regulatory capital thresholds under the\nBasel III endgame and long-term debt proposals, where there is a new, stark line at $100 billion\nin assets? Will regulatory proposals effectively impact the viability of certain institutions,\n5 See Michelle W. Bowman, “The Role of Research, Data, and Analysis in Banking Reforms,” speech at the 2023\nCommunity Banking Research Conference sponsored by the Federal Reserve System, the Conference of State Bank\nSupervisors, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, St. Louis, Missouri, October 4, 2023,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20231004a.htm.\n\n- 11 -\nparticularly those clustered around regulatory thresholds? What would the loss of these smaller\ninstitutions mean for credit availability and pricing? In all of these policy decisions, banks must\nnot be passive observers. They must ensure the that regulators and policymakers recognize and\nunderstand their important role and the impacts of considered changes to ensure their viability in\nthe future.\nOf course, while we often think of the banking system as being defined by a “regulatory\nperimeter”—a line that distinguishes institutions that are subject to direct oversight from those\nthat are not—this line in some ways blinds us from some of the important and unintended\nconsequences we must consider in shaping the regulatory framework. Banks are an integral part\nof the larger financial system, and financial risks, including financial stability risks, are not\nunique to banks. For example, we know that the cost of capital influences not only the pricing of\nfinancial services offered by banks, but where activities occur, either within the regulatory\nperimeter or in nonbank entities and the shadow-banking system. I worry about the migration of\nrisks across this line and what it means for the stability of the U.S. financial system. But I am\nparticularly concerned about intentional regulatory actions that actually push activity to the\nnonbank financial system. In my view, this structural dynamic—where activities occur and how\nthose choices are influenced by regulation—is one that banks themselves must be concerned\nwith, as over the long-term, it will affect every decision they make about the products and\nservices they offer.\nWhile regulatory choices can affect the scope of the regulatory perimeter, these choices\ncan also help to mitigate the flow of risk between the permeable boundary separating regulated\nbanks and other companies. Regulators often address risks in the financial system by focusing\non regulated banks, promoting up-front due diligence of bank partners, monitoring the risks of\n\n- 12 -\nthese relationships, and placing accountability for issues that arise on the banks themselves. A\npotentially underused tool that could be used to address these risks is oversight of third-party\nservice providers under the authority granted to banking regulators under the Bank Service\nCompany Act. Better aligning supervisory attention with the source of risk in this way could be\na more efficient mechanism to address risks on the borders of the regulatory perimeter.\nClosing\nIn closing, thank you again to the Southwestern Graduate School of Banking for the\ninvitation to discuss my thoughts about the future of banking. Bank management and directors\nface significant challenges in preparing for an unpredictable future, a future that will be impacted\nby emerging risks, new business opportunities, regulatory actions, and many other factors\nbeyond a bank’s immediate control. While the factors I have highlighted do not—and could not\npossibly—provide a roadmap to the future, they do provide a different way of thinking about the\nlong-term challenges and opportunities in the banking industry, a perspective that may be helpful\nfor bank directors, bankers—and even for regulators.",

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nUtah Bankers Association and Salt Lake City Chamber\nBanker and Business Leader Breakfast\nSalt Lake City, Utah\nNovember 28, 2023\n\nIt is a pleasure to join you this morning in Salt Lake City for the Utah Banker and\nBusiness Leader Breakfast.1 I find great value in engaging with and learning from the\nexperiences and perspectives of those who are directly engaged in the economy—\nbusinesses and consumers, and those who support economic activity by providing access\nto financial services through the broader financial system. These experiences help\nprovide context for the economic and financial data that we rely upon for our economic\nanalyses. I look forward to learning about how your businesses—and the clients and\ncommunities you serve—are navigating the current economic and financial conditions.\nSince joining the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System five years\nago this week, the U.S. economy has experienced a number of unique economic\nchallenges. In my remarks today, I will include some of my observations on a number of\neconomic developments that our economy has experienced during that time. I will also\nconsider the monetary policy actions taken by the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC) in response to these developments and conclude by highlighting several\nuncertainties surrounding the economic outlook and how they affect my views about\nappropriate monetary policy going forward. Prominent among these uncertainties are\nwhether supply-side improvements will continue to reduce inflationary pressures; the\nextent to which the demand for goods, services, and labor will come into better balance\nwith supply given the current setting of monetary policy; and the level at which the\nfederal funds rate will be consistent with the FOMC’s inflation and maximum-\nemployment goals in the longer run.\n1 The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee or the Board of Governors.\n\n- 2 -\nThe Post–Financial Crisis Economy and Monetary Policy\nFive years ago, monetary policymakers faced a much different set of challenges\nthan those we face today. At that time, one of the primary concerns of the FOMC was\nthat inflation had consistently been running slightly below the Committee’s 2 percent\ninflation target, despite years of accommodative monetary policy following the 2007–08\nfinancial crisis and subsequent recession. More broadly, many central banks around the\nworld were grappling with the prospect of structurally lower interest rates due to a variety\nof factors including demographic changes and higher savings rates, lower potential output\nand productivity growth, and greater investor demand for safe assets like Treasury\nsecurities.\nOne central topic of discussion during FOMC meetings in 2018 and 2019, my\nfirst year as a Governor and permanent voting member of the FOMC, was how monetary\npolicy strategies and tools could best achieve the Committee’s dual mandate of price\nstability and maximum employment in a world of structurally low interest rates and\ndisinflationary forces that kept inflation persistently under the Committee’s 2 percent\ntarget. Relatedly, there was an ongoing concern that the federal funds rate, the FOMC’s\nkey policy rate, was too close to the “zero lower bound,” which would limit the\nCommittee’s ability to respond effectively to an adverse shock by lowering interest rates.\nSo much so that even during the economic expansion there was concern that the Fed\nwould likely be severely limited in its ability to stimulate the economy.\nIn 2018, the FOMC was nearing the end of a gradual monetary policy tightening\ncycle that had begun in late 2015. At the time the FOMC had been slowly tightening\nmonetary policy, it had the benefit of a strong labor market, a steadily expanding\n\n- 3 -\neconomy, and inflation near 2 percent. The U.S. was also experiencing one of the longest\neconomic expansions in its history, with consistent labor market gains for all segments of\nthe workforce. During my first FOMC meeting in December 2018, the FOMC completed\nthis hiking cycle by raising the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to\n2¼ to 2½ percent. The FOMC maintained this range until the second half of 2019, when\nthe Committee reduced the federal funds rate by a total of 75 basis points in response to\nmoderating economic growth and inflation and global economic uncertainties related to\nexpectations of lower U.S. growth.2 Although the underlying issues were quite different,\nthere were similarities to the issues we face today. At that time, the Federal Reserve was\nalso in the process of normalizing the size of its balance sheet, which stood at just under\n$4 trillion in December 2018.3\nThen, in March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic created an unprecedented shock\nto the global economy and financial system. This shock—combined with the policy\nresponses of governments and central banks around the world—disrupted many of the\neconomic dynamics that had influenced the economy over the past several decades.\nThese impacts will affect how we think about monetary policy going forward, but let’s\nput the event and response into better context.\n2 See, for example, the discussion of risks and uncertainties at the July 2019 FOMC meeting, the first\nmeeting at which the target range for the federal funds rate was lowered. The minutes of the July 30–31,\n2019, Federal Open Market Committee meeting are available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.\n3 Securities runoff had begun in October 2017 when the Fed’s securities holdings stood at nearly\n$4.25 trillion. In October 2019, in response to a brief period of stress in short-term funding markets, the\nFOMC began to expand the size of the Fed’s securities holdings from a level of just over $3.5 trillion to\nattain a level of ample reserves to the banking system in line with growth in the economy and banking\nsector. See the October 2019 Federal Open Market Committee Statement, which is available on the\nBoard’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.\n\n- 4 -\nThe Pandemic Policy Response and Economic Recovery\nWidespread economic lockdowns and social isolation, combined with other\npandemic effects, caused the swiftest and deepest contraction in employment and\neconomic activity since the Great Depression. Many critical parts of the U.S. financial\nsystem experienced significant disruption or completely ceased to function. The Federal\nReserve responded forcefully to mitigate the financial market turmoil and the economic\neffects of the rapid shutdown of the U.S. economy. As a part of its response, the FOMC\nquickly lowered the target range for the federal funds rate back to 0 to ¼ percent and\nbegan purchasing large amounts of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities.\nThese purchases were initially designed to support the smooth functioning of security\nmarkets to support the flow of credit to businesses and households and, later, to provide\nadditional monetary policy accommodation to support economic activity and labor\nmarkets.4\nCentral banks in other countries and jurisdictions also implemented\naccommodative monetary policy to support their economies during the early phases of\nthe pandemic. In addition, fiscal authorities around the world implemented programs to\nsupport labor markets and enable household and business spending. In the U.S., these\nprograms and policies included the Paycheck Protection Program and other CARES Act\nprograms designed to support businesses, households, and state and local governments.\nThese policies, combined with extremely accommodative monetary policies, bolstered\n4 The Federal Reserve implemented 13 emergency lending and liquidity facilities under its emergency\nlending authorities and undertook supervisory and regulatory actions to support the flow of credit to\nhouseholds, businesses, and local governments. See “Funding, Credit, Liquidity, and Loan Facilities” and\n“Supervisory and Regulatory Actions in Response to COVID-19” on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/funding-credit-liquidity-and-loan-facilities.htm and\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisory-regulatory-action-response-covid-19.htm, respectively.\n\n- 5 -\nprivate-sector and local government balance sheets. They also resulted in what has come\nto be referred to as “excess savings”—money that consumers would have spent otherwise\nbut couldn’t, given a number of physical- and supply-related constraints.\nThe innovative approaches adopted by many American businesses—including\nshifting to online sales and complying with social-distancing requirements to meet\ngovernment operating requirements—the excess savings, and the newly introduced\nmedical treatments supported a sharp economic rebound in 2021, with more than\n5 percent real gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the first two quarters. Strong\ndemand, early retirements, generous fiscal support, very low legal immigration, and a\nmismatch between available jobs and workers all contributed to a very tight labor market.\nThe unusually rapid rebound in economic activity, the pandemic-driven shift in consumer\nspending toward goods, reduced manufacturing capacity in some sectors, and supply-\nchain vulnerabilities led to crippling supply-chain bottlenecks in a number of areas.\nEventually, given these supply–demand imbalances amid accommodative fiscal and\nmonetary policies, inflation moved up to very high levels.\nBy the second half of 2021, inflationary pressures intensified and became more\nbroad based. Labor markets were extremely tight, though data available at the time did\nnot reflect the true extent of this tightness. Of the many difficult issues the Committee\nfaced at the time, one of the most important was whether the inflationary pressures would\nbe persistent or resolve as supply-side pressures eventually eased.\nThe June 2021 Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) showed the median\nFOMC participant expected annual personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation to\n\n- 6 -\nbe 3.4 percent at the end of 2021 and to settle at 2.1 percent by the end of 2022.5 Private-\nsector forecasters expected slightly lower inflation of 2.9 percent at year-end 2021 and\nprojected it to be 2.3 percent by the end of 2022.6 With the benefit of hindsight, we know\nnow that most forecasters, ourselves included, vastly misjudged the persistence of\ninflation at that time, with PCE inflation of 5.9 percent for both 2021 and 2022. This\nunderscores the challenge we faced in discerning which factors were driving inflation and\nhow long those forces would persist.\nHigh Inflation and the Response of Monetary Policy\nIn the second half of 2021, it became clear that the FOMC’s monetary policy\nstance was too accommodative in the presence of growing inflationary pressures and that\nthe Committee needed to move toward a tighter policy stance.7 It seems likely to me that\nthe experience of the years leading up to the pandemic, when inflation was persistently\nlow, made it hard for forecasters to foresee how quickly that could change. Of course,\nthe inflation and labor data did not accurately reflect the economic conditions prevailing\nat the time and were subsequently substantially revised. Together, these factors likely\nalso led to a delay in the removal of monetary policy accommodation in 2021.8 The\n5 See the Summary of Economic Projections released following the June 2021 meeting of the Federal Open\nMarket Committee, which is available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.\n6 Private-sector forecasts reflect the consensus estimate in the Blue Chip survey of business forecasters in\nJune 2021.\n7 The median FOMC participant revised up 12-month PCE inflation to 4.2 percent and 2.2 percent for the\nyears 2021 and 2022, respectively, in the September 2021 SEP.\n8 For example, both August and September 2021 employment reports suggested job growth at much lower\nlevels than consensus forecasts and were subsequently sizably increased. Similarly, based on current data,\nPCE inflation for 2021:Q3 to 2022:Q2 are also revised higher. See the real-time data for macroeconomists\non the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s website at https://www.philadelphiafed.org/surveys-and-\ndata/real-time-data-research/pcon.\n\n- 7 -\nmonetary policy experience during the pandemic highlights how structural changes in the\neconomy can be difficult to identify in real time.\nBy November 2021, the target range for the federal funds rate was still at 0 to\n¼ percent. And we continued to purchase assets at the same pace as earlier in the year,\nalthough at our November 2021 meeting we announced that we would begin to slow the\npace of purchases later that month and in December.9 At the December 2021 meeting,\nwe doubled the pace of tapering, which accelerated the end of purchases to the following\nMarch.\nThe FOMC finally raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis\npoints and ended the purchase of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities at the\nMarch 2022 meeting. And in May, the FOMC announced its plan to reduce the size of\nthe Federal Reserve’s securities holdings—which then stood at around $8.5 trillion—\nstarting in June and at a pace much faster than in the previous episode of balance sheet\nreduction.10 The FOMC also continued to increase the target range for the federal funds\nrate over the course of 2022 at a pace much faster than in previous tightening cycles, as it\nbecame clear that inflation was higher and more persistent than many forecasters had\nexpected. Twelve-month total PCE inflation peaked at 6.6 percent just before the June\n2022 meeting, reflecting both high core inflation and higher energy and food prices,\nwhich were influenced by geopolitical conflicts.\nTo date, the FOMC has increased the target range for the federal funds rate to\n5¼ to 5½ percent and has been reducing the size of the Federal Reserve’s securities\n9 See the November 2021 Federal Open Market Committee Statement, which is available on the Board’s\nwebsite at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.\n10 See the May 2023 Federal Open Market Committee Statement, which is available on the Board’s website\nat https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.\n\n- 8 -\nholdings, which now stand at just above $7 trillion. We have also seen significant\nprogress on bringing inflation down, so far without impairing the strength of the labor\nmarket and economic activity.\nLooking Ahead\nAt our most recent meeting, the FOMC voted to maintain the target range for the\nfederal funds rate at the current level and continue to run off the Fed’s securities\nholdings.11 Inflation readings have come in lower, with some of the improvement related\nto a continued easing of supply-side pressures. But the level of inflation remains high,\nwith the most recent readings of 12-month total and core PCE inflation at 3.4 percent and\n3.7 percent, respectively. And recent progress has been uneven. The economy has\nremained strong as the FOMC has raised the federal funds rate, and recent data indicate\nthat economic activity accelerated in the third quarter, with real GDP growing at a\n4.9 percent annual rate. The most recent employment report showed a continuation of\nhealthy job gains. Labor force participation has improved over the past year, with a\nsomewhat slower, but still strong, pace of job gains, a sign that labor market supply and\ndemand may be coming into better balance.\nAt our last meeting, I supported the FOMC’s decision to hold the target range for\nthe federal funds rate at the current level as we continue to assess incoming information\nand its implications for the outlook. But my baseline economic outlook continues to\nexpect that we will need to increase the federal funds rate further to keep policy\nsufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to our 2 percent target in a timely way.\nHowever, monetary policy is not on a preset course, and I will continue to closely watch\n11 See the October 2023 Federal Open Market Committee Statement, which is available on the Board’s\nwebsite at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.\n\n- 9 -\nthe incoming data as I assess the implications for the economic outlook and the\nappropriate path of monetary policy.\nThere are several uncertainties surrounding my baseline outlook that will\ninfluence my view of appropriate monetary policy going forward. First, much of the\nimprovement in inflation over the past year has been due to supply-side improvements,\nsuch as improving supply chains, increases in labor force participation, and lower energy\nprices. It is unclear whether further supply-side improvements will continue to lower\ninflation. Some firms are now shifting their supply chains closer to home in place of\nmore global supply chains. Government policies such as the CHIPS and IRA Acts are\nsupporting these shifts by encouraging greater investment in developing domestic\nmanufacturing capacity, including for semiconductors and electric vehicle batteries. How\nthese investments work out over time may affect the productive capacity of the U.S.\neconomy. And while these investments have the potential to increase productive\ncapacity, over the next few years they may also create strong demand for labor and\nequipment in areas without the necessary physical resources to support the development,\nwhich may increase inflationary pressures. In my view, there is also a risk that over the\ncoming months higher energy prices could reverse some of the recent progress made by\nsupply-side improvements to bring overall inflation down.\nSecond, over the past year, the number of workers in the labor force has increased\nfrom improved labor force participation and other factors, including recent growth in\nwork visa issuance for some immigrants. At the same time, the average pace of job gains\nhas slowed somewhat and vacancies have declined, a sign that labor supply and demand\nmay be coming into better balance. However, future gains in labor force participation\n\n- 10 -\nmay be limited, since prime-age labor force participation is currently higher than pre-\npandemic levels. It is also unclear whether all of the workers who retired or left the labor\nforce during the pandemic will eventually return.\nWe also know that pandemic-era education disruptions from school closures and\nremote learning resulted in extensive learning losses. There is a real risk that these\nlearning losses will limit the productivity of the American workforce in coming years.\nOver time, American workers who experienced these education disruptions may\novercome the pandemic-era learning losses, but today, as young people leave education\nand transition into the work force, there is a risk that either the economy will experience\nlower long-term trend growth, or that the divide between those who suffered learning\nlosses and those who did not results in vastly different economic and overall outcomes\nfor this generation of American workers.12\nThe third of these uncertainties is the extent to which strong aggregate demand\nand the composition of spending will continue and contribute to inflationary pressures\ngoing forward. It is possible that consumption pattern changes that occurred during the\npandemic will prove durable. Prior to the pandemic, goods consumption comprised just\nunder one-third of overall consumption. During the pandemic, consumption shifted to a\ngreater proportion of goods, like home office and gym equipment, in part because\npandemic-related restrictions limited the opportunities available to consume services. As\nwe emerged from the pandemic, the initial expectation was a return to stronger services\n12 National Centre for Educational Statistics data show fall of 2022–23 school year cohort of 13-year-old’s\nscore for reading and mathematics has declined to levels lower than 1992 levels, reversing steady gains\nachieved since then; see “Scores Decline Again for 13-Year-Old Students in Reading and Mathematics” on\nthe Nation’s Report Card’s website at https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/highlights/ltt/2023. The decline\nis more pronounced among students with lower scores.\n\n- 11 -\nconsumption, but goods consumption remains near 35 percent of overall consumption. If\ngoods consumption continues to be a greater proportion of overall consumption, the\nexpected deflationary effect from goods prices could be delayed.\nThere is also a risk to inflation from higher services consumption. With too few\nworkers to fill the number of existing job openings, a continued increase in the demand\nfor services may contribute to persistently high core services inflation. Additionally, a\nlack of fiscal restraint could further contribute to inflationary pressures.\nAnother uncertainty is the reaction of economic activity and inflation to the\ncontinuation of higher interest rates and tighter financial conditions. We don’t yet know\nthe full extent of the effects of tighter monetary policy and financial conditions on\neconomic activity and inflation.13 There are some signs of interest rate sensitivity for\nsmall business loans and corporate debt, and slightly higher delinquencies for existing\ncredit card accounts and auto loans, in comparison to before the pandemic. However, the\npresence of cash buyers in the housing market has lowered some of the interest rate\nsensitivity in the housing sector. Further, many households continue to hold significant\nexcess savings and are realizing ongoing savings from mortgages originated or\nrefinanced when interest rates were low.\n13 The literature points to a wide range of estimates regarding the effects of higher interest rates on the\neconomy. See, for example, Ander Perez-Orive and Yannick Timmer (2023), “Distressed Firms and the\nLarge Effects of Monetary Policy Tightenings,” FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System, June 23), https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/distressed-\nfirms-and-the-large-effects-of-monetary-policy-tightenings-20230623.html; Nitish Sinha and Michael\nSmolyansky (2022), “How Sensitive Is the Economy to Large Interest Rate Increases? Evidence from the\nTaper Tantrum,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2022-085 (Washington: Board of Governors\nof the Federal Reserve System, December), https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/how-sensitive-is-\nthe-economy-to-large-interest-rate-increases.htm. For a case study and an overview, see V. A. Ramey\n(2016), “Macroeconomic Shocks and Their Propagation,” in John B. Taylor and Harald Uhlig, eds.,\nHandbook of Macroeconomics, vol. 2A (Amsterdam: Elsevier), pp. 71–162.\n\n- 12 -\nIn considering business investment and interest rate sensitivity, the evidence has\nbeen mixed.14 The most recent Richmond and Atlanta Federal Reserve CFO Survey\nsuggests that roughly 40 percent of respondents have already pulled back on investment\nrequiring financing at current interest rates.15 However, another 40 percent say that they\nare not interest rate sensitive, their financing or borrowing is not influenced by rates, or\nthey do not know the level at which the rate would become an impediment.\nFinally, given all of the considerations I have just discussed, it is not yet clear\nwhether the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will need to remain at a higher\nlevel than before the pandemic in order to effectively foster low and stable inflation and\nsupport full employment. In my view, given potential structural changes in the economy,\nsuch as higher demand for investment relative to saving, it is quite possible that the level\nof the federal funds rate consistent with low and stable inflation will be higher than\nbefore the pandemic. In some respects, a higher longer-run level of the federal funds rate\nwould be a welcome development, as this would allow the FOMC to more effectively\nrespond to future negative economic shocks by lowering the policy rate. Structurally\nhigher interest rates might also lead to less concern about the possible financial stability\neffects of reach-for-yield behavior, as higher interest rates ease pressure on institutions\nlike life insurance companies and pension funds that manage extended-duration\nliabilities.\n14 See Steve A. Sharpe and Gustavo A. Suarez (2014), “Why Isn’t Investment More Sensitive to Interest\nRates: Evidence from Surveys,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2014-02 (Washington: Board\nof Governors of the Federal Reserve System, January, revised September 2015),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/why-isn39t-investment-more-sensitive-to-interest-rates-\nevidence-from-surveys.htm.\n15 See Zach Edwards and Daniel Weitz (2023), “How Are Interest Rates Impacting Spending?

My colleagues and I will continue to make our monetary policy\ndecisions at each meeting based on the incoming data and the implications for the\neconomic outlook. I remain willing to support raising the federal funds rate at a future\nmeeting should the incoming data indicate that progress on inflation has stalled or is\ninsufficient to bring inflation down to 2 percent in a timely way.\nWe should keep in mind the historical lessons and risks associated with\nprematurely declaring victory in the fight against inflation, including the risk that\ninflation may settle at a level above our 2 percent target without further policy tightening.\nReturning inflation to the FOMC’s 2 percent goal is necessary to achieve a sustainably\nstrong labor market and an economy that works for everyone.",

    "text": "For release at 1 p.m. EDT\nSeptember 20, 2024\nStatement by Governor Michelle W. Bowman\nOn Wednesday, September 18, 2024, I dissented from the Federal Open Market\nCommittee’s (FOMC) decision to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by\n1/2 percentage point to 4-3/4 to 5 percent. As the Committee’s post-meeting statement notes,\nI preferred to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point to 5 to 5-\n1/4 percent.\nGiven the progress we have seen since the middle of 2023 on both lowering inflation and\ncooling the labor market, I agree that at this meeting it was appropriate to recalibrate the level of\nthe federal funds rate and begin the process of moving toward a more neutral policy stance. In\nmy view, however, a smaller first move in this process would have been a preferable action.\nThe U.S. Economy Remains Strong\nThe U.S. economy remains strong, with solid underlying growth in economic activity and\na labor market near full employment. Although hiring appears to have softened, layoffs remain\nlow. I see the normalization in labor market conditions as necessary to help bring wage growth\ndown to a pace consistent with 2 percent inflation given trend productivity growth. My reading\nof labor market data has become more uncertain due to increased measurement challenges and\nthe inherent difficulty in assessing the effects of recent immigration flows. I am also taking\nsignal from continued solid growth in the spending data, especially consumer spending,\nreflecting a healthy labor market.\n-1-\n\nDespite Progress, Inflation Remains a Concern\nInflation remains above our 2 percent goal, as core personal consumption expenditures\nprices are still rising faster than 2.5 percent from 12 months earlier. Higher prices have an\noutsized impact on lower- and moderate-income households. Accomplishing our mission of\nreturning to low and stable inflation at our 2 percent goal is necessary to foster a strong labor\nmarket and an economy that works for everyone in the longer term.\nAlthough it is important to recognize that there has been meaningful progress on\nlowering inflation, while core inflation remains around or above 2.5 percent, I see the risk that\nthe Committee’s larger policy action could be interpreted as a premature declaration of victory\non our price stability mandate.\nWe have not yet achieved our inflation goal. I believe that moving at a measured pace\ntoward a more neutral policy stance will ensure further progress in bringing inflation down to our\n2 percent target. This approach would also avoid unnecessarily stoking demand.\nShared Goals for the Future\nDespite my dissent at our recent meeting, I respect and appreciate that my colleagues\npreferred to begin the reduction in the federal funds rate with a larger initial reduction in the\ntarget range for the policy rate. I remain committed to working together with my colleagues to\nensure that monetary policy is appropriately positioned to achieve our goals of maximum\nemployment and returning inflation to our 2 percent target.\n-2-",

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe 2024 Community Banking Research Conference\nSponsored by the Federal Reserve System, the Conference of State Bank Supervisors, and the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation\nSt. Louis, Missouri\nOctober 2, 2024\n\nIt is an honor to return to St. Louis for the 12th year of the Community Banking Research\nConference.1 This conference is a model of effective partnership between the Federal Reserve\nand the Conference of State Bank Supervisors, and more recently, the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation (FDIC). It is an opportunity for us all to dig deeper into the community banking\nmodel and the important role of community banks now and into the future. Together, regulators\nwork to ensure that the approach to supervision and regulation is fit for purpose, and that each\nelement of both supervision and regulation acts in a complementary manner. Policy\ndisagreements are a healthy part of the process, but we must also strive to build consensus where\nwe can. At a minimum, we must understand and respect our counterparts’ and colleagues’\nviewpoints. Ultimately, we all share the same goal of promoting a safe and sound banking\nsystem.\nThe strength of the U.S. banking system relies upon the diversity of its institutions, and\nfacilitating an environment that allows each category of bank to thrive is essential to fostering a\nhealthy financial system. For community banks, this includes building a framework that better\nsupports the unique characteristics of these institutions. Today, my remarks will consider three\nfoundational questions as we contemplate revising the community banking framework:\n(1) Given the continued evolution of the banking system, how should a community bank be\ndefined? (2) Are we pursuing the most appropriate approach to supervision and regulation of\ncommunity banks, and finally, (3) How can we build a policy framework that better supports and\nanticipates this evolution of the banking system now and into the future?\n1 These remarks represent my own views and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nHow to Define a Community Bank\nBy necessity, regulators divide banks into more manageable categories. The Federal\nReserve has distinct portfolios that oversee “community,” “regional,” and four “categories” of\nlarger banks.2 The Federal Reserve and federal banking agencies further subdivide these\nportfolios based on additional factors. They may also depart from this framework altogether to\ngroup banks across portfolios or based on other common features.\nThis approach to separating bank supervisory portfolios can enable us to more clearly\narticulate the tailoring applied to specific requirements of supervision and regulation.3 This\napproach has its virtues, including allowing examiners to better organize supervisory activities\nand training in different portfolios to focus on issues that are most relevant for the institutions\nbeing examined. When appropriately executed, it can lead to better and more risk-focused\nsupervision, which ultimately promotes a safer and more sound banking system.\nOf course, there are limits to this framework. And we should continue to ask if the\nmetrics and thresholds established through regulation, and more often recently through\nsupervisory policy decisions, are appropriate over time as conditions change.\nLocking regulatory standards into a fixed asset-size threshold has its costs. Over time,\nthese fixed thresholds fail to take into account growth attributable to broader economic growth\n2 Larger banks are defined using tests that look primarily at asset size but may include other metrics like cross-\njurisdictional activity, nonbank assets, short-term wholesale funding, or off-balance sheet exposures.\n3 For example, the “tailoring” rule in 2019 included a helpful visual that laid out the various standards and\nthresholds at which such standards applied across Category I-IV firms, and firms with more than $50 billion in\nassets. See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Tailoring Rule Visual, “Requirements for Domestic\nand Foreign Banking Organizations” (October 10, 2019),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/boardmeetings/files/tailoring-rule-visual-20191010.pdf. We use a\nvariety of asset-size thresholds to help define our current portfolios and establish thresholds for supervisory and\nregulatory expectations. These thresholds apply for banks with assets of $10 billion, $50 billion, $100 billion, $250\nbillion, and $750 billion. Some regulatory standards implement lower thresholds under the current $10 billion\ncommunity bank asset threshold. See, e.g., 12 C.F.R. 228.12 (defining a “small bank” and “intermediate bank” for\npurposes of the regulations implementing the Community Reinvestment Act); 13 C.F.R. 121.201 (SBA regulations\ndefining small business entities, including commercial banks with less than $850 million in assets).\n\n- 3 -\nand inflation. They are also not reflective of any changes in a particular bank’s activities or risk\nprofile. As a result, many firms that are stable in their growth, business model, and risk profile\nend up unintentionally crossing regulatory thresholds. As they approach, and certainly once they\ncross over these asset-size lines, they must comply with additional regulatory and supervisory\nrequirements that were specifically designed and implemented for larger and more complex\nfirms.\nWhile the fixed-threshold approach benefits from simplicity, it is necessary to\nperiodically revisit the policy effect of these bright-line thresholds. There are certainly cases in\nwhich a bank with assets less than $10 billion faces risks that are disproportionate to its asset\nsize, warranting greater supervisory scrutiny. For these firms, asset size may vastly understate\ntheir risk profile. Often, they do not operate like traditional community banks, relying instead on\nnontraditional services and engaging in complex activities. Therefore, it may be appropriate for\na community bank to be subject to additional oversight. This is particularly relevant when a\nbank has un-remediated, long-standing supervisory issues that require more supervisory\nmonitoring and oversight. In such cases, a community bank supervisory approach is likely not\nsufficient or appropriate.\nAt the same time, many banks with assets over $10 billion do operate like community\nbanks, with a relationship-based straightforward business model, yet they are not regulated or\nsupervised as such. Over time, the mismatch in supervisory expectations around this and other\nasset thresholds becomes more pronounced as economic growth and inflation effectively lower\nthem. This results in potentially overly complex supervisory constructs for banks with a limited\ntraditional community bank risk profile.\n\n- 4 -\nIs it appropriate to impose more restrictive requirements on firms when those heightened\nrequirements are not a deliberate policy choice based on the level of risk? Is it appropriate to\ntreat each bank below a regulatory threshold as a traditional community bank? Historically,\nregulators have been willing to push more complex requirements and expectations down to\nsmaller banks—essentially bumping them into a higher risk tier—than moving larger firms into a\nlower risk tier when that treatment may be more appropriate.\nOne important aspect of this definitional question involves the natural evolution of\nbanking, specifically as it relates to innovation. The “push down” of regulatory and supervisory\nstandards often applies when a bank pursues activities that fit under the broad umbrella of\n“innovation.” Innovation can be defined expansively to include engaging in bank-fintech\npartnerships, using (or considering using) digital ledger technology, or even providing traditional\nbanking services to entities that touch the crypto-asset ecosystem. Innovation can present a\nchallenging problem for both regulators and banks. If the “cost” of adopting innovation results\nin a bank’s inclusion in a higher compliance tier, it may be difficult to encourage greater\ninvestment in innovation for smaller banks. Establishing appropriate regulatory thresholds does\nnot force regulators to eliminate or purge innovation from the banking system, especially among\ncommunity banks.4\nWhen considering building a framework to support community banks, the definition is\nkey—which banks will be in scope? The answer lies in the bank’s business model, activities,\nand risk profile.\n4 Michelle W. Bowman, “Innovation and the Evolving Financial Landscape” (speech at The Digital Chamber DC\nBlockchain Summit 2024, Washington, D.C., May 15, 2024),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20240515a.pdf; Michelle W. Bowman,\n“Innovation in the Financial System” (speech at The Salzburg Global Seminar on Financial Technology Innovation,\nSocial Impact, and Regulation, Salzburg, Austria, June 17, 2024),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20240617a.pdf.\n\n- 5 -\nWhere we have established fixed-dollar asset thresholds, we must commit to revisit and\nadjust them as needed. In my view, this is a principle that extends beyond the lines defining\ncommunity banks to all regulatory and supervisory thresholds. While there is need for flexibility\nin both directions, it is apparent that over time economic growth and inflation will result in\nthresholds that are inappropriately low.\nThe Supervision and Regulation of Community Banks\nEstablishing a definition for community banks leaves open the fundamental question of\nregulatory and supervisory approach. Before turning to that discussion, we need to take stock of\nsupervision and regulation today. What areas of the framework require review and attention?\nThe Tradeoffs of Regulation\nRegulation can be a powerful and effective tool to promote bank safety and soundness,\nand U.S. financial stability. The special privileges that are granted with a banking charter—\nincluding deposit insurance and access to the discount window—all come with the responsibility\nand obligation to comply with the bank regulatory framework.\nA robust presence of community banks, especially those that are remote and rural,\nenables access to credit, banking, and payment services in underserved markets and\ncommunities. These banks support local economies by serving consumers and small- and\nmedium-sized businesses, building an economic foundation to drive business development and\ngrowth. But community banks, like any business, face the economic reality that accompanies\nrunning a successful business. Each must manage its costs—including personnel, funding, and\nregulatory compliance—in light of its revenues to achieve a reasonable return on equity.\n\n- 6 -\nWhen a bank’s costs increase, there is, by necessity, a need to make changes if the bank\nhopes to maintain profitability and ultimately its survival. This usually involves either cutting\ncosts or raising prices on banking services.\nHow do the realities of operating a business inform our current approach to regulation?\nThe question becomes acutely relevant when regulators consider imposing new or revised\nregulations. Regulators should always ask (1) what problem does this new regulation solve,\n(2) what are costs of this approach, and (3) are there alternative approaches? Before discussing\nthe path forward, I would like to note an example that highlights this concern.\nThe final Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) regulations issued in 2023 established\nnew regulatory thresholds defining “small,” “intermediate” and “large” banks, with the last\ncategory—large banks—including every bank with more than $2 billion in assets.5 In my view,\nthis rulemaking represented a missed opportunity to rationalize the requirements of the CRA\namong community banks, and ignored the fundamental differences among banks with different\nbalance sheets and business models.6 An approach that applies the same evaluation standards to\na bank with $2 billion in assets as it does to a bank with $2 trillion in assets arguably represents a\nshortcoming in considering the fundamental differences among firms, and the disproportionate\ncosts these standards may impose on the smallest banks.\nThe Hidden Cost of Supervision and Guidance\nWhile regulation carries with it the obligation to comply with public notice and comment\nprocedures under the Administrative Procedure Act, regulators have far more discretion in the\n5 Community Reinvestment Act, 89 Fed. Reg. 6574 (February 1, 2024), https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-\n2024-02-01/pdf/2023-25797.pdf.\n6 See dissenting statement, “Statement on the Community Reinvestment Act Final Rule by Governor Michelle W.\nBowman,” news release, October 24, 2023, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bowman-\nstatement-20231024.htm.\n\n- 7 -\nsupervisory process, and in issuing “guidance” that is technically non-binding but often operates\nas a de facto requirement. The development and implementation of new supervisory approaches\nand of guidance largely escape rigorous scrutiny due to the lack of formal procedural\nrequirements for its development. This is true even though the expectations created by guidance\ncan be equally or more impactful to banks than rules.\nFor example, the examination process often produces supervisory findings over-\nemphasizing non-core and non-financial risks, highlighting issues like IT and operational risk,\nmanagement, risk management, and internal controls.7 These issues have filtered down from\nexaminations and findings at the largest banks to the smallest, raising the question of\nappropriateness of application for smaller firms.\nIn the supervisory process, we should guard against being distracted by less relevant\nissues. The prevalence of supervisory findings related to nonfinancial metrics is in part driven\nby the time it may take to remediate certain issues. However, we should also scrutinize whether\nthis trend is indicative of our supervisory focus—beyond financial risk and toward non-financial\nrisks and internal processes—and whether that shift is appropriate. We should also be aware that\ndue to the vast diversity in business models, size, and geographic footprint among banks, we\nshould not expect every firm to follow the same standards and must be careful to prevent forcing\nuniformity through “grading on a curve.” This risk can be exacerbated through any type of\nhorizontal-like reviews. The supervisory findings made during the examination process inform\nbank ratings, which can have follow-on effects like limiting options for mergers and acquisitions\n7 As noted in the Board’s most recent Supervision and Regulation Report, nearly half of the 1,340 supervisory\nfindings for community banks were cited in these categories, more frequently than credit risk as of the fourth quarter\nof 2023. See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Supervision and Regulation Report, (Washington:\nBoard of Governors, May 2024) 22, figure 16, https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/202405-\nsupervision-and-regulation-report.pdf.\n\n- 8 -\n(M&A) activity; raising the cost of liquidity; or diverting resources away from other, more\nimportant bank management priorities.\nGuidance can also impose costs on banks that are not always obvious or quantified. The\npurpose of guidance is to provide clarity to banks and reduce implementation uncertainty and\nrisk. To serve this purpose, however, guidance must be clear, actionable, and account for the\nneeds of the targeted firms, especially for community banks.\nIn 2023, the federal banking agencies published supervisory guidance addressing third-\nparty risk management, guidance expressly applicable to community banks. As I noted at the\ntime this guidance was issued, it included shortcomings that were known and identified, but not\naddressed in advance.8 While I am pleased that the community bank implementation guide was\neventually published, this recent example demonstrates that we need to ensure new guidance\nprovides clarity to regulated firms on its own, or that we provide additional resources at the same\ntime we publish the guidance.\nGuidance can help clarify uncertainty about the application of legal requirements or\nsuggest how regulators may view particular activities in the supervisory process. But when\nguidance is unclear or ambiguous about supervisory views and expectations, it can hinder\ncommunity banks’ ability to clearly understand and meet them. Community bankers feel a\nstrong obligation to review the voluminous body of guidance published by regulators, knowing\n8 Michelle W. Bowman, “Defining a Bank” (Speech to the American Bankers Association 2024 Conference for\nCommunity Bankers, San Antonio, Texas, February 12, 2024),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20240212a.pdf; Statement on Third Party Risk\nManagement Guidance by Governor Michelle W. Bowman (June 6, 2023),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bowman-statement-20230606.htm (“… Federal Reserve\nregional bank supervisors have indicated that we should provide additional resources for community banks upon\nimplementation to provide appropriate expectations and ensure that small banks understand and can effectively use\nthe guidance to inform their third-party risk management processes…. I am disappointed that the agencies failed to\nmake the upfront investment to reduce unnecessary confusion and burden on community banks”).\n\n- 9 -\nthat even where it does not apply to them on its face, it may be pushed down to these banks as a\nbest practice in the future.9\nBank Mergers, Acquisitions, and De Novo Formations\nWhat does a healthy banking system look like? While we often espouse the virtues of a\n“diverse” banking system—one with many different sizes of institutions and the flexibility to\nshift in size over time—a healthy banking system includes opportunities for entry and exit—\nfrom de novo bank formation through merger and acquisition activity.\nDe novo bank formation promotes competition and greater availability of banking\nservices. As banks consolidate or wind down operations, new banks fill gaps in the banking\nsystem. But the significant decline in the number of de novo banks raises questions about\nwhether this pipeline can continue to be effective, even while there is existing and unmet demand\nfor new charters.10 While factors other than the regulatory climate for applications may influence\nbank formation, the application process itself can be a significant roadblock, one that can limit\nthe healthy formation of new community banks. For example, the M&A approval process can\nhave a disproportionate impact on community banks because the “screens” used to evaluate the\ncompetitive effects of a proposed merger often result in a finding that a rural market M&A is\n9 As I have noted in the past, even guidance with an applicability “threshold” may effectively establish new\nexpectations even for much smaller banks.

But I am concerned that fully pivoting to a\nsegment-by-segment analysis of competitive effects could, in practice, result in greater\nopportunities for regulatory objection to transactions, rather than as a mechanism to better reflect\nthe competitive pressures for community banks. Replacing the deposit-based threshold to\nanalyze competition with a completely open-ended approach—without standards for what\nproducts will be reviewed, what standards to apply for different products, and how to approach a\ntransaction where the competitive impacts vary by product type—seems likely to promote\ninconsistency in the analysis among firms, and even longer delays in processing times. This is\nespecially concerning when accompanied by changes that may result in even greater barriers to\nM&A regulatory approval.12\nFostering an environment that enables bank formation and merger transactions is vital to\nensuring a future for community banking. Without viable formation and merger options for all\nbanks, but especially for community banks, we will create a “barbell” in the banking system. If\nthis continues, it will eventually result in a handful of very large banks, and an ever-shrinking\n11 Michelle W.

Over time, these trends will result\nin a reduction in available credit and services, an increase in the number of unbanked or\nunderbanked communities, and economic harm.\nBuilding a Framework to Better Support Community Banks\nAfter acknowledging the importance of community banks and effectively defining these\nfirms, the next step is identifying principles for how these firms should be regulated and\nsupervised. The guiding principles are relatively straightforward: the approach must be tailored\nto risk, transparent, and consistent across similar institutions. Together, these elements can\ncreate an opportunity to construct an enduring community bank regulatory and supervisory\nframework for the future.\nThis conference provides an ideal venue to facilitate conversations that can help spur the\ndevelopment of blue-sky ideas to preserve community banking well into the future. While it\nwould be impossible to lay out a comprehensive blueprint for a community banking reform\nagenda in this speech, I see several opportunities that are promising and essential.\nThe Value of Experience\nBuilding this framework for the future starts with personnel, the people making decisions\nover the long term. How do we approach our responsibilities? We should highlight examples\nthat have been successful but also reflect on the significant work that remains to be done.\nCongress reserved one seat on the Federal Reserve Board for someone with demonstrated\nprimary experience working in or supervising community banks.13 While Congress did not\nenumerate any specific additional responsibilities for this particular seat on the Board, the\n13 12 U.S.C. § 241.\n\n- 12 -\ncreation of this role itself is an implicit acknowledgement of the value that this experience can\nbring across the Board’s functions, especially regarding bank regulation and supervision.\nThis experience, of having worked as a banker or as a state regulator, is uncommon\nwithin the Federal regulatory agencies. For example, of the current members of the Federal\nReserve Board, I am the only member with experience as a banker or state regulator. In my\nview, we should ask how someone with this experience in the community banking system can\nbest serve on the Board.\nThis experience and perspective is critical. As a former community banker at a state-\nchartered bank and as the State Bank Commissioner of Kansas, I have seen and directly\nexperienced the practical effect of supervision and regulation from “both sides” of the banker’s\ndesk. With this background, one understands and appreciates the importance of a respectful and\nhealthy partnership between state and federal regulators and the need for setting high standards\nand applying strong oversight to banks of all sizes, including community banks. This\nbackground also provides perspective on how overregulation can impose disproportionate burden\non a community bank, over time leading to the erosion of the viability of the community banking\nmodel.\nThe requirement for community banking experience does not equate to advocacy on\nbehalf of community banks. Instead, this role provides much-needed perspective on—and calls\nattention to—bank regulatory and supervisory matters that affect community banks.\nWhen I arrived at the Board, I was designated to serve as the chair of the Subcommittee\non Smaller Regional and Community Banking. One of my first priorities was to make clear to\nexamination staff the importance of their work in supervising community banks. After the 2008\nfinancial crisis, although many community banks failed, much of the supervisory attention\n\n- 13 -\nshifted to the very largest firms. The focus of this role provided the platform and opportunity to\nprioritize small regional and community banking issues, which led to a number of important\nsuccesses, including:\n• the creation of the Small Bank Supervision Working Group to focus on the unique issues\nfacing small banks with Reserve Bank staff from across the system;\n• the development and implementation of tools to assist community banks in complying\nwith the Current Expected Credit Losses (“CECL”) reporting change;\n• as interest rates were rising, encouraged supervisory focus to develop examination\nguidance to assess the risks associated with a changing interest rate environment and low\ntangible common equity, well before the spring 2023 banking failures;\n• improved frequency and content of communication with community banks; and\n• during the COVID-19 response, worked together with agency partners to implement\napproaches that encouraged banks to work with their borrowers, suspend exam timelines,\nand extend reporting deadlines for affected banks. During that time, staff also developed\nguidance for examiners as we emerged from the pandemic.\nThese accomplishments highlight how prioritizing community banking issues at the highest level\ncan improve the outcomes and experiences for community banks. We need a balanced approach\nto regulation and supervision of community banks. This approach should prioritize the key risks\nfacing the banking system, acknowledge the costs of regulation and supervision, and consider\nalternatives that may be more efficient than simply adding additional requirements and\nexpectations for smaller institutions.\nWhile I am proud of these accomplishments and our work together, a more formal\nstructure for this seat’s responsibilities—one that includes dedicated responsibility over the\n\n- 14 -\nsupervision and regulation of community banks, and to play an active role in interagency\ncoordinating bodies like the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC)—\nwould go a long way toward building and preserving an enduring framework that supports\ncommunity banks in the future.\nState Coordination\nOne priority that would enhance our current approach to supervision would be to more\neffectively engage and coordinate with state banking regulators. What does coordination look\nlike in practice? As a baseline, it should include communication during the consideration of\nregulatory proposals. But let’s begin with the examination process. One of the concerning\ntrends in 2023 were reports—including reports from state banking regulators—that some federal\nsupervisory actions were excessive considering the risks posed by some smaller institutions.14\nHistorically, such disagreements have been uncommon because the examination process for\nstate-chartered banks is joint between the state and federal counterparts at the Fed or the FDIC.\nWe share responsibility for oversight of state banks, and jointly participate in examinations, so it\nis unsurprising that we often reach similar conclusions. When there are disagreements,\nsupervisory divergence can also signal material changes in approach or standards, a shift that\nfails to accomplish the goal of effective supervisory judgment and consistency in the supervision\nof banks of all types.\nThere are other opportunities to expand coordination with states, both through formal\ncoordination bodies and when engaged in rule making efforts that are intended to impact state-\n14 Michelle W. Bowman, “Defining a Bank,” (speech at the American Bankers Association 2024 Conference for\nCommunity Bankers, San Antonio, Texas, February 12, 2024),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20240212a.pdf; Michelle W. Bowman, “New\nYear’s Resolutions for Bank Regulatory Policymakers,” (speech at the South Carolina Bankers Association 2024\nCommunity Bankers Conference, Columbia, South Carolina, January 8, 2024),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20240108a.pdf.\n\n- 15 -\nchartered institutions. These coordination bodies include (1) the FFIEC—which is tasked with\nprescribing uniform principles, standards, and reporting forms for the federal examination of\nfinancial institutions, and making recommendations to promote consistency in the supervision of\nfinancial institutions—and (2) the Financial and Banking Information Infrastructure\nCommittee—which is tasked with promoting information sharing and enhancing incident\nresponse planning, in addition to identifying cybersecurity best practices.\nCoordination is only effective if we are committed to work in an open, collaborative, and\nbalanced way with other agencies and policymakers. There are unmet opportunities on this\nfront. For example, the FFIEC is the venue in which regulators coordinate on examination\nstandards and discuss and agree on reporting requirements that apply to smaller banks. With a\ngrowing divergence in the approach of state and federal regulators to the examination process,\nwe need to ask how the FFIEC can better accomplish its goals.\nWe also need to ask whether the other important work of the FFIEC, like establishing\nreporting requirements, is being conducted in an appropriate way. The opportunities for input,\nreview, and oversight of this important work are very limited, with only the Board representative\non the FFIEC participating. Notwithstanding these structural impediments, I have prioritized\nrationalizing the Call Report, an effort that I revived when I joined the Board.\nThese types of overly broad requirements pose their own risks to community banks, and\nwe should remember to focus on the unglamorous work of making sure we are not collecting\nmore data than is necessary and appropriate for supervisory purposes, and that we are efficient in\nthe collection of that data, for example, by leveraging data previously collected instead of\nrequiring further collection of the same data.\n\n- 16 -\nRegulators also tend to be very proprietary about the development of regulatory and\nsupervisory proposals. Often, policies are far along in the development process before they are\npublished for public comment in the rulemaking process, and state banking regulators rarely\nprovide feedback on proposals before or after they are put out for comment.\nWhile regulators tasked with implementing regulations, supervision, and guidance bear\nthe ultimate responsibility for those policy choices, this process can greatly benefit from more\ninteraction among federal regulators and our state bank regulatory counterparts. More extensive\ndialogue with state regulators can improve proposals in the formulation stage by sharing\npractical, real-world perspectives, including observations on the impacts of intended and\nunintended consequences. While it is challenging to anticipate the unintended consequences of\nreforms, casting a wide net for views can lead to better, less disruptive, and better-informed\npolicy choices.\nThe importance of enhancing coordination between state regulators and the Federal\nReserve cannot be overstated. At a recent meeting of the Board’s Subcommittee on Smaller\nRegional and Community Banking, my colleagues and I were delighted to welcome\nrepresentatives of the Conference of State Bank Supervisors and four of their State Bank\nCommissioner members. We learned firsthand about the successes, frustrations, concerns, and\nareas for improvement in the coordination between state and federal regulators. There is simply\nno substitute for these direct conversations and building upon and improving these important\nintergovernmental relationships.\nCollaborative Approach to Reform\nHistorically, one of the many virtues of the Federal Reserve Board is the structural\nincentive to work together to achieve compromise. Governors serve extended, staggered terms\n\n- 17 -\nintended to insulate them from political considerations. The Board consists of seven independent\ngovernors who often bring their unique voices to a range of policy matters. While instances of\ndissent tend to attract the most attention, the Fed has a long history and tradition of engaging in\nthoughtful debate, exchange of views, and reaching more durable compromises on rulemaking\nmatters. The history of consensus on bank regulatory matters is not surprising because we work\ntoward common goals of safety and soundness and financial stability.\nConsensus is a powerful tool. When there is broad policy agreement, there tends to be\nmoderation in approach, acting as a check on wild swings of the regulatory pendulum and\nproviding banks and holding companies with an important degree of stability in their regulatory\nand supervisory expectations. While it is important for regulators to adapt to changing\nconditions, and to evolve in the face of new and emerging risks, this incremental approach tends\nto produce better policy and better outcomes in the banking system.\nThe antithesis of this policymaking approach is one that involves the close guarding of\ninformation, limiting the airing of competing views, and failing to engage in meaningful\ndiscussion and debate about policy. When contrasting these two ends of the policymaking\nspectrum, the virtues of consensus-building are even more apparent. Regulatory reform should\nnot be a “shock” to the banking system, and meaningful discussion and consensus act as a check\non dramatic swings of the regulatory pendulum.\nCollaborative reform is more effective when we have both a widespread sharing of\ninformation, analysis, and policy perspectives, and when a range of views is brought to bear on\nimportant regulatory questions. One way that we can accomplish this goal is through\nrepresentation of those with banking or state regulatory experience representing the Federal\nReserve in bodies that are influential in the shaping of policy approaches, like the FFIEC, and by\n\n- 18 -\nembracing a culture of freely sharing information among policymakers both within and across\nregulatory agencies.\nAssessing the Costs and Benefits of Existing Approaches and Reform\nToo often when regulators impose requirements on banks, the temptation is to\noverestimate the benefits and underestimate the costs. Requiring banks to report additional data\nallows us to better understand the operations of banks. Limiting the fees that may be charged to\nconsumers may result in a short-run reduction in consumer costs. But in the long run, regulation\ncarries with it many costs, ranging from the direct costs of compliance and capital to indirect\ncosts like the reduction in product offerings or increased prices for consumers. Regulators must\nanticipate, assess, and balance these costs in the rulemaking process and accept that, at times, the\nright policy is not to impose additional regulations but rather to take actions to reduce the burden\nof existing regulatory requirements.\nOne of the key challenges to pursuing this balancing is how to effectively complete the\nanalysis. The incremental burden of any single regulatory reform may be challenging to\nmeasure—its costs may seem minor when weighed against the benefits. But this approach\nignores the additional cost of cumulative burdens, a concern that is particularly acute among\ncommunity banks faced with an onslaught of changes.\nIf we ignore cumulative burdens, we risk more rapid and pronounced swings in the\nregulatory pendulum. These swings in approach risk not only our ability to effectively supervise\nbanks, but banks’ ability to effectively manage their business.15 When faced with regulatory\nchange, how does bank management review and provide meaningful comment on voluminous\n15 Michelle W. Bowman, “Bank Mergers and Acquisition, and De Novo Bank Formation: Implications for the\nFuture of the Banking System,” (speech at a Workshop on the Future of Banking hosted by the Federal Reserve\nBank of Kansas City, Kansas City, Missouri, April 2, 2024),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20240402a.pdf.\n\n- 19 -\nconcurrent regulatory proposals that may build upon proposed, but not finalized regulations?\nWhen new rules are adopted, how can a bank ensure it has appropriate staffing and resources to\nensure compliance?\nThe cumulative burden of regulation is rarely acknowledged in the rulemaking process.\nWhile we assess burden with respect to discrete rule changes, there is no obligation to “refresh”\nthat analysis due to changes in underlying conditions or new information about impact absent a\nfurther rule change. And the analysis of a rule focuses on the incremental impact of the specific\nregulation, ignoring the likely aggregate effect of requirements.\nWhile the minimum legal process required under the Administrative Procedure Act\nshould be the “floor” for rulemaking, in my view it is insufficient. Likewise, while policymakers\nhave even greater discretion in pursuing changes to supervision, we need not do so in a vacuum\nwithout opportunities for—and a receptiveness to—feedback. We can and should expand the\nlens through which we consider proposals, in a way that considers the cumulative effects of\nregulation and supervision on banks and their ultimate customers, in a way that identifies\nredundancies and excessive burdens, and in a way that considers multiple alternatives and the\ntradeoffs of different approaches.\nTailoring\nFinally, I would be remiss to discuss the future of community banking without noting one\nof the critical mechanisms to build a sensible framework for the future—tailoring. Tailoring\nhelps us calibrate regulation and supervision to the activities and risks at every tier within our\noversight framework, but it is particularly important when we think about the application of\nprudential tools to community banks. Tailoring our approach helps with the allocation of finite\nresources—among both banks and regulators. It enables us to right-size the approach to\n\n- 20 -\nregulation and supervision to the complexity of banks, acknowledging that community banks\nthat pose manageable risks in the event of their failure, and no real risk to financial stability,\nsimply do not warrant the same treatment as larger, more complex, and more systemically\ninterconnected banking institutions.\nWhile in some cases, policymakers have made efforts to promote appropriate tailoring,\noften the end result has been lacking. As I noted earlier, in my view the 2023 CRA reforms\nrepresent a missed opportunity to rationalize and right-size CRA requirements for community\nbanks. Instead, the rule applied the same essential framework to all institutions above $2 billion\nin assets, scoping in community banks with the very largest global systemically important banks.\nEven where supervisory approaches take into account the needs of community banks, the end\nresult requires reviewing and incorporating ever-increasing guidance into their risk management\nactivities. This was certainly the case with regulatory guidance on third-party risk management.\nTo be clear, tailoring is not only an efficient way to allocate resources, but the lack of\ntailoring poses a longer-term threat to the viability of community and smaller banks. As the\nbanking system evolves, with new opportunities and new risks, the temptation is to simply\nincrease the body of regulatory requirements, without doing the necessary work of\n“maintenance,” to ensure that the set of requirements that applies to banking activities is\nappropriate.16\nOften, our guidance has a “cumulative” or “compounding” effect—a bank cannot go to a\nsingle source or compendium to understand supervisory expectations or requirements for a\nparticular activity. Instead, a banker must parse through multiple regulations and guidance\n16 The banking agencies have an obligation under the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act\nof 1996 to review their regulations every 10 years to identify, with input from the public, outdated, unnecessary, or\nunduly burdensome regulation and to consider how to reduce regulatory burden. See 12 U.S.C. § 3311.\n\n- 21 -\nbefore understanding how regulators expect an activity to be conducted. A community banking\nregulatory framework that enables small banks to thrive must prioritize tailoring.\nClosing Thoughts\nThank you for your commitment to community banking, and conducting the important\nresearch that can inform the regulatory policy agenda. Community banks may be small but their\ncontributions to local communities are mighty. The importance of their role in providing credit\nto a broad range of customers and businesses that in their absence would have far fewer banking\noptions cannot be overstated.\nThere simply is no alternative or replacement for community banks and the relationship\nbanking model. If regulators believe in a dynamic banking system, if we support financial\ninclusion and extending the availability of banking access, we must acknowledge the importance\nof community banks and ensure that our regulatory framework preserves their role for the future.\nTo function effectively, the banking system requires the presence of banks of all sizes—larger,\nregional, and community banks. This diversity of our financial institutions is the greatest\nstrength of our banking system, and it can easily be imperiled by insufficiently targeted\nregulation, supervision, and guidance.\nThe discussions we will have over the next two days will include steps to further preserve\nand enhance the future of community banking. The presentations will enhance our\nunderstanding of the dynamics and pressures that shape the banking system, identify issues and\nconcerns that may threaten different bank business models and activities, and develop policy\napproaches that consider the tradeoffs in our regulatory and supervisory approach.",

Bowman\nVice Chair for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\n(via pre-recorded video)\nat\n2025 Federal Reserve Stress Testing Research Conference\nBoston, Massachusetts\nOctober 16, 2025\n\nWelcome to the 2025 Federal Reserve Stress Testing Research Conference.1\nAlthough I am not able to join you in person today, I would like to take a moment to\nacknowledge the important contributions this conference has made and continues to make\nin promoting research on the stress testing process and related issues.\nI would like to start by thanking the organizing committee, our presenters, and all\nof the participants joining us at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston at our Stress Test\nResearch Conference. This event brings together academics, regulators, and industry\nexperts, encouraging broad collaboration and rigorous discussion.\nThis conference marks a critical and necessary evolution in the Federal Reserve’s\nstress test program. Stress testing is an important supervisory tool that was initially\ndesigned to maintain financial stability and establish binding capital requirements for the\nlargest banks. As the role of stress testing must evolve, we have shifted our focus to\nenhance the reliability and credibility of both the process and its outcomes. Going\nforward, the Federal Reserve is committed to transparency and ensuring that public input\nand stakeholder comment enhance the program over time.\nStress testing remains an important element of the Board’s capital framework and\nsupervisory program for large banks. To promote public accountability and achieve\nrobust outcomes, the Board plans to solicit public comment on various stress testing\nreforms later this month. This proposal seeks to ensure that any substantive changes are\ninformed by public input prior to their adoption.\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee\n\n- 2 -\nThese actions are part of a broader set of capital-related measures designed to\nright-size and recalibrate the regulatory framework to better balance safety and soundness\nwith the role of the financial system in promoting economic growth. The Board intends\nto leverage public and industry perspectives to further improve the stress test.\nThe stress testing package will provide detailed model descriptions, including\nassumptions and limitations for each model, as well as the rationale behind key modeling\nchoices. The proposal will invite public comment on the specific modeling changes that\nthe Board plans to implement for the 2026 stress test, including proposed changes that\naddress the sensitivity of pre-provision net revenue projections to recent bank\nperformance, and to improve the design and related assumptions for certain models\nincluding credit losses, operational risk and securities.\nThe second aspect of the proposal seeks comment on scenario design for the\nstress test, particularly the guides governing the variables included in the severely\nadverse macroeconomic scenario. The proposal would also include details on the\nmacroeconomic model used to formulate the paths of the variables that are not\ndetermined by a guide for a given annual scenario. In addition, the proposal would cover\ndisclosure of the global market shock framework, including the logic behind shock\nseverity, liquidity horizons and the description of the models generating these shocks.\nThird, the proposal would solicit public comment on the severely adverse scenario\nthat the Board intends to use for the 2026 stress test.\n\n- 3 -\nWhile I have attempted to provide a high-level summary of the proposal, it is not\npossible to capture the depth and breadth of the changes. We look forward to working\nwith all of our stakeholders to improve our stress test and reduce the year-over-year\nvolatility in the stress testing results.\nBefore I conclude, I would like to recognize the dedication and professionalism of\nour stress testing staff at both the Board and Reserve Banks. The pending comprehensive\nstress testing package reflects countless hours of diligent work, perseverance, and\ncollaboration. This robust and thorough proposal would not have been possible without\nthe extraordinary commitment of all involved. I am grateful for your contributions and\nwould like to formally acknowledge your essential role in this important work.\nThank you to our attendees for your continued partnership and dedication to\nresearch and collaboration in stress testing. Your engagement helps us build a safer and\nmore resilient financial system.",

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nArkansas Women’s Commission Meeting\nRussellville, Arkansas\nAugust 17, 2022\n\nIt’s a pleasure to be with you today to talk about a subject that I experience\ndirectly—women’s labor force participation.1 I come to this issue with a similar\nperspective to this Commission, being from a heavily rural state and a small farming and\nranching community deep in the Flint Hills of Kansas. But I also have roots here in\nArkansas, my husband’s family is from Hardy, and my father’s mother was from Little\nRock. It’s really nice to be back in an area where I spent a lot of time growing up.\nMy husband and I returned home to Kansas with our two children under three in\nlate 2009, just as the impacts of the last financial crisis were making their way to rural\nareas. At the time, I was a community banker, which means I was also a very active\nmember of the community. As I am sure many of you did then, I saw firsthand the\neconomic impacts of the recession and the increased drug and opioid use that devastated\nmany rural communities across the Midwest.\nAt that time, many in the community received benefits from well-intended\nprograms created to provide assistance, which often made it very difficult for small\nemployers to find employees. This was often because, as I learned when trying to hire\nemployees at our local chamber of commerce, the benefit from taking a job was much\nless than the benefit one could receive from the government at that time while not\nworking. This is one major similarity between the current experience and the last\nrecession, except that in this episode, the benefits many received were far in excess of\nwhat they could earn from working. So much so that the benefits provided to a large\nnumber of Americans resulted in a significant increase in savings, which is only recently\n1 These remarks reflect my views and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of Governors\nand the Federal Open Market Committee. I am grateful to Federal Reserve staff members Nick Carollo,\nWendy Dunn, Charles Fleischman and Stacey Tevlin for their assistance in preparing this text.\n\n- 2 -\nbeginning to decline and likely leading many who had not yet decided to re-enter the\nworkforce to find work. These labor supply problems, as I will explain, are a large part\nof women’s experience in the workforce since the pandemic, and the lesson from this and\nother recessions is that policymakers need to carefully weigh all of the consequences of\ntheir decisions.\nIt is fair to say that the majority of the economic conditions we are experiencing\ntoday, like inflation, are different from those of the last financial crisis. But as I just\nnoted, there are some similarities in the impacts on the labor force.\nTurning to the subject of my remarks today, I will discuss the role of women in\nthe U.S. economy, focusing on the period since the onset of COVID-19.2 You may\nalready know that women suffered disproportionately more job losses than men during\nthe pandemic. This was the opposite of what happened in past recessions, when men lost\njobs at a higher rate than women. The difference this time has led some to call the 2020\ndownturn a “she-cession.” Most of the differences between how men and women fared\nin the labor market during that time had reversed by 2021, but their different experiences\nhighlight how participation by men and women can sometimes be driven by different\nforces.\nThe backdrop for recent events is the long history, starting after World War II, of\nwomen gradually entering the labor market. Of course, women have always significantly\ncontributed to and played a large role in the U.S. economy, but initially in ways that don’t\nshow up in most government statistics. The rise of industrialization and the shift away\nfrom an agrarian economy provided opportunities for men to work outside the home and\n2These remarks reflect my own views and not necessarily those of the Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 3 -\nwomen took on more responsibility for cooking, sewing, child-rearing and other domestic\ntasks.3 We heard an echo of that history during the pandemic, because when schools\nclosed and other childcare was disrupted, women assumed the majority of those\ncaregiving responsibilities, which led many to quit their jobs and drop out of the labor\nforce. This magnified the effect by eliminating jobs in childcare resulting in even more\nunemployment. But that wasn’t the only reason why women were impacted during this\nepisode.\nLet me start with the big picture on the differences between men and women in\nthe labor market. Before 1950, few women worked outside the home and the majority of\nthose who did were unmarried. From 1950 to 1970, more women entered the workforce,\nbut many did not plan to work for the long term, and their investment in education and\ntraining was often limited.4 By the mid-1970s, barriers that limited opportunities for\nwomen in many workplaces began to fall, and by 1990 the education gap between men\nand women narrowed significantly. Women’s participation steadily increased from there\nuntil the gains leveled off in the 1990s, but then rose again from 2015 to 2020, just before\nthe pandemic. The narrowing of educational attainment for men and women had a lot to\ndo with the narrowing of participation rates over the decades, and today women are more\nlikely than men to hold a bachelor’s degree. Even so, before the pandemic, overall\nparticipation remained lower for women than men regardless of education level.\n3 See Claudia Golden (2021), Career & Family: Women’s Century-Long Journey Toward Equity\n(Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press).\n4 See Claudia Goldin (2006), “The Quiet Revolution that Transformed Women’s Employment, Education,\nand Family,” American Economic Review, vol. 96 (2), pp. 1–21.\n\n- 4 -\nThe response to the COVID-19 pandemic caused the most abrupt decline in\nemployment in the history of this nation.5 The lockdowns and other government\nrestrictions on businesses severely limited work, education, and travel. In February 2020,\nover 60 percent of working-age people had a job or were looking for work, but by April it\nwas closer to half that amount. The pandemic hit all sectors of the economy, but the toll\nwas especially heavy on in-person, close-contact service industries—restaurants, hotels,\nairline travel, and retail businesses other than big box stores, grocery stores and\npharmacies. These in-person service-industry jobs were considered more conducive to\nspreading COVID-19, they were more affected by government-mandated shutdowns and\nsocial distancing, and teleworking was generally not possible.\nUnlike any previous recession, the downturn in employment fell more heavily on\nwomen than men. The unemployment rates for men and women were essentially the\nsame before the pandemic but ended up much higher for women.6 That was very\ndifferent from past recessions. For example, after the recession following the housing\ncrisis, unemployment for prime working age men rose to 11 percent, compared to only 9\npercent for prime age women.7\nThe women’s labor force participation rate is another way to measure their\npresence in the workforce. Women have made significant progress in closing the gap\nwith men since the 1960s, including in the five years before the pandemic, but that gap\n5 In just two months, the unemployment rate rose from 3.5 percent to 14.7 percent. While unemployment\nwas higher during the Great Depression of the 1930s, it never rose this quickly.\n6 Unemployment rose to 16.1 percent for women but only 13.5 percent for men in April 2020.\n7 The U.S. Department of Labor define prime age workers as those 25-54.\n\n- 5 -\nreopened after the onset of COVID-19.8 The number of both prime working age men and\nwomen in the labor force plunged, but the drop was half a million larger for women.\nFrom what we know now, there appear to be two main reasons why the pandemic\ndownturn affected women more than men. First, even after the dramatic employment\ngains over the past 50 years, women are still most often the primary caregivers to\nchildren and other family members. They shouldered most of the childcare burden from\nthe COVID school closures. Second, a higher proportion of women worked in and\ncontinue to be employed in positions in the high-contact service sectors that were hit\nhardest by the pandemic.\nCaregiving burdens in the United States have always fallen more heavily on\nwomen. In the 20 years before the pandemic, roughly one-fourth of prime-age women\nwith children didn’t participate in the workforce. An even larger share of women with\nchildren under five were primarily engaged in childcare. Many women with children\ntend to cycle in and out of employment based on their family’s childcare demands.\nWomen are significantly affected by the summer childcare burdens of families with\nchildren. Each year between May and July, when schools close for the summer, the\nemployment-to-population ratio for prime age women declines by more than a percentage\npoint and then rebounds when schools reopen in the fall. That difference is one-third of\nthe total drop that prime-age women experienced following a very bad recession, the one\nfollowing the housing crisis.9\n8 Part of the reason women closed the participation gap with prime working age men after 1965 is that\nparticipation by this cohort of men gradually declined. Major reasons for this decline in prime age male\nparticipation likely were increasing trade, globalization, and technological changes that reduced the number\nof manufacturing jobs, which were held primarily by men.\n9 See Brendan Price and Melanie Wasserman (2022), “The Summer Drop in Female Employment,” CESifo\nWorking Paper 9783 (Munich: CESifo, June), https://www.cesifo.org/DocDL/cesifo1_wp9783.pdf.\n\n- 6 -\nToday, working women still carry out most childcare responsibilities. One study\nconducted before the pandemic found that when both parents work, women spend\n50 percent more time on childcare than men.10 And when the pandemic closed many\nschools, it was largely women who stayed home. Women with children saw their labor\nforce participation rate and employment-to-population ratio fall more than for women\nwithout children, while men were much less affected regardless of whether they had\nchildren. According to one Federal Reserve study, increased caregiving burdens for\nmothers with school aged children accounted for about three-fourths of the decline in\nwomen in the labor force from February 2020 to August 2021 but only about one-third of\nthe decline for fathers.11 Even after most children returned to in-person schooling,\ncaregiving continues to weigh on female participation in the labor force, likely because of\nincreased care for elderly or ill family members.12\nThe other major factor affecting women during the pandemic was the larger\nnumber of female employees in high-contact service-sector jobs, where demand dropped\nsharply during the pandemic and the government-imposed restrictions in response to\nCOVID-19.\nDuring past recessions, women experienced fewer job losses because service-\nsector jobs were more stable in downturns. Historically, goods-producing industries were\nharder hit, and men, who tended to hold these roles, were more likely to lose their jobs.13\nBut during the pandemic, it was service jobs that were more likely to be lost. Before the\n10 https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/10/01/women-more-than-men-adjust-their-careers-for-\nfamily-life/\n11 Montes, Joshua, Christopher Smith and Isabel Leigh. 2021. “Caregiving for Children and Parental Labor\nForce Participation during the Pandemic.” FEDS Notes, Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System.\n12 Montes, Smith and Leigh (2021.)\n13 Albanese and Sahin (2018)\n\n- 7 -\npandemic, more than 75 percent of these workers were women. Between February and\nApril 2020, service sector employment fell 40 percent. Job losses in other industries with\ngreater proportions of male workers, like manufacturing, were much smaller. We have\nalso seen recovery in service-sector jobs lag behind other sectors. Employment in\nindustries that tend to have larger shares of female workers, such as leisure and\nhospitality, education, and health services, is still below pre-pandemic levels. The losses\nfor women are even larger when considering how fast these industries were growing\nbefore the pandemic.\nThe shift to remote work may have been a mitigating factor for employment for\nwomen without college degrees. Overall, workers without college degrees were hit\nparticularly hard by the pandemic recession because remote work was much more\ncommon for those with a degree. 14 However, women without degrees were affected less\nthan men, probably because the jobs they held were more likely to be able to be\nperformed remotely than those of men without college degrees.15\nWe have seen a substantial recovery in the labor market for both genders since the\nworst of the pandemic. By the end of 2020, unemployment rates had equalized, and the\ngap between gender participation rates had returned to pre-pandemic levels in 2021.\nHowever, because that gap had been narrowing in the five years prior to the onset of\nCOVID, we can assume that the participation gap would have continued to decrease over\nthat time.\n14 Around 62 percent of college education workers worked remotely in May 2020. See Claudia Goldin\n(2022), “Understanding the Economic Impact of COVID-19 on Women.” Brookings Papers on Economic\nActivity, Spring, https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/SP22_BPEA_Goldin_conf-\ndraft.pdf.\n15 25 percent of non-college women worked remotely at that time, compared with 14 percent of non-college\nmen. Goldin (2022)\n\n- 8 -\nSo, based on what we know about the history and recent experience of women in\nthe labor market, what does the future hold for working women?\nOn the demand side, the labor market continues to be strong and there are\nabundant job opportunities for workers of all education and skill levels. With about four\nmillion fewer people participating in the workforce today, there are still plenty of jobs\navailable even if we see the number of job openings reduced. We are also seeing a larger\nnumber of women graduating from college than men, a development that is likely to help\ninsulate women from job losses in future recessions.\nOne complication is that the future of labor supply is uncertain, and it is difficult\nto predict how labor force participation will evolve. Factors like generational aging were\nalready weighing on labor supply before the pandemic, and we saw millions of workers\naccelerate retirement during the pandemic, effectively retiring early. Even the strong\nlabor market has not yet lured many of these early retirees back, and some believe that as\ntime passes it becomes less likely that they will return. Over time, those who chose to\nleave the workforce early will move into a normal retirement age. We really don’t know\nif gender will be a factor here as this is the first generation to retire that had large\nnumbers of women in the workforce, but workforce aging is an important consideration\nwhen it comes to labor supply. We also don’t know how the influence of inflation will\naffect decision making about returning to the workforce, but some may feel compelled to\nreturn to work.\nAnother consideration is caregiving demands and how those responsibilities will\nbe shared within households. While I hope that we never see a public health emergency\nlike the one we’ve just been through, I hope that if we do, we can avoid the governmental\n\n- 9 -\ndecisions to intentionally disrupt foundational education and the unnecessary forced\nisolation of children. These policies have left a significant impact on this generation of\nchildren, on families and their decision making about many things including participation\nin the labor force.\nOne ongoing labor supply issue relates to the lingering effects of COVID that can\ninterfere with the ability to work or impose additional caregiving needs for family\nmembers. By one account, nearly a fifth of adults who contracted COVID reported\nongoing symptoms of “long COVID,” affecting significantly more women than men. At\nthe same time, the number of working-age people with disabilities has increased\nsignificantly. While the number of Americans reporting a disability had been rising\ngradually over the past decade, the increase picked up in mid-2020, and about 2 million\nmore people reported they had a disability in July 2022 than at the outset of the\npandemic.16\nDisability has been a major drag on the work force in rural areas in the past.\nLiving in rural Kansas following the last recession, as I mentioned earlier, I am very\nfamiliar with the challenges that disability presents for many aspects of the community—\nbeyond just economic conditions. Disability is also a significant challenge in Arkansas.\nWomen’s labor force attachment in Arkansas is below the national average. In the five\nyears before the pandemic, about 72 percent of prime-age women here were either\nworking or looking for work, compared with 75 percent nationally. This difference in\n16 See U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (2022), “Population—With a Disability, 16 Years and Over,”\nretrieved from FRED, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, August 5,\nhttps://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNU00074597.\n\n- 10 -\nlabor force participation is primarily explained by illness or disability and existed long\nbefore the onset of COVID.\nThere is no magic wand that will draw workers back into the labor force,\nespecially when generous government benefits programs are provided for those who are\ncapable of working. But as challenging as these issues are to address, there are some\nlessons to draw from experience and research regarding approaches that encourage\npeople to work. Research suggests that assistance programs including job search\nassistance, training programs, and private-sector employment subsidies increase the\nlikelihood of employment by up to 10 percent for those who utilize the programs.17 The\nbenefits of this assistance are not always immediately realized, but women were more\nlikely to benefit from job training and private-sector employment programs.\nIn conclusion, although we still have about 4 million people out of the pre-\npandemic workforce, we continue to see strong employment gains and low\nunemployment rates—the kind of labor market that historically has pulled in more\nworkers. As the service sector continues to recover and as schools and childcare\nestablishments open more fully, I see potential for greater employment opportunities for\nwomen in the future. Obviously, economic conditions will influence job opportunities\ngoing forward. Today’s high inflation and strong employment will likely create some\npressure on labor and employment.\n17 See David Card, Jochen Kluve, and Andrea Weber (2018), “What Works?

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n2023 CEO and Senior Management Summit and Annual Meeting, sponsored by\nthe Kansas Bankers Association\nColorado Springs, Colorado\nAugust 5, 2023\n\nThank you for the invitation to join you again this year.1 As a former Kansas\nbanker, it is always great to be with Kansas bankers. I look forward to opportunities to\nlearn about and discuss the issues affecting financial institutions and your communities,\nfrom supervision and regulation to how you and you customers are navigating the current\neconomic and financial environment.\nBefore we turn to our conversation, I’ll offer a few thoughts on the economy and\nmonetary policy. As you likely know, at our most recent meeting in July, the Federal\nOpen Market Committee (FOMC) raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 25\nbasis points—to a range of 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent—and we continue to reduce the Fed’s\nsecurities holdings. Since March 2022, the FOMC has been tightening monetary policy\nas part of our ongoing effort to lower unacceptably high inflation. Since then, we have\nseen some progress, and inflation has declined from last year’s very high level. Most\nrecently, after more than six months of stubbornly high readings, the June consumer price\nindex showed lower core inflation, a measure that excludes food and energy prices.\nWhile this development is a positive sign that monetary policy is contributing to lower\ninflation, both total and core inflation remain well above our 2 percent target.\nAt the same time, the economy and the labor market have remained strong as the\nFOMC has tightened monetary policy. Real gross domestic product grew slightly more\nthan 2 percent at an annual rate in the first half of the year, well above many forecasters’\nexpectations. Consumer spending has been robust, and the housing sector appears to be\nrebounding with accelerating growth in house prices and a pickup in new housing starts.\nThe most recent employment report showed a strong labor market with low\n1 The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee or the Board of Governors.\n\n- 2 -\nunemployment and solid job gains. The pace of job gains has slowed, which is a sign\nthat labor market demand and supply are coming into better balance. But the demand for\nworkers continues to exceed the supply of available job seekers, adding upward pressure\non prices.\nThe banking system continues to be strong and resilient. While banks have\ntightened lending standards in response to higher interest rates and funding costs, there\nhave not been signs of a further sharp contraction in credit from the stress earlier this year\nthat would slow economic activity. Though loan balance growth has slowed, banks have\ncontinued to increase lending to households and businesses.\nGiven the strong economic data and still elevated inflation, I supported the\nFOMC’s decision in July to further increase the target range for the federal funds rate. I\nalso expect that additional rate increases will likely be needed to get inflation on a path\ndown to the FOMC’s 2 percent target.\nThe recent lower inflation reading was positive, but I will be looking for\nconsistent evidence that inflation is on a meaningful path down toward our 2 percent goal\nas I consider further rate increases and how long the federal funds rate will need to\nremain at a restrictive level. I will also be watching for signs of slowing in consumer\nspending and signs that labor market conditions are loosening.\nIt’s important to reiterate that monetary policy is not on a preset course. My\ncolleagues and I will make our decisions based on the incoming data and its implications\nfor the economic outlook. We should remain willing to raise the federal funds rate at a\nfuture meeting if the incoming data indicate that progress on inflation has stalled.\n\n- 3 -\nReturning inflation to our 2 percent goal is necessary to achieve a sustainably\nstrong labor market and economy.",

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe Salzburg Global Seminar on\nFinancial Technology Innovation, Social Impact, and Regulation: Do We Need New Paradigms?\nSalzburg, Austria\nJune 17, 2024\n\nIt is a pleasure to be back in Salzburg again for the next chapter in the Global Seminar,\nfocusing on financial technology innovations and the developing financial regulatory\nframework.1 At this same gathering last year, we discussed the potential evolution of the bank\nregulatory framework in response to the banking stress during the spring of 2023. At that time,\nwe were taking stock of the regulatory reforms implemented after the 2008 financial crisis and\nevaluating whether those reforms—and the resulting bank regulatory and supervisory framework\nwe have now—were effective and efficient, and whether improvements may be appropriate. Of\ncourse, many of those conversations are ongoing in the United States, with proposals—in\nvarying levels of formality—under discussion, including new and expanded long-term debt\nrequirements for non-global systemically important banks (G-SIBs), new liquidity requirements,\nand a host of other supervisory and regulatory reforms. These are in addition to other regulatory\nreform matters, including Basel III capital reforms and changes to the G-SIB surcharge\nframework, that are not directly related to the 2023 banking stress.\nPolicy reforms in the United States, at times and to varying degrees, have arguably\nsuffered from a lack of appropriate prioritization and focus.2 This trend has been evident\nrecently, when one considers the sheer volume of reforms that have recently been completed,\nthat have been proposed, or that are in the pipeline. Often shortchanged in the rush to implement\nreforms are considerations of effectiveness and efficiency—effectiveness in addressing identified\n1 The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee or the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\n2 See Michelle W. Bowman, “Remarks on the Economy and Prioritization of Bank Supervision and Regulation”\n(speech at the New York Bankers Association’s Financial Services Forum, Palm Beach, Florida, November 9,\n2023), https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20231109a.pdf; Michelle W.

So, today I would like\nto discuss how we can create a regulatory environment that fosters successful innovation. I will\nfocus my remarks on the United States, specifically innovation within the “regulatory perimeter”\nin which regulated institutions—banks, holding companies, and their affiliates—operate.\nHowever, I think this approach has broader relevance for how regulation can more effectively\nsupport and promote innovation, including internationally.\nThe implications of our regulatory approach go beyond just the banking system. A\nreflexive “no” from regulators can encourage activity to migrate out of the banking system. The\nresult could be decreased transparency, lower regulatory standards, and increased risks to\nfinancial stability. We tend to think that the “stakes” are confined to a particular technology or\ninnovation, but this is a misleading approach. Instead, we should adopt a broader approach that\nconsiders financial system stability. To implement a successful “same activity, same risk, same\nregulation” approach requires either broad-based legislation to coordinate these standards or an\neffective interagency approach that incorporates regulators beyond traditional banking\nregulators.\nBenefits of Innovation\nIn my experience, regulators love innovation—in the abstract. The idea of innovation is\nan alluring one. Among other things, innovation can help develop a faster and more efficient\nbanking and payments system, it can lower the cost and expand the availability of products and\n\n- 3 -\nservices to consumers and businesses, it can improve the speed and reduce counterparty risk of\nsecurities transactions, and it can promote market competition.\nAnd we see evidence all around in the banking system where innovation has had\ntransformative effects: we have automated teller machines (ATMs) that allow ready access to\ncash and basic account services, we have the ability to make electronic payments at merchants\nboth in-person and online, and almost every bank customer can access their bank account or\ntransfer money to a friend by using only their mobile phone. When innovation becomes\ncommonplace, and with the passage of time, we lose sight of the long and sometimes tortured\nroad these innovators traveled to introduce and embed them into customer expectations for\nbanking services.\nI see a common theme between innovation as an abstract idea and “established”\ninnovation that has become the new norm in the financial landscape—namely, that neither of\nthese versions force us to confront the risks of the unknown. The abstract version does not force\nus to confront its practical implications, including: How does it work? What benefits could it\nbring? What risks does it present, and how will those risks be managed? Similarly, by the point\nat which the innovation becomes widely adopted and accepted, hopefully we have done the\ndifficult work. We have come to understand the challenges it presents and have accepted the\ntradeoffs between the benefits, and the associated risks and costs, of allowing the new\ntechnology or process improvement to be introduced into the banking system.\nWhen we think about the abstract, or look back on successful innovation, we lose sight of\nthe unique path forged to ensure its success. Many of the technologies that we will discuss\nduring this conference have the potential to bring benefits, including greater efficiency to\nbanking and payments. So how do we create an environment that allows innovation to flourish\n\n- 4 -\nand in which regulated banking institutions are able to play a role? In the past I have spoken\nabout three principles that I believe are necessary building blocks to fostering innovation:\ndeveloping an understanding of the technology, having an open approach to innovation, and\nmaking innovation a priority in the development of regulatory frameworks.3 I would like to\nrevisit these principles today.\nUnderstanding Innovation\nAs a threshold matter, regulators and innovators share some responsibilities when it\ncomes to innovation. Regulators must work hard to understand the functionality of new\ninnovation, including the benefits innovation can bring and its accompanying risks. Regulators\nmust not fall into the trap of complacency. Comfort with the known and familiar risks of how\nthings have always been done can present a barrier. Regulators must be willing to thoughtfully\nconsider the possibilities of innovation within the regulated banking system.\nAt the same time, innovators must be committed to sharing their understanding and\nknowledge of innovation with regulators. But in doing so, innovators must not adopt the “sales”\nmentality that they may use when pitching investors or partners, and instead, acknowledge the\nunknowns—the risks that new technology presents, the various ways that the technology could\nbe used or evolve over time, and how the technology could either complement or disrupt the\ncurrent financial system. Going a step further, they may be best positioned to propose how\nregulators can best develop a regulatory framework to manage these risks.\nThis deeper level of understanding may assist regulators in their responsibility to consider\nhow innovation could impact different financial sectors, from small banks to wholesale financial\n3 See Michelle W. Bowman, “Innovation and the Evolving Financial Landscape” (speech at The Digital Chamber\nDC Blockchain Summit 2024, Washington, D.C., May 15, 2024),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20240515a.pdf.\n\n- 5 -\nmarkets, and how those impacts may ultimately affect end users. Of course, regulators must also\nconsider not only the intended objectives of innovation, but they must also anticipate and\nunderstand the unintended consequences.\nWithin the broad category of “understanding” innovation, I see three critical steps that\nregulators must take: understand the technology and landscape, recognize the use case for the\ntechnology, and anticipate the consequences. Each of these is a necessary ingredient for\naccepting the technology and developing a regulatory framework that effectively fosters\ninnovation.\nUnderstanding technology and the landscape\nAt its most basic level, many innovations involve a technological component and are\nsituated in a landscape of different parties who may play a role in the use of the technology.\nTake for example, distributed ledger technology (DLT), including blockchain, which is\nthe backbone of some innovations that are being explored in the financial system. DLT\nhighlights the challenges presented to regulators in understanding innovation. There are many\nvariations in the application of DLT—with ongoing research and development creating more\nvariability over time—which ultimately may complicate understanding how the technology can\nbe used and how different functionality can be incorporated into DLT solutions for different use\ncases. DLT provides a way for parties to record transfers of digital assets without the need for\nany centralized authority and relies on multiple participants who coordinate to maintain a\nsynchronized version of the “ledger.” DLT combines a number of different design elements—\nlike distributed data storage, cryptography, and consensus mechanisms—that support the transfer\nprocess, information visibility, and transaction recordkeeping. These design elements can be\ncombined in a number of different ways, and different parties may play a role in its ultimate use.\n\n- 6 -\nUnderstanding technology is an important first step, but regulators also need to be\nconfident in the players who operate in a particular innovative space. Banks of all sizes have a\nlong history of innovation. And the many nonbank providers in this space, including core\nservice providers, often hold the “keys” to innovation when they facilitate the add-on of new\ntechnology to core systems. There are also fintechs that may focus on even more\ntransformational uses of technology, in ways that can affect all aspects of banking. Many of the\nparties involved in financial innovation describe themselves as financial system “disruptors.”\nThis may be an apt word to describe some of their ambitions, but it is certainly one that proves\nthe need for a deliberate and cautious approach to regulation. The broad range of participants\ninvolved in this space presents another layer of complication. It is especially important for\nregulators to be able to distill the reality from the prototype hype to achieve a comprehensive\nunderstanding necessary to inform a policy viewpoint and ultimately an effective regulatory\nframework.\nUnderstanding the use case\nApart from understanding the technology, and who may use it, regulators also need to\nclearly understand the use case—what existing problem does this technology solve? What are\nthe costs and benefits, and are there tradeoffs policymakers would need to consider if the new\ntechnology were introduced or integrated in the existing financial system? DLT has inspired\nnew ways of thinking about the exchange of assets and data, in addition to the role of\nintermediaries and trusted third parties. And of course, as will be discussed during this\nconference, artificial intelligence, or “AI,” is increasingly discussed for its transformative\npotential not only in banking, but also in the broader world economy.\n\n- 7 -\nWhile innovation can take many forms, from the regulatory perspective, it is helpful to\nunderstand how innovation fits—or could fit—into the existing financial system. Does\ninnovation meet customer demands for cheaper or new and innovative products? Does it operate\nin the background to reduce both the incidence and cost of fraud? Does it lower the cost of basic\nbanking services or improve financial inclusion? Does it allow banks to do a better job\nevaluating the creditworthiness of their customers and make safer loans?\nThe “use case” is important because it helps to define the parameters around any\nparticular innovation. Instead of saying the innovation is AI, or tokenization, or DLT, what is it\nexactly? How does it work? What technology underpins it, and what constraints would be\nplaced on its use? Does its implementation rely on external participants or third parties to\naccomplish its use? Who has ultimate control over, and responsibility for, the function of the\nproduct or service?\nUnderstanding the consequences\nWhile understanding both the technology behind a new innovation and its use case is\nimportant, these steps alone are not sufficient. Regulators must also understand, to the extent\npossible, the consequences of specific innovations. Take, for example, the increasing interest in\ntokenization. There is a risk that tokenized products and platforms could duplicate existing bank\ndeposits and payment rails, potentially creating parallel systems. How would these parallel\nsystems interact with, or even replace, current systems? Will the products and platforms that\nduplicate these deposit and payment functions provide the same legal protections for customers\nand the overall financial system that they currently receive? In the long run, the goal of financial\ninnovation is to integrate the new technology into the fabric of the financial system. To do so in\na responsible way, we need to understand the effects the technology will have, including the\n\n- 8 -\nrisks and consequences of introducing it, and the risks and consequences of its wide adoption in\nthe financial system.\nIt is not my intent to downplay the difficulty of understanding new developments that\ncould change key activities, technology, products, or processes within the financial system. We\nare in an era of rapid change, and there are a wide range of innovations that may play an\nimportant role in the future of the financial system. But within the regulatory perimeter of the\nbanking system, we need to be cautious about the risks of new technology, not only to the safety\nand soundness of individual financial institutions, but also to financial stability concerns.\nOpenness to Innovation\nEarlier I mentioned the importance of ensuring the regulator understands the new\ntechnology. But while education is an important first step, it often runs headlong into regulatory\nskepticism. Often, a regulator’s first reaction to proposed innovation in the banking system is\nnot one of openness and acceptance but rather suspicion and concern. The use of emerging\ntechnology and innovation may require a change in policy or supervisory approach. It also very\noften requires regulatory feedback—ideally before the innovation is introduced or after it has\nbeen integrated by a bank and is reviewed during the supervisory process.\nTo be sure, skepticism is an understandable first reaction to new activities, particularly\nthose that someone seeks to conduct within the regulatory perimeter after its integration. For\nregulators, the challenge is one of balance. How do we allow innovation to flourish, with\nsensible supervision and regulation, so that our financial system can reap the gains of innovation\nwhile preserving safety and soundness and consumer compliance?\nRegulators need to ask whether we have considered the intended and unintended\noutcomes of a new innovation, and do the benefits of the new technology outweigh its risks?\n\n- 9 -\nWould the introduction of a new technology or innovation in the banking system require\nupdating our regulatory framework to incorporate clear oversight? Who should have\nresponsibility for oversight, and what roles do we see for different regulators at both the state and\nfederal level?\nTransformational technology requires clear, consistent, and transparent guardrails and\nexpectations to govern the activities that are allowed into the regulated financial system. Where\ncurrent regulation does not contemplate a new activity, should it be acceptable for financial\nagencies to regulate the activity through supervision and enforcement alone? Or should\ncongressional action address the treatment of these activities in the financial system?\nI think it is vital that regulators work with banks through all stages of the innovation life\ncycle to achieve that baseline understanding I mentioned before. But it is incumbent on\nregulators to fight the temptation to say “no” and resist new technology and instead focus on\nsolutions—how can we mitigate the risk of new technology? What benefits will technology\nbring to the financial system? How can we provide clear regulatory expectations?\nI would suggest that adopting a posture receptive to innovation requires a shift in\nregulatory approach. The current temptation is to pre-judge financial innovation and to take a\nharsh view. But this resistance approach carries significant risks. One of the most important\nrisks is that financial innovation stagnates or is pushed out of—and kept out of—the banking\nsystem. Eliminating innovation could result in significant harm to the stability of the financial\nsystem and in terms of limiting the role of banking in the economy. Ultimately, this approach\ncould lead to a banking system that may be safer and smaller but also much less effective in\nproviding banking products and services to support the U.S. economy.\n\n- 10 -\nIn developing this regulatory “openness,” I think it is important to acknowledge the\nshortcomings of our regulatory posture. This requires looking beyond the most immediate\nimpacts on the banking system and considering the broader effects on the financial system.\nHostility to innovation within the banking system often results in activity migrating outside of\nthe banking system. This is not an elimination of the underlying risk of these activities. They\nremain in the financial system but are often subject to less transparency and less regulation than\nthe same activities conducted by banks. There have been a number of examples in which\nregulatory approach has driven activity outside the banking industry, thereby creating different\nand less transparent risks.\nTake for example mortgage servicing rights. In May, the U.S. Financial Stability\nOversight Council released a report on nonbank mortgage servicing, documenting the growth of\nnonbank mortgage servicing since 2008, and the potential vulnerabilities that these servicers\npose, vulnerabilities that could manifest as shocks to the U.S. financial system. As noted in the\nmaterials announcing this report, nonbank mortgage companies had servicing rights on 4 percent\nof U.S. mortgage balances in 2008; by 2022, this percentage had risen to 54 percent.4 The rapid\nshift of such activity out of banks and into nonbank mortgage companies should surprise no one,\nas this was a predictable result of post-2008 regulatory reforms that made it more costly for these\nactivities to be conducted by banks. But equally unsurprising (in my view) is that this shift did\nnot insulate the U.S. financial system from the risks of these activities. The U.S. mortgage\nindustry in the United States is very large—shifting which entities are favored to conduct these\nactivities merely transferred the risk to less-regulated entities. The mortgages did not disappear,\nnor did the underlying activities necessary to support this market.\n4 See U.S. Department of the Treasury, “The Financial Stability Oversight Council Releases Report on Nonbank\nMortgage Servicing,” press release, May 10, 2024, https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2331.\n\n- 11 -\nInnovation as a Priority in the Regulatory and Supervisory Agenda\nFinancial innovation must be a core regulatory priority, in the sense that we must devote\nregulatory and supervisory resources and attention to building a framework that permits\nresponsible innovation to flourish. Our approach must shift from reactive to active and one that\nfacilitates innovation. Regulators must also promote innovation through transparency and open\ncommunication, ideally demonstrating a willingness to engage during the development process\nand within a restricted environment for experimentation.\nShifting to a more tangible example, in some instances there are policy reasons for\nregulatory hesitation. In the past, I have spoken about cross-border payments as one area that\nhas historically presented many frictions that, at least in theory, could be improved with new\ninnovations and technology. This challenge involves achieving the goal to serve new types of\ncustomers and increase the speed of payments without losing or diluting important compliance\nsafeguards that deter criminal activity. Some perceived payment frictions exist for specific\npolicy reasons, not because of issues with existing technology. Therefore, new technology alone\ncannot solve a particular issue unless it also incorporates the required safeguards.\nThe challenge is not just understanding innovative solutions to address cross-border\npayments, but also understanding how the framework itself could or should adjust in the face of\ninnovation. Regulators can serve a valuable role in identifying where a technology solution may\nhave an important “gap,” as in the case of cross-border payments, by identifying how a solution\ncan meet the needs of both customers and regulators. Innovation and regulatory and legal\nrequirements can coexist—providing both enhanced capability and regulatory compliance.\nTransparency itself can promote innovation.\n\n- 12 -\nOur goal should be to develop—and continually invest in—building and supporting a\nclear and sensible regulatory framework. One that allows the private sector to innovate while\nalso maintaining appropriate safeguards. A clear regulatory framework supports private-sector\ninnovators by providing the clarity and consistency that encourage long-term business\ninvestment in pursing innovation, while continuing to support today’s products and services. A\nclear regulatory framework empowers supervisors to focus on safety and soundness, while also\nensuring a safe and efficient payment system.\nThe best way to build a regulatory system that is receptive to new financial technologies\nand innovations is to build on what has been effective in the past. This includes providing clear\nguidance to banks and the broader public, incorporating innovation into the regulatory agenda in\na comprehensive way, and encouraging interaction between industry and regulators. This\nindustry–regulator interaction must allow for feedback and information sharing throughout the\ninnovation life cycle and incorporate regulatory feedback on innovation.\nThere is more that can be done to accomplish this. While we should expand\nopportunities for regulators to provide clear, actionable, and timely feedback on innovation\nproposals, we should also consider developing regulatory “sandboxes,” those designed to allow\nsome degree of testing and experimentation. We should also ensure our regulatory staff\nunderstands and appreciates the value of responsible new technologies, so they may contribute to\ncrafting a sensible regulatory approach to financial innovation. The more that regulators\nunderstand innovation, the more comfortable they will be in accepting and promoting its\nadoption in the financial system.\nAs part of this framework, we also must consider the broader financial system. The\n“regulatory perimeter” between regulated banks and other parts of the financial system is a\n\n- 13 -\npermeable barrier, and not only can activities shift between the two—as we saw with the\nmigration of mortgage servicing in the United States—but risk can shift between the two as well.\nAs our financial system has grown and become more complex over time, it has also become\nmuch more interconnected. Banks often have direct exposure to activities and risks that occur in\nother parts of the financial system. Even when they do not have direct exposures, they may have\nindirect exposures to financial stability risks originating in other parts of the financial system.\nClosing Thoughts\nThe most unfortunate approach to innovation would be to simply prohibit it, or to impose\nsuch onerous standards that effectively discourage innovation or prevent it from developing and\nflourishing. This approach would not only decrease the importance and relevance of the banking\nsystem, but it could also generate new financial stability risks as activity migrates to areas with\nlower regulatory standards and less transparency. Broadly speaking, the regulatory framework\nshould be dynamic, one that can and should accommodate new technology and services. Where\nthe same underlying activity presents the same risk, there is a strong case to be made for\nimposing the same type of regulation. But we must successfully balance the standards that\nprotect households and businesses and prohibit criminal and other illicit financial activity with\nmaintaining the safety and soundness of individual financial institutions and the stability of the\nbroader financial system. We must also prioritize working on a whole-of-government approach\nto ensure we appropriately monitor and manage the risks of financial activity, no matter where\nthose occur. As we continue to enhance our understanding, my hope is that we can strike a more\nreceptive tone to financial innovation, in a way that enables a more innovative, efficient, and\neffective financial system for the future.",

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nDykhouse Scholar Program Speakers Series in Money, Banking, and Regulation\nSouth Dakota State University\nBrookings, South Dakota\nOctober 13, 2021\n\nIt has been a privilege to travel across and explore this beautiful state over the\npast several days and to be here in Brookings with you this evening. And I’m pleased to\nhave the opportunity to share with you, the students of South Dakota State University\n(SDSU), my experience as a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and my\noutlook for the U.S. economy.1\nToday I will speak to you about my outlook for the U.S. economy and what the\nFederal Reserve has been doing to support economic activity during the COVID-19\npandemic recovery.\nI will also touch on a few details about what I’ve learned of the economic\nconditions here in South Dakota. Over the past few days, I’ve had the opportunity to\nmeet with a number of business and community leaders here in your state. Beginning on\nMonday in Rapid City, I made a quick pre-dawn visit to Mount Rushmore on Tuesday\nwhile en route to a Native American Indian reservation. Later in the day, I met with\nstate, business, and tribal leaders in Pierre, and here in Brookings earlier today. Hearing\ndirectly about the successes and challenges from their perspective provides important\ncontext for understanding economic conditions that cannot be obtained from economic\ndata. These conversations help us see through the data from the eyes of the people,\nbusinesses, and communities that make up the American economy. That information is\nvery helpful to me and to us at the Federal Reserve as we make our policy decisions.\nBut before I turn to the outlook and its implications for Federal Reserve decisions,\nlet me share some basics about the Fed’s responsibilities and how we carry out those\nresponsibilities.\n1 The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of other Federal Reserve Board members or\nFederal Open Market Committee participants.\n\n- 2 -\nAs students of economics, you may already know that the Federal Reserve\nconducts monetary policy to support a strong and stable economy in the United States.\nOur official mandate from the Congress is to pursue two goals, maximum employment\nand stable prices. Together, we commonly refer to these objectives as our dual mandate,\nand pursuing both at the same time means that we seek the maximum level of\nemployment that is consistent with price stability. Regarding the price-stability goal, our\nframework references an annual inflation rate of 2 percent as most consistent with our\nprice-stability goal over the longer run.\nThe Fed pursues its monetary policy goals using a variety of tools, but the main\npolicy tool is the federal funds rate, a key interest rate for overnight borrowing by\ncommercial banks that influences other interest rates throughout the economy. Lower\ninterest rates tend to stimulate demand—for housing, cars and other durable goods, and\nbusiness investment, for example—which boosts economic activity and has the potential\nto push up inflation. Higher interest rates tend to slow the economy and tend to push\ninflation down.\nIn normal times, monetary policy decisions are made eight times each year\nthrough votes of members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).2 In\npreparation for each meeting, the FOMC participants analyze the latest economic data\nand assess where the economy stands relative to our two mandated goals. And, because\nmonetary policy decisions take some time to flow through to, or have their full effect on,\nthe economy, FOMC participants must form a view about how they think the economy\n2 Except in very unusual circumstances, monetary policy decisions are made during our regular FOMC\nmeetings eight times each year. The 12 Reserve Bank presidents and the members of the Federal Reserve\nBoard of Governors participate in these meetings, with 5 of the 12 presidents and all of the Governors\nvoting as members of the FOMC.\n\n- 3 -\nwill evolve in the coming months and years. In addition to understanding where the\neconomy is at any given point in time, making a judgment about where it is headed is\nalso crucial to monetary policy.\nAs I have learned in my nearly three years and almost 20 meetings as an FOMC\nmember, economic forecasting is challenging, to say the least. Despite all of the data and\neconomic models at our disposal, the economy is exceedingly complex, the product of\ncountless decisions made every day by human beings, who have varied goals and\nmotives. Economic data, sometimes received with a considerable time lag, can give us\nonly a rough, backward-looking picture of the economy, and judging where the economy\nis headed in the future is even more difficult. Even the most accurate forecasts about the\neconomy are often wrong, simply because of the uncertainty that is inherent in the task of\ninterpreting and predicting future economic conditions. Yet our responsibility is to do\njust that—make predictions about how economic activity will evolve, and act on those\nforecasts in real time, to ensure that monetary policy can help support a strong economy.\nAs part of this process, FOMC members also consider the different ways that our\noutlook may be wrong. We consider a number of alternative scenarios for the future and\ntry to manage the relative risks of a policy decision if the future does not turn out as\nexpected. I would compare that task with the judgments other professions might be\nrequired to make throughout the year. Since we are in South Dakota and farming is a\nfamiliar industry, let’s use that as a comparison. Every farmer has an outlook for the\ncosts of seed, fertilizer and other inputs, and the prices the crop might yield at the end of\nthe growing season. Inherent in this outlook is considerable uncertainty, and a farmer has\nto be able to manage the risks and possible costs of being wrong in one way or another\n\n-4 -\nabout prices. Decisions made before the growing or breeding season can have significant\neffects on profits after the crop is harvested or the livestock are sold. As with each\nmember of the FOMC, this often involves careful decisions in the near term that can play\nout for months and years ahead.\nThese are some of the challenges faced by members of the FOMC. Now let me\ntell you a bit about how I approach our monetary policy decisions.\nIn preparation for each FOMC meeting, I regularly conduct extensive outreach to\ngather timely information from a broad range of industries and geographies. To me, it is\nimportant that economic discussion captures what is really going on in people’s\nlives. With this in mind, I recently restarted the Fed Listens process at the Board, in\nwhich we focus not on monetary policy and hear from a range of different people about\nhow the economy is affecting them. As the member of the Board of Governors with\nexperience in community banking, I often speak to local bankers, who are excellent\nsources to understand the important effects of monetary policy decisions on Main Street.\nWith this perspective, and relying on my rural Kansas background, I also pay special\nattention to developments in rural communities and in the agriculture sector, monitoring\nthe effect of Fed policy in those areas.\nFor example, during my visit to South Dakota over the past few days, I have had\nthe opportunity to tour parts of the Pine Ridge Reservation and discuss community\ndevelopment efforts and economic conditions with a number of tribal and community\nleaders. It is concerning to see that South Dakota’s tribal communities, particularly those\non rural reservations, are experiencing a slower employment recovery than in other parts\nof the country. I also heard firsthand about the challenges that some Native Americans,\n\n- 5 -\nespecially those living on reservations, face in accessing reliable financial services and\nfinding affordable credit and housing.\nUnderstanding the barriers to financial inclusion is particularly important to\nensuring that our financial system works for everyone. For this reason, I am pleased that\nthe Federal Reserve recently joined the Central Bank Network for Indigenous Inclusion,\nan international network of central banks committed to engaging with Indigenous peoples\nand understanding and addressing their unique economic and financial challenges. I will\nserve as the Board’s representative to this group and look forward to continuing our\noutreach and work in this area.\nAs much as any other preparation for FOMC meetings, all of these conversations\nare vital inputs for my consideration of the data influencing my monetary policy\ndecisions every six to eight weeks. To cite one example, in the early weeks of the\npandemic, our outreach and communication with community bankers led the Fed to\ncreate a special lending program to help banks that were participating in the Paycheck\nProtection Program (PPP), which loaned and granted funding to small businesses. The\nFed’s PPP liquidity facility was crucial in ensuring that lenders had the liquidity they\nneeded to get PPP funds out to businesses as quickly as possible, which resulted in the\npreservation of millions of jobs.\nNow that I’ve given you an idea of what this process looks like for me as a\nmember of the FOMC, let me describe my view of current economic conditions, my\noutlook for the economy, and how I believe monetary policy can continue to support the\nrecovery. Along the way, I will also highlight a few factors that I believe could pose a\nrisk to continued progress toward our maximum-employment and inflation goals.\n\n- 6 -\nFirst, looking at the job market, stringent economic and social distancing\nrestrictions imposed in an effort to contain the spread of the virus resulted in enormous\njob losses in the early months of the pandemic, with the unemployment rate surging from\n3.5 percent in February 2020 (a 50-year low) to 14.8 percent in April 2020. Since the\nmiddle of last year, however, as the economy started to reopen, we have seen steady\nprogress toward maximum employment.\nThat progress continued in September, with the unemployment rate moving down\nto 4.8 percent. Although the September increase in payrolls was smaller than many had\nexpected, over the past three months we’ve seen an average of 550,000 jobs created, just\ndown from the remarkable average pace of 567,000 per month in the first half of the year.\nAt least part of the recent slowing in payroll growth seems to reflect a limited supply of\nlabor. That’s certainly what I’ve heard in South Dakota. Employers are having a very\ntough time filling jobs. I was told one ethanol plant needed to fill 15 jobs and got four\napplicants. In contrast, indicators of labor demand, such as unfilled job openings, remain\nexceptionally strong. On balance, I anticipate that employment will continue to move up\nin the months ahead, although for several reasons that are unrelated to the stance of\nmonetary policy, I don’t expect that we will see employment fully return to pre-pandemic\nlevels any time soon.\nFirst, despite all of the economic progress, it is clear that switching off economic\nactivity for such a long period has had lasting consequences, and expectations of a\nsmooth resumption of production, transportation, and business operations may not be met\nfor some time. Many workers that were initially laid off temporarily have left the\nworkforce altogether, which is especially true for women, with nearly 2 million women\n\n- 7 -\nleaving the workforce since the pandemic began. In addition, many older workers\ndislocated by the pandemic effectively retired and probably will not rejoin the workforce\neven in a much stronger job market.\nWhile I would not want to place too much weight on one or two months of data,\nthe most recent reports on employment and anecdotal reports from a wide range of\nbusinesses suggest that, even when offering higher wages and signing bonuses, many\nemployers are finding it difficult to fill open positions. History tells us that the longer\nworkers remain out of the workforce, the less likely it is that they will return to\nemployment and the greater the likelihood that they will lose skills and connections with\nthe job market, which could weigh on labor force participation for years to come. The\nFederal Reserve’s policy tools are useful for promoting a strong job market, but they are\nnot well suited to addressing these harmful effects on labor supply.\nAnother reason for my cautious outlook for employment growth is that, while\nlarge firms have adequate resources, funding options, and flexibility to withstand\npandemic-related disruptions, many small businesses without those advantages have\nclosed permanently. I continue to hear concern about the future from small business\nowners, which is also reflected in the latest readings from broader surveys of small\nbusiness sentiment. While many factors lead to this perspective, I have heard specific\nreference to continued rising costs, supply chain issues, labor shortages, and uncertainty\nabout other factors, like tax increases and vaccine mandates.\nLet me turn now to our other monetary policy goal, price stability. Earlier this\nyear, as the economy was reopening, we saw a pronounced pickup in inflation, as prices\nfor motor vehicles, electronics, and other goods rose especially rapidly. Most of these\n\n- 8 -\nincreases could be traced to bottlenecks in global supply chains. The bottlenecks were\noften the direct result of shortages of labor and key materials used in production and\ndistribution. Demand for semiconductors has surged because of a sharp increase of\nspending on high-tech equipment and consumer electronics, investment in new wireless\nnetworks, and increasing usage of semiconductors in motor vehicles, appliances, and\nother goods. But throughout the pandemic, the supply of semiconductors has been\nsignificantly restrained by pandemic-related production disruptions, most recently in\nMalaysia and Vietnam. We are seeing shipments at record levels, and more capacity is\nexpected to come on line, but the combination of strong demand and intermittent\ndisruptions to this complex supply chain poses a risk that it could be some time before\nsemiconductor supply issues are resolved.\nThe motor vehicle industry is a prominent example of a downstream sector that\nhas been adversely affected by the semiconductor supply crunch. Every new car and\ntruck produced today has many semiconductors included in its electrical components. As\na consequence, the shortage of automotive chips has considerably reduced the number of\nnew cars completed in the manufacturing process, driving up prices for those that have\nbeen produced. The lack of new cars for sale on dealer lots has also boosted demand and\nprices this year for used cars and spilled over to the rental car market, leading to soaring\ncar rental prices. Fortunately, these prices eased a bit in September, but they are still\nelevated, and this causes spillovers in the broader economy as well. When an auto\nassembly plant shuts down for several weeks and its workers are furloughed, a whole\ncommunity and its businesses feel the ripple effects of that closure. For instance, when\n\n- 9 -\nan auto assembly plant in Ohio was closed for several weeks last summer, we heard\nanecdotal reports of an outsized drop in bookings at a nearby hotel chain.\nThe semiconductor shortage highlights the global nature of many supply chains,\nwhere a disruption in one link can have wide and unexpected effects across the globe and\nin many industries. As another example, beyond the motor vehicle industry, supply chain\ndisruptions have also limited the availability of major appliances, which impairs the\ncompletion and delivery timeline for homebuilders and puts further pressure on the\nlimited housing inventory. Supply chain problems can have surprising spillovers. In the\npast couple of days, I’ve heard that the pheasant-hunting season in South Dakota may be\ndisrupted by a shortage of shotgun shells. Nationally, these effects have led some firms\nto consider shifting their manufacturing from overseas or sourcing inputs from suppliers\ncloser to home in an effort to reduce supply chain risks. In the longer run, these efforts\nmay lead to more resilient supply chains, but the short-term transition could introduce\ndifferent vulnerabilities. I will be watching these developments closely.\nAs the various supply bottlenecks we are currently seeing are gradually resolved,\nwe should see monthly inflation readings step down further from the high rates we have\nobserved this year. Nevertheless, I still see a material risk that supply-related pricing\npressures could last longer than expected.\nAnother source of inflation risk comes from the lower labor force participation,\nwhich, as I mentioned earlier, has led some firms to offer inducements to bring potential\nworkers back, including hiring bonuses and higher wages. Even with these incentives,\nhowever, many firms are struggling with staffing, and some are also offering training\nprograms for new hires to develop required job skills. Wage increases and these\n\n- 10 -\nadditional employee investments are increasing firms’ costs, potentially adding to\ninflationary pressures.\nIn the agricultural sector, prices for most major commodities remain above pre-\npandemic levels, and farm income is expected to be higher than a year ago for the second\nconsecutive year. But since farmers lock in prices for inputs before planting, the effects\nof substantial price increases for inputs like fuel and fertilizer have not yet been fully\nrealized. In their planning for next season’s planting, farmers are much more concerned\nabout input cost inflation. Some estimates show that farmers could pay 30 to 70 percent\nmore for fertilizer for the 2022 season. In addition, if they can even find equipment or\nland to buy, prices for these assets have continued to increase.\nAnother source of inflationary pressure is the rapid increase in house prices,\nsomething that also raises potential concerns about valuation pressures. The ongoing\nstrength in housing demand is also notably driving up rental costs. Higher house prices\nalso make it much more difficult for low- to moderate-income households to become\nhomeowners, as larger down payments and other financing requirements, in effect, lock\nthese households out of the housing market.\nAmid the booming real estate market, some bankers I spoke with recently cited\nconcerns about a possible house price bubble and growing concerns about potential risks\nto financial stability. These concerns are a notable change from our conversations a year\nago, when most bankers were appreciating the frenzied activity in this market as a means\nto boost income in a very low-rate environment. Given the experience of the previous\nfinancial crisis, this development is something we should closely monitor. Now, unlike\nthe conditions leading up to that crisis, homeowners have fewer financial obligations and\n\n- 11 -\ndebts, and many of the financial system vulnerabilities that existed have been addressed.\nBut homes are a widely held asset, and even a modest shift in the housing market,\nespecially a decline in home prices, could have significant ripple effects throughout the\neconomy.\nIf elevated inflation readings continue into and through the next year, we may\nbegin to see an imprint on longer-run inflation expectations. While short-term inflation\nexpectations have moved up with the recent period of increased inflation, longer-term\nmeasures have remained relatively stable. As we know, after reaching uncomfortably\nhigh levels in the 1970s and early 1980s, in more recent decades, inflation has run close\nto our 2 percent goal, helping anchor the public’s inflation expectations at levels that\nseem consistent with our goal. This is relevant because the Fed has long considered the\nanchoring of inflation expectations an important condition for meeting our monetary\npolicy goals.\nFinally, let’s turn to the implications for monetary policy more broadly and the\nFOMC’s most recent decision at our meeting in September. When actions taken to\nmitigate the spread of COVID-19 began to disrupt the U.S. economy and financial\nmarkets in the first half of last year, the FOMC cut short-term interest rates to near zero\nand began purchasing Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities. These\nactions helped stabilize financial markets and sustain the flow of credit to U.S.\nhouseholds and businesses. By the middle of last year, we were seeing signs of resilience\nin economic activity, with labor market conditions beginning to recover from the\neconomic effects of the pandemic.\n\n- 12 -\nIn December, we indicated that we would start scaling back our asset purchases\nafter the U.S. economy had made “substantial further progress” toward our maximum-\nemployment and price-stability goals.3 We have been closely monitoring that progress\nsince then, and, at our most recent policy meeting, we noted that, if the economy\ncontinues to improve as expected, this scaling back, or tapering of our asset purchases,\nmay soon be warranted. I fully supported that assessment. Provided the economy\ncontinues to improve as I expect, I am very comfortable at this point with a decision to\nstart to taper our asset purchases before the end of the year and, preferably, as early as at\nour next meeting in November.\nIn my view, our asset purchases were an important part of our response to the\neconomic effects of the pandemic, but they have essentially served their purpose. I am\nmindful that the remaining benefits to the economy from our asset purchases are now\nlikely outweighed by the potential costs. In particular, I am concerned that our asset\npurchases could now be contributing to valuation pressures, especially in housing and\nequity markets, or that maintaining a highly accommodative monetary policy stance at\nthis stage of the economic expansion may pose risks to the stability of longer-term\ninflation expectations. If the expansion continues as I expect, I will support a pace of\ntapering that would end our asset purchases by the middle of next year.\nIn closing, I would say that our economy has made great strides this year, which\nis a testament to the resilience of U.S. households and businesses and the many\nchallenges faced throughout the pandemic experience. While many risks to the outlook\n3 See the December 2020 FOMC statement (paragraph 4), which is available, along with other FOMC\nstatements, on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.\n\n- 13 -\nremain, I expect that the recovery will continue in the coming months, and that steady\nprogress will be made toward our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n8:30 a.m. EDT\nAugust 7, 20213\nWelcoming Remarks\nby\nMichelle W. Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Fed Listens: Community Listening Session”\nhosted by\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nAtlanta, Georgia\nAugust 7, 2023\n\nThank you, President Bostic.1 When the Board began the Fed Listens initiative, our\npurpose was to engage directly with the public to discuss issues related to our monetary policy\ndecision-making framework and our efforts to pursue the congressionally-mandated monetary\npolicy goals of price stability and maximum employment. Since that time, and as a recognition\nof the importance of engaging with people across the country from a wide range of geographies\nand perspectives, we broadened the scope to become an ongoing process of consultation with the\npublic. Through Fed Listens and other Board and System convenings, we can learn directly\nfrom those experiencing the economy about how households and businesses are faring, and how\nthey are affected by Federal Reserve decisions.\nIn the latest of those decisions, on July 26 the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)\nraised the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points and decided to continue\nreducing the Fed’s securities holdings, both actions aimed at bringing down inflation. I look\nforward to hearing from today’s participants about how inflation and higher interest rates are\naffecting their day-to-day decision making. But first, I will briefly share my thinking on, and\nwhy I supported, the FOMC’s latest decision.\nAs many of you know, since March of last year the FOMC has significantly increased the\nfederal funds rate, which is our primary monetary policy tool. The goal is to raise interest rates\nthroughout the economy to bring demand into better balance with supply and reduce upward\npricing pressures.\nWe have made progress in lowering inflation over the past year, but inflation is still\nsignificantly above the FOMC’s two percent target, and the labor market continues to be tight,\n1 The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee or the Board of Governors.\n\n-2-\nwith job openings still far exceeding the number of available workers. Economic activity has\ngrown at a moderate pace, and even as banks have been tightening their lending standards in\nresponse to higher interest rates and funding costs, lending to businesses and households has\ncontinued to expand.\nGiven these developments, I supported raising the federal funds rate at our July meeting,\nand I expect that additional increases will likely be needed to lower inflation to the FOMC’s\ngoal. Of course, monetary policy is not on a pre-set path, and I will be closely monitoring the\nincoming data and their implications for the economic outlook. I will be looking for evidence\nthat inflation is on a consistent and meaningful downward path as I consider whether further\nincreases in the federal funds rate will be needed, and how long the federal funds rate will need\nto remain at a sufficiently restrictive level.\nI know that high inflation has been a hardship, especially for lower- and middle-income\nfamilies, who spend the majority of their income on necessities. Returning inflation to\ntwo percent will help American families focus on important decisions other than inflation.\nAddressing high inflation will ensure that it is no longer a factor for spending and investment\ndecisions and will help put the U.S. economy on a course of ongoing economic growth and rising\nstandards of living. But I also know that higher interest rates have made it more difficult for\nmany to get a loan, to buy a home or a car, and for businesses to invest and expand. I am\ninterested to hear the ways in which inflation and higher interest rates are affecting the day-to-\nday lives of our participants today.\nI am also looking forward to learning about how the economy and the Fed’s policies are\naffecting lower-income workers and small businesses, the two subjects of today’s Fed Listens\nevent. Over the past few years, for many, wage and salary increases have not kept up with\n\n-3-\ninflation, and while that general pattern has improved recently, most workers still have not seen\nwage increases equal to price increases. For workers at the lower end of the wage spectrum,\nwage gains have been the strongest seen in decades. However, because necessities like groceries\nand gasoline make up a large share of their household expenses, lower-wage workers have been\nexperiencing the effects of higher prices more acutely than others. We also know from history\nthat a slower economy, with higher unemployment, tends to hit lower-income workers the\nhardest, so we must remain attuned to the fact that our efforts to reduce inflation have the\npotential to undermine wage gains and job security for lower-wage workers. Should inflation\nremain at today’s level, or increase again, lower-wage workers would continue to bear the brunt\nof these effects.\nSmall businesses are also more vulnerable in an economic slowdown than larger\nbusinesses, and I am watching carefully to see how they are dealing with both inflation and\nhigher interest rates. Despite high inflation and significant challenges finding workers in a tight\nlabor market, the past few years have been relatively good for small businesses and for new\nbusiness formation. One noteworthy development is the remarkable surge in entrepreneurship,\nas evidenced by a significant number of new business start-ups. Rates of new business creation\njumped beginning in mid-2020 after lagging for more than a decade. And recent indicators, like\napplications for new tax identification numbers, suggest the pace remained elevated through the\nmiddle of this year.\nNew businesses have also been responsible for a surprising amount of job growth, with\nan average of one million jobs created each quarter from early 2021 through the end of last year,\nwhich is a significantly higher pace than was typical prior to the pandemic.2 This extended\n2 In particular, Bureau of Labor Statistics data on jobs created by new establishments averaged 980,000 per quarter\nfrom 2020:Q3 to 2022:Q4 (the latest observation), compared with 810,000 per quarter from 2009 to 2019.\n\n-4-\nperiod of elevated start-up activity has been good for workers, and in a larger sense, good for\nentrepreneurship. While it may seem hard to believe, many of today’s largest businesses began\nas small businesses. It is entirely possible that the next wealth-creating, world-beating business\ngot its start during the depths of the pandemic.\nI think I will leave it there, and say thank you again, for the opportunity to be part of this\nimportant conversation today.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n6:45 p.m. EST\nMarch 5, 2024\nTailoring, Fidelity to the Rule of Law, and Unintended Consequences\nRemarks by\nMichelle W. Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nHarvard Law School Faculty Club\nCambridge, Massachusetts\nMarch 5, 2024\n\nThank you for the invitation to join you this evening at Harvard Law School.1 It is an\nhonor and a pleasure to speak to this distinguished group. To kick off our conversation, I would\nlike to frame the discussion by offering my views on a key element underpinning the U.S. bank\nregulatory framework: the role of tailoring. While the principle itself is simple—setting\nregulatory priorities and allocating supervisory resources in a risk-based way—the consequences\nof tailoring (or not) can reverberate throughout the banking system, the broader U.S. financial\nsystem, and the economy. I see a clear nexus between tailoring and fidelity to the law, including\na targeted focus within our statutorily mandated prudential responsibilities.\nTailoring as a Grounding Principle\nI have long been a proponent of tailoring and continue to consider it a strong foundational\nprinciple upon which to apply bank regulation and supervision. This approach ensures a focus\non the most critical risks over time, avoiding the over-allocation of resources or imposition of\nunnecessary costs on the banking system. When we approach rulemaking with a commitment to\ntailoring, and to our broader prudential mandates, the public can judge our actions by how well\nthey serve these ends, and they should rightly be concerned when regulatory actions seem to\nserve other goals. In this sense, tailoring keeps policymakers grounded and facilitates\nappropriate prioritization. Tailoring also allows us to allocate limited supervisory resources to\nmost effectively support safety and soundness of the banking system and U.S. financial stability.\nIn accordance with the law, the Federal Reserve, both in its monetary policy function and\nin the execution of its bank regulatory and supervisory responsibilities, is meant to operate\nindependently and apolitically. But banking regulators have a responsibility to act in a way that\n1 The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee or the Board of Governors.\n\n- 2 -\nproves this independence is warranted. We earn the right to operate with this independence\nwhen we consistently follow the law and achieve our prudential objectives. One of the most\neffective ways we accomplish this goal is through the appropriate prioritization of risks in the\nfinancial system. Regardless of the approach to bank regulation and supervision, bank regulators\nshould be subject to oversight and accountability, to both Congress and the public.\nThe principles that guide the execution of prudential responsibilities matter, especially\nwhen they further efficiency and effectiveness. Congress has embedded the concept of tailoring\nwithin the Federal Reserve’s regulatory mandates, including the Economic Growth, Regulatory\nRelief, and Consumer Protection Act, commonly referred to as S. 2155.2 This law revised\nprovisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, amending the threshold for tailored application of enhanced\nprudential standards on certain regulated institutions.3 Notably, S. 2155 did not introduce\ntailoring to these standards; it merely modified tailoring thresholds and mandated the Board\nimplement this approach. To be clear, tailoring is not a pretext for deregulation but rather a\nprinciple that allows regulators to pursue required statutory objectives in the most efficient and\neffective way.\nDoes Tailoring Need a Defender?\nI suppose one could view my support for tailoring as merely setting up a straw man;\nsurely everyone agrees with tailoring in principle? On a superficial level, it is hard to argue with\nthe principle that regulatory tailoring—matching regulation and supervision to risk—is a prudent\napproach for bank regulators. And yet the rhetoric supporting tailoring and risk-based\nsupervision often does not match regulatory reform efforts or supervisory approaches. The\n2 Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, Pub. L. No. 115-174, 132 Stat. 1296 (2018).\n3 Pub. L. No. 115-174, § 401(a)(1), amending 12 U.S.C. § 5365.\n\n- 3 -\ncriticisms rarely manifest as skepticism of the principle itself. Rather, they are implicit in the\napproach to regulation and supervisory guidance or are disguised as a criticism of the execution\nof tailoring.\nBoth the pending capital reform proposals and the final climate guidance illustrate how\nregulatory actions can deviate from the principle of tailoring without any express recognition of\nthis effect.\nThe federal banking agencies have proposed several reforms to the capital framework,\namong them the Basel III “endgame” and new long-term debt requirements that would apply to\nall banks with over $100 billion in assets. I have expressed concern with both of these proposals\non the merits, in terms of striking the right balance between safety and soundness and efficiency\nand fairness, and out of concern for potential unintended consequences. Another concern is\nwhether these proposals show fidelity to the law, which requires regulatory tailoring above the\n$100 billion asset threshold. In 2019, the Board published its regulatory tailoring rule and\nincluded a compelling visual that depicts in table form how a series of requirements—capital,\nsingle counterparty credit limits, liquidity, and the requirement to form a U.S. Intermediate\nHolding Company for foreign banking organizations—worked collectively to establish a tiered\nframework.4\n4 See Tailoring Rule Visual, “Requirements for Domestic and Foreign Banking Organizations,” October 10, 2019,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/boardmeetings/files/tailoring-rule-visual-20191010.pdf.\n\n- 4 -\n\n- 5 -\nIf you superimpose the pending capital reform proposals on the table, there is a\n“flattening” of requirements in the capital bucket. Of course, this simple exercise does not\nreflect the unknown end state of the bank regulatory framework, and the current desire among\nsome policymakers to modify liquidity requirements. These individual efforts highlight the\nhazard of piecemeal reforms, especially those that are closely related in their end-state operation,\nlike capital and long-term debt requirements. When regulators pursue reforms by creating\nseparate rulemaking silos, we limit our capacity to not only ensure fidelity to tailoring but also\nfidelity to our prudential mandates. Even when proposals have concurrent comment periods, the\ndanger is that the final regulations will be miscalibrated and not appropriately tailored.\nTailoring underpins not only effective regulation, but also effective bank supervision.\nThe effectiveness of the interagency principles used by the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency for the management of\nclimate-related financial risks could be evaluated as a supervisory tool through the lens of\ntailoring, which requires us to consider both the regulatory threshold for applicability and the\ncontent of the guidance.5 One approach to evaluate the merit and effectiveness of these\nprinciples as a supervisory tool is through the lens of tailoring, which requires us to consider\nboth the regulatory threshold for applicability and the content of the guidance.\nOn its face, it applies to banks with $100 billion or more in consolidated assets. What\ndoes this threshold mean in practice? Guidance serves the role of illuminating supervisory\npriorities and expectations. These informal communications help bridge the divide between\nregulators and regulated entities. When guidance notes that “all financial institutions, regardless\n5 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency, “Agencies Issue Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large\nFinancial Institutions,” news release, October 24, 2023,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20231024b.htm.\n\n- 6 -\nof size, may have material exposures to climate-related financial risks…,”6 my intuition is that\nbanks will take little comfort from the nominal carveout in light of this language. Apart from the\ngeneral concern with the “cliff effect” threshold at $100 billion, I question whether any size\nthreshold will apply in practice.7\nThe content of the guidance—and its expectations for larger banks—suggests that the\nmotivation behind the principles is neither prudential considerations nor to further regulatory\ntailoring, as it has a somewhat tenuous connection to core safety and soundness considerations\nand seems destined to trickle down to smaller firms over time. Banks have long been exposed to\nclimate- and weather-related financial risks and have long been required to manage all of their\nmaterial risks, including these. But the principles seem oriented toward contributing to a policy\nmatter that extends well beyond prudential bank regulation—namely how the U.S. and other\ngovernments around the world should address climate change. And the principles seem focused\non highly uncertain risks well outside the normal temporal horizon of a bank supervisor. One\ncould reasonably ask, do the principles result in appropriate, risk-based prioritization of\nsupervisory concerns? It is possible that they prioritize risks that may not be the most relevant\nfor safety and soundness and may effectively influence credit allocation decisions through\nregulations that are not driven primarily by prudential considerations.\nBank regulators can acknowledge the importance of questions around climate change\nwhile also hewing to their statutory responsibilities. Promoting safety and soundness and U.S.\nfinancial stability is a weighty enough task without taking on other causes.\n6 88 Fed. Reg. 74,183–184 (October 30, 2023).\n7 See Michelle W. Bowman, “Reflections on the Economy and Bank Regulation” (speech at the Florida Bankers\nAssociation Leadership Luncheon Events, Miami, Florida, February 27, 2024),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20240227a.pdf.\n\n- 7 -\nThe current regulatory agenda includes many other examples where similar arguments\ncan be made that regulatory reform proposals lack sufficient attention to regulatory tailoring and\nthereby fail to further statutory directives to tailor certain requirements and, more importantly, to\naddress the condition of the banking system.\nApart from substantive deviations from regulatory tailoring, there are also indirect attacks\non the value of tailoring as a principle to guide bank regulatory reforms. For example, one\nprominent argument raised shortly after the failure of Silicon Valley Bank, and which has\nbecome a driving force in regulatory reform efforts, is that the Board’s approach to tailoring was\nto blame for the bank failures and broader banking stress.8 The argument is that a major factor\ncontributing to the bank failures was the implementation of S. 2155, the statutory mandate to\ntailor regulation and an accompanying shift in supervisory policy.\nAs I have noted many times in the past, I find little evidence to support this claim. While\ncouched as a critique of the execution of tailoring, this argument also seems to challenge the\nvalue of tailoring, asserting that a simple solution would be to unwind regulatory tailoring and\neliminate risk-based tailoring in supervision. Taking ownership and accountability of the\nsupervisory issues that significantly contributed to the banking system stress last spring enables\nus to look critically at the approach to regulation and supervision in the lead-up to these failures,\nand appropriately address the shortcomings.\n8 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Review of the Federal Reserve’s Supervision and\nRegulation of Silicon Valley Bank,” (Washington: Board of Governors, April 2023), introductory letter by Michael\nS. Barr, https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/svb-review-20230428.pdf (concluding that “[t]he Board’s\ntailoring approach in response to the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act\n(EGRRCPA) and a shift in the stance of supervisory policy impeded effective supervision by reducing standards,\nincreasing complexity, and promoting a less assertive supervisory approach.”).\n\n- 8 -\nWhy Does Tailoring Matter?\nBefore thinking about tailoring for smaller, simpler firms, I think it’s helpful to think\nabout the largest, most complex firms. Additional regulation and heightened supervisory\nattention are warranted and necessary for larger firms, particularly global systemically important\nbanks (GSIBs) with additional size, risk, and complexity. This principle is so well-established\nthat it was not only a core precept of S. 2155, it was a central theme of the Dodd-Frank Act.9 We\nneed not rely on past views about the virtue of tailoring—what was once conventional wisdom—\nto believe in its ongoing relevance.\nOne critique of tailoring may be with what underlying “problem” it is designed to solve,\nparticularly as it relates to the allocation of finite resources both for banks and for regulators.\nAre regulatory and supervisory resources actually limited, and if so, what are the practical\nconstraints on these resources? At a basic level, the quantum of regulatory and supervisory\nresources is a policy decision—as regulatory and supervisory demands grow, so too can the\nstaffs and budgets of the federal banking agencies. The U.S. financial system is expansive and\nregulators have the capacity to expand supervisory resources as needed (or as perceived) to\naddress safety and soundness concerns.\nOf course, there are practical constraints on an ever-expanding and stricter bank\nregulatory framework. First, the funding of regulatory and supervisory expansion imposes costs\nnot only on U.S. taxpayers but also on banks, and indirectly, bank customers. While the banking\nsystem has many advantages—including the use of insured deposits as a source of financing\nbanking activities—at some point, this structural advantage will erode under the cumulative\nburden of the regulatory framework and will result in a shift of activities from banks to nonbanks\n9 Pub. L. No. 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376, 1423, § 165 (July 21, 2010).\n\n- 9 -\nand the broader shadow-banking system. The contours of the financial system, where products\nand services are offered, does not exist according to the bright line of federal regulatory\nauthority. We would be well served to recognize the limitations of a regulatory perimeter that\npushes activity outside of the banking system and beyond this authority.\nUnintended Consequences\nAs we consider the merits of tailoring, we should consider the consequences of not\nadhering to this principle in regulation and supervision, and related reform proposals.\nAs a threshold matter, a bank regulatory approach that disregards tailoring can manifest\nin different ways, such as uniformity in approach—failing to differentiate among institutions\nbased on their size, risk, and complexity—or by adopting regulatory “cliffs” clustered around\nthresholds that insufficiently distinguish among institutions based on these factors. In both\ncases, deviating from tailoring could result in fundamental changes to the structure of the U.S.\nbanking system.\nOne risk of uniform requirements is the consolidation pressure it creates. Apart from the\nshortcomings I’ve discussed in appropriate risk-based prioritization within the bank regulatory\nframework, this approach encourages consolidation, as institutions seek operational economies\nof scale to gain competitive advantage over their peers. In this scenario, the benefits of being\nlarge, risky, and complex become a driving force in the organization of the banking industry. I\nthink we should consider the implications not only for regulatory efficiency, but also whether\nthis approach represents waving the white flag in fighting against the assertion that certain\ninstitutions are “too big to fail.”\nEven where standards are not uniform, a lack of sufficient tailoring can reshape the\nbanking industry, simply through the cliff effects created around particular regulatory thresholds.\n\n- 10 -\nFor example, capital reform and climate regulation would establish $100 billion as the key\nregulatory threshold, lending additional gravity to the decision to cross, or even approach it, with\nthe consequence of reducing the number of institutions around that threshold. Institutions above\nthe threshold will face strong incentives to grow larger to achieve economies of scale.\nInstitutions below the threshold will face strong incentives to manage their size to avoid the\nsignificant intensification of requirements that apply as they approach $100 billion in assets.\nThis scenario also has significant implications for the too-big-to-fail issue, as well as for industry\ncompetition over the long term.\nRegulatory costs that are disproportionate to a firm’s risk create incentives for activities\nto migrate out of the banking system entirely, which we have seen as a consequence of past\nregulatory reform efforts. In my view, implicit in the statutory mandate to promote safety and\nsoundness, and financial stability, is that we allow banks to continue serving their role in the U.S.\nfinancial system and in support of the economy. Fidelity to the law does not require regulators to\ncreate a bank regulatory framework that eliminates risk: banking is inherently about managing,\nnot eliminating, risk.\nClosing\nThank you, again, for the invitation to speak with you, and I look forward to our\ndiscussion.",

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Age of Advancement: The Intricacies of a Digital World”\n2020 Banking Outlook Conference sponsored by\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nAtlanta, Georgia\nFebruary 27, 2020\n\nIt is a pleasure to be here today. I appreciate the invitation to speak to you as part\nof this year’s Banking Outlook Conference at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.1 I\nthink this year’s theme, Age of Advancement: The Intricacies of a Digital World, captures\nthe dynamic and evolving landscape of our country’s financial system well. Advances in\ntechnology are occurring at a rapid pace and present the opportunity to make our\nfinancial system safer and more efficient for more Americans.\nFrom faster payments to artificial intelligence, technological advancements touch\nnearly every aspect of our financial system and affect institutions of every type. As the\nfirst Federal Reserve governor to serve in the role designated by Congress for someone\nwith community banking experience, I am especially interested in the impact these kinds\nof advancements may have on community banks. I am also committed to ensuring that as\npolicymakers and supervisors navigate the intricacies of today’s digital world, we do so\nin a way that considers the important role of community banks in cities and towns and\nrural communities across the country, and our nation’s financial system more broadly.\nTo that end, I believe the Federal Reserve is well positioned to support innovation and the\nfuture of banking in a way that ensures our nation’s evolving financial system works for\ncommunity banks and the customers they serve. So I would like to spend my time with\nyou today focusing on how the Federal Reserve can achieve this objective in one specific\narea, that of our nation’s payment system.\n1 These remarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Board of\nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nImportance of Community Banks and the Payment System\nAs many of you may know, before joining the Federal Reserve, I was a\ncommunity banker and more recently had the privilege to serve as the Kansas State Bank\nCommissioner. I have seen firsthand the vital role that our nation’s community banks\nplay in the financial industry and in the economy more broadly.\nThrough the services they provide, community banks help support strong cities,\ntowns, and rural communities across the country, which are central to a vibrant economy.\nFor example, small business lending is an essential part of community bank portfolios.\nMany community banks often specialize in serving small businesses, which account for\nthe majority of new job creation in the country.2 In fact, community banks hold 48\npercent of all loans to small businesses and farms in the United States.3\nCommunity banks are also often seen by their customers as an important source\nof financial advice and a source of civic leadership.4 Community banks have a deep\nunderstanding of their local areas. They also have close relationships with those living in\nthe communities they serve and the organizations that serve those communities. In many\ninstances, community banks are also serving markets that tend to be neglected by larger\nbanks. These connections allow community banks to focus on specific local needs to\nprovide a variety of services, which often include tailored and innovative products.\nPayment services in particular are a key component of these relationships and are\n2 See U.S. Small Business Administration, Office of Advocacy, Frequently Asked Questions (September\n2019), https://cdn.advocacy.sba.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/24153946/Frequently-Asked-Questions-\nSmall-Business-2019-1.pdf.\n3 Data on loans were compiled from Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income, also known as Call\nReports, that banks file with the Federal Financial Institution Examination Council.\n4 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Perspectives from Main Street: Bank Branch\nAccess in Rural Communities (Washington: Board of Governors, November 2019),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/bank-branch-access-in-rural-communities.pdf.\n\n- 3 -\nessential to the role of banks in their communities. Community banks help ensure that\nconsumers and businesses can safely and efficiently access and move their money. By\ndoing so, the payment services they provide act as the foundation for economic activities\nthat help cities, towns, and rural communities grow and thrive, which in turn is essential\nto a strong and stable financial system.\nA strong and stable financial system also depends on the smooth functioning of\nthe nation’s payment system. Today, many Americans take the ability to move money\nacross the country safely and efficiently for granted, but history shows that payment\nsystem disruptions can affect the economy more broadly.5 In the past, our nation’s\npayment system was fragmented and inefficient, creating costs for consumers, merchants,\nbanks, and, ultimately, the U.S. economy. For example, before the Federal Reserve was\nestablished, check clearing fees and banks’ efforts to avoid them often led to circuitous\ncheck routing, with recipients facing long, unpredictable delays in receiving their money.\nWhen they did eventually receive their money, fees had often consumed a considerable\nportion of what they were expecting. In extreme instances, this led to checks moving\nfrom city to city before eventually ending up at their destination. One often-cited\nexample described a check that started in Rochester, New York, and traveled to\nJacksonville, Florida, then to Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Cincinnati before it finally\nreached its final destination in Birmingham, Alabama.6 To put that in terms of miles\ntraveled, if the check had gone directly from New York to Alabama, it would have\n5 “Policies: The Federal Reserve in the Payments System,” Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem (issued 1984; revised 1990), https://www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/pfs_frpaysys.htm.\n6 Noted by Federal Reserve Chairman W.P.G. Harding in Robert Kramer and W. Putnam Livingston,\n“Cashing in on the Checkless Society,” Harvard Business Review, September/October 1967, p. 143; Bill\nMedley, Highways of Commerce: Central Banking and the U.S. Payments System (Kansas City: Federal\nReserve Bank of Kansas City, July 2014), p. 23,\nhttps://www.kansascityfed.org/~/media/files/publicat/highwasyofcommer/highwaysofcommerce.pdf?la=en.\n\n- 4 -\ntraveled about 1,000 miles. Instead, it traveled 3,000 miles up and down the east coast,\nlikely for days, before it finally reached its destination. The distance from Atlanta to Los\nAngeles is shorter than the route that check took.\nThese kinds of inefficiencies were so significant that one of Congress’s\nmotivations in creating the Federal Reserve was ensuring a safe and efficient nationwide\npayment infrastructure. Shortly after they opened for business, the Reserve Banks began\nproviding a nationwide check collection service. This service helped speed up payments\nby reducing circuitous routing. It also facilitated access to more-efficient payment\nservices for banks across the nation. Since then, the Federal Reserve has continued to\nsupport ongoing efficiency improvements in the nation’s payment system, including the\ndevelopment of the Fedwire funds transfer system and the implementation of the\nautomated clearinghouse, or ACH system, in partnership with the private sector.\nThis operational role has allowed the Federal Reserve to support the goal of a safe\nand efficient payment system throughout its history. It has also contributed to widespread\npublic confidence in the nation’s payment infrastructure. At times, the Federal Reserve\nhas taken extraordinary steps to ensure the payment system can function reliably. After\nplanes were grounded on September 11, 2001, in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks in\nNew York and Washington, D.C., the Federal Reserve arranged alternative transportation\nfor millions of checks that normally would have moved across the country by plane. The\nFederal Reserve also started giving immediate credit for all checks that it received. This\nprovided a key source of liquidity for the payment system and temporarily caused the\ndaily float held by the Federal Reserve to increase over 6,000 percent.7 After September\n7 Medley, Highways of Commerce, 105,\nhttps://www.kansascityfed.org/~/media/files/publicat/highwasyofcommer/highwaysofcommerce.pdf?la=en.\n\n- 5 -\n11, the Federal Reserve also took steps to improve the future efficiency of the nation’s\ncheck collection system by working with Congress on the passage of the Check 21 Act in\n2002.\nA safe and efficient payment system also needs to be accessible, because payment\nservices are most valuable when you can pay anyone regardless of where balances are\nheld. The ultimate success of any effort to modernize the U.S. payment system depends\non adoption across the entire banking industry. Therefore, in considering the Federal\nReserve’s provision of payment services, Congress took steps to try to ensure access to\nservices across the country. As a result, Congress specifically tasked the Federal Reserve\nwith taking into account an adequate level of services nationwide when providing and\nsetting fees for payment services.8 The United States has a highly complex banking\nsystem with more than 10,000 depository institutions spread over wide areas with\ndiffering payment needs.9 Over 4,800 of those are community banks.10 In many areas,\nparticularly rural areas, community banks may be the primary providers of banking\nservices for individuals and small businesses. Community banks are, therefore, essential\nin ensuring access to safe and efficient payment services in towns, cities, and rural\ncommunities nationwide so that payments can move across the country regardless of\ngeography—from here in the South, to the Midwest, and coast to coast.\n8 The Monetary Control Act of 1980 requires in part “due regard to competitive factors and the provision of\nan adequate level of such services nationwide . . . .”\n9 Including both FDIC-insured commercial banks and savings institutions and federally insured credit\nunions.

At the Federal Reserve, we support\nthe responsible use of technology and innovation to transform the financial system and\nreduce frictions and delays, while preserving consumer protections, data privacy and\nsecurity, and financial stability. But as technology continues to advance, the intricacies\nof our digital world become more complex, and I believe we can help ensure that banks\nare well positioned to take advantage of these technology advancements and innovations.\nLike the rest of the financial industry, community banks are investing in new\ntechnologies and innovations to meet the growing expectations of their customers. With\ntheir considerable understanding of local needs, community banks are able to put these\nkinds of innovations to use in meeting the specific needs of their communities. At the\nFederal Reserve, we are actively engaging with the banking industry to encourage\nresponsible innovation in the community-banking sector.\nBut I also firmly believe that we cannot just say community banks need to engage\nin responsible innovation, we need to empower community banks to do just that, and I\nam committed to working with my colleagues to realize this objective. I believe it is our\nresponsibility as a payment service provider and supervisor to ensure that our nation’s\nevolving financial system works for community banks. Because by empowering them to\nprovide modern and innovative services to their customers, we also ensure that\nAmericans across the country can make payments safely and efficiently.\n\n- 7 -\nFirst, as a provider of payment services, the Federal Reserve has a long history of\nsupporting community banks. We have long-standing relationships with, and the\nnationwide infrastructure to provide services to, thousands of community banks across\nthe country. While the existing payment infrastructure provided by the Federal Reserve\nhas generally served community banks and the nation’s economy well, advances in\ntechnology have also created opportunities to modernize these payment services.\nCollectively, these efforts will create a modern payment infrastructure that provides\ncommunity banks the ability to meet customer expectations in offering innovative\nservices with the same effectiveness and efficiency as other providers. This in turn will\nprovide consumers the ability to better manage their financial lives by accessing accounts\nwhen and where they choose and providing more flexibility to manage money and make\ntime-sensitive payments.\nTo start, the Board has supported changes to existing Federal Reserve services.\nFor example, at the end of last year, the Board announced changes to support adoption of\nan additional same-day ACH window available later in the day. When it was adopted in\n2015, same-day ACH allowed for faster processing and return of recurring, low-cost\npayments such as payroll and bill payments. This additional window will help to make\nthe benefits of same-day ACH more broadly accessible. More specifically, it will allow\nbanks and their customers, particularly those located outside the eastern time zone, to use\nsame-day ACH services during a greater portion of the business day.\nOur modernization efforts do not stop with existing services, though. The\nFedNowSM Service, announced last August, will create a new payment infrastructure for\ninstitutions of all sizes to offer innovative faster payment services. Community banks in\n\n- 8 -\nparticular were strong supporters of developing the FedNow Service. Many of them\nemphasized that the Federal Reserve’s long-standing policy commitment to promoting\nnationwide access would result in a service that is accessible to banks of all sizes. They\nfelt that this in turn would ultimately increase the long-term likelihood of being able to\noffer faster payment services in their communities. Community banks continued to voice\nstrong support in response to our most recent request for comment on the design of the\nFedNow Service. At the same time, they raised a number of important issues, including\ninteroperability, time to market, and use of volume-based pricing. These issues are\nimportant to community banks, and as such, they are important to me. I intend to work\nwith my colleagues so that the FedNow Service meets the needs of community banks and\ntheir customers. I hope that you will continue to engage with us, continue to provide\nyour feedback, and continue to be patient as we undertake this effort to develop the\nFedNow Service. Because with your input, I believe the Federal Reserve can continue its\nlong history—which started with bank notes and checks, then continued with ACH—of\nproviding infrastructure that supports the independence and success of community banks\nfor the long term.\nIt is also important to understand that technology advancements affect more than\njust the payment infrastructure behind-the-scenes. Innovations in consumer and other\nend-user experiences, such as those facilitated by fintech firms, can also transform the\nway that consumers interact with their financial institutions, offering community banks\nadditional opportunities to serve their customers in the future. For instance, I have\npreviously discussed how working with fintech firms may offer community banks\npotential partnerships that leverage the latest technology to provide customer-first,\n\n- 9 -\ncommunity-focused financial services and provide customers with efficiencies, such as\neasy-to-use online applications or rapid loan decisionmaking. These kinds of strategic\npartnerships harness the indispensable knowledge and trust that community banks have\nbuilt with retail customers and local small businesses. For example, we have seen\ncommunity banks experience significant growth after partnering with fintech companies\nto offer checking accounts for online investors, personal loans, and debit cards. We have\nalso seen such partnerships increase efficiency in service offerings, such as significantly\nreducing loan approval processing time. We expect that the efforts to modernize our\npayment infrastructure that I outlined earlier, such as FedNow, will serve as a foundation\nfor this kind of innovation to flourish, and will support new opportunities for community\nbanks and the communities they serve.\nOf course, new technology is also subject to many of the traditional risks banks\nhave managed in the past with more-traditional consumer services, and implementation\nof new technology should be driven by banks’ business strategies and customer needs.\nUltimately, banks remain responsible for conducting due diligence and understanding the\nrisks faced by their organization. But technology advances quickly, and new\ndevelopments inevitably raise new questions. That is why I believe that the Federal\nReserve also needs to take steps as a supervisor to ensure our nation’s evolving financial\nsystem works for community banks.\nFirst and foremost, it is essential we continue to meaningfully engage with\nstakeholders on these issues. For example, we recently launched an innovation web page\n(www.federalreserve.gov/innovate) that will serve as an accessible central hub for\nstakeholders interested in learning about and engaging with the Federal Reserve on\n\n- 10 -\ninnovation-related matters.11 The web page can serve as a starting point for members of\nthe industry to engage with Federal Reserve specialists, submit questions, and request in-\nperson meetings. We also announced a series of “fintech innovation office hours” across\nthe country. The first of these was held just yesterday here in Atlanta, and some of you\nmay have even had the opportunity to participate. These are also an important\nopportunity for us to learn, and I encourage you to provide your feedback. For\ncommunity banks and their potential fintech partners, I hope that these sessions will serve\nas a resource to meet one-on-one with Federal Reserve staff members with relevant\nexpertise, discuss fintech developments, share specific projects, and ask questions. They\nalso provide us an opportunity to hear directly from banks and fintech companies about\nchallenges to innovation.\nAnother important area of focus for me is community banks’ relationships with\ntheir vendors and third-party service providers. As a former community banker, I am\nacutely aware that community banks are often reliant on outside service providers and\nvendors to access new technologies and provide payment services. I also know that\nsupervisory expectations in these areas can be challenging, and I have experienced it\nmyself. There are several things I believe we can do to help provide clarity and\ntransparency, reduce confusion, and simplify and remove some of the burden community\nbanks face in this area.\nFirst, in order to give community banks a better picture of what success in due\ndiligence of third-party providers looks like, and where it begins and ends, I believe that\nwe should release more information on its necessary elements. This change would\n11 See https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/innovation.htm.\n\n- 11 -\nprovide clarity and assist community banks in completing their work. In particular, I\nbelieve that regulators can provide more clarity on the types of questions that should be\nasked of a prospective third-party provider and our view of a satisfactory answer. I also\nbelieve our guidance should explain what due diligence looks like for a potential fintech\npartner, because the standards applied to other third parties may not be universally\napplicable. Potential partnerships are not one-size-fits-all. Every bank has different\nobjectives, and guidance should reflect some supervisory flexibility so that we do not\nimpede prudent, strategic partnerships between community banks and potential partners.\nRegulators should especially support partnerships that combine the strengths of\ncommunity banks and fintech companies, which have a track record of success. I also\nbelieve the Federal Reserve should allow banks to conduct shared due diligence on\npotential partners. If several banks use the same third-party service provider and are\nopen to collaborating, they should be allowed to pool resources instead of duplicating one\nanother’s work. These approaches would not only have the benefit of increasing clarity\nand transparency for community banks, but could also be beneficial for fintech\ncompanies that hope to become third-party providers.\nSecond, clear and transparent guidance is most helpful when it is consistent. I\nhave previously discussed my view that guidance on third-party relationships should be\nconsistent across banking agencies. No one benefits when banks and their potential\npartners or other vendors have to navigate unnecessary differences in guidance between\nagencies. To that end, the Federal Reserve is in the process of working with the other\nbanking agencies to update our third-party guidance. As part of this process, I believe\nthat the banking agencies should all have consistent expectations for third-party\n\n- 12 -\nrelationships, and that the Federal Reserve should, as a starting point, move toward\nadopting the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s guidance.\nThird, I believe we can improve transparency with regard to our supervision of\nthird parties. Through our service provider supervision program, we regularly conduct\nexams of many third-party service providers. While we make the outcomes available to\nbanks that are clients of a supervised service provider, I believe we can go a step further\nto increase transparency by also making information that may be useful about our\nsupervision of key service providers available to banks. This could take a number of\nforms, such as being more transparent about who and what we evaluate. Of course,\nmoving forward in these areas requires careful consideration and interagency\ncollaboration, and I have asked our staff to work with other agencies to develop and\npropose workable options for giving banks the benefit of the knowledge that supervisors\nhave about their potential providers in an appropriate manner.\nFinally, I believe regulators and supervisors have a role to play in ensuring that\nregulatory burden is tailored to bank size, risk, complexity, and capacity. Knowing the\nburden that third-party monitoring in particular can present to employees of the smallest\nbanks, I have also encouraged Federal Reserve staff to consider options for further\ntailoring our expectations for community banks with assets under $1 billion in this area.\nCollectively, I view these as important steps to improve the ability of community\nbanks to manage their third-party relationships effectively. By doing so, I believe we will\nbe able to better support the ability of community banks to access innovative new\ntechnology and offer modern services to customers.\n\n- 13 -\nLooking Ahead\nThe kinds of advances in technology we are discussing here today present\nchallenges and opportunities for banks of all sizes, including community banks.\nInvestments in new technology are likely to create implementation costs, and payment\nsystem innovations are no exception. Testing new technology, upgrading software and\nprocessing systems, and integrating new systems with existing systems will require banks\nto incur costs and dedicate resources to implementation. Community banks in particular\nmay incur additional costs, for example to extend operating hours in order to facilitate\npayments during nonstandard business hours.\nHowever, technological advances also present opportunities for community banks\nto continue serving their neighbors, and payment services are a key component of this.\nSince I joined the Federal Reserve, I have been on the road a lot, visiting Federal Reserve\nDistricts and talking to bankers, consumers, and community groups. I have been struck\nin particular by stories I have heard about younger generations of Americans moving\nback to rural areas. These individuals may be returning to their hometown or moving out\nof urban centers, but they still have the same expectations for services like those that may\nbe offered by larger banks with nationwide footprints. Technological developments, like\nthe payment system modernization efforts we have discussed today, allow banks across\nthe country to meet these customer expectations and provide payment services on a\ncompetitive basis.\nI believe the Federal Reserve is uniquely positioned as a provider of payment\nservices and as a supervisor of banks to ensure that our nation’s evolving financial system\nworks for community banks. As a provider of payment services, our efforts to modernize\n\n- 14 -\nthe nation’s payment system through services like FedNow and same-day ACH will\nensure community banks and their customers have access to today’s financial technology\nnationwide. As a supervisor of banks, we can support responsible innovation by reducing\nregulatory burden where we can, clarifying expectations, and improving the ability of\ncommunity banks to manage their relationships effectively. Collectively, I believe these\nefforts will help support a community banking sector that is well positioned to thrive and\noffer modern, innovative services to their customers. By providing such services,\ncommunity banks can help ensure all Americans can make payments safely and\nefficiently regardless of their location and that families across the country have access to\nfinancial services that are so important to their success and the success of our\ncommunities in today’s age of advancement.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n11:00 a.m. EDT\nOctober 7, 2023\nBrief Remarks on the Economy and Insights from Past Bank Regulatory Reform Efforts\nby\nMichelle W. Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nConnecticut Bankers Association Annual Meeting\nWhite Sulphur Springs, West Virginia\nOctober 7, 2023\n\nIt is a pleasure to be with you here today.1 As a former community banker and a\nformer state bank commissioner, I bring a unique perspective to my service on the Board\nof Governors of the Federal Reserve System. These different experiences help inform\nmy views on the Fed’s important role in bank regulation and supervision. Over the past\nfive years, I have found that one of the most informative, enjoyable, and productive\naspects of my work at the Fed is hearing from bankers about issues that are important to\nyou, and that affect you and your customers. This includes, of course, the impact of the\nFed’s regulation and supervision. So today, I would like to share some thoughts about\nthat and, should changes to the bank regulatory framework be necessary, how we can\nsupport thoughtful and considered changes.\nBefore we turn to our conversation, I’d like to offer a few thoughts on the\neconomy and monetary policy, in light of our Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)\nmeeting last month. As you know, at that meeting, my colleagues and I voted to maintain\nthe target range for the federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent, after raising rates sharply\nover the past year and a half to reduce inflation. Since then, there has been considerable\nprogress on lowering inflation, and the FOMC has responded this year with a more\ngradual pace of increases. In keeping with this approach, we held the policy rate steady\nin June, raised it by 25 basis points in July, and then held steady again last month.\nInflation continues to be too high, and I expect it will likely be appropriate for the\nCommittee to raise rates further and hold them at a restrictive level for some time to\nreturn inflation to our 2 percent goal in a timely way.\n1 The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee or the Board of Governors.\n\n- 2 -\nMost recently, the latest inflation reading based on the personal consumption\nexpenditure (PCE) index showed that overall inflation rose, responding in part to higher\noil prices. I see a continued risk that high energy prices could reverse some of the\nprogress we have seen on inflation in recent months.\nAt the same time, the economy has remained strong as the FOMC has tightened\nmonetary policy. Real gross domestic product (GDP) has been growing at a solid pace.\nConsumer spending has remained robust, and the housing sector appears to be continuing\nto rebound. The most recent employment report showed a labor market with solid job\ngains. The average pace of job gains over the past year has slowed somewhat and the\nlabor force participation rate has also improved over the same time frame, a sign that\nlabor market supply and demand may be coming into better balance.\nThe banking system continues to be strong and resilient. Banks have tightened\nlending standards due to higher interest rates and funding costs and in anticipation of\nfuture regulatory requirements. But despite this tightening of lending standards, there has\nnot been a sharp contraction in credit that would significantly slow economic activity.\nBank loan balance growth has slowed, but ongoing strong household and business\nbalance sheets combined with the growing importance of nonbank lending suggest that\nmonetary policy may have smaller effects on bank lending and the economy than in the\npast.\nGiven the mixed data releases recently—strong spending data but a decline in\ninflation and downward revisions to jobs created in previous months—I supported the\nFOMC’s decision to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate. Since then, the\nGDP and employment data have also been revised. The frequency and scope of recent\n\n- 3 -\ndata revisions complicates the task of projecting how the economy will evolve. But I\ncontinue to expect that further policy tightening will likely be needed to return inflation\nto 2 percent in a timely way. The Summary of Economic Projections released in\nconnection with the September FOMC meeting showed that the median participant\nexpects inflation to stay above 2 percent at least until the end of 2025. This, along with\nmy own expectation that progress on inflation is likely to be slow given the current level\nof monetary policy restraint, suggests that further policy tightening will be needed to\nbring inflation down in a sustainable and timely manner.\nIt is important to note that monetary policy is not on a pre-set course. My\ncolleagues and I will make our decisions based on the incoming data and its implications\nfor the economic outlook. I remain willing to support raising the federal funds rate at a\nfuture meeting if the incoming data indicates that progress on inflation has stalled or is\ntoo slow to bring inflation to 2 percent in a timely way. Returning inflation to the\nFOMC’s 2 percent goal is necessary to achieve a sustainably strong labor market and an\neconomy that works for everyone.\nI would now like to share some views on how I see a responsible evolution of the\nbank regulatory framework in my day-to-day work on the Board. To frame this\ndiscussion, I would like to revisit a few of the regulatory actions the Board has engaged\nin over the past year. I will identify several lessons we can learn from these actions and\nconsider how we can apply these lessons when thinking about ongoing and future\nreforms to the bank regulatory framework.\nSpecifically, I would like to address three broad themes: (1) how efficiency\nshould be a key factor in policy discussions, (2) how to think about limits on the Board’s\n\n- 4 -\ntools to implement policy decisions, and (3) the importance of due process and public\nengagement in rulemaking.\nEfficiency should play a central role in policymaking. Policymakers should\nconsider how a desired policy goal can be achieved in a targeted manner that minimizes\ncosts and administrative burdens on financial institutions. In June of this year, the Board,\nalong with the FDIC and OCC, released third-party risk management guidance for banks\nof all sizes. While I continue to support the overarching and worthy goal of the guidance,\nas I noted at the time, I think the agencies lost an opportunity to maximize efficiency in\nthe release of this guidance. The text acknowledged the need for resources to assist\ncommunity banks in meeting the untailored expectations set forth in the guidance, but\nfailed to provide those resources on a timeline that would have improved transparency\nand understanding among community banks. In the absence of clearly defined\nexpectations, the regulatory agencies should have supplemented the published guidance\nto ensure that the smallest banks understand how to apply the guidance to their third-\nparty relationships.2 Over the years, the bank regulatory agencies have made great efforts\nto enhance our approach to consider financial institution risk, business model, and asset\nsize in our regulatory proposals and guidance. This guidance did not meet that bar, and\nwe should do better for the smallest in size, yet largest number, of banks.\nThe benefits of an efficient approach extend well beyond rulemaking and\nguidance and apply broadly to all aspects of the Federal Reserve’s approach. For\n2 “Statement on Third-Party Risk Management Guidance by Governor Michelle W. Bowman,” (June 6,\n2023), https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bowman-statement-20230606.htm. (“The\nguidance contemplates that the agencies plan to develop additional resources to assist smaller, non-complex\ncommunity banks in managing relevant third-party risks, but provides no timeline for development of these\nresources. It also makes clear that these additional resources will not be available for some time. This\nleaves one to wonder why the rush to publish without appropriate tools available for small banks.”)\n\n- 5 -\nexample, as I noted at the St. Louis Reserve Bank Community Banking Conference\nearlier this week, delays in processing applications can be harmful to banks of all sizes.\nThe Board’s application review processes should support the efficient resolution of\napplications.3 One way the Board could do this is by improving the approach to\nprocessing applications in cases where a member of the public has made an adverse\ncomment. When the recent supervisory record addresses the concerns raised in the\nprotest and the record is consistent with approval, the decision should be delegated to the\nReserve Bank for a determination.4 Our goal should be to ensure that bona fide concerns\nraised by the public are appropriately considered, without resulting in unnecessary\nprocessing delays.5\nAnother important issue relates to how policymakers should consider the limits on\navailable regulatory tools. Before the Board uses its regulatory or supervisory authority,\nwe need to ask a basic question: Does the Board have the legal authority to use the tool in\nthe manner contemplated? Late last year, the Board published principles for climate-\nrelated financial risk management for large financial institutions for public comment.6\nWhile I supported publishing the draft principles, I noted at the time that the Board “has\nspecific responsibilities, established by Congress, to supervise holding companies and\n3 Michelle W. Bowman, “The Role of Research, Data, and Analysis in Banking Reforms” (speech at the\n2023 Community Banking Research Conference sponsored by the Federal Reserve System, the Conference\nof State Bank Supervisors, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, October 4, 2023),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20231004a.htm.\n4 See “Statement on Application by Vantage Bank Texas by Governor Michelle W. Bowman,” (June 27,\n2023), https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bowman-statement-20230627.htm.\n5 See Michelle W. Bowman, “Independence, Predictability, and Tailoring in Banking Regulation and\nSupervision” (speech at the American Bankers Association Community Banking Conference, February 13,\n2023), https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20230213a.pdf.\n6 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Federal Reserve Board Invites Public Comment on\nProposed Principles Providing a High-Level Framework for the Safe and Sound Management of Exposures\nto Climate-Related Financial Risks for Large Banking Organizations,” news release, December 2, 2022,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20221202b.htm.\n\n- 6 -\nbanks, with a focus on the safety and soundness of these regulated institutions.”7 Of\ncourse, any decision to mandate guidance on a narrow area like climate-related financial\nrisk—highlighting this one risk out of the full range of risks that banks manage today—\nshould be based on evidence of unique climate financial risks and an identified need for\nmore guidance addressing this area. Of course, any new guidance should complement\nexisting standards as well. As I observed at the time the climate guidance was proposed,\n“[t]he new principles contemplate additional obligations on firms to monitor and measure\na broader set of climate-related risks, over indefinite time horizons.”8 Such narrow and\nspecific guidance runs the risk of going beyond the scope of safety and soundness, by\nfocusing on narrow, remote and uncertain risks with minimal demonstrated impacts on\nfinancial institutions. I am concerned that the Board could unintentionally interfere with\nthe ability of a bank’s management to make credit allocation decisions. Under no\ncircumstances should the Board mandate credit allocation decisions for banks—directly\nthrough a prohibition, or indirectly through policy tools like guidance—and we must\ncarefully evaluate this type of guidance with an eye toward whether the policy tool we\nuse is appropriate in the circumstance.\nAnother example I want to highlight is the use of conditions in applications. In\nthe process of deliberating on applications that come before the Board, the Board can\nimpose limitations or restrictions in certain circumstances, to address specific supervisory\nor policy concerns raised by the application. While this can be an important tool, it\ncannot replace rulemaking.\n7 “Statement by Governor Bowman on Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for\nLarge Financial Institutions,” (December 2, 2022),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bowman-statement-20221202.htm.\n8 See footnote 7.\n\n- 7 -\nIn a Board Order approving a large bank application last year, the Board used its\ncommitment authority in a way that “could impose heightened prudential standards at a\nfixed date in the future” on a firm, in a manner “inconsistent with the Board’s existing\nregulatory framework, which imposes tailored requirements based on clear, quantitative\nmeasures of the firm’s underlying risk.”9 This Board action highlights yet another\nquestion policymakers should ask when using one of many bank regulatory and\nsupervisory tools, namely whether the tool is appropriate in the circumstances, or whether\nanother tool—one established by regulation to address the very concern raised—is more\nappropriate.10 The Board’s rules and regulations are often the most appropriate and\neffective tools to address supervisory and financial stability concerns.\nFinally, I want to talk about how due process and promoting public engagement\ncan improve the rulemaking process, including by helping policymakers understand the\nimpact of proposed rules. In October of last year, the agencies finalized amendments to\nthe Board’s Regulation II, implementing new rules pertaining to debit card routing on\ndifferent networks. During the public comment process, community banks raised\nsubstantial concerns with the proposal, specifically around the uncertainty of the rule\nrevisions on fraud and the cost of compliance. As a result of comments raised, and my\nview that significant questions remained about the effect of the rule, I did not support the\nBoard’s final action.11 But a key element in that rulemaking is that banks engaged in the\n9 “Statement by Governor Bowman on Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on Resolution\nRequirements for Large Banks and Application by U.S. Bancorp,” (October 14, 2022),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bowman-statement-20221014.htm\n10 See footnote 9.\n11 “Statement on Final Amendments to Regulation II to Clarify the Prohibition on Network Exclusivity by\nGovernor Michelle W. Bowman,” (October 3, 2022),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bowman-statement-20221003.htm.\n\n- 8 -\nrulemaking process shared their feedback, especially around potential fraud concerns and\nthe speed with which the rule mandated system changes and implementation without\nconsideration of the practical implementation and processor functionality constraints.\nCommunity banks have unique perspectives and concerns, and raising these\nissues with policymakers can make a difference in the contours of any final rules. In my\nconversations with state member banks over the past 12 months, many have shared their\nconcerns about the proposed changes to the criteria for becoming or maintaining their\ndesignation as a certified community development financial institution (CDFI). While\nCDFI certification is the sole purview of the CDFI Fund within the Treasury Department,\nI appreciate the implications the recent proposed revisions to these guidelines may have\non nearly 200 bank CDFIs and the communities they serve. But this also shows the\nopportunity, and the need, for the robust public engagement of affected stakeholders.\nFrom time to time, my colleagues and I disagree on policy questions. But, the\nrulemaking process benefits when policymakers have the full scope of information\nneeded to inform our discussions and debate. This enables us to fully appreciate the\nactual impact of our policy decisions.\nThe rulemaking process provides a path for policymakers to follow that is\ndesigned to ensure that we are aware of the important tradeoffs and considerations in\nunderstanding the intended and unintended consequences resulting from each proposal.\nConclusion\nI would like to conclude by emphasizing the critical role you and other public\ncommenters play in making the rulemaking process work as it was intended. This is a\n\n- 9 -\ntopic I have frequently raised, which is the importance of robust public engagement on\nthe Federal Reserve’s and the other federal banking agencies’ rulemaking agendas.\nA number of rules have been proposed for comment or are currently in the\npipeline. Some have already been published, including the proposal to implement Basel\nIII “endgame” by significantly expanding capital requirements and bringing the threshold\nfor compliance down to include all banks over $100 billion in assets from only the largest\nbanks, and the expansion of the long-term debt requirement from only the largest banks\nagain to all banks over $100 billion in assets. Still other proposals have not yet been\npublished or moved to the next stage of the rulemaking process, including the\nCommunity Reinvestment Act rulemaking, the further consideration of climate guidance,\nand others. The Board has also publicly indicated it may propose additional revisions in\nthe future to Regulation II.\nThe scope of some of these reforms will be extensive and could reshape the\ncontours of the bank regulatory framework, including for community banks, and could\nrestrict the ability of consumers and businesses to access credit and other financial\nservices from chartered financial institutions. It is critical that stakeholders engage in the\ncomment process and communicate with policymakers to share their views on the\nrulemaking agenda, including the specific impacts—intended and unintended—of any\nchanges. Public comments, data, and analysis help to inform decisions made throughout\nthe rulemaking and proposal process. The bankers in this room and across the country\nare vitally important to the banking system, and to the broader economy. As reforms take\nshape, it is important that we incorporate your perspectives on the real-world\nconsequences of any considered changes.\n\n- 10 -\nI look forward to our conversation.",

Bowman\nVice Chair for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Assessing the Effectiveness of Monetary Policy during and after\nthe COVID-19 Pandemic,” a research conference sponsored by the\nInternational Journal of Central Banking and the Czech National Bank\nPrague, Czech Republic\nJune 23, 2025\n\nThank you for the invitation to join you today.1 As the Federal Reserve’s Vice Chair for\nSupervision, I am responsible for, among other things, leading the Board’s Division of\nSupervision and Regulation in its work to promote the safe and sound operation of the U.S.\nbanking system. While this includes the specific activities of bank supervision and regulation,\nthe financial system reaches far beyond the banking system. Regulators must also monitor the\neffects of activities that extend outside this perimeter, for example activities that have migrated\nfrom banks to non-banks, or when there are broader market implications of regulatory actions\nand their potential effects on financial stability. Regulations should not be created in a static\nworld of “set it and forget it.”\nToday, my remarks will focus specifically on how the passage of time—with underlying\nchanges in the composition of the economy and the financial system, interest rate shifts, and\npatterns and preferences of banking and financial activity—can lead to unintended policy\napplication and unexpected consequences. Regulators should consider these broader evolving\ndynamics as they craft regulations to endure beyond today’s circumstances.\nTypically, these effects are not contemplated in the scope of the usual cost-benefit\nanalysis, as shifts occur over time after a new rule or regulation is implemented or enacted. But\nshifts can, in effect, become new policy choices with consequences that can pose significant\nissues.\nOne shift in particular is that of the supplementary leverage ratio increasingly becoming\nthe binding capital constraint for the largest banks in the United States. The U.S. banking system\nincludes two basic types of capital requirements: risk-based requirements that impose a capital\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\n“charge” based on the underlying risk of a particular activity, and leverage-based requirements\nthat do not differentiate based on the risk characteristics of underlying assets. And while\nleverage-based capital requirements are generally intended to operate as a backstop to risk-based\nrequirements, changes in the financial system and the broader economy can alter this relationship\nbetween capital requirements. This shift in the nature of leverage-based capital requirements,\nfrom backstop to binding constraint, was not driven by a deliberate policymaking process, but\nrather by the maintenance of a high level of reserves in the banking system, as well as the\nintroduction of liquidity requirements that compelled banks to replace loans with high-quality\nliquid assets.2\nMonetary Policy and Economic Outlook\nBefore turning to the main theme of my remarks, I would like to give a brief update on\nmy outlook for the economy and monetary policy.\nAt the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting last week, the Committee\nvoted to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4-1/4 to 4‑1/2 percent and to\ncontinue to reduce the Federal Reserve's securities holdings. I supported this decision because\nthe data shows a solid labor market and I would like to see further confirmation that inflation is\nclose to our 2 percent target on a sustained basis.\nIf inflation remains near its current level or continues to move closer to our target, or if\nthe data show signs of weakening in labor market conditions, it would be appropriate to consider\nlowering the policy rate, moving it closer to a neutral setting.\nAt this point, we have not seen significant economic impacts from trade developments or\nother factors, and the U.S. economy has continued to be resilient despite some slowing in\n2 See 12 CFR 249.3; 249.20 (defining categories of high-quality liquid assets based on asset characteristics).\n\n- 3 -\neconomic growth. Private domestic final purchases (PDFP) growth slowed to a moderate pace in\nthe first quarter, even as activity was partly boosted by a pull-forward of spending on motor\nvehicles and high-tech equipment ahead of the implementation of tariffs. Although the pull-\nforward of spending appears to be unwinding, retail and motor vehicle sales through May\nprovide further evidence that PDFP has softened so far this year.\nThe labor market appears to remain solid, with payroll employment rising about 140,000\nper month, on average, in April and May, only slightly below the average monthly gains over the\npast two quarters. This pace of job gains appears consistent with the unemployment rate\nremaining at a low 4.2 percent through May, which is roughly unchanged since the middle of last\nyear.\nThe labor market appears to be stable near estimates of full employment, with layoffs\nremaining low. The number of job openings relative to job seekers has moved roughly sideways\nsince the middle of last year at, or a touch below, the pre-pandemic level. And the labor market\nno longer appears to be especially tight or a significant source of inflation pressures, as most\nwage growth measures have slowed closer to a pace consistent with 2 percent inflation.\nTurning to inflation, we have seen a welcome return to further moderation of personal\nconsumption expenditures (PCE) inflation over the past three months. The May consumer and\nproducer price reports suggest that 12-month core PCE inflation stood at 2.6 percent in May,\ndown meaningfully from its elevated reading of 2.9 percent at the end of last year. Similar to the\npast two years, elevated monthly inflation readings in January and February have been followed\nby low readings as we move into the spring.\nOn a 12-month basis, core PCE goods inflation has picked up somewhat since last\nDecember, but this has been more than offset by a considerable slowing in core PCE services\n\n- 4 -\ninflation. It appears that any upward pressure from higher tariffs on goods prices is being offset\nby other factors and that the underlying trend in core PCE inflation is moving much closer to our\n2 percent target than is currently apparent in the data. With housing services inflation on a\nsustained downward trajectory, and other core services inflation already consistent with\n2 percent inflation, only core goods inflation remains somewhat elevated likely reflecting limited\npassthrough from tariffs.\nWith economic growth slowing, it is possible that recent softness in aggregate demand\ncould be starting to translate into weaker labor market conditions. While still strong, the labor\nmarket appears to be less dynamic, with modest hiring rates, layoffs edging up from low levels,\nand job gains concentrated in just a few industries. With inflation on a sustained trajectory\ntoward 2 percent, softness in aggregate demand, and signs of fragility in the labor market, I think\nthat we should put more weight on downside risks to our employment mandate going forward.\nDespite progress on lowering inflation, there are potential upside risks if negotiations\nresult in higher tariffs or if firms raise goods prices independent of any tariff pass-through.\nAlthough we have not seen evidence of disruptive impacts on supply chains, changes in global\ntrade patterns could lead to an increase in prices for goods and services. The current conflict in\nthe Middle East or other geopolitical tensions could also lead to higher commodity prices.\nI am certainly attentive to these inflation risks, but I am not yet seeing a major concern,\nas some retailers seem unwilling to raise prices for essentials due to high price sensitivity among\nlow-income consumers and as supply chains appear to be largely unaffected so far.\nMeasures of policy and economic uncertainty have receded from recent highs, and\nmeasures of consumer and business sentiment have also improved in recent weeks after having\ndropped considerably. These developments reinforce my view that concerns will subside as\n\n- 5 -\nmore clarity emerges on trade policy. Businesses appear to be resuming investment and hiring\ndecisions, as they feel increasingly confident that less favorable trade outcomes are unlikely to\noccur.\nI remain focused on how new policies evolve and whether future data releases will\nprovide perspective about their economic impacts. On trade policy, I expect that negotiations\nwill ultimately result in lower tariff rates than are currently in place, consistent with the\nresumption of financial market optimism. Further, should we see effects on inflation this year, I\nexpect that increased slack in the economy will limit this to a small, one-off impact.\nSmall and one-off price increases this year should translate only into a small drag on real\nactivity. I also expect that less restrictive regulations, lower business taxes, and a more friendly\nbusiness environment will likely boost supply and largely offset any negative effects on\neconomic activity and prices.\nIn considering the risks to achieving our dual mandate, I fully supported the revised\ncharacterization of uncertainty and the balance of risks in our most recent monetary policy\nstatement, pointing to the diminished uncertainty and removing the emphasis on risks to both\nsides of our mandate. In my view, it was appropriate to recognize that the balance of risks has\nshifted. In fact, the data have not shown clear signs of material impacts from tariffs and other\npolicies. I think it is likely that the impact of tariffs on inflation may take longer, be more\ndelayed, and have a smaller effect than initially expected, especially because many firms front-\nloaded their stocks of inventories. And, all considered, ongoing progress on trade and tariff\nnegotiations has led to an economic environment that is now demonstrably less risky. The\nchange in our monetary policy statement appropriately incorporates this shift in the balance of\nrisks as well as the rapid improvement in many measures of uncertainty.\n\n- 6 -\nAs we think about the path forward, it is time to consider adjusting the policy rate. As\ninflation has declined or come in below expectations over the past few months, we should\nrecognize that inflation appears to be on a sustained path toward 2 percent and that there will\nlikely be only minimal impacts on overall core PCE inflation from changes to trade policy. We\nshould also recognize that downside risks to our employment mandate could soon become more\nsalient, given recent softness in spending and signs of fragility in the labor market.\nBefore our next meeting in July, we will have received one additional month of\nemployment and inflation data. If upcoming data show inflation continuing to evolve favorably,\nwith upward pressures remaining limited to goods prices, or if we see signs that softer spending\nis spilling over into weaker labor market conditions, such developments should be addressed in\nour policy discussions and reflected in our deliberations. Should inflation pressures remain\ncontained, I would support lowering the policy rate as soon as our next meeting in order to bring\nit closer to its neutral setting and to sustain a healthy labor market. In the meantime, I will\ncontinue to carefully monitor economic conditions as the Administration’s policies, the\neconomy, and financial markets continue to evolve.\nIt is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course. At each FOMC\nmeeting, my colleagues and I will make our decisions based on the incoming data and the\nimplications for and risks to the outlook, guided by the Fed’s dual-mandate goals of maximum\nemployment and stable prices. I will also continue to meet with a broad range of contacts as I\nassess the appropriateness of our monetary policy stance.\nBringing inflation in line with our price-stability goal is essential for sustaining a healthy\nlabor market and fostering an economy that works for everyone in the longer run.\n\n- 7 -\nPolicy Shifts and Unintended Consequences\nIn my responsibilities over bank regulation and supervision at the Federal Reserve, I\nintend to apply a pragmatic approach. We will review data and evidence, identify problems that\nneed to be resolved, and develop efficient solutions to address those identified issues.3 While the\nregulatory authority of the Federal Reserve is primarily related to the banking system, the\nconsequences of banking regulation and supervisory efforts are not limited to the banking\nsystem. Bank regulation and supervision affect how financial activities are conducted, the cost\nand availability of credit and financial services, and even what types of entities provide those\nservices. While it is important to consider the consequences of regulatory actions as they evolve\nover time, in cases where regulation may create or exacerbate financial stability risks, we must\nexamine whether those risks are justified by the safety and soundness benefits of the regulation.\nBank-affiliated broker-dealers play a critical role in U.S. capital markets, including in\nTreasury market intermediation activities. Today I will discuss the lessons we have learned\nabout how bank regulatory requirements, specifically leverage ratios in the United States, can\nhave unintended consequences. Leverage ratio impacts on bank-affiliated broker-dealers can\nhave broader impacts, including market impacts like those observed in Treasury market\nintermediation activities. Once we’ve identified “emerging” unintended consequences—issues\nthat were not contemplated during the development of a regulatory approach—we must consider\nhow to revisit earlier regulatory and policy decisions.\nAs I will discuss in greater detail shortly, regulators must act quickly to address the\ngrowing problems with increasingly binding leverage ratios. In 2021, in connection with the\n3 See Michelle W. Bowman, “Taking a Fresh Look at Supervision and Regulation,” (speech at the Georgetown\nUniversity McDonough School of Business, Psaros Center for Financial Markets Policy, Washington, D.C., June 6,\n2025), https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20250606a.pdf.\n\n- 8 -\nexpiration of temporary, emergency changes to the supplementary leverage ratio (SLR), the\nFederal Reserve committed to “soon” inviting public comment on potential modifications.4 Over\nfour years later, a proposal has not been issued, and problems with Treasury market\nintermediation continue to emerge. The time has come for the federal banking agencies to revisit\nleverage ratios and their impacts on the Treasury markets.\nLooking at the Data: Treasury Market Functioning\nAs a first step in this pragmatic approach, it is important to look at what the data says\nabout Treasury market functioning. This is a necessary first step before we determine whether\nthere are issues or problems that can be addressed through adjustments to bank regulatory\nrequirements.\nA review of Treasury market data provides a history of growing issues with Treasury\nmarket functioning. In recent years, U.S. policy debates have highlighted the need to take\npreventative measures to ensure smooth market functioning. One issue that continues to persist\nis low levels of Treasury market liquidity as the Board’s semiannual Financial Stability Report\nnoted.5 In addition, some dealers experienced balance sheet pressure in intermediating record\nvolumes of Treasury market transactions in the spring, at a time when reports from market\nparticipants also indicated reduced demand from other Treasury investors.6\n4 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Federal Reserve Board Announces that the Temporary\nChange to its Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) for Bank Holding Companies Will Expire as Scheduled on\nMarch 31,” press release, March 19, 2021,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20210319a.htm (“To ensure that the SLR—which\nwas established in 2014 as an additional capital requirement—remains effective in an environment of higher\nreserves, the Board will soon be inviting public comment on several potential SLR modifications. The proposal and\ncomments will contribute to ongoing discussions with the Department of the Treasury and other regulators on future\nwork to ensure the resiliency of the Treasury market.”).\n5 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Financial Stability Report (Washington, D.C., April\n2025), 10–11, https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/financial-stability-report-20250425.pdf.\n6 Board of Governors, Financial Stability Report, at 32.\n\n- 9 -\nA survey of market participants from the Fed’s most recent Financial Stability Report\nnoted that more than a quarter of respondents cited Treasury market functioning as a risk to the\nU.S. financial system and the broader global economy. This was an increase from the same\nsurvey conducted last fall when 17 percent of those surveyed cited Treasury market functioning\nas a risk.7\nRecent changes to Treasury market clearing activities from the Securities and Exchange\nCommission’s central clearing requirement for U.S. Treasuries were implemented to improve\nTreasury market functioning. Once fully implemented, these changes may improve market\nfunctioning. The Federal Reserve’s Standing Repo Facility may also help to promote smooth\nfunctioning in the Treasury market. But it is unclear how the ongoing increases in the volume of\nTreasury issuance, the volume of Treasury securities outstanding, and changes to the Fed’s\nbalance sheet over time, may also affect market liquidity.\nTreasury markets have experienced stress events as recently as the September 2019 repo\nmarket stress, and the so-called “dash for cash” in March of 2020. In early April, we also saw\nstrains in Treasury cash markets. Although markets continued to function, there were\nunexpected moves in Treasury yields, with an initial drop in yields followed by a sharp increase\nthat seems to have been driven in part by the unwinding of the swap spread trade by leveraged\ninvestors in response to declining swap spreads.\nWe do not know exactly what circumstances may lead to a future stress event or how it\nwill manifest, and continuing to impose unwarranted limits on dealers’ intermediation capacity\ncould exacerbate a future stress event in this critical market. But we do know that these events\nhave raised concerns about the resilience of U.S. Treasury markets. Therefore, we should\n7 See Board of Governors, Financial Stability Report, at 3.\n\n- 10 -\ncontinue to actively monitor indicators of market functioning. Recent trends in both market\nliquidity indicators and survey responses suggest that this problem has persisted and may be\nbecoming more severe. Low liquidity can create more volatility in prices, exacerbate the effects\nof market shocks, and threaten market functioning.\nIdentifying the Problem: Looking Beyond Treasury Market Intermediation\nLarge bank-affiliated primary dealers play a vital role in the intermediation of U.S.\nTreasury markets. These dealers are subject to, not insulated from, the effect of banking\nregulation. While many factors can affect market liquidity, including the growing volume of\nTreasury issuance, Treasury market saturation, and interest rate volatility, we must consider\nwhether some of the pressure is a byproduct of bank regulation. Due to the role of large banks in\nthe intermediation of Treasury markets, there is a direct link between banking regulation and\nTreasury market liquidity, particularly when it comes to the growth of “safe” assets in the\nbanking system and the increase in leverage-based capital requirements becoming the binding\ncapital constraint on some large banks. In 2018, the Federal Reserve along with the Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency (OCC) proposed significant changes to the enhanced supplementary\nleverage ratio (eSLR) that applies to the largest banks.8 These revisions were never finalized,\nbut the intent behind them was to return the eSLR to its traditional role as a backstop capital\nrequirement instead of what has become a substantial balance sheet constraint.\nThe proposed change was designed to promote resilience in the banking system and to\nprotect financial stability, while also maximizing credit availability and economic growth\n8 See Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and Federal Reserve System (2018), “Regulatory Capital Rules:\nRegulatory Capital, Enhanced Supplementary Leverage Ratio Standards for U.S. Global Systemically Important\nBank Holding Companies and Certain of Their Subsidiary Insured Depository Institutions; Total Loss-Absorbing\nCapacity Requirements for U.S. Global Systemically Important Bank Holding Companies,” Federal Register, vol.\n83 (April 19), pp. 17317–27.\n\n- 11 -\nthroughout the credit cycle.9 During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve addressed\nconstraints on the ability of U.S. banks to support efficient Treasury market functioning by\ntemporarily excluding Fed reserves and Treasuries from the denominator of the SLR.10\nThe central role of bank-affiliated broker-dealers in Treasury market intermediation has\nled us to take a close look at bank regulatory requirements to clarify how these requirements,\nparticularly their calibration, may impact Treasury market functioning. Although designed to\naddress low risk activities, like Treasury market intermediation, leverage ratios have become\nincreasingly binding as a bank capital constraint as market conditions change.\nWhile issues around the use of leverage ratios require close examination, a solid capital\nfoundation in the banking system is critical to support safety and soundness and financial\nstability. Revisiting the calibration of leverage ratios to ensure that they remain backstops\ninstead of creating binding constraints, especially in times of stress, should not be interpreted as\na critique of the role of capital in a robust regulatory and supervisory framework.\nBut to be clear, the consequences of an overly restrictive leverage ratio go well beyond\njust Treasury market intermediation, and impact a wide range of low-risk activities. Leverage\ncapital requirements do not differentiate between the risk of different asset classes or exposures.\nHowever, in periods when bank balance sheets are expanding—like the significant\ndeposit inflows during COVID-19—leverage capital requirements can unintentionally become\nthe binding constraint on both banks and their affiliates. This increases the amount of required\n9 See Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and Federal Reserve System (2018), “II. Revisions to the Enhanced\nSupplementary Leverage Ratio Standards,” Federal Register, vol. 83 (April 19), p. 17319, paragraph 3: “Leverage\ncapital requirements should generally act as a backstop to the risk-based requirements. If a leverage ratio is\ncalibrated at a level that makes it generally a binding constraint through the economic and credit cycle, it can create\nincentives for firms to reduce participation in or increase costs for low-risk, low-return businesses.”\n10 See, for example, Federal Reserve System (2020), “Temporary Exclusion of U.S. Treasury Securities and\nDeposits at Federal Reserve Banks from the Supplementary Leverage Ratio,” Federal Register, vol. 85, (April 14),\npp. 20578–79, https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2020-04-14/pdf/2020-07345.pdf.\n\n- 12 -\ncapital as bank balance sheets grow, regardless of the underlying risk. When constrained in this\nway, bank-affiliated primary dealers may pull back on the market intermediation of low-risk\nassets like U.S. Treasuries. A binding leverage capital requirement can create perverse\nincentives for banks to shift their balance sheets into higher risk assets, since doing so could\ngenerate larger returns without requiring additional capital. This is simply a cause and effect of\noverly restrictive leverage capital.\nThe fact of leverage ratios becoming increasingly binding is evident in simple metrics\nlike the ratio of risk-weighted assets to total leverage exposure. These are, respectively, the\ndenominators of risk-based capital ratios and the SLR. Shortly after the SLR was adopted in the\nU.S. in the mid-2010s, this ratio stood at 48 percent in the aggregate for the eight largest U.S.\nbanks, the global systemically important banks (G-SIBs). Since then, the ratio of risk-weighted\nassets to total leverage exposure has declined and currently stands at 40 percent, primarily due to\nhigher reserves and other types of high-quality liquid assets on bank balance sheets. This\ndownward trend results in the SLR increasingly becoming the binding constraint and reflects\nbanks’ growing holdings of high-quality liquid assets, most of which carry a risk weight of zero\nunder risk-based capital ratios but have a 100 percent weighting under leverage capital ratios.\nEfficient Solutions\nOne example of the SLR’s unintended consequence is the erosion of liquidity in U.S.\nTreasury markets because it is driven, in part, by leverage ratio requirements increasingly\nbecoming the binding constraints on the largest U.S. banks. This example also illustrates the\nnecessity of evaluating tradeoffs in regulation and speaks to a larger issue with the calibration of\nleverage.\n\n- 13 -\nThe banking regulators are uniquely positioned to both analyze and remediate\ncomponents of the bank regulatory framework that may disrupt banks’ participation in low-risk,\nbut economically critical activities. This includes the exacerbation of Treasury market\nilliquidity. Treasury markets play a critical role in the U.S. and global financial systems, and we\nshould be proactive in addressing the unintended consequences of bank regulation, while\nensuring the framework continues to promote safety, soundness, and financial stability.11 We\nshould start by addressing potential constraints on Treasury market functioning before issues\narise, lessening impacts from stress, and mitigating the need to intervene in future market events.\nOn Wednesday, the Board is scheduled to consider specific amendments to the eSLR,\nwhich is the requirement that applies at both the holding company and bank levels of the largest\nU.S. banks. While I do not want to front-run the proposal, I will note that the proposal’s goal is\nto address a long-identified—and growing—problem with the calibration of this leverage\nrequirement. The proposal would solicit public comment on the impacts of this miscalibration,\npotential fixes, and work to develop an appropriate and effective solution. This proposal takes a\nfirst step toward what I view as long overdue follow-up to review and reform what have become\ndistorted capital requirements. This proposal, while meaningful, addresses only one element of\nthe capital framework. More work on capital requirements remains, especially to consider how\nthey have evolved and whether changes in market conditions have revealed issues that should be\naddressed.\nIn a few weeks, on July 22, the Federal Reserve will host a conference to bring together a\nwide range of thought leaders to discuss the U.S. bank capital framework, including the design\n11 For more information, see the press release in note 4 indicating that the Board would seek comment on changes\nto the SLR.\n\n- 14 -\nand calibration of leverage ratios. Fixing the design and calibration of leverage capital\nrequirements will not resolve every issue with U.S. Treasury market functioning. But, simple\nreforms to return leverage ratio requirements to their traditional role as a capital backstop could\nimprove Treasury market functioning by building resilience in advance of future stress events.\nAnd this could reduce the chances that we would need to intervene in Treasury markets should a\nfuture stress event arise. While we know well the issues created by the eSLR, there are many\npotential improvements that could address other issues within the capital framework.\nAs I have noted previously, a broader set of reforms could include amending not only the\nleverage capital ratio, but also G-SIB surcharge requirements. We should also reconsider capital\nrequirements for a wider range of banks, including the SLR’s application to banks with more\nthan $250 billion in assets, Tier 1 leverage requirements, and the calibration of the community\nbank leverage ratio.\nThe unintended shift over time in the eSLR increasingly becoming a binding capital\nconstraint demonstrates that we need to think about regulatory policies in a dynamic way based\non the evolution in the banking and financial systems, and the broader economy.\nOther examples of regulations that must take into account the impact of economic growth\nand inflation include elements of the G-SIB surcharge, as well as regulatory thresholds that\ndefine the broader categories of banks. Thresholds like the $10 billion definition of a\n“community bank” and the $700 billion in total assets and $75 billion for cross-jurisdictional\nactivity separating Category II and III banks determine which regulatory requirements apply to\neach group.\nOne way to prevent the original calibration from becoming divorced from the\nfoundational policy decisions over time is to index the relevant G-SIB surcharge coefficients and\n\n- 15 -\nregulatory thresholds to nominal gross domestic product. While approaches like indexing\nthresholds and requirements can make our regulations more robust and durable over time, we\nshould also acknowledge the essential role of supervision as a tool to promote safety and\nsoundness, and financial stability. Just as our capital requirements are intended to operate in a\ncomplementary manner, so do regulation and supervision act in a complementary way.\nThese are only a handful of relevant examples, but they are representative of an effective\napproach to regulatory reform. Regulations should not be created in a static world of “set it and\nforget it.” The economy evolves over time, as do the banking and financial systems and the\nneeds of businesses and consumers.\nIncreasingly, regulators are expected to conduct a more thorough and detailed analysis as\npart of the ordinary rulemaking process, which includes a proposal’s costs and benefits. Yet,\nover time, we tend to devote fewer resources to the work of conducting maintenance of our\nregulations. Maintenance of the regulatory system should include reviewing the basis for earlier\npolicy decisions, considering whether the policies embedded in regulations have been distorted\nover time through market developments, and examining whether emerging issues in the market\nshould lead to further review and revision.\nClosing Thoughts\nThank you for the opportunity to join you today and to provide my views on the U.S.\neconomic outlook and current regulatory proposals. In the United States, regulatory policy\nobjectives are prescribed by law, and bank regulators focus primarily on promoting the safe and\nsound operation of U.S. banks, and financial stability. Despite this limited purpose, we must\nunderstand the consequences of regulations, which can extend well beyond the banking system.\n\n- 16 -\nRecent trends—including providing more fact-based and analytical support for proposals—are a\npositive step in achieving responsible regulation.\nBut we need a broad commitment to follow the approach I have just described. We must\nconsider relevant data and information, identify the source of any problems or opportunity for\ngreater efficiency, and then develop targeted and effective policy solutions and approaches.",

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe Salzburg Global Seminar on\nGlobal Turbulence and Financial Resilience: Implications for Financial Services and Society\nSalzburg, Austria\nJune 25, 2023\n\nIt is a pleasure to be with you here in Salzburg.1 Bank regulators, particularly in the\nUnited States, have come to an inflection point where we are again taking stock of the reforms\nimplemented after the 2008 financial crisis and evaluating whether these reforms have proven to\nbe sufficient. One justification for pushing these reviews forward has been the recent stress in\nthe banking system.\nThe regulatory framework has evolved substantially since the 2008 financial crisis. The\nregulatory landscape has become more restrictive, with large increases in capital and liquidity\nrequirements, and other post-crisis reforms to improve bank resiliency. Since that time, the\nbanking landscape has also evolved. Today, to stay competitive, banks need to be able to\nquickly adopt new and innovative technology.\nMy remarks this afternoon will address the importance of a responsive and responsible\nregulatory framework, including regulation and supervision. A responsive framework adapts\nquickly to changing economic conditions, changing business activities and models, and emerging\nrisks. A responsible framework enables regulators to make changes that are informed by open\ndebate and take into account intended and unintended consequences. These two concepts—\nadapting to changing conditions, and transparency about regulatory adjustments—are\nintertwined. They inform my view about how bank regulation should evolve and adapt over\ntime. This is particularly relevant now in light of the calls for reform of the regulatory\nframework, motivated in part by a desire to remediate perceived weaknesses that contributed to\nrecent bank failures.\n1 The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee or the Board of Governors.\n\n- 2 -\nResponsive Regulation and Supervision\nThis year, we have seen the failures of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), Signature Bank\n(Signature), and First Republic Bank, and the merger of Credit Suisse into UBS. In the United\nStates, the bank failures of SVB and Signature were accompanied by government intervention in\nthe form of a guarantee on uninsured deposits at these institutions, and the creation of a new,\nbroad-based, emergency liquidity facility designed to calm markets and provide reassurance\nabout the underlying strength of the U.S. banking system. These bank failures also highlighted\nthe need for regulators to consider reform efforts to make the financial system stronger and more\nresilient.\nMany of the problems we have seen at these banks—interest rate risk, liquidity risk, poor\nrisk management—are not caused by any evolution in banking. These bank failures and recent\nstress in the banking system have highlighted key deficiencies in risk management practices, and\nkey deficiencies in supervisory priorities. The Federal Reserve and other banking agencies have\nbeen trying to determine what more can be done to respond to the recent stress, but we also need\nto reflect on how reform efforts can lead to the best results, while minimizing unintended\nconsequences.\nIndependent Review\nIn my view, a necessary next step is to engage an independent third party to analyze the\nsurrounding events of the recent bank failures to fully understand the factors and circumstances\nthat contributed to the recent bank failures and to the ensuing stress in the banking system.2\n2 Michelle W. Bowman, “The Evolving Nature of Banking, Bank Culture, and Bank Runs,” (speech at the 21st\nAnnual Symposium on Building the Financial System of the 21st Century: An Agenda for Europe and the United\nStates, Frankfurt, Germany, May 12, 2023),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20230512a.pdf.\n\n- 3 -\nSeveral efforts have been undertaken to provide this type of after-the-fact review.3 Much of the\nwork done to date has been helpful and has brought to light some uncomfortable realities about\nthe lead-up to the bank failures. But much of this work was prepared internally, by Federal\nReserve supervision staff, relying on a limited number of unattributed source interviews, and\ncompleted on an expedited timeframe with a limited scope. Although the report was published\nas a report of the Board of Governors, it was the product of one Board Member, and was not\nreviewed by the other members of the Board prior to its publication. Troublingly, other Board\nmembers were afforded no ability to contribute to the report’s content. There is a genuine\nquestion whether these efforts provide a sufficient accounting of what occurred. A\nsupplemental, independent review would help overcome the limitations of scope and timing of\nthese initial efforts, and address concerns about the impartiality and independence of the reviews.\nAdditional, independent reviews could add substantial value.4 These reviews should play\nan important role in informing the future path of supervision and regulation. The diagnosis of\nwhat went wrong can help inform necessary changes to supervision and regulation, the Fed’s\n3 See Government Accountability Office, Bank Regulation: Preliminary Review of Agency Actions Related to\nMarch 2023 Bank Failures GAO-23-106736 (Washington: Government Accountability Office, April 2023),\nhttps://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-23-106736.pdf; Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, FDIC’s Supervision of\nSignature Bank (Washington: Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, April 28, 2023),\nhttps://www.fdic.gov/news/press-releases/2023/pr23033a.pdf; Michael S.

Misperceptions and misunderstandings\nabout the root causes and related issues could result in changes that are not only unnecessary but\nresult in real harm to banks and their customers, to the financial system, and to the broader\neconomy.\nThe policy agenda—the set of reforms to supervision and regulation that are intended to\nremediate perceived shortcomings—has already begun to take shape, driven by the conclusions\nfrom the current set of limited reviews. And while I think some changes to supervision and\nregulation—such as a renewed examination focus on core banking risks like liquidity and\ninterest rate risk and a careful review of liquidity requirements and expectations—are warranted\nand helpful, I am concerned that other reforms may be based on faulty assumptions or\nincomplete information.\nIn particular, as the United States moves forward with implementing new international\ncapital standards, I am concerned that new capital requirements could unnecessarily hinder bank\nlending and diminish competition. We need to consider whether examiners have the appropriate\ntools and support to identify important issues and demand prompt remediation. Increasing\ncapital requirements simply does not get at this underlying concern about the effectiveness of\nsupervision.\nI have heard the argument that recent bank stress was the result of changes Congress\nmade several years ago to promote risk-based and tailored supervision, and a shift to a less\nassertive supervisory approach. I have not seen compelling evidence to support this. As I and\nmany of my colleagues have noted, the banking system today is strong and resilient, despite\n\n- 5 -\nrecent banking stress.5 This is in no small part due to the extensive reforms implemented after\nthe 2008 financial crisis. Banks today are much better capitalized, with substantially more\nliquidity, and are subject to a new range of supervisory tools that did not exist prior to 2008. The\nstrong foundation of the banking system results in banks that are well prepared to continue\nlending to their communities and supporting the broader economy even in stressful economic\ntimes. The underlying strength and resilience of the banking system also begs the question—\nwhat are the justifications for higher capital requirements?\nSupervisory Reform\nSupervisory reform proposals—particularly those that address a perceived retreat from\nrobust supervision over the last few years—could similarly be improved by additional review,\nanalysis, and discussion. The notion that any regulator, including the Federal Reserve, would\npurposefully promote a less assertive supervisory approach or try to limit the ability of examiners\nto identify issues and require remediation, is inconsistent with every experience of my nearly 14\nyears in the professional banking and regulatory environments—as a banker, a state bank\ncommissioner, and as a member of the Federal Reserve Board.6 Supervision has long been and\n5 See Joint Statement of Secretary of the Treasury Janet L.

While I have long been an advocate for greater\ntransparency in supervision, transparency should not be mistaken for leniency.7 When we\nprovide regulated institutions with clear expectations, and institutions fail to live up to those\nexpectations, examiners are better positioned to require prompt remediation. This approach\nresults in greater consistency and fairness and supports bank efforts to meet supervisory\nexpectations by facilitating open engagement with examiners.\nEchoes of the Past\nThe recent banking stress presents many of the same dynamics that led to the savings and\nloan crisis in the 1980s. Savings and loan institutions have been and continue to be important\nproviders of banking services in the United States, but during the 1980s many of these\ninstitutions failed. These institutions experienced a period of rapid asset growth, followed by\nrapidly rising interest rates that depressed the value of some of these assets and an erosion of\ncustomer confidence that led to deposit withdrawals.\nMany of these same dynamics created banking stress over the past few months, but the\nbuildup of these risks was foreseeable. The failure to identify and properly address the buildup\nof these risks was a substantial oversight for the management and supervisors of SVB and was\nJanuary 17, 2020) https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/quarles20200117a.pdf (“Through their\nengagement with banks, supervisors promote good risk management and thus help banks preemptively avert\nexcessive risk taking that would be costly and inefficient to correct after the fact. Where banks fall materially out of\ncompliance with a regulatory framework or act in a manner that poses a threat to their safety and soundness,\nsupervisors can act rapidly to address the failures that led to the lack of compliance or threat to safety and\nsoundness.”).\n7 See Michelle W.

It seems obvious that reform efforts should concentrate on\nsupervision programs and their effectiveness in identifying material risks to banking institutions.\nIt is incumbent on policymakers, as we revisit the regulatory framework, to pursue policy\ninformed by an impartial review of the facts. There are several areas where it is apparent that\nimprovements are needed—more effective communication among regulators and within the\nFederal Reserve System and Board’s supervisory program, greater transparency in supervisory\nexpectations with enforceable and timely consequences when expectations are not met, a focus\non the most relevant banking risks with a demonstrated nexus to bank stability and safety and\nsoundness, and a clearly articulated and implementable approach to the supervision of novel\nbanking activities.\nOne area in particular that requires attention is the current approach to the supervision of\nnovel banking activities, which leaves financial institutions in a supervisory void. While there\nhave been some efforts to provide guidance, there remains substantial uncertainty about the\npermissibility of and supervisory expectations for these activities, including banking as a service,\ndigital assets, and other novel activities. This leaves banks in the perilous position of relying on\ngeneral but non-binding statements by policymakers only to be criticized at some point in the\nfuture. The absence of a clear regulatory and supervisory approach creates the risk that\nregulators may determine novel activities are impermissible or impose new requirements and\nexpectations on these activities after the fact and, for some first movers, after significant\ninvestment. If our role is effective supervision and regulation, we must be willing to engage on\nboth the novel and traditional activities.\nThese changes in supervisory approach could help remediate current shortcomings and\nbuild capacity to embrace, evolve with, and respond to emerging risks. Failure to follow this\n\n- 8 -\napproach could have significant consequences for banks navigating higher interest rates while\nmeeting the credit and financial needs of their customers.\nResponsible Reform of the Regulatory Framework\nA review of bank regulation would be incomplete without a discussion of some basic\nprinciples for how the regulatory framework should evolve over time. In my view, responsible\nreforms reflect and incorporate a number of principles I have spoken about in the past: a\ncommitment to transparency, accountability, efficiency, and due process.8 These considerations\nare all important, but one overlooked aspect of responsible reform is the imperative of evaluating\nthe consequences of revisions. I view this as an extension of the need for efficiency. A broader\nconsideration of consequences does not assume the need for a particular reform, but instead takes\ninto account how a particular policy change would interact with the regulatory framework and\nthe impact on the broader financial system.\nIn thinking through regulatory reform, it is critical to understand the context.\nRequirements for capital, liquidity, resolution plans, stress testing, and supervisory approach are\nall elements of the regulatory framework. Each of these complements the others in support of\nsafety and soundness. So, when considering reforms, we must think about which tools are most\neffective and efficient in addressing identified shortcomings. I expect that we will find\nimprovements to supervision, revisions to liquidity requirements, or improvements to bank\n8 See, e.g., Michelle W. Bowman, “Independence, Predictability, and Tailoring in Banking Regulation and\nSupervision” (speech at the American Bankers Association Community Banking Conference, Orlando, Florida,\nFebruary 13, 2023) https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20230213a.pdf; Michelle W.\nBowman, “Large Bank Supervision and Regulation” (speech at the Institute of International Finance, Washington,\nD.C., September 30, 2022) https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20220930a.pdf;\nMichelle W.

I support providing\nsufficient time, of at least 120 days, for industry and stakeholders to review and provide\ncomment on the proposal.\nA key element of the rulemaking process is openness and transparency. In the past, the\nBoard has held public meetings to consider rules of significance. During the pandemic, the\nBoard largely departed from this practice. I believe we should return to having more public,\nopen meetings on matters of importance. Public Board meetings enable Board members to air\ntheir views and perspectives and raise potential concerns about how proposals will affect\neconomic activity and financial stability. Public meetings also promote accountability by\nallowing interested parties to hear the discussion and debate among policymakers on matters that\ndirectly affect them.\nAs we and other regulators around the world begin the process for implementing the final\nelements of the Basel III international capital framework, it is imperative that we understand\nboth the underlying goals of these changes and their practical impacts. When policymakers raise\ncapital requirements, the tendency can be to singularly focus on the perceived benefits—higher\ncapital implies greater resiliency of the banking system. But there’s a tradeoff. Resiliency, in\n9 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency, \"Agencies Reaffirm Commitment to Basel III Standards\" joint press release\n(September 9, 2022), https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20220909a.htm.\n\n- 10 -\nterms of higher capital, comes at a cost—namely, decreased credit availability and increased cost\nof credit in normal times—and can have broad impacts on banks, the broader financial system,\nand the economy.\nOne of the core objectives of the Basel capital standards is to promote a level playing\nfield internationally among banks subject to the standards. This objective can be challenging to\nevaluate—the business activities, structure, and broader financial landscape varies significantly\nfrom country to country, which complicates a horizontal evaluation of capital standards across\njurisdictions. And while Basel capital standards are negotiated and internationally agreed to\namong financial regulators, they also require implementation by each of the many jurisdictions.\nIn contrast, regulators in the United States have often adopted “gold-plating” for\ninternational Basel capital standards during implementation, layering on higher or expanded\nrequirements above those adopted internationally, including an added stress capital buffer, the\nenhanced supplementary leverage ratio, and the “method two” calculation methodology for the\nglobal systemically important bank (G-SIB) surcharge. Some gold-plating in the United States is\nthe product of Congressional directives, like the so-called Collins floor, which requires large\nU.S. banks to calculate their capital requirements using multiple methodologies and apply the\none resulting in higher aggregate capital requirements. This is not an indictment of the robust\ncapital standards we have in the United States today, but this U.S. gold-plating is the current\nbaseline as we consider the impact of future capital changes.\nWhile some deviation in standards is to be expected during local implementation of\ninternational capital requirements, policymakers should not ignore the underlying goal of\npromoting international consistency and parity. We often see deviations across jurisdictions to\nadjust to local market conditions and for other reasons, often by including extended phase-in\n\n- 11 -\nperiods or reducing the size of capital increases. Gold-plating U.S. standards could further\nexacerbate the existing differences in international capital standards. We should be mindful of\nhow such jurisdiction-specific deviations could impact international banking activities and cross-\nborder competition. While the policy objective in implementing capital standards is not to\ndisadvantage U.S. banks in non-U.S. markets, or to give an advantage to foreign banks operating\nin the United States, if international capital standards present substantial variability across\njurisdictions, they could have detrimental consequences.\nNon-Bank Financial Services Firms\nThe effects of capital, however, extend well beyond the impact on international\ncompetition, particularly in light of the growing role of non-bank companies in financial\nservices, the so-called shadow banking system. Non-bank competitors, who often already have a\npricing advantage, compete in many of the same markets as banks without the same regulatory\nexpectations. Rising bank capital requirements may exacerbate the competitive dynamics that\nresult in advantages to non-bank competitors and push additional financial activity out of the\nregulated banking system. This shift—while possibly leaving a stronger and more resilient\nbanking system—could create a financial system in which banks simply can’t compete in a cost-\neffective manner. The shadow banking system has many connections to the regulated banking\nsystem. Even the resiliency of a smaller, safer banking system could prove illusory when we\nlook deeper into the connections between banks and non-banks, for example, with subscription\nlines of credit supporting the private credit industry, and the indirect bank-financing of non-bank\nmortgage lending activities through traditional bank credit lines.\n\n- 12 -\nHow much and what types of financial activity should exist inside versus outside the\nregulated financial sector? We should be aware that making banks safer and sounder by pushing\nactivity and risk to the shadow banking system may not make the broader financial system safer.\nRegulatory Influence on Banking Products and Services and the Broader Banking System\nRegulation has the power to dramatically reshape banking by affecting which products\nand services banks offer, the price of financial services, and the competitive landscape.\nRegulation can affect whether certain banks will be insulated from competition, ensconcing too-\nbig-to-fail institutions atop the banking system and reducing competition and the availability of\nbanking services in certain product markets and geographies. A thorough consideration of these\ndynamics should be a key element of regulatory reform.\nAvailability of Products\nBeyond the effects of capital on competition with foreign firms and non-banks, capital\nrequirements can also have a direct impact on bank willingness and ability to engage in core\nbanking activities. Banks pursue business strategies and offer products not despite capital\nrequirements, but with the full knowledge and understanding of the capital allocations required\nto engage in that activity. Increasing capital requirements can result in banks retreating from\ncertain activities. The net result of a pullback could be higher costs due to the pass-through of\nhigher regulatory requirements, or less availability of certain products and services for\nconsumers. This could also increase concentration risks among competitors that remain in\ncertain product markets.\nPolicymakers should fully consider these real-world consequences and engage in a\ntransparent and public discussion of the pros and cons of options for capital reform. Banking\nregulatory and supervisory policy—including capital policy—should be focused on promoting a\n\n- 13 -\nsafe and sound banking system. I am concerned about the adoption of reforms that attempt to\nsteer banks toward or away from business activities. Bank regulators are not and should not be\nin the business of making capital allocation decisions regarding bank lending. In the same way,\nbank regulators should also not direct bank business strategy about the products and services\noffered by establishing capital requirements that are disproportionate to risk.\nRegulatory Reform and the Banking Landscape\nA broader concern about regulatory policy, of which capital requirements are an\nimportant component, is the impact on the broader banking landscape. A regulator’s initial\nreaction to a bank failure may be to increase capital costs, focusing on the impact of increased\ncapital on the failed bank and limiting consideration of that impact to the point of the failure. In\nthat narrow test sample, there is no doubt that more capital is preferable and would improve\nsolvency. But broader regulatory reform does not impact only one bank, or impact only banks\nexperiencing significant banking stress, or only banks that have a history of mismanagement.\nBroad-based changes can affect the incentives of the various tiers of firms. For example,\nflattening regulatory requirements—imposing the same high bar on all firms over a certain\nsize—at first blush seems like it would improve financial resiliency. But we should not assume\nthat the banking system would remain static in response to uniform higher regulatory standards\nacross institutions of dramatically different sizes, complexity, business models, and risk.\nEliminating banking standards tailored for these characteristics would create intense\npressure on the smaller end of that spectrum to consolidate, as smaller banks struggle to adapt to\nregulation ill-suited for their size or complexity, applying instead regulations designed for a\nG-SIB. My intuition is that this type of approach could become a self-fulfilling prophecy, as\nbanks regulated like G-SIBs would have strong incentives to grow or merge, to help develop\n\n- 14 -\neconomies of scale that come with larger size. Instead of addressing the problem of too-big-to-\nfail banks, regulation could become a tool that insulates too-big-to-fail banks from competition\nfrom smaller competitors.\nFundamentally, this raises the question of the ongoing role of tailoring in supervision and\nregulation. The concept of tailoring—of aligning supervision and regulation with bank risk and\ncomplexity, alternatively called risk-based supervision—has recently come under threat of being\neroded through regulatory reform efforts in the United States.10 The tailoring approach has long\nbeen a feature of regulation and supervision in the United States, and I think it provides a useful\nframework for how to think about responsible approaches to regulatory reform.\nThe Potential Impact of Risk-Insensitive Regulatory Reform on Banks and Competition\nWhat are the consequences of deviating from risk-based supervision and tailoring, when\nwe apply standards designed for larger and more complex firms to smaller and simpler firms?\nAs an academic matter, and operating in a vacuum, higher standards imply that banks get\nsafer; they hold more capital, face increased scrutiny by examiners, and are subjected to higher\nstandards on all aspects of their business. But we need to consider whether this is truly\nnecessary, and if implemented, what would be the practical outcome?\nUnder the weight of overly burdensome or redundant regulation, the business models of\nsome banks may simply cease to be viable. Many banks would be unable to operate under the\nweight of increased compliance costs. Of course, the banking system cannot tolerate unlimited\nrisk, and regulatory policy bears within it the choice about how much risk is appropriate within\n10 See, Michelle W. Bowman, “Statement on Third Party Risk Management Guidance” (June 6, 2023),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bowman-statement-20230606.htm (“[O]ne size fits all\nregulatory expectations for banks, including small banks, and failing to appropriately consider and mitigate the\ncompliance and implementation burden imposed on these small banks, signals a concerning trend in our regulatory\napproach.”).\n\n- 15 -\nthe banking system. While conservatism, and ensuring safety and soundness, may be appropriate\nto some degree, at a certain point regulatory requirements become unmoored from risk and force\ngood banks out of the market.\nThe consequences of excessive and overlapping regulations will inevitably be forced\nconsolidation and reduced consumer choice, especially in underserved banking markets. Even in\nthe absence of consolidation, banks always face choices in responding to regulation, and may\npare back on lending to small businesses, or forfeit their banking charter and choose to operate\ninstead within the nonbank sector. Overregulation in trading book capital requirements could\nincrease the cost of market-making—impacting the liquidity of debt and equity markets—and\nincrease the cost of market funding. We cannot understate the potential impacts. Communities\noften fund local infrastructure projects by issuing municipal bonds in public debt markets. If this\nfunding source evaporates, or becomes more expensive, that can have severe consequences for\nthese communities. Banking is not risk-free, and the goal of the regulatory framework is to\nsupport the safe and sound operation of banks, not to eliminate risk altogether.\nIf one is concerned about those who are underserved in the current market, it is necessary\nto understand that different sizes of banks often meet the specific banking needs of unique\ncommunities and customers in geographic areas or within product lines that may not provide a\nvariety of options. Smaller banks support their communities in unique ways, and often have\ndeeper community ties and commitments than out-of-market competitors without direct\nrelationships to their community. There seems to be a misperception by some—based solely on\nthe aggregate number of banks in the United States—that there are simply too many bank\ncharters competing for too little business. It is difficult to know what the optimum number of\n\n- 16 -\nbanks in the banking system may be, but it is important to recognize that the number of charters\ndoes not tell the whole story.\nA real concern is whether regulatory reform could have the unintended consequence of\nhollowing out the mid-sized tier of banks, effectively preventing the largest banks from facing\nnew competition. If we believe in the virtue of competition as a way to spur innovation and\nimprove customer choice, we need to be cautious about less risk-sensitive regulatory and\nsupervisory expectations. If we were to apply some of the same heightened standards for banks\nwith $50 billion or $100 billion in assets as we have for banks with trillions of dollars in assets,\nthis inevitably would create pressure to merge to create economies of scale to lessen the cost of\nregulatory compliance, resulting in further bank consolidation. By doing so, we would eliminate\nthe current dynamic banking system that incorporates institutions regulated in tiers. We would\nprevent the next large bank from growing to be a viable competitor, and essentially permanently\nand officially designate a handful of banks as “too big to fail,” despite years of policymaker\nefforts fighting against the perceived government guarantee of only the largest banks. Our goal\nshould not be to create a “barbell” of banking institutions based on size, with a small number of\ntoo-big-to-fail banks at the large end of the spectrum, and some smaller community banks at the\nlow end.\nBank regulation is most effective when it adapts to changing economic conditions,\nchanging business activities and models, and emerging risks. But policymakers should not be\nshortsighted about the potential consequences of policy changes, consequences that may have\nlong-term effects on the contours of the banking system. Driving activity out of banks into the\nshadow banking system does not make the financial system safer, it simply makes banks less\ncompetitive, and increases economic and financial stability risks. As we consider the evolution\n\n- 17 -\nof the financial system, and the current and future role of banks within it, a renewed focus on\nunintended consequences is a particularly important topic to consider and would ensure that our\nactions support resiliency in the global financial system.\nClosing Thoughts\nMy remarks today should not be interpreted as a categorical rejection of reform efforts.\nSome reform efforts—to both regulation and supervision—are a natural part of the evolution of\nthe regulatory framework, and some would address weaknesses revealed by the recent bank\nfailures. There is room to improve bank supervision for large banks, particularly those in\nCategory IV of the U.S. tailoring framework, and we need to evaluate whether our regulations\ncould have inadvertently contributed to stress in the banking system.11 But these reform efforts\nshould be both informed by an impartial and independent review of what led to the failures and\nhealthy public debate, which should take into account the unintended consequences of reform.\nWe must be circumspect about what went wrong, deliberate about what to fix, and cognizant of\nunintended consequences. It is imperative that we preserve a dynamic banking sector, with\nbanks of all sizes that serve the needs of their unique customers wherever they are located.\nIt is abundantly clear that regulatory and supervisory reform is on the way. But we\nshould ensure that changes ultimately promote a safe and sound banking system. That system\nshould serve the needs of customers and support the broader economy.\n11 See 12 CFR 252.5(e) (defining a Category IV banking organization).",

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\n2020 Economic Forecast Breakfast\nHome Builders Association of Greater Kansas City\nKansas City, Missouri\nJanuary 16, 2020\n\nFew sectors are as central to the success of our economy and the lives of\nAmerican families as housing. If we include the amount families spend on shelter each\nmonth as well as the construction of new houses and apartments, housing generates about\n15 cents out of every dollar of economic activity. As homebuilders, you set the\nfoundation that supports the work of architects, bankers, electricians, carpenters,\nplumbers, furniture makers, and many others. In our time together today, I’d like to\ndiscuss the outlook for housing at the national level and also look at the labor force and\ncredit challenges facing your industry.1\nLet me start with just a few words about the overall economic picture. I’m\npleased to say that the U.S. economy is currently in a good place, and the baseline\noutlook of participants on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is for continued\nmoderate growth in gross domestic product (GDP) over the next few years.\nUnemployment is the lowest it has been in 50 years, and FOMC participants expect it to\nremain low. Inflation has been muted and is expected to rise gradually to the FOMC’s\n2 percent objective.\nOne of the most remarkable features of the current economic expansion has been\nthe vitality and resilience of the U.S. job market. More than 22 million jobs have been\ncreated since the low point for employment at the end of the last downturn, and the pace\nof job gains has been amazingly consistent. Until this expansion, even in good times,\nscarcely a year went by without at least one month when payrolls shrank. Yet during the\npast 10 years, we haven’t had a single month with a decline in the overall number of jobs.\nI should note that I would not necessarily consider a single month of job losses as saying\n1 These remarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nmuch about the direction of the economy. But the unbroken string of job gains that we\nhave experienced during this recovery highlights how our economy has kept humming\nalong during this past decade, weathering the occasional lull. Let me also add here that,\nas good as the national numbers for the job market look, things seem even better here in\nthe Kansas City area, where job growth has been steady and the unemployment rate has\nconsistently run around 1 percentage point below the national average—at last count, it\nwas 2.8 percent.\nLet me now turn to the main topic of my talk today. My colleagues and I at the\nFederal Reserve pay close attention to developments in the housing sector, in part\nbecause it has historically been such an important driver of economic growth. In the\nnational economic data, the part of GDP that includes homebuilding activity is referred to\nas residential fixed investment. This measure summarizes a variety of housing-related\nactivities, including spending on the construction of new single-family and multifamily\nstructures, residential remodeling, real estate brokers’ fees, and a few other smaller\ncomponents.\nIf we look at the growth of residential fixed investment in periods since World\nWar II that are defined as economic expansions, we see that this broad category has\nincreased at an average rate of around 7 percent per year, faster than the roughly\n4 percent pace of GDP growth in those same periods. And, as many of you know from\nexperience, the opposite is true as well—that housing activity tends to experience\nrelatively large declines in economic downturns. In particular, residential fixed\ninvestment declined an average of about 15 percent annually during periods defined as\n\n- 3 -\nrecessions, compared with an average annual rate of decline in GDP of just 2 percent in\nthose same periods.\nThese numbers illustrate that residential fixed investment is particularly sensitive\nto where we are in the business cycle. The strong economy we are experiencing now has\nan obvious upside for the housing sector: A robust job market translates into higher\nincomes, greater confidence, and more people looking to buy a new home or considering\nwhether to make a change from their current home.\nYet even though the financial crisis and the bursting of the real estate bubble\noccurred more than a decade ago, all of us here are no doubt aware of the lasting imprint\nthat those developments left on the housing market. On an annual basis, both new and\nexisting home sales did not increase again until 2012, and they remained at modest levels\nfor several years thereafter. Given the large and persistent inventory overhang of unsold\nhomes in the aftermath of the crisis, the construction of new homes was also sluggish for\nmany years into the recovery.\nPart of the weak recovery in the housing market during the first few years of this\nexpansion can be traced to extremely tight mortgage credit conditions. Despite the fact\nthat the Fed slashed interest rates and kept them low for many years, many households\nwere underwater on their existing mortgages, with more owed on their housing than their\nhomes were worth, while others were unable to obtain a loan to finance a new purchase.\nAs a result, housing demand remained very weak for an extended period.\nAnother factor that played a role in the slow housing recovery was the low rate of\nhousehold formation, which dropped significantly during the recession and remained low\nfor most of the following decade. Much of this drop was due to a larger share of young\n\n- 4 -\npeople continuing to live with their parents, though this is not unusual when the economy\nis weak and jobs are hard to find.2\nIn the past few years, though, we have seen some encouraging signs that the\nbroader strength in the economy has eased these housing market headwinds. Along with\nongoing improvements in households’ balance sheet conditions, mortgage credit\nconditions appear to be less of a constraint for creditworthy borrowers. I should add that\nhousing activity is also being supported by interest rates that remain quite low by\nhistorical standards, with the fixed rate charged on a 30-year mortgage now below\n4 percent, substantially lower than the rates observed just before the last recession. As\nyou well know, activity in the housing sector is highly sensitive to interest rates and other\nfactors that have a powerful effect on the overall cost of owning a home.\nIn addition, amid the strong job market of the past few years, we have seen a rise\nin the rate at which young adults are moving out of their family homes and forming\nhouseholds of their own. Even so, millions of young adults are still living with their\nparents who likely wouldn’t have been before the crisis. While their reasons for doing so\nare probably varied, there is potential for many more individuals to shift back to forming\nnew households.\nAlthough the effects may evolve slowly, the higher rate of household formation\nwill eventually result in higher demand for housing and encourage further increases in\nhomebuilding. Home sales have been rising in recent years, the percentage of homes that\nare vacant has been falling, and inventories of both new and existing homes for sale have\n2 See, for example, Aditya Aladangady, Laura Feiveson, and Andrew Paciorek (2019), “Living at Home\nAin’t Such a Drag (on Spending): Young Adults’ Spending in and out of Their Parents’ Home,” FEDS\nNotes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, February 5),\nhttps://doi.org/10.17016/2380-7172.2301.\n\n- 5 -\ndrifted back down to relatively low levels. In fact, at this point, the residential real estate\nmarket is quite tight in some areas of the country and by enough that I have heard that the\nvolume of home sales is being restricted by the low inventory of homes on the market.\nThe most recent housing data have been encouraging: Both new and existing\nhome sales moved up strongly in the second half of 2019, and traffic of prospective\nbuyers in new homes for sale and expected sales within the next six months have\napproached all-time highs. Permits for new residential construction, which had been\nsluggish early last year, recently moved up to highs for this expansion. In all, the\nnational indicators suggest a positive growth outlook for the housing sector over the next\nseveral quarters.\nBefore I conclude, I’d like to address two challenges currently facing the housing\nsector. The first relates to the difficulties that some employers face, including\nhomebuilders, in finding and retaining qualified and skilled workers. To provide some\ncontext, the national data show that the unemployment rate in the private construction\nindustry is now well below the rate we observed in the early 2000s, a time when the\nhousing market was booming. In addition, the ratio of job vacancies to unemployment in\nthe construction industry—a measure of labor market strength—shot up to historic highs\nat the end of 2018, and it has remained near those levels. These indicators confirm what I\nhave been hearing from construction industry employers during my visits to different\nparts of the country—it’s extremely difficult to find and hire workers, skilled or\notherwise.\nIn response to these hiring-related challenges, we have seen a renewed and broad\nfocus on workforce development initiatives by the public and private sector, a\n\n- 6 -\ndevelopment we have followed closely at the Federal Reserve. I recently heard a very\nencouraging presentation from representatives of vocational training organizations about\nprogress they are making in connecting young adults, students, and high school grads\nwith skilled trades. I am hopeful that these efforts, along with a continued strong job\nmarket, will encourage more people to join—or, in some cases, rejoin—the construction\ntrades.\nThe second challenge I want to highlight relates to the declining presence of\ncommunity banks in the consumer real estate mortgage market. As regulatory burdens\nhave risen, many community banks have significantly scaled back their lending or exited\nthe mortgage market altogether. These developments concern me for several reasons.\nHome mortgage lending has traditionally been a significant business for smaller banks,\nand the decline in this business threatens a part of the banking industry that plays a\ncrucial role in communities. Bankers who are present and active in their communities\nknow and understand their customers and the local market better than lenders outside the\narea. Because of their local knowledge and customer relationships, they are often more\nwilling to help troubled borrowers work their way through difficult times.\nThese two challenges notwithstanding, I remain optimistic about the outlook for\nhousing. I expect construction to continue advancing to meet the underlying expansion in\nhousing demand from population growth and the strong economy. In addition, low\ninterest rates will continue to be a key factor supporting growth in housing activity. As\nreported in the latest Summary of Economic Projections, released in December, most\nFOMC participants see the current target range for the federal funds rate as likely to\n\n- 7 -\nremain appropriate this year as long as incoming information remains broadly consistent\nwith the economic outlook I described earlier.\nIn closing, let me say that I would also appreciate hearing what is on your minds.\nAs a policymaker, I particularly value opportunities to travel outside of Washington to\nhear your perspectives on the national and local economies. These conversations\nimprove our work at the Fed by helping us make better-informed decisions.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n9:45 a.m. EDT\nMay 3, 2024\nBrief Remarks on the Economy and Monetary Policy\nRemarks by\nMichelle W. Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nMassachusetts Bankers Association Annual Convention\nKey Biscayne, Florida\nMay 3, 2024\n\n- 1 -\nI would like to thank the Massachusetts Bankers Association for the invitation to meet\nwith you today.1 One of the most enjoyable and informative aspects of my role is the time I\nspend with bankers, listening to issues that are important to you and that affect you and your\ncustomers. Banks play a key role in supporting economic growth and lending to serve their\ncustomers and communities, which is an indispensable role in the U.S. economy. Conversations\nsuch as ours today help inform my work at the Federal Reserve Board—for my understanding of\nboth the broader U.S. economy and the banking regulatory and supervisory environment.\nBefore our conversation, I would like to briefly touch on the economy and monetary\npolicy.\nOver the past two years, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has significantly\ntightened the stance of monetary policy to address high inflation. At our meeting earlier this\nweek, the FOMC voted to continue to hold the federal funds rate target range at 5-1/4 to\n5-1/2 percent and to continue to reduce the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings.\nAfter seeing considerable progress on slowing inflation last year, we have not seen\nfurther progress over the first quarter of this year. The 12-month measures of total and core\npersonal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation have moved roughly sideways since\nDecember and remained elevated at 2.7 percent and 2.8 percent, respectively, in March. With\nannualized 3-month core PCE inflation jumping to 4.4 percent in March, well above average\ninflation in the second half of last year, I expect inflation to remain elevated for some time. The\nrecent pickup seems to be evident across many goods and services categories, suggesting that\ninflation was temporarily lower in the latter half of last year. Prices continue to be much higher\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nthan before the pandemic, which is weighing on consumer sentiment. Inflation has hit lower-\nincome households hardest since food, energy, and housing services price increases far outpaced\noverall inflation throughout this episode.\nEconomic activity increased at a strong pace last year and has maintained momentum\nover the first three months of this year. Although first-quarter growth in gross domestic product\nwas temporarily dampened by volatile categories, such as inventories and net exports, consumer\nspending on services remained robust, and residential activity and business investment in\nequipment and intangibles strengthened. Payroll employment has increased at a strong pace\nthrough April this year, partly reflecting increased immigrant labor supply. Although we had\nseen signs of the labor market coming into better balance, recent employment reports show a\ncontinued tight labor market, with the unemployment rate remaining below 4 percent, and the\nnumber of job openings relative to unemployed workers is still above its pre-pandemic level.\nLast year, the average pace of job gains slowed, and the labor force participation rate rose. In\nrecent months, however, job growth has rebounded, and labor force participation has flattened\nout around its peak from last year, suggesting there has not been further improvement in labor\nsupply along this margin, as labor force participation among those aged 55 and older has been\npersistently low.\nAt its current setting, our monetary policy stance appears to be restrictive, and I will\ncontinue to monitor the incoming data to assess whether monetary policy is sufficiently\nrestrictive to bring inflation down to our target. As I’ve noted recently, my baseline outlook\ncontinues to be that inflation will decline further with the policy rate held steady, but I still see a\nnumber of upside inflation risks that affect my outlook.\n\n- 3 -\nFirst, much of the progress on inflation last year was due to supply-side improvements,\nincluding easing of supply chain constraints; increases in the number of available workers, due in\npart to immigration; and lower energy prices. It is unclear whether further supply-side\nimprovements will continue to lower inflation. Geopolitical developments could also pose\nupside risks to inflation, including the risk that spillovers from regional conflicts could disrupt\nglobal supply chains, putting additional upward pressure on food, energy, and commodity prices.\nThere is also the risk that the loosening in financial conditions since late last year and additional\nfiscal stimulus could add momentum to demand, stalling any further progress or even causing\ninflation to reaccelerate.\nFinally, there is a risk that strong consumer demand for services, increased immigration,\nand continued labor market tightness could lead to persistently high core services inflation.\nGiven the current low inventory of affordable housing, the inflow of new immigrants to some\ngeographic areas could result in upward pressure on rents, as additional housing supply may take\ntime to materialize. Wage growth has remained at an elevated rate of between 4 and 5 percent,\nstill higher than the pace consistent with our 2 percent inflation goal given trend productivity\ngrowth.\nIn light of these risks, and the general uncertainty regarding the economic outlook, I will\ncontinue to watch the data closely as I assess the appropriate path of monetary policy. The\nfrequency and extent of data revisions over the past few years make the task of assessing the\ncurrent state of the economy as well as predicting how the economy will evolve even more\nchallenging, and I will remain cautious in my approach to considering future changes in the\nstance of policy.\n\n- 4 -\nIt is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course. My colleagues and I\nwill make our decisions at each FOMC meeting based on the incoming data and the implications\nfor and risks to the outlook. While the current stance of monetary policy appears to be at a\nrestrictive level, I remain willing to raise the federal funds rate at a future meeting should the\nincoming data indicate that progress on inflation has stalled or reversed. Restoring price stability\nis essential for achieving maximum employment over the longer run.\nThank you, and I look forward to our conversation.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n4:00 p.m. EDT (1:00 p.m. PDT)\nApril 11, 2019\nCommunity Banking in the Age of Innovation\nRemarks by\nMichelle W. Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\n“Fed Family” Luncheon\nat the\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nSan Francisco, California\nApril 11, 2019\n\nToday I would like to share a few observations on innovation as it relates to the business\nof community banking. In particular, I will focus on opportunities for community banks to\ninnovate through collaboration with fintech firms. I’ll also discuss the role our regulatory\nstructure plays in those relationships.1\nCommunity banks, like just about every other industry, are learning to adapt to a new\nworld of rapid innovation and shifting consumer expectations. Consider the personal loan\nmarket. TransUnion estimates that, about a decade ago, fintech lenders generated less than 1\npercent of personal loans.2 Today, fintech firms originate a larger share of personal loans than\nbanks.3 This is not all bad news for banks, though. And we should not simply assume that gains\nby fintech lenders are necessarily at the expense of banks. A large share of fintech lending is\nactually originated by bank partners working with fintech firms. Similarly, the funds that flow\nbetween a fintech lender and borrowers almost always travel across the payment services of a\nbank. So, while the changes in the market pose potential competitive threats to banks, the\nchanges also raise potential new opportunities for banks. This is especially true for community\nbanks, which are frequently the banks working most closely with fintech lenders.\n1 These remarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve Board or\nthe Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 TransUnion, “FinTechs Taking Larger Share of Personal Loan Market While Increasing Portfolio Risk-Return\nPerformance,” press release, November 2, 2017, https://newsroom.transunion.com/\nfintechs-taking-larger-share-of-personal-loan-market-while-increasing-portfolio-risk-return-performance/.\n3 TransUnion, “Fact versus Fiction: Fintech Lenders,” (2017) (finding that fintech firms and banks originate 38\npercent and 28 percent of personal loans, respectively). See also Kate Rooney, “Fintechs help boost US personal\nloan surge to a record $138 billion,” CNBC, February 24, 2019, https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/21/personal-loans-\nsurge-to-a-record-138-billion-in-us-as-fintechs-lead-new-lending-charge.html.\n\n- 2 -\nCompetition or collaboration?\nNot too long ago commentators were looking at the impact of fintech on community\nbanking as a zero-sum game. In fact, many wondered whether fintech firms would put\ncommunity banks out of business.4 Recent surveys show how much the discussion has evolved.\nRather than fear fintech, more and more community bankers are trying to determine how to\nadjust their businesses to make the best use of new technologies. For example, in the 2018\nSurvey of Community Banks by the Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS), small banks\nalmost universally agreed that fintech firms are not currently their primary competitor.5 These\nfindings are consistent with data from the 2018 Small Business Lending Survey by the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).6 In contrast, almost half of large banks identified fintech\nfirms as frequent competitors. The FDIC opined that this was likely because large banks, like\nfintech firms, rely heavily on data and automated technology when making loans. A much lower\npercentage of small banks—only about 10 percent—saw fintech firms as current competitors. As\nI’ll discuss later, it’s likely that the relationship-driven nature of community bank business\nmodels helps insulate these banks from fintech competitors.\n4 See, for example, Kate Rooney, “Small banks you’ve never heard of are quietly enabling the tech takeover of the\nfinancial industry,” CNBC, February 15, 2019, https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/15/small-banks-youve-never-heard-\nof-quietly-power-the-booming-fintech-industry--.html.\n5 The primary exception was survey responses regarding mortgage lending, where just under 5 percent of\nrespondents identified fintech firms as a primary source of competition. See CSBS Community Bank Survey,\n“Community Banking in the 21st Century” (paper presented at the Sixth Annual Community Banking Research and\nPolicy Conference, St. Louis, MO, October 3-4, 2018),\nhttps://www.communitybanking.org/~/media/files/publication/cb21pub_2018_final.pdf. See also Allen N. Berger,\nWilliam Goulding, Tara Rice, “Do small businesses still prefer community banks?,” Journal of Banking & Finance\n44 (July 2014): 264-278 (finding that small banks may have less strong relationships with small businesses,\npotentially due to changes in lending technologies and deregulation of the banking industry).\n6 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, FDIC Small Business Lending Survey (Washington: FDIC, 2018),\nhttps://www.fdic.gov/bank/historical/sbls/full-survey.pdf.\n\n- 3 -\nThe most interesting possibilities emerged in survey responses about small banks\nworking together with fintech firms as partners. The community bank respondents to the CSBS\nsurvey included numerous anecdotes and observations about the important opportunities fintech\noffered community banks to diversify their products, extend their reach, and offer more efficient\nservices for their customers.7\nIndeed, fintech firms may complement the activities of community banks well. For\nexample, while small businesses may value the relationships that local bankers offer, they don’t\nlike the lengthy process of filling out loan applications, waiting for credit decisions, and the time\nit takes small banks to make funds available.8 Those are precisely the types of issues that data-\ndriven, smartphone-based fintech firms are good at addressing.9\nAt the same time, community banks’ particular advantages, mainly their strong\nrelationships with their small business customers, would be difficult for smartphone-based\nfintech apps to replicate. Let me give you an example: During last year’s community bank\nresearch conference held at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis,10 a community bank based in\nSanta Barbara described the harrowing months around the end of 2017. As you know all too\nwell, a massive wildfire, followed by a deadly series of mudslides, caused devastating damage\n7 One Missouri bank described how it uses new technologies (and partnerships) to be one of the first banks in its\nmarket to offer video banking services. See also CSBS Community Bank Survey in note 5.\n8 See, for example, Federal Reserve Banks of Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, Kansas City,\nMinneapolis, New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, St. Louis, San Francisco, Small Business Credit Survey: Report\non Employer Firms (Federal Reserve System, 2017),\nhttps://www.fedsmallbusiness.org/medialibrary/fedsmallbusiness/files/2018/sbcs-employer-firms-report.pdf.\n9 For example, focus group participants were limited to small businesses with 1 to 20 employees, excluding owners,\nand at least $200,000 but less than $2 million in revenue. See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,\nBrowsing to Borrow: “Mom & Pop” Small Business Perspectives on Online Lenders (Washington: Board of\nGovernors, June 2018), https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/2018-small-business-lending.pdf.\n10 The annual conference is jointly-sponsored by the Federal Reserve System, the Conference of State Bank\nSupervisors, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.\n\n- 4 -\nand five emergency evacuations of Montecito, California.11 Within 24 hours of the wildfires and\nmudslides, the community bank declared an emergency and began executing its disaster response\nstrategy.12 The bank used a wide range of communication channels, from Facebook to text\nmessaging, to keep in touch with its employees and its customers. It created a disaster assistance\npackage for personal and small business borrowers. The bank offered new lines of credit\n(including a 24-hour turnaround on small business lines). It made payment deferrals on already-\nexisting loans and provided free safe deposit boxes. The bank even delivered more than 15,000\nwater bottles and offered more than 1,500 respirators for local residents at its branches.\nSmall businesses value that level of commitment to local customers. And they recognize\nthe benefits of working with local community banks that understand their regions and businesses.\nThe relationship-based nature of community bank lending helps small businesses that often lack\nthe detailed balance sheets or detailed income statements required by larger banks.13 Even when\nsmall businesses do have the right paperwork, large banks are still less likely to engage in\nlending at small bank levels. That’s because the transaction costs for underwriting a $100,000\nloan are comparable to a $1 million loan. None of this is lost on small businesses, which,\naccording to the Federal Reserve’s Small Business Credit Survey, continue to express greater\nsatisfaction with small banks compared to both big banks and fintech lenders.14\n11 See Lou Whiteman, “How the ‘Best Banks’ handle the wrath of Mother Nature,” American Banker, September 4,\n2018), https://www.americanbanker.com/news/how-the-best-banks-handle-the-wrath-of-mother-nature. See also\nBrooke Holland, “In Case of Emergency, Planning Pays Off for Montecito Bank & Trust After Fire and Debris\nFlows,” Noozhawk, July 29, 2018,\nhttps://www.noozhawk.com/article/montecito_bank_and_trust_emergency_preparedness_20180729.\n12 The bank had finalized its disaster relief strategy in 2016, anticipating potential roadway closures and shutdowns\nfrom the predicted El Niño season.\n13 See, for example, Karen Gordon Mills and Brayden McCarthy, “The State of Small Business Lending: Credit\nAccess during the Recovery and How Technology May Change the Game,” Harvard Business School Working\nPaper 15-004 (Cambridge: Harvard Business School, July 2014),\nhttp://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/15-004_09b1bf8b-eb2a-4e63-9c4e-0374f770856f.pdf.\n14 Results show net satisfaction scores for small banks as 73 percent, large banks as 49 percent, and online lenders as\n35 percent. See Small Business Credit Survey: Report on Employer Firms in note 8.\n\n- 5 -\nThis is not to say that the community banks’ advantages cannot be challenged by\ntechnology. Many fintech firms are currently looking to leverage their deep ties with other\naspects of small businesses—their payment processing services or accounting software, for\ninstance—to build data-driven lending products that are tied to the day-to-day operations of\nsmall businesses. Fintech lenders can provide easy-to-use online applications, rapid loan\ndecisionmaking, and customer service that helps bring low cost, automated decisionmaking to\nthe small loan segment that was previously left to community banks.\nPartnering with a fintech firm can offer a community bank the best of both worlds. The\nbank can take advantage of new technology and all the efficiencies that come with it as an\nextension of the banks’ relationship-banking model. In a sense, fintech is just the latest evolution\nof a long history of community banks leveraging technology to provide financial services. I’m\nthinking here of technologies, such as ATMs, mobile banking, and remote deposit capture.15 For\ntheir part, community banks offer potential fintech partners a consumer-first approach to\nbusiness and a number of advantages: deposit insurance and liquidity; a stable customer base;\ncredibility in a local community; and settlement and compliance services.16 I thought one\nresponse to the CSBS survey said it best. The banker wrote, “[T]he future of consumer banking\nseems to be as a participant in the ecosystem of lifestyle technological solutions rather than as a\nstandalone banking relationship.” The problem is, as the banker continued, “[I]t’s hard to\nimagine what exactly that will look like and how it will change the banking business model.”17\n15 See, for example, The Independent Community Bankers of America, Fintech Strategy Roadmap for Community\nBanks (Washington: The Independent Community Bankers of America, March 2018),\nhttps://www.icba.org/docs/default-source/icba/icba-fintech-strategy-roadmap-(03-12-16).pdf?sfvrsn=6a0e7117_4.\n16 Fintech Strategy Roadmap.\n17 See CSBS Community Bank Survey in note 5.\n\n- 6 -\nWhat can the Federal Reserve do to foster prudent community bank innovation?\nI believe that if a bank has not started thinking about how innovation may impact its\nbusiness, it is very late to the game. This does not mean that every bank has to run out this\nafternoon and partner with a fintech firm—there may be all kinds of thoughtful reasons not to\nengage with them. What matters is that banks, particularly community banks, have gone through\nthe process of thinking about the relevant issues.18\nBut there are many questions about how community banks are adjusting to the changing\nenvironment. For instance, about 40 percent of community banks say that they do not currently\noffer online loan applications and have no immediate plans to do so.19 That 40 percent may\nrepresent bankers who have not gone through the process of thinking about the way innovation\nimpacts their business. But it could just as easily include bankers who have looked at the issue\ncarefully and concluded that online loan applications do not fit within their business model. Most\nimportantly, though, it may indicate that some community banks may feel that they are simply\nnot able to leverage new technology.\nMost small banks are dependent on partnerships with third parties to make use of new\ntechnologies.20 I am concerned that some banks are not innovating because they feel they lack\nthe ability to navigate the complex regulatory and compliance issues that may arise. Among\n18 The National Risk Committee at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) warns that, “[f]ailure to\nappropriately consider innovation and the responsible adoption of technology could pose strategic risk to some\nbanks.” See also Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Semiannual Risk Perspective (Washington: OCC, Fall\n2018), https://www.occ.gov/publications/publications-by-type/semiannual-risk-perspective/pub-semiannual-risk-\nperspective-fall-2018.pdf.\nThe OCC has long raised concerns that the strategic risks are particularly acute for community banks as compared to\nlarge banks that have the resources to fund innovation labs or even purchase mature fintech firms. See, for example,\nLalita Clozel, “OCC’s Curry: Fintech a ‘Strategic Risk’ for Small Banks,” American Banker, November 18, 2016,\nhttps://www.americanbanker.com/news/occs-curry-fintech-a-strategic-risk-for-small-banks.\n19 See CSBS Community Bank Survey in note 5.\n20 More than two-thirds of respondents to the Conference of State Bank Supervisor’s annual survey of community\nbanks reported that they rarely or never rely on in-house technology for online loan applications and other digital\nproducts. See also CSBS Community Bank Survey in note 5.\n\n- 7 -\nother requirements, for instance, before a bank partners with a fintech firm, it first has to\nconsider regulatory and supervisory expectations regarding third-party risk management. Written\nguidance may allow for risk-based or more tailored approaches, but a number of factors\ncontribute to what the Treasury Department recently described as, “more stringent de facto\nregulation.” In particular, Treasury raised concerns that banks that are worried about criticism\nfrom examiners might, “adopt a more uniformly stringent vendor oversight approach rather than\ntrying to convince their examiners to permit a more tailored approach to vendor oversight.”21\nAnd this may ultimately deter banks from trying to explore how they should be adapting their\nbusiness strategies in light of technological change.\nGiven these concerns, what is the Federal Reserve Board’s role, as a bank supervisor, in\nhelping community banks chart their way through changing times? Let me be clear. It is\nmanagement’s job, not an examiner’s job, to set the bank’s innovation strategy. However, I think\nsupervisors need to recognize and be thoughtful about how we might affect the way banks\nconsider innovation. In particular, I think it’s important that we fulfill our responsibilities to\nensure safety and soundness of banks and consumer protection, while also creating a regulatory\nenvironment that does not hinder the integration of responsible innovation into the strategic\ndirection that a bank opts to pursue.\nHere at the Federal Reserve, I think it’s vital that we look closely at our work to make\nsure we are not hindering prudent innovation between community banks and fintech firms. We\n21 U.S. Department of Treasury, A Financial System that Creates Economic Opportunities: Nonbank Financials,\nFintech, and Innovation (Washington: Department of Treasury, July 2018),\nhttps://home.treasury.gov/sites/default/files/2018-08/A-Financial-System-that-Creates-Economic-Opportunities---\nNonbank-Financials-Fintech-and-Innovation.pdf.\n“Smaller, nonbank fintech firms and banks have raised concerns that the overall burden of the third-party\nsupervisory regime stifles the ability of new firms to partner with banks. . . . [C]ommunity banks have expressed\nconcern about their capacity to undertake the requisite due diligence and ongoing vendor management (especially\nwith larger vendors).”\n\n- 8 -\nneed to think about how our guidance sets expectations for the way banks should engage third\nparties. We should explore more effective ways to interact with banks, including through new\ntypes of outreach and education.\nTo begin with, I recognize the need to ensure that our outsourcing risk management\nguidance appropriately reflects the present-day business realities of the banks that we supervise.\nFor instance, regulators’ third-party risk management frameworks discuss particular types of\ncontractual terms and, where appropriate, audit rights by a bank over its service providers.\nHowever, when a community bank is in negotiations with large vendors, such as cloud service\ncompanies and core service providers, they may not be in a position to make demands. As the\nlargest vendors grow even larger, this will get even harder for small banks.22\nConcerns about compliance can also make it difficult for a community bank to work with\nsmall partners. A small fintech firm may lack a traditional financial history, raising questions\nabout how a bank can evaluate the fintech firm’s status in the industry, corporate history, or\nfinancial condition. It certainly can be difficult for a small bank’s staff to evaluate a wide range\nof potential technology vendors. I am heartened to hear that small banks are increasingly\ncollaborating to vet third-parties. Services are also emerging to help deliver due diligence\ninformation to banks and monitor their third-party relationships. Of course, the ultimate\nresponsibility should always lie with bank management, as each relationship involves particular\nservices, for particular needs, for a particular risk profile. However, it seems sensible that a large\namount of the vetting, contracting, and onboarding process could be streamlined for banks by\ncollaboration or specialized third-party services.\n22 See, for example, Penny Crosman, “Fiserv-First Data: Why small banks fear big fintech,” American Banker,\nJanuary 16, 2019, https://www.americanbanker.com/opinion/fiserv-first-data-why-small-banks-fear-big-fintech.\n\n- 9 -\nWe are also looking to engage industry more frequently and openly so that we understand\nhow they are weighing questions relating to innovation and how bank regulators may or may not\nimpact those considerations. Along those lines, we continue to look for new ways for regulated\ninstitutions to interact with the Federal Reserve System outside of the examination process. In\nparticular, supervised institutions, vendors, or consumer advocates are encouraged to contact\ntheir local Reserve Bank; talk with us about the issues they face; and, in some cases, ask\nclarifying questions about relevant legal frameworks and supervisory expectations.\nConclusion\nAs regulators and banks adjust to this post-crisis age of innovation, it is important for us\nto understand the pain points for community banks. As a regulator, my priority will always be\nfacilitating a banking system that is safe and sound and in which consumers are treated fairly.\nBut regulators also have to ask: How can our approach to supervision be modernized so that it\nsupports responsible innovation by our supervised institutions?\nThe efforts I described today are hopefully just a start. I am looking forward to personally\nengaging with community bankers, vendors, and consumer advocates to hear their perspectives\non the most productive ways for the Federal Reserve Board to help community banks thrive in\nthis age of innovation.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n11:45 a.m. EST (10:45 a.m. local time)\nFebruary 27, 2025\nCommunity Banking\nRemarks by\nMichelle W. Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe Robbins Banking Institute Lecture Series\nHays, Kansas\nFebruary 27, 2025\n\nIt is a pleasure to join you today at Fort Hays State University for the Robbins Banking\nInstitute Lecture.1 I have been a supporter of this institute since it was first created here at Fort\nHays State, including by giving a lecture to students during my tenure as the Kansas State Bank\nCommissioner. Today, my view is slightly different than at that time, and I thought it would be a\ngood time to share my thoughts on the critical role community banks play, not only in the U.S.\nbanking system but also as drivers of local and regional economic growth and as anchors of their\nlocal communities. I will also explore the responsibility of bank regulators to support\ncommunity banks.\nIn a broad and diverse economy, banks of all sizes play an important role in the creation\nand funding of business and consumer opportunities and investments. Without this diverse\nbanking ecosystem, 30 percent of American communities would not have access to a physical\nbank location. There is little doubt that community banks have an extensive presence across this\nlandscape and that they are essential to the success of the American economy.\nNo other country in the world enjoys this direct access to and presence of financial\nservices in remote and rural areas. These bankers are members of the community. They are\nneighbors and friends, and their kids attend local schools and play sports in the local recreational\nleague. The term “relationship” banking has true meaning in this context.\nThe direct relationships provide an opportunity for bankers to understand the unique\nfinancing needs of local businesses and enables them to develop specialized services for specific\nsegments of the local economy, including agriculture and small business lending.2\n1 The views expressed in these remarks are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of my colleagues on the\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 Allen N. Berger, Nathan H. Miller, Mitchell A. Petersen, Raghuram G. Rajan, and Jeremy C. Stein, “Does\nFunction Follow Organizational Form? Evidence from the Lending Practices of Large and Small Banks,” National\nBureau of Economic Research, Working Paper 8752 (Cambridge, MA: NBER, February 2002),\nhttps://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w8752/w8752.pdf.\n\n- 2 -\nCommunity banks are catalysts for local economic growth, and their bankers often also\nserve as civic leaders in the region. I served as one of those community leaders while I was a\nbanker in Council Grove. That experience—whether serving as the President of the local\nChamber of Commerce or the Rotary Club—provided a unique view into the local economy.\nAnd today, as I travel across the country to visit with bankers in just about every state, I learn\nabout how they are driving investment, philanthropy, and financial support for the local\neconomy. While this work is rewarding, it is also challenging. It is sometimes tedious—\nespecially in today’s regulatory environment—and it is a seven days a week job. Bankers are\noften “working” while engaged in social activities, attending church or their kids athletic events,\nand shopping at the grocery store, and I often hear about customers giving a loan payment to\ntheir banker in the grocery store or asking about financing terms for the new car they might have\ntheir eye on.\nOnce a policymaker grasps the perspective of community banking from this vantage\npoint, it becomes clear that the regulatory approach is much more complex than necessary to\naddress many small bank issues. A community bank that has no out-of-market customers\napplying for new accounts likely does not need the same know-your-customer processes as a\nlarge or regional bank that opens accounts online and may be more vulnerable to fraud. A\ncommunity bank can operate safely and soundly, and in compliance with laws, without being\nsubject to the same extensive guidance and regulatory requirements as larger, more complex\nbanks that offer a broader range of products and may be exposed to wider range of risks. A\nnumber of onerous requirements imposed on community banks seem to reflect an assumption of\nan indirect and less personal banking relationship.\n\n- 3 -\nPublic debates about the banking system often feature academics that tend to downplay\nthe significant role of community banks in the financial system. Instead, they imagine a banking\nsystem with fewer banks as equally effective in meeting the banking needs of every community\nthroughout the United States. The eight largest U.S. banks hold $15.4 trillion in assets, which is\nseveral times larger than the assets controlled by the more than 4,000 community banks in the\nUnited States.3 But as we all know, aggregate asset size is not an accurate indication of these\nbanks’ importance.\nOf course, metrics do not provide the full picture of how relationship-based lending\npractices drive local economic activity. They ignore that banking has a regional component,\nwhere local knowledge and expertise—and a commitment to the local community—can help\nenable the community to thrive. There is an important place for the largest banks and regional\nbanks in the banking system, but it is a fallacy to assume that the presence of fewer community\nbanks would not have devastating consequences for a number of consumers and businesses.\nSome community banks serve rural and underserved banking markets and may be the only\noption for consumers and businesses, especially those that have unique balance sheets or less\npristine credit histories. If community banks were to disappear, many communities would be left\nwith few or no alternative options for banking services.\nWhile metrics do not tell the whole story, this is not meant to downplay the importance of\ndata, research, and analysis, all of which assist us in our understanding of the banking system\nand how that understanding could be improved. Data can help us identify issues that must be\naddressed or remediated. Data can help us evaluate which elements of the current bank\n3 See, e.g., Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Supervision and Regulation Report (Washington:\nBoard of Governors, November 2024), Table 2, Summary of organizations supervised by the Federal Reserve (as of\n6/30/2024), https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/202411-supervision-and-regulation-report.pdf.\n\n- 4 -\nregulatory framework may be effective or ineffective. And data can help regulators update\nregulations and guidance with a clearer understanding of the intended and unintended\nconsequences.\nOver the past 20 years, we have seen the number of community banks continue to\ndecline. Bank consolidation through mergers has contributed to this decline, and de novo bank\nformation has been largely nonexistent. Many factors have contributed to the bank consolidation\ntrend, including competition from nonbank financial service providers and the ever-increasing\nregulatory burdens on the community banking model. Many of these same challenges have\nacted as a deterrent to bankers who have considered pursuing a de novo bank charter. And while\nmany factors influence the health of the community bank model—including the interest rate\nenvironment, economic conditions, and alternative sources of competition for credit—we should\nconsider whether there are actions regulators can take to support and ensure the future of\ncommunity banks.\nThe Benefits of Experience\nOne of the biggest barriers to the community bank model is the competition for qualified\nbank management and staff. Attracting, developing, and retaining future and current bank\nleadership is a significant challenge. Yet, one of the most important priorities for bank\nmanagement is to develop the next generation of leadership. Educational programs like this\ninstitute, bank and regulator internships, and regional graduate schools of banking can help\ndevelop this pipeline of talent to support the industry and supervisory responsibilities. These\nprograms also help regulators recruit the next generation of bank examiners.\n\n- 5 -\nWorking in my family’s community bank reinforced the mission focus and relationship\nmodel of community banking for me. This holds true for many family-owned community banks\nacross the country.\nSince we are on the campus of Fort Hays State University today and we have a number of\nstudents in the audience, part of my message today is to encourage each of you to consider\nexploring a career in the financial services industry—including in community banking or with a\nstate or federal banking regulator. Whether that experience becomes a lifelong career or a\nstepping stone along your path, having experience in banking provides valuable perspective on\nhow local economies function and the importance of access to banking services and financial\ninclusion. This experience has helped to shape my perspective and approach as the state bank\ncommissioner and as a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\nThis experience is also not something that I take for granted—seeing different\nperspectives empowers me to be a better policymaker. For example, as a bank compliance\nofficer you understand the challenges of ensuring the bank is in compliance with rules and\nguidance and is prepared for interactions with bank examiners. Further, having this perspective\nenables a policymaker to approach the process of drafting rules and guidance and relaying\nsupervisory messages in a way that recognizes a need for clarity, efficiency, and simplicity. The\noutcomes of our work are enhanced by a better understanding of the costs and unintended\nconsequences of getting it wrong.\nThe Responsibility of Regulators\nOverregulation and unnecessary rules and guidance imposed on smaller and community\nbanks create disproportionate burdens on these banks, eventually eroding the viability of the\ncommunity banking model.\n\n- 6 -\nPolicymakers and regulators have a responsibility to ensure that the banking and financial\nsystems encourage growth and innovation and foster a strong and growing economy. One of the\ngreat strengths of the U.S. banking system is the variety of institutions that meet the needs of\nconsumers and businesses, not only through offering a range of products and services but also by\nreaching customers throughout the country, including in the most rural and remote locations.\nOur goal must be to facilitate a banking and regulatory environment that enables banks of all\ntypes and sizes to thrive. For community banks, this includes building a better regulatory and\nsupervisory framework to effectively support the unique characteristics of these institutions.\nWhat should that framework look like?\nFirst, it includes thresholds that better reflect risk and business model.\nAs currently defined, community banks are those with less than $10 billion in assets. The\nFederal Reserve divides banks into distinct supervisory portfolios that oversee “community,”\n“regional,” and four categories of larger banks.4 The portfolio approach helps regulators\ndifferentiate standards and supervisory focus based on bank characteristics and risks. In theory,\nit allows examiners to better organize supervisory activities and to provide specialized training to\nhelp examiners focus on issues that are most relevant for the institutions being examined. If\nappropriately executed, this portfolio-based approach should lead to better and more risk-focused\nsupervision, and in turn a safer and more sound banking system.\nAn organizational structure that better allocates and directs supervisory resources seems\nlike a worthwhile goal, but over time, it becomes clear that there are downsides to this approach.\nOne of these downsides is the static nature of the fixed thresholds defining the categories.\n4 Larger banks are defined using tests that look primarily at asset size but may include other metrics like cross-\njurisdictional activity, nonbank assets, short-term wholesale funding, or off-balance sheet exposures.\n\n- 7 -\nCurrently, our framework includes fixed thresholds that are not adjusted with economic growth,\ninflation, or the growth in deposits from unexpected sources and fiscal programs, like those from\nthe COVID era. They also do not account for changed industry dynamics, especially those\nresulting from a particular bank’s activities or risk profile. In this environment, some firms with\nstable growth, a static business model, and a straightforward risk profile cross the $10 billion\nthreshold unintentionally, subjecting them to additional regulatory and supervisory requirements\nthat were specifically designed and implemented for larger and more complex firms. Banks\napproaching the $10 billion threshold often choose to curtail their asset growth to stay below the\nthreshold.\nAnother significant problem with the current approach—that specifically challenges\ncommunity banks—is the failure to index and update how a community bank is defined. Given\nthe low fixed-dollar asset thresholds, regulators must focus on ensuring that asset-based\nbenchmarks remain reasonable and appropriate in their work to supervise banks, especially as\nthey apply tailored, but static, supervisory standards. As is the case now, over time, economic\ngrowth and inflation have created an environment in which thresholds are inappropriately low.\nWe also need to implement a better, more timely, transparent, and viable path for all bank\nregulatory applications. The application process can be a significant obstacle to applications\nactivity, in particular mergers and acquisitions. Applications often experience significant delays\nbetween the application filing date and before receiving final regulatory approval. In some\ncases, even for non-complex transactions, the regulatory approval process has taken more than a\nyear. A healthy banking system is one in which banks can make decisions to merge with peers\nor acquire new assets or business lines, and one that allows new bank formation, in a reasonable\namount of time in accordance with statutory timelines. As the bank applications process has\n\n- 8 -\nbecome a barrier to bank merger activity, we have seen credit unions acquiring community banks\nin record numbers. In the absence of a better functioning bank applications process, institutions\nwill explore other options, including credit union acquisitions.\nI think this trend should be a wake up call for regulators to reevaluate our approaches to\nmany areas of our responsibility, but especially whether our applications processes are operating\nas effectively and efficiently as they should. It is important that the regulatory framework\nensures that competition and broader availability of banking services remain a feature of the U.S.\nbanking system.\nA necessary approach to solving this is by making targeted improvements to the\napplications process. If you follow my work, you know that I often discuss how the applications\nprocess can be improved.5 So I will note some of the important changes that I believe would be\na catalyst to returning our bank applications review function to an appropriate processing\ntimeline. These are simply threshold steps that should be easy to accomplish and would be a\ngreat start to fundamentally improving the process.\nI believe that we should not be complacent when facing excessive and longstanding\ndelays. For bank applications, we must focus our resources and expertise to review and\npromptly act on all bank applications, to streamline the required forms and procedures, and to\nprovide clear standards for approval.\nBank regulators should be prepared to act promptly on applications, and yet the\nsignificant delays in applications processing we see suggests we can do better. The published\nstatistics on applications processing also tell an incomplete story, as they do not reflect the time\n5 Michelle W. Bowman, “Brief Remarks on the Economy and Accountability in Supervision, Applications, and\nRegulation” (remarks at the American Bankers Association 2025 Conference for Community Bankers, Phoenix, AZ,\nFebruary 17, 2025), https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20250217a.pdf.\n\n- 9 -\nspent by applicants who withdraw applications before final regulatory action or that simply forgo\nbusiness opportunities that require an application out of concern that the regulatory approval\nprocess is too uncertain and unpredictable.6\nMany banks experience these frictions in the applications process firsthand. And judging\nfrom the number of bankers that contact me as they experience unexplained and prolonged\ndelays, there is clear need for improvement. Uncertainty regarding the status of the application\nand an expected timeline for resolution creates challenges in moving forward with related\nbusiness processes often resulting in costly delays for systems conversions and unhealthy\nuncertainty among bank staff.\nWe can certainly learn from the inefficiencies in the current process and leverage these\nexperiences by consulting with banks about these challenges and identifying a clear path to\nimprove the process. One step could be to ensure that our applications teams have access to\nspecialized knowledge required to more effectively approach applications for infrequent\nactivities, like de novo formations. We should ensure that a Reserve Bank has the resources\nnecessary to assist them in making the applications process smooth, and ensuring prompt action\nis taken on the application.\nWe also know that the applications process itself can be a significant barrier and has in\nrecent years been used by regulators to delay decisions. While many activities that require\nregulatory approval rely on common application forms, some bank applications require\nregulatory approvals from multiple regulators. Even where only one primary federal regulator\nmust act on an application, there may be requirements to solicit views from other regulators, or\n6 See, e.g., Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Banking Applications Activity Semiannual Report,\nJanuary 1-June 30, 2024 (Washington, Board of Governors, October 2024),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/semiannual-report-on-banking-applications-20241002.pdf.\n\n- 10 -\nthe need to request additional information from the applicant that was not included in the initial\nfiling forms.\nEach additional step in the process can lead to delays and prolonged uncertainty.\nWithout question, there is a better process, and it should start with aligned requirements across\nthe banking agencies, coordinated review processes, and clearer standards for approval.\nThe standards for approval should be clear to all applicants and consistently applied.\nThis must include transparency not only in approval standards but also in timelines, which are\nequally critical to banks seeking regulatory approval. Banking applications are not filed without\nextensive work up front and specific plans in mind. For example, a merger application will\ninclude information about the pro forma institution’s management team, geographies to be\nserved in the merged institution’s banking footprint, what products will be offered, and how the\napplication will be consistent with the various statutory approval standards.\nIf we determine that we consistently need more information to process an application, we\nshould amend the applications form instead of relying on time-consuming additional information\nrequests that extend the decision timeline. And if there are standards we expect applicants to\nmeet—for example, the minimum amount of capital required for a de novo bank formation or an\nexpansionary proposal—we should be clear and transparent about those expectations in advance.\nUncertainty in the standards and timelines for action on bank applications can contribute\nto a regulatory environment that favors nonbanks. This more favorable treatment includes\nallowing them to engage in the same activities without the same regulatory burdens, like more\nfavorable tax and regulatory treatment for credit unions and the exemption from Community\nReinvestment Act requirements for nonbank financial institutions, again, including credit unions.\n\n- 11 -\nWhy would a new business choose to become a bank if they can avoid the complexities of the\nbanking regulatory framework and still provide similar services?\nTailoring\nWhile these steps—developing a pipeline of future leadership for community banks and\npromoting a more efficient bank applications process—would help support the community\nbanking system generally, perhaps the most critical feature of the framework that affects\ncommunity banks is tailoring to address the ongoing burden of compliance.\nTailoring is the term we use in banking to describe an approach to regulation that strives\nto match regulation and supervision with the size, risk, complexity, and business model of an\ninstitution. Tailoring helps us calibrate regulation and supervision to the activities and risks at\nevery tier within our framework, but it is particularly important when we think about its\napplication for smaller and community banks.\nFrankly, when you consider the fundamental differences between the largest banks and\nthe smallest, tailoring seems like common sense rather than a distinct regulatory philosophy. But\nin the absence of industry experience among bank policymakers, the trend over time has been an\nerosion of tailoring in favor of one-size-fits-all approaches.\nPushing down requirements more appropriate for larger institutions to smaller banks—\neither formally through regulation or informally through supervisory messaging—encourages\nhomogenization of the industry. This trend becomes even more concerning when regulators\n“grade on a curve” by evaluating a bank relative to other institutions, instead of evaluating a\nbank against a clear legal standard.\nIt is also important for regulators evaluating regulations and supervisory approach to\nconsider the aggregate benefits and costs of the framework, rather than looking at each part of\n\n- 12 -\nthe framework on a piecemeal basis. Often, the regulations and supervisory guidance issued by\nregulators has a “cumulative” or “compounding” effect on banks. A piecemeal approach ensures\nthat banks cannot go to a single source or one regulation to understand supervisory expectations\nor requirements for a particular activity. While it may be possible to justify or explain any single\nregulation or piece of guidance on a standalone basis, when we consider the aggregate effects, it\nis clear that we need to rethink our approach and recommit to tailoring.\nRegulatory ambivalence to tailoring comes at a significant cost. If current trends\ncontinue—where we push down requirements from large banks to small and attempt to “smooth”\nor standardize requirements and expectations across all banks—we will eventually find ourselves\nachieving the academically preferred end state of only a few large banks ineffectively serving the\nfinancial needs of the entire U.S. economy. In this state of the world, not only will community\nbanks suffer but so will the communities they serve.\nClosing Thoughts\nThank you again for the invitation to join you today. It is wonderful to see the ongoing\nsuccess and commitment of the Robbins Banking Institute in preparing the next generation of\nleaders to play an important role in the banking and financial system. While I have expressed\nconcern about some recent trends, one of the many benefits of our system is that there are always\nopportunities to change course, and I am confident that with committed and experienced\nleadership we can.\nI am also confident that the future of community banking is bright, as long as we focus on\nright sized and appropriate regulations and guidance and a recognition that investment in\ninnovation and growth is a necessity, not a roadblock. Regulators have an important opportunity\nnow to prioritize changes that will support the safe and sound operation of community banks\n\n- 13 -\nwhile allowing these banks to support the U.S. economy, serve their communities, innovate, and\ngrow. Community banks enable the economic success of our country and will continue to\nsupport financial opportunities for many future generations. I look forward to seeing how the\nstudents in attendance here today will be a part of and shape that bright future.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n1:40 p.m. EDT\nSeptember 28, 2021\nCreating a New Model for the Future of Supervision\nRemarks by\nMichelle W. Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nCommunity Banking in the 21st Century Research and Policy Conference\nSt. Louis, Missouri\n(virtual conference)\nSeptember 28, 2021\n\nGood afternoon. I’m pleased to be able to join you again virtually for this year’s\nCommunity Banking in the 21st Century research and policy conference. Although I think\nwe would all prefer to be together in person, in the shadow of the St. Louis Arch, I’m\noptimistic that next year (which will be the 10th anniversary of the conference, by the\nway) will give us the opportunity to finally gather in person after a two-year hiatus.\nFor nine years, this conference, which brings together researchers, regulators, and\ncommunity bankers, has enabled us to hear from top academics around the world who\nconduct research to help us better understand the community bank business model. It’s\nnot an accident that this conference is sponsored by three agencies involved in the\nsupervision of banks—the Federal Reserve, the Conference of State Bank Supervisors,\nand the FDIC—as the work of this conference has informed, and will continue to inform,\nhow we think about the supervision of our nation’s community banks.\nOur conference sponsors entered this partnership with the belief that what we\nlearn here will deepen our understanding of the benefits of, and the challenges facing, the\ncommunity bank business model, which, in turn, helps to make us better bank\nsupervisors.\nIt’s natural then to ask: What have we learned from this conference that is\napplicable today? What might we apply in the future to the supervision of community\nbanks?\nTo answer that question, or quite frankly, to answer many questions that pertain to\nthe regulation and supervision of banks, it’s instructive to first go back a bit in history. In\nthis case, I’d like to take you all the way back to. . .2019.\nSeems like a lifetime ago.\n\n- 2 -\nWay back then, we were concerned about liquidity. Banks were concerned about\na potential run-off of deposits as consumers found new, more technology-centric ways to\nmanage their money, often outside of the insured banking system. Although we also saw\na decline in technology costs that enabled banks of all sizes to offer a wider array of\ndigital products and services to their customers, the innovation taking place outside the\nbanking sector was often seen as outpacing the innovation in the banking sector.\nConsumers seemed to increasingly weigh convenience over safety, as a number of\nnon-banks increased their market share. To a lesser degree, but still concerning, was that\nof the convenience factor. It drove some small business borrowers to move away from\nlenders with whom they had longstanding relationships. In some cases, those borrowers\nwere even willing to pay much more for credit for the sake of convenience.\nUnfortunately, some borrowers learned the hard way that convenience does not always\noutweigh a banking relationship—particularly when a business or community\nexperiences a significant hardship such as a natural disaster.\nI regularly heard stories of how small businesses that borrowed from an online\nlender were unable to reach anyone to discuss their situation during a crisis and\nultimately had their loans called because of missing a payment. In these situations, I also\nheard stories of how the local community bank that understood the local situation and\nwanted to see the business and the community survive, would step in, and refinance the\noriginal loan to help the small business return to more normal operations.\nI also heard about challenges with core processors and how legacy contracts and a\nlack of competition for core processing services was stifling innovation. We saw several\nfintechs become “mainstream” nationally, and we saw a proliferation of technology\n\n- 3 -\nsolutions targeted at helping community banks become nimbler in adding new products\nand services.\nFrom a supervisory perspective, the Federal Reserve actively explored ways to\nreduce regulatory burden and provide greater transparency into the work of bank\nsupervisors. Using research presented in prior years at this conference, we applied\nfindings showing the disproportionate regulatory burden borne by our smallest\ninstitutions and looked across our processes to find ways to tailor our supervisory model\nto more accurately reflect the risk posed by these smaller financial institutions.\nAnd then came March 2020 and the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic in the\nU.S.\nDespite the many choices consumers have for managing their money and\npurchases outside of the traditional banking system, we witnessed a systematic flight to\nthe safety of FDIC-insured deposits in state or nationally chartered banks.\nSpecifically, total deposits at all FDIC-insured institutions increased by 22\npercent when comparing deposit data from 2019 to 2020.1 Small business lending also\nincreased significantly. From the end of 2019 to the end of the second quarter of 2020\nalone, small loans to businesses at community banks, a proxy for small business lending,\nincreased by 39 percent.2\nThe Impact of the PPP during the Pandemic\nOne driver for the increase in small business lending was, of course, the Small\nBusiness Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program or PPP. The PPP was funded\n1 FDIC Summary of Deposits (2019, 2020). Summary of Deposits is collected as of the second quarter each\nyear.\n2 Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income (Call Reports).\n\n- 4 -\nby the U.S. Treasury Department through forgivable loans that enabled small businesses\nto maintain payroll, retain employees who may have been laid off in response to the\nsocial distancing protocols that went into effect in April 2020, or to cover other overhead\ncosts.\nTo support the PPP, the Federal Reserve provided a liquidity backstop to PPP\nlenders through its Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility or PPPLF. In\nrecognition of the evolution in the banking landscape that I referenced a few moments\nago, the PPPLF was designed to not only provide a liquidity backstop to banks and credit\nunions, but also to serve non-bank fintechs, community development financial\ninstitutions, and agricultural finance companies that participated in the PPP. Given the\nimportant role minority-owned banks play in the allocation of credit in their\ncommunities, the Federal Reserve also actively engaged minority depository institutions\nto ensure they had the tools they needed to benefit from the Fed’s emergency liquidity\nprograms.\nTo be sure, the PPP and the PPPLF will provide significant research material for\nyears to come. I understand from reviewing the papers accepted into this year’s\nproceedings that it has already driven the work of several economists you’ll be hearing\nfrom over this two-day conference. In reviewing the data on these programs, however—\nand here I must credit the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s “Supervision\nTransformational Trends” program—we see that a substantial majority of PPP loans,\nnearly 73 percent, were made by insured depository institutions. These loans also\naccounted for nearly 90 percent of the aggregated loan amount for all PPP loans.\n\n- 5 -\nGetting a bit more granular, we can see that community banks made 32 percent of\nall PPP loans while large banks made 35 percent of all PPP loans, with credit unions and\nsavings banks accounting for the rest of the loans made by banking institutions. Fintechs\naccounted for approximately 13 percent of all PPP loans and more than half of those were\nmade as a result of a partner bank relationship.\nA recent working paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER)\noffers additional detail on the roles these different types of lenders played in allocating\ncredit through the PPP during the pandemic.3 The authors found\n• Community banks originated the majority of PPP loans when the program first\nlaunched, while large banks were the majority lender during the second phase of\nthe program.4\n• Community banks provided more loans to middle income borrowers while large\nbanks provided more PPP loans to upper income borrowers.\n• Community banks and large banks made loans to lower and moderate-income\nborrowers in approximately equal proportions.\n• Fintech firms, on the other hand, made more loans in zip codes with fewer bank\nbranches, lower incomes, and larger minority populations.5\n• The authors also found that fintech lending, instead of taking market share from\ntraditional banks, mostly expanded the overall supply of credit and other financial\nservices.\n3 Isil Erel and Jack Liebersohn, “Does FinTech Substitute for Banks? Evidence from the Paycheck\nProtection Program,” NBER Working Paper 27659 (Cambridge: National Bureau of Economic Research,\nDecember 2020), https://www.nber.org/papers/w27659.\n4 It’s important to note that the NBER paper uses $20 billion as the asset size threshold between large banks\nand small (community) banks. This is different than the $10 billion asset size threshold that was established\nvia the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.\n5 In this study, lending by Minority Depository Institutions and Community Development Financial\nInstitutions is included in the lending data for small (community) banks.\n\n- 6 -\nFrom my perspective, these findings offer evidence of the continuing importance of\ncommunity banks to our economy during both “normal” times as well as during times of\nextreme financial stress. Or, to paraphrase Mark Twain, “reports of the demise of\ncommunity banks are greatly exaggerated.”\nThe NBER paper also highlights how new entrants to banking can meet an unmet\nneed.\nThe experiences of banks and bank supervisors during the pandemic also offer\ninsights into how we should think about the Federal Reserve’s approach to supervision in\nthe future. For the remainder of my talk, I will offer my thoughts on a key principle that I\nbelieve should guide our thinking: The future of community banking and the future of\nbanking supervision are deeply interconnected.\nMy earlier comments should not be interpreted as suggesting that there aren’t real\nchallenges facing the community bank business model. But I am suggesting that new\ntechnologies, new entrants into banking, and changes in customer preferences that have\nled to predictions about the end of the community banking business model simply have\nnot been substantiated.\nIf anything, this conference has highlighted that the diversity in business models\nof small financial institutions is an essential part of our economy. There is strength in\nbeing small that enables institutions to know their customers on a much deeper level.\nSmall financial institutions can quickly customize products and services to address their\ncustomers’ needs and, in some cases, they can leverage the flexibility of their business\nmodels to take advantage of new business opportunities. This flexibility allows banks to\nmaintain strong relationships with customers—particularly those customers who don’t fit\n\n- 7 -\na “typical” borrower profile. It also explains why community banks have a long history\nof providing essential financial services to households, small businesses, and small farms\nin communities across the country.\nDuring the pandemic, I personally began speaking to the leaders of the more than\n650 state member community banks in the Federal Reserve’s supervisory portfolio. The\nconversations to date have provided important regional insights and perspectives that can\nonly be gleaned from leaders who know their markets and customers at a very deep level.\nWhile I heard that lobby traffic was down and that lending opportunities were not as\nrobust as they once were, I mostly heard optimism. I heard that the value proposition of\nthe traditional community bank was on full display in many communities, urban and\nrural. I heard that bank business customers needed bankers who truly knew them and\ntheir businesses, and who could work with them to provide the customized support they\nneeded during that time of great uncertainty.\nAs banks changed to meet the challenges of the pandemic, we asked ourselves at\nthe Federal Reserve, do bank supervisors need to change?\nBy necessity, the immediate answer, of course, was “yes.” The Federal Reserve\ndid so by pausing all on-site exams and using technology that enabled us to remotely\nsupervise the safety and soundness of our institutions as well as monitor their compliance\nwith relevant consumer compliance laws and regulations. To be sure, we adjusted our\nsupervisory expectations accordingly based on the guidance we were providing banks.\nWe also greatly expanded our outreach and engagement with financial\ninstitutions. We deployed the full range of communications tools that we’ve developed\nover many years to provide banks with real-time information on supervisory expectations\n\n- 8 -\nas well as the emergency lending programs that were put in place to forestall any\nsystematic deterioration in the health of our financial system.\nAs evidenced by the continued strength of bank balance sheets and the general\nabsence of bank failures during the pandemic, I think we can confidently say that the\nactions of banks, bank supervisors, and policymakers during the pandemic allowed us to\navoid the challenges that plagued our banking system during 2008 financial crisis. The\npandemic heightened our awareness of this important linkage between banking and\nsupervision.\nHad we not tailored our supervisory approach during the pandemic, I believe the\nimpact on our banks, our economy, and on consumers would have been much more\nsevere.\nFrom the beginning, we worked closely with our federal and state counterparts—\nmany of whom are represented at this conference—to develop a sense of joint action and\nto agree to work together in a holistic way.\nI knew from my experience as both a community banker and a state bank\nregulator, that we needed to avoid overreacting and instead approach supervision in a\nmore measured way that allowed banks the flexibility to work with their customers. We\nneeded to empower banks to manage those key relationships in their loan portfolios in a\nway that was beneficial to their customers without exposing the banks to risk.\nWhat we saw, as a result of this approach, is that the industry made responsible\ndecisions that kept credit flowing throughout the pandemic and enabled businesses across\nthe U.S. to continue operating.\n\n-9 -\nBut the question remains: how should supervisors, and banking supervision itself,\napply what we learned going forward? During the pandemic, we changed our\nsupervisory approaches based on necessity, but now we need to look ahead and make\nsure that we’re adjusting our supervisory model in ways that allow banks greater\nflexibility to innovate to compete in today’s quickly evolving banking environment—\nwithout sacrificing important consumer protections or the health and safety of our\nbanking system.\nThe Future of Supervision\nTo start, we must acknowledge the interconnectedness of the future of banking\nand the future of bank supervision. Supervision has to evolve because the banking\nindustry is evolving. Available technology, analytical capabilities, and customer and\nworkforce preferences are driving this evolution in how financial sector products and\nservices are delivered. We recognize that our workforce, processes, and technology\nmust align with these changes to ensure that an effective, transparent, and timely\nsupervision program is maintained.\nTherefore, the Federal Reserve is embarking on an initiative to investigate the\nimplications of these changes for the Federal Reserve’s Supervision function.6\nThe goal of this initiative is to ensure our supervisory approaches accommodate a\nmuch broader range of activities while ensuring we don’t create an unlevel playing field\nwith unfair advantages, or unfair disadvantages, for some types of firms versus others.\n6 The scope includes execution of safety and soundness and consumer compliance supervision, risk\nidentification, and analytical activities. The scope excludes other System Supervision activities, such as\ntraining, applications, enforcement, and policymaking.\n\n- 10 -\nThis will include investigating technology and innovative business practices that increase\nour agility and efficiency.\nInnovation is a way of life for banks, it should be for supervisors as well.\nBut we must do this in a way that also preserves what we know works and what\nwe learned can work during the pandemic.\nBefore sharing my views on the underlying principles that need to guide our\nthinking on our future supervisory approaches, I’ll first offer some thoughts on a few\naspects of Federal Reserve supervision that I believe must be preserved even as we think\nexpansively about the future:\n1. The first being the Federal Reserve’s Supervisory structure. Although the\nFed’s supervision and regulation of banks is the responsibility of the Board of\nGovernors, the day-to-day supervision of banks is delegated to the Reserve\nBanks. This distributed system ensures we have most of our examination\nworkforce living and working in the same communities served by our community\nbanks. This structure, perhaps more importantly, gives our examiners deep\ninsights into thousands of local economies across the U.S. and helps us\nunderstand the local industries that are vital to the long-term health and success of\nthese communities. This local knowledge is what enables our examiners to tailor\nour supervision of institutions based not only on the complexity of the bank but\nbased on the unique characteristics of the industries they support.\n2. The second is the Federal Reserve’s direct outreach and engagement with\nbanks and financial institutions. Since the 2008 financial crisis, the Federal\nReserve has built an extensive communications infrastructure—through national\n\n- 11 -\nprograms, such as Ask the Fed®, and though hundreds of local Reserve Bank\nprograms—to share important supervisory and regulatory information with banks.\nThe goal was simple: provide a mechanism that enables us to quickly share\ninformation and perspectives with institutions outside of the exam process,\nprovide timely and accurate responses to questions, and give the banks the tools\nthey need to meet our supervisory expectations. I believe supervision works best\nwhen supervisors clearly communicate their expectations with banks—there\nshouldn’t be any “surprises” about our expectations during an exam. In my calls\nwith bankers, I’m reminded that one of the biggest sources of regulatory burden is\nregulatory and supervisory uncertainty. By clearly communicating our\nexpectations, by engaging the industry directly to understand the impact of these\nexpectations and, when appropriate, providing banks with tools and resources to\nmeet those expectations, we reduce uncertainty for banks.\nWe continued to expand our communication approach this past July with the\nlaunch of the Federal Reserve’s Scaled CECL Allowance for Losses Estimator or\nSCALE tool. SCALE gives community banks a tangible tool to help with their\ncalculation of loan loss allowance under the Current Expected Credit Losses\nmethodology. Our effort to identify simple and practical ways to implement\nCECL that would help reduce costs and complexity for smaller community banks\nwas supported by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. The launch of\nSCALE represents a significant cultural shift in how we intend to supervise in the\nfuture: when there is significant uncertainty around a new regulation, supervisory\n\n- 12 -\nexpectation, or practice, we will look beyond our traditional communications\ntools to find innovative ways to reduce that uncertainty.\nSo, what will this new approach to supervision look like and what principles will\nguide us?\n• First, we must maintain a firm commitment to preserving the stability, integrity,\nfunctionality, and diversity of our banking system.\n• Second, we must maintain consumer protection as we innovate and ensure that\nbanks can safely offer financial products and services that consumers demand and\nare uniquely tailored to their circumstances and goals.\n• Third, as we adjust our supervisory approach, we must avoid adding new burdens\non banks, particularly on those that maintain a more traditional business model.\nWe must be consistent in how we view similar activities at similar institutions, but\nour approach must also allow for de novo banks and allow for greater innovation\nat our nation’s banks. And we need to continue to provide examiners with the\nability to tailor their expectations based on the risks posed by individual\ninstitutions. We must move even further beyond the “one size fits all”\nsupervisory model that defined our approach in the past.\n• Fourth, we must enhance transparency around our supervisory expectations for\nsafety and soundness and consumer compliance matters and be timelier in our\nfeedback to banks. We must fully leverage our distributed structure to delegate\ndecision making to our Reserve Banks, without diminishing the Board’s\nimportant policymaking and oversight role over the supervision of banks.\n\n- 13 -\n• And fifth, we must ensure that we are always able to adjust our supervisory\nexpectations effectively and efficiently as conditions warrant to enable banks to\nbe more flexible in serving their communities and in providing credit to the areas\nof our economy that most need it.\nWhen I spoke at this conference in 2019, I discussed a number of very practical\nproblems that we needed to solve. These included understanding how technology,\ncompetition, regulation, and other factors drive industry consolidation, quantifying the\nbenefits community banks provide to their communities, and defining the full economic\neffects a community bank has on its community.7\nAs we move forward with modernizing our supervisory approach, these questions\nremain at the forefront of our thinking. But, based on our experiences of the past few\nyears, we also have a number of new questions that we’ll need to address if we are to be\nsuccessful.\nFor example, what do banks see as the most transformative technological\ninnovations that will drive changes to their business models? How do banking\ninstitutions prefer to interact with their supervisors, and what do they think makes for a\nsuccessful relationship between the supervisor and the supervised?\nThe factors that are identified through this initiative as having the greatest\npotential influence on future bank business models will vary based on several factors,\nincluding size, complexity, geography, staff capacity, and business strategy, but, taken\n7 Michelle W. Bowman, “Advancing Our Understanding of Community Banking” (speech at the\nCommunity Banking Research and Policy Conference, St. Louis, MO, October 1, 2019),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20191001a.htm.\n\n- 14 -\ntogether, they will give us important insights into how we, as bank supervisors, might\nneed to evolve our supervisory practices as the bank business model evolves.\nAnd as we consider our own evolution in the face of these changes, we will need\nto ask ourselves:\n• What changes to the Federal Reserve System Supervision function’s workforce,\nprocesses and technology are necessary to execute our supervisory activities given\nthe factors affecting the industry?\n• How should the Federal Reserve structure its supervisory activities across its\nportfolios of supervised firms?\n• Where are we aligned across the Supervision function in conducting our work?\nWhere might we be out of alignment?\n• Should innovations in technology, such as artificial intelligence, be used to better\naccomplish supervision?\nIn the future, I look forward to sharing our progress on this initiative and providing\nspecific examples of how our supervisory practices are evolving alongside those of the\nindustry.\nTimes of crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, provide us a unique opportunity\nto see how our banking system operates under stress—and to see both the strengths of our\ncurrent system of supervision as well as opportunities for improvement.\nThe lessons we learned over the past 18 months, supported by research from this\nconference and from other sources, offer important lessons on how we can appropriately\nevolve our supervisory approaches.\n\n- 15 -\nWhat we learn over the next two days from the researchers, policymakers, and\ncommunity bankers presenting during this year’s conference proceedings will factor into\nour overall thinking as we embark on this journey to modernize our supervisory practices\nand develop new supervisory approaches that can meet the needs of today, and the\nchallenges of tomorrow.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n10:30 a.m. EDT (8:30 a.m. MDT)\nOctober 2, 2023\nBrief Remarks on the Economy and Bank Regulation\nby\nMichelle W. Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe CEO/Executive Management Conference\nSponsored by the Mississippi Bankers Association and the\nTennessee Bankers Association\nBanff, Canada\nOctober 2, 2023\n\nThank you for the invitation to join you today. It is a privilege to speak to so\nmany bank leaders from Mississippi and Tennessee together at the same time, and I\nappreciate the opportunity to be here with you.1 As a former community banker, one of\nthe most informative, enjoyable, and productive aspects of my role is the time I spend\nwith community bankers, listening to issues that are important to you and that affect you\nand your customers, including, of course, the impact of the Fed’s regulation and\nsupervision. Community banks play a key role in supporting economic growth and\nlending to serve their customers and communities, which is an indispensable role in the\nU.S. economy.\nBefore we turn to our conversation, I’d like to offer a few thoughts on the\neconomy and monetary policy, following our Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)\nmeeting last month. As you know, at that meeting, my colleagues and I voted to maintain\nthe target range for the federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent, after raising rates sharply\nover the past year and a half to reduce inflation. Since then, there has been considerable\nprogress on lowering inflation and the FOMC has responded this year with a more\ngradual pace of increases. In keeping with this approach, we held the policy rate steady\nin June, raised it by 25 basis points in July, and then held steady again last month.\nInflation continues to be too high, and I expect it will likely be appropriate for the\nCommittee to raise rates further and hold them at a restrictive level for some time to\nreturn inflation to our 2 percent goal in a timely way.\n1 The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee or the Board of Governors.\n\n- 2 -\nMost recently, the latest inflation reading based on the personal consumption\nexpenditure (PCE) index showed that overall inflation rose, responding in part to higher\noil prices. I see a continued risk that high energy prices could reverse some of the\nprogress we have seen on inflation in recent months.\nAt the same time, the economy has remained strong as the FOMC has tightened\nmonetary policy. Real gross domestic product (GDP has been growing at a solid pace.\nConsumer spending has remained robust, and the housing sector appears to be continuing\nto rebound. The most recent employment report showed a labor market with solid job\ngains. The average pace of job gains over the past year has slowed somewhat and the\nlabor force participation rate has also improved over the same time frame, a sign that\nlabor market supply and demand may be coming into better balance.\nThe banking system continues to be strong and resilient. Banks have tightened\nlending standards due to higher interest rates and funding costs and in anticipation of\nfuture regulatory requirements. But despite this tightening of lending standards, there has\nnot been a sharp contraction in credit that would significantly slow economic activity.\nBank loan balance growth has slowed, but ongoing strong household and business\nbalance sheets combined with the growing importance of non-bank lending suggest that\nmonetary policy may have smaller effects on bank lending and the economy than in the\npast.\nGiven the mixed data releases—strong spending data but a decline in inflation and\ndownward revisions to jobs created in previous months—I supported the FOMC’s\ndecision to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate. Since then, the GDP data\nhave also been revised. The frequency and scope of recent data revision complicates the\n\n- 3 -\ntask of projecting how the economy will evolve. But I continue to expect that further rate\nincreases will likely be needed to return inflation to 2 percent in a timely way. The\nSummary of Economic Projections released in connection with the September FOMC\nmeeting showed that the median participant expects inflation to stay above 2 percent at\nleast until the end of 2025. This, along with my own expectation that progress on\ninflation is likely to be slow given the current level of monetary policy restraint, suggests\nthat further policy tightening will be needed to bring inflation down in a sustainable and\ntimely manner.\nIt is important to note that monetary policy is not on a pre-set course. My\ncolleagues and I will make our decisions based on the incoming data and its implications\nfor the economic outlook. I remain willing to support raising the federal funds rate at a\nfuture meeting if the incoming data indicates that progress on inflation has stalled or is\ntoo slow to bring inflation to 2 percent in a timely way. Returning inflation to the\nFOMC’s 2 percent goal is necessary to achieve a sustainably strong labor market and an\neconomy that works for everyone.\nI would also like to briefly discuss recent and future developments in banking\nregulation. The bank failures and accompanying banking system stress earlier this year\nmade clear that the Federal Reserve, and in some cases the other federal banking\nagencies, need to address supervisory shortcomings and potentially consider revision of\nsome failure-related bank regulations. I have previously noted my perspective on the\npath forward, that proposals should be (1) focused on remediating identified issues and\nshortcomings; (2) informed by data, analysis, and genuine debate and discussion among\npolicymakers within each of the participating agencies; and (3) developed through a\n\n- 4 -\ntransparent and open process that allows policymakers and the public to understand the\ncontext, data, and analysis underlying the proposed reforms. The process must also\nincorporate the opportunity to solicit meaningful public comment.\nToday we have an opportunity to revisit the path of regulatory reform, starting\nwith whether we have identified the relevant issues and shortcomings. There have been a\nnumber of reports discussing the root causes of the failure of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB),\nincluding just this past week, a report from the Board’s Office of the Inspector General.\nCollectively, these reports have provided some valuable insights into the bank\nfailure, but in my view, much work remains to ensure we have identified all of the factors\nthat contributed to the failure of SVB, and the subsequent failures of Signature Bank and\nFirst Republic, including the actions of regulators in the lead-up to and following the\nfailures. While there is overlap between many of the findings in the reports published to-\ndate, these reports have not reached entirely consistent conclusions.\nOne way to effectively identify and address these issues is to engage an\nindependent third party to conduct a review. As I have said since shortly after the bank\nfailures occurred, a third-party review should review and analyze a broader time period\nthan the limited time periods covered to-date, including a broader range of topics and\nissues that are likely to identify further areas in need of reform. While this type of review\nwould be an unusual step, it is appropriate where, as here, the existing limited reviews are\ndriving the regulatory reform agenda, and where these bank failures have caused\nsignificant losses.\nPut another way, the purpose of an independent third-party review would be to\nanalyze the events surrounding the failure of these banks, so that we can fully understand\n\n- 5 -\nwhat led to the failures. This would be a logical next step in holding ourselves\naccountable. Before making conclusions about appropriate responses going forward to\naddress causal issues, we need accurate, impartial, and thorough information to inform\nthe debate about what specifically may be needed to fix any problems in our supervision\nand regulatory framework. While the Board has made some confidential supervisory\ninformation about SVB available to the public, an outside party has an inherent\ndisadvantage in probing the events surrounding the failure of a bank—they do not have\naccess to the full supervisory record, and they have no ability to conduct extensive staff\ninterviews. The Board could easily put this criticism to rest simply by engaging an\nindependent third party to prepare a more thorough and broadly scoped report and giving\nthat party the necessary access to information.\nOf course, the staff who prepared the internal reviews, both the review led by\nVice Chair for Supervision Barr, and the recently prepared report of the Board’s Office of\nthe Inspector General, had greater capacity to review internal information and speak with\nstaff. But both of these reports themselves acknowledge their limited scope, related to\nthe time constraints and the nature of the specific questions probed.2\nWhile the reports produced to-date have provided some insights, it is worth\npausing and reflecting on whether we have our regulatory and supervisory priorities\naligned with the most pressing needs demonstrated by recent events, and whether we are\n2 As noted in Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr's review of the supervision and regulation of Silicon\nValley Bank, \"[the] report was written with the benefit of hindsight on the particular facts and\ncircumstances that proved most relevant for SVB and SVBFG. The report was prepared in a compressed\ntime frame from March 13, 2023, through April 28, 2023, and further work over a longer period could draw\nadditional or different conclusions.\" Barr, Review of the Federal Reserve's Supervision and Regulation of\nSilicon Valley Bank. As noted in the Material Loss Review of SVB, the objective of the report was to\ndetermine why SVB’s failure resulted in a material loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund, and to assess the\nFederal Reserve’s supervision of SVB from January 2018 through March 2023. Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System, Evaluation Report 2023-SR-B-013 (September 25, 2023).\n\n- 6 -\ntaking the right “lessons learned” from these events. As regulators continue to pursue\nfurther supervisory and regulatory reforms, we should also pause and reflect on whether\nthese changes are appropriately calibrated and executed.\nTo be clear, supervisory priorities have already been influenced by the bank\nfailures earlier this year. The trend seems to be that regulators are engaging in\nsupervision with a more heavy-handed approach, focusing primarily on quarterly call\nreport data in some cases without the benefit of direct engagement with the targeted\nfinancial institutions.\nThe Board has long found that information received outside of a regular\nexamination may suggest the need to carefully consider whether bank ratings remain\nappropriate.3 But when engaging in this type of off-cycle review, we should consider\nwhether the process is appropriately calibrated, is transparent to the financial institution,\nand whether it provides the financial institution the ability to engage in meaningful\ndialogue and discussion with examiners. In my mind, bank data analysis that occurs\nexclusively in an off-site context prevents supervisors from leveraging important\nopportunities to engage with financial institutions to effectively deliver supervisory\nmessages. It is entirely appropriate to express concern or engage in dialogue with\nmanagement, or to gain a better understanding of a bank’s strategic direction or risk\nmanagement approach based on reported data. Financial results are key, but in the\ncontinuum of supervision, we should not forget the value of a broader based supervisory\napproach that uses all available tools and considers all relevant factors.\n3 Federal Reserve SR Letter 99-17 (June 24, 1999).\n\n- 7 -\nWe should also carefully consider whether our approach is appropriate in the\nmoment: Are the federal banking agencies acting in a consistent manner in their bank\nsupervisory activities? Are federal banking agencies coordinating appropriately with\nstate banking agencies when reviewing state-chartered banks? And fundamentally, are\nsupervisory decisions being driven by a comparison or horizontal review of differences\namong institutions that may have very different business activities and risk profiles? Are\nsupervisors acting pro-cyclically, or overreacting to the events of March 2023? When\nagencies adopt a more adversarial approach to supervision, or apply standards that are\ndisproportionate to risk, does that negatively impact a bank’s ability and willingness to\nengage in open communication with their examiners?\nAsking these questions can help us appropriately calibrate our revised approach to\nbanking supervision and help us avoid reacting in a way that is disproportionate to an\ninstitution’s risk to the banking system.\nBefore concluding my prepared remarks, I’d like to discuss the Federal Reserve’s\nand the other Federal banking agencies’ rulemaking agenda. A number of rules have\nbeen proposed for comment or are currently in the pipeline. Some have already been\npublished for comment including the proposal to implement Basel III “endgame” by\nsignificantly expanding capital requirements and bringing the threshold for compliance\ndown to include all banks over $100 billion in assets from only the largest GSIB banks,\nand the expansion of the long-term debt requirement from only the largest banks again to\nall banks over $100 billion in assets. Still other proposals have not yet been published or\nmoved to the next stage of the rulemaking process, including the Community\nReinvestment Act rulemaking, the further consideration of climate guidance, and others.\n\n- 8 -\nThe Board has also publicly indicated it may propose additional revisions in the future to\nRegulation II.\nThe scope of some of these reforms will be extensive and could reshape the\ncontours of the bank regulatory framework in important ways, including for community\nbanks. It is critical that stakeholders engage in the comment process and communicate\nwith policymakers to share their views on the rulemaking agenda, including the specific\nimpacts—intended and unintended—of any changes. Public comments, data, and\nanalysis help to inform decisions made throughout the rulemaking and proposal process.\nThe bankers in this room and across the country are vitally important to the banking\nsystem, and to the broader economy, and it is important that as reforms take shape, we\nincorporate your perspectives on the real-world consequences of any considered reform.\nI look forward to our conversation.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n3:00 a.m. EDT (9:00 a.m. local time)\nMay 12, 2023\nThe Evolving Nature of Banking, Bank Culture, and Bank Runs\nRemarks by\nMichelle W. Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n21st Annual Symposium on\nBuilding the Financial System of the 21st Century:\nAn Agenda for Europe and the United States\nSponsored by Harvard Law School\nProgram on International Financial Systems\nEuropean Central Bank\nFrankfurt, Germany\nMay 12, 2023\n\nIt is a pleasure to be with you here today.1 This symposium, focused on building the\nfinancial system of the twenty-first century, is very timely. Given the recent banking system\nstress many are welcoming a fresh look at whether the Dodd-Frank era changes to the financial\nsystem and the approach to supervision and regulation have kept pace with the evolving nature\nof banking, the evolving culture of banking, and how the risks of bank runs today have evolved\nto be meaningfully different from what we’ve seen in the past. While my remarks will largely\nfocus on the United States, the lens through which regulators and policymakers should view\nthese issues has some broader applicability and is worthy of an ongoing discussion.\nI will begin by offering a few thoughts on U.S. monetary policy. At our most recent\nmeeting last week, in light of the ongoing unacceptably high inflation, the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC) increased the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points.\nWith this increase, the FOMC has raised the federal funds rate by 5 percentage points since\nMarch of last year. These increases, combined with the runoff of our balance sheet, are having\nthe desired effect of tightening financial conditions. In my view, our policy stance is now\nrestrictive, but whether it is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down remains uncertain.\nSome signs of slowing in aggregate demand, lower numbers of job openings and more modest\ngross domestic product (GDP) growth indicate that we have moved into restrictive territory. But\ninflation remains much too high, and measures of core inflation have remained persistently\nelevated, with declining unemployment and ongoing wage growth. And, as senior loan officers\nsignaled beginning last summer, credit has continued to tighten.2 I expect this trend will\ncontinue given increased bank funding costs and reduced levels of liquidity.\n1 The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee or the Board of Governors.\n2 See Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/data/sloos.htm.\n\n- 2 -\nWhile the U.S. banking and financial system remains sound and resilient, the recent\nfailures of three U.S. banks with unique risk profiles have added to the uncertainty surrounding\nthe economic outlook. This uncertainty is further complicated by stock price movements among\nregional banks.\nShould inflation remain high and the labor market remain tight, additional monetary\npolicy tightening will likely be appropriate to attain a sufficiently restrictive stance of monetary\npolicy to lower inflation over time. I also expect that our policy rate will need to remain\nsufficiently restrictive for some time to bring inflation down and create conditions that will\nsupport a sustainably strong labor market. Of course, the economic outlook is uncertain and our\npolicy actions are not on a preset course. I will consider the incoming economic and financial\ndata during the intermeeting period and its implications for the economic outlook in determining\nmy view of the appropriate stance of monetary policy. I will look for signs of consistent\nevidence that inflation is on a downward path when considering future rate increases and at what\npoint we will have achieved a sufficiently restrictive stance for the policy rate. In my view, the\nmost recent CPI and employment reports have not provided consistent evidence that inflation is\non a downward path, and I will continue to closely monitor the incoming data as I consider the\nappropriate stance of monetary policy going into our June meeting.\nMy remarks today will address the recent bank failures in the United States and how the\nevolution of the banking industry has influenced and amplified bank deposit run risk. I will then\ndiscuss supervision, regulation, bank management culture, and technology, and how each of\nthese changes the dynamics of our approach to building a stronger and more resilient financial\nsystem. Finally, I will close with my views on the importance of approaching the future in a\ndeliberate, evidence focused, and thoughtful manner.\n\n- 3 -\nThe Evolving Context of Banking and Bank Failures\nThose who are involved in the business of banking will not find this shocking, but it is a\nfundamental fact that banking involves risk. It is inherent in, and foundational to, the business of\nbanking: banks take demand deposits—a short-term liability—and make term loans—creating a\nlong-term asset. Absent this intentional risk-taking, banks could not play their indispensable role\nof credit provision in the economy. There are many other risks, with the specific risks that banks\nface today as varied as the wide range of bank business models. The most fundamental banking\nrisks include credit, concentration, interest rate, liquidity, cybersecurity, more recently\noperational risk and, of course, the risk of contagion.\nBanking simply cannot work in its current and historical form without risk, so unless the\ngoal is to change the nature of banking, the task of policymakers and regulators is not to\neliminate risk from the banking system, but rather to ensure that risk is appropriately and\neffectively managed. Fundamentally, this is the basis for the bank regulatory frameworks that\nexist around the world. In countries with well-functioning and appropriately regulated banking\nsystems, banks serve an indispensable role in credit provision and economic stability. The goal\nis to create and maintain a system that supports prudent banking practices, and results in the\nimplementation of appropriate risk management. No efficient banking system can eliminate all\nbank failures. But well-designed and well-maintained systems can limit bank failures and\nmitigate the harm caused by any that occur.\nIn practice, the “maintenance” of the bank regulatory and supervisory framework has\noften been challenging, in part because maintenance requires vigilance in responding to evolving\ncircumstances and risks. Lapses in this effort are revealed when something breaks, which could\ninclude fragilities resulting from the emergence of unidentified risks and financial stability\n\n- 4 -\nthreats; banking practices that expose shortcomings in the supervisory framework; or\npolicymakers, regulators, and/or examiners who have lost sight of the fundamental goal of\nencouraging prudent banking practices and appropriate risk management.\nThe need for maintenance of the U.S. bank regulatory and supervisory framework has\ncome into stark relief with the failures of two large banks in March, followed by a third at the\nbeginning of May. The future and current policy choices made in responding to these failures\nwill have important consequences for the U.S. banking system. Including the extent to which\nbank regulation will continue to drive banking activities from regulated banks and into shadow\nbanks. While shoring up the resiliency of the banking sector is important, it is also important\nthat we consider the consequences of any regulatory change.\nBefore discussing the direction of policy, I think it’s imperative that we pause and\nconsider where we are and what has changed.\nThe Failure of Silicon Valley Bank\nAs financial services have evolved to meet the demands and expectations of sophisticated\nand wealthy businesses and individuals, risks inherent in the very nature of these services—\ninstant accessibility and transferability of funds—created the potential for instability at an\nextensive and accelerated scale. For Silicon Valley Bank in particular, while the run was ignited\nby traditional concerns, it was much faster than previous bank runs, was fueled by the most\nmodern communication methods and social media, and was enabled through new technology that\nallows customers to move money on a scale and at a velocity not previously accessible directly\nto customers.\nOn Thursday, March 9, SVB experienced a deposit outflow of more than $40 billion, and\nmore than $100 billion was anticipated in queue for outflow on Friday, March 10. Let’s consider\n\n- 5 -\nthis in comparison to past bank failures and the pace and size of deposit outflows. Prior to SVB,\nthe largest bank failure in U.S. history was the failure of Washington Mutual, which experienced\ntwo periods of large deposit outflows, the first lasted 23 days with outflows of $9.1 billion, and\nthe second $18.7 billion over 16 days.3 In other bank failures resulting from deposit runs,\ndeposits flowed out of the bank in significantly smaller volumes and over much longer time\nhorizons than SVB experienced on March 9 and 10.4\nThe recent bank runs have many familiar elements. SVB relied on funding from\nextremely large deposits of technology and health care sector firms, which were mostly\nuninsured (more than 95 percent) and held in transaction accounts. In traditional banking,\nuninsured depositors have historically been exposed to credit risk on their bank deposits, which\nprovides some incentive for them to impose market discipline on the bank, such as by\ndiscouraging excessive risk-taking. As we were very recently reminded, a disproportionate\npercentage of uninsured depositors can also present risk, since they may have strong incentives\nto withdraw their funds at the slightest sign of actual or perceived bank stress. These dynamics\nand incentives are certainly not new but have featured prominently in past bank runs.5\nThe most significant shift has been one of speed. This is where modern technology has\nplayed a significant role, both in facilitating the transfer of funds and in the access to, and\nexpedited flow of, information among depositors.\n3 See Jonathan D. Rose, “Old-Fashioned Deposit Runs,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2015-111,\ntable 1 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, November 2015),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/feds/2015/files/2015111pap.pdf.\n4 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Financial Stability Report,” box 3.1. (Washington:\nBoard of Governors, May 2023), https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/financial-stability-report-\n20230508.pdf.\n5 See Rose, “Old-Fashioned Deposit Runs.”\n\n- 6 -\nEvolving Technology and Customer Expectations\nBack-end money transfer systems have been gradually shifting to real-time payments,\nwhich are immediately available to customers upon transfer, rather than being subject to a\nwaiting period while it is processed between financial institutions. Many bank websites provide\ncapabilities that appear to allow customers to initiate funds transfers in real time. Sophisticated\ncustomers that hold uninsured deposits also have tools at their disposal—like the ability to\ninitiate wire transfers between financial institutions—that allow faster transfers of funds.\nThe capacity to initiate transfers, and even the changed perceptions of customers that they\ncan move their funds at any time of day or night, have caused important structural shifts. Large\ndepositors may have less incentive to act as a force for market discipline, even for banks where\nthey hold large uninsured deposits in their operational accounts. These depositors have a\ncheaper and more efficient mechanism at their disposal to protect against credit risk—they can\npull their money out in banking’s new normal. These changes have exacerbated the potential\nflight risks of uninsured deposits, while changing some of the incentives for depositors imposing\nmarket discipline.\nBank Runs and the Rumor Mill\nThe speed and size of deposit withdrawals were a feature, not a cause, of the recent U.S.\nbank failures. We live in a world where a wide array of communication tools—text messaging,\ngroup chats, and social media postings—have enabled expedited, if not always more accurate,\ndissemination of information.\nThe spread of information has always played an important role in bank confidence and\nbank runs. When information is more readily and quickly accessible and shared among\n\n- 7 -\nshareholders, creditors, customers, and depositors, bank management needs to be attuned to how\nit communicates, especially when remediating identified weaknesses.\nThe failure of SVB illustrates this dynamic. Uninsured depositors were connected by a\nclosely linked network of business relationships and contacts, and strong ties with venture capital\nfund investors. The flow of information among these depositors—and the mechanisms that\npushed them to act collectively—seem apparent in retrospect, but the closely linked relationships\namong this group exacerbated the risks involved in SVB’s public communication of its\nremediation strategy.\nBut while the risk of uninsured depositors acting collectively was a significant\nvulnerability, communications from management caused this group to begin to withdraw their\ndeposits on a massive scale and in a coordinated fashion. We know that there were many\nsupervisory issues at SVB over several years. At the time the bank failed, it had been selling\nsecurities to improve liquidity and raising capital to address some of these fundamental\nweaknesses in its funding and liquidity. Simply the act of announcing that the bank’s\nmanagement was taking steps to remediate these issues created panic—highlighting the risks\nthey were confronting—and the panic spread quickly.\nSocial media has also played a role in fueling stock price volatility, which can lead to\nother risks to a bank. In October of last year, rumors circulated about Credit Suisse’s stock price\nconflating stock price with capital and liquidity strength. Despite Credit Suisse management’s\nefforts to intervene and calm markets, its stock experienced significant volatility, resulting in an\nincrease in the spreads on the firm’s credit default swaps and a decrease in the value of its bonds.\nCredit Suisse had been dealing with significant issues for an extended period of time, but this\nincident highlighted how quickly investor sentiment can change in the age of social media.\n\n- 8 -\nBank Culture and Mindset\nA more subtle way we are seeing banking evolve is most evident in the “culture” of\nbanking for those banks whose business models directly involve funders of startups,\ntransformative new technologies, or novel activities like digital and crypto assets. For many\nbanks, innovation has been a long-term priority because it enables them to offer customers new\nproducts and services and remain competitive in the current financial services environment.6 But\nregardless of the business model, the culture of a bank must also prioritize the values and rules\nthat make banks successful over time. This includes not only being responsive to the needs of\ntheir customers and communities, but also maintaining a strong risk-management culture.\nThe expansion from traditional bank business models brings an influx of non-bankers\ninto bank management. Over the past several years, there have been a number of charter-strip\nacquisitions, where a new management group transforms a traditional bank’s business model.\nAnd we have seen consistent growth in banking-as-a-service partnerships—where the bank\npartners with a nonbank company, often a fintech, to offer new products and services. Even\nwithout these external influences, bankers who leverage innovation as a significant aspect of\ntheir business model often have a mindset that is compatible with continued innovation and are\nless sensitive to regulatory and supervisory communications. I view these trends as part of a\ncultural shift within these banks.\nSome innovators espouse an “ask for forgiveness, not permission” mentality when it\ncomes to regulation and compliance. This is a particularly dangerous mindset when it comes to\nbanking. Bank supervisors often rely on their interactions with bankers to communicate\n6 See Michelle W. Bowman, “The Innovation Imperative: Modernizing Traditional Banking” Speech at the\nIndependent Community Bankers of America ICBA Live 2023 Conference, Honolulu, Hawaii (March 14, 2023),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20230314a.pdf.\n\n- 9 -\nsupervisory concerns. This enables supervisors to provide feedback to bank management before\nthese issues escalate and are cited in examination reports and as Matters Requiring Attention\n(MRAs), Matters Requiring Immediate Attention (MRIAs), or enforcement actions. But bank\nmanagement must be receptive to these supervisory messages and should take proactive\nmeasures to address the issues identified. This kind of proactive approach may not be the most\nnatural reaction for those who have been successful in a less-regulated tech or start-up\nenvironment.\nThe Policy Response\nGiven the recent banking sector stress, it is clear that we need to review the bank\nregulatory and supervisory framework to determine whether updates are needed. As we consider\npotential changes to improve supervision and regulation, we should start from a baseline\nunderstanding of the available tools and determine whether those tools have been utilized and\nimplemented effectively. Before regulators seek new tools, it is necessary to understand the\nneed—how would the use of those new tools address deficiencies in the existing regulatory\ntoolkit? Imposing additional requirements on regulated institutions without understanding this\nneed results in additional costs and can have unintended consequences like encouraging bank\nconsolidation and constraining credit availability to critical business activities or geographies. In\naddition to these unintended consequences, we also need to carefully consider the broader\nimplications of regulatory change for financial stability.\nThe policy response to a crisis should be multifaceted, as changes to different elements of\nsupervision and regulation in combination may be the most efficient and effective response. We\nshould have no illusions that “getting it right”—finding the right combination of regulatory and\n\n- 10 -\nsupervisory changes—is a simple task. This fine tuning is a core element of maintaining an\neffective system, constantly re-evaluating whether our tools are effective and used appropriately.\nThere are a few specific areas where I see a need to revisit our approach, specifically in\nsupervision, regulation, and technology.\nSupervision\nStarting with supervision, effective bank supervision requires both transparency in\nexpectations, and an assertive supervisory approach when firms fail to meet these expectations.\nIn the past, I have spoken about the virtue of transparency in supervision.7 Transparency\nin supervisory expectations builds legitimacy, promotes a compliance culture, and is critical to\nensuring that we preserve due process. Transparency between a bank and its examiners can be a\nprofoundly effective tool by allowing bankers to air issues early with their examiners. This type\nof communication promotes understanding—of the bank and its operation by examination staff,\nand of regulatory expectations by the bank’s management and board of directors. Amorphous\nstandards or standards that change without prior notice frustrate this goal.\nIf regulators are clear in our expectations with banks, and banks fail to meet those\nexpectations, regulators are well-positioned to take strong action and demand remediation of\nsupervisory issues. When a bank fails to promptly address identified issues, the bank and the\nbanking system run the risk that those issues can become far more damaging over time. There is\na significant cost to delay.\nWhile the specific timelines for remediation of supervisory issues vary significantly\nacross firms, the Board has published statistics on the number of and general nature of\n7 See Michelle W. Bowman, “Independence, Predictability, and Tailoring in Banking Regulation and Supervision,”\nSpeech to the American Bankers Association Community Banking Conference, Orlando, Florida (February 13,\n2023), https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20230213a.pdf.\n\n- 11 -\nsupervisory findings, and how those have evolved over time.8 Remediation of technology\ninfrastructure, data, and operational resilience issues often take longer to address than those in\nother business areas or related to risk management.9 Some variability is reasonable as these\nissues vary in complexity. And, to the extent that a bank is reliant on third parties, core\nproviders, or others to help remediate issues, providing sufficient remediation time can be\nnecessary and appropriate.\nProviding time to remediate issues should not be a pretext for inaction or inattention to\nimportant supervisory issues. Ultimately, one of the primary goals of supervision is to hold the\nbank accountable for safety and soundness and consumer compliance. Accountability is critical\nfor both the bank and for supervisors. Where regulators have failed in supervision, we must hold\nourselves accountable.\nPart of the solution to inaction may simply be to take a stronger approach when\nexaminers have identified deficiencies in need of remediation. But for some banks,\nmanagement’s responsiveness to supervision—traditionally an area that rewarded conservative\nand prudent management—has changed, with a greater emphasis on innovation, especially those\nthat promise to transform the business of banking.\nThese shifts impact supervision, in that we need to reevaluate the effectiveness of formal\nand informal enforcement mechanisms. If moral suasion as an informal tool is less effective, and\nbank management and boards are less attuned to hear and respond to supervisory messages, we\nneed to reconsider our supervisory toolkit. This may mean taking more formal remediation\n8 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Supervision and Regulation Report” (Washington:\nBoard of Governors, November 2022), https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/202211-supervision-and-\nregulation-report.pdf.\n9 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Supervision and Regulation Report.\n\n- 12 -\nmeasures, with definitive timelines, and imposing meaningful consequences for firms that fail to\nremediate issues in a timely way.\nIn addition to being transparent, supervision must be nimble and responsive because the\nfinancial services landscape and bank risks evolve over time. The low interest rate environment\nfollowing the 2008 financial crisis shifted the supervisory focus away from interest rate risk to\nother risks, just as the current rising rate environment required supervisors to return to interest\nrate and emerging credit risk.10\nSupervision must also complement regulation. While regulation is a critical tool, it\noperates with a significant lag for most developed banking systems. This is where supervision\ncan complement regulation to address emerging threats and risks by allowing supervisors to\npivot to those fundamental risks that may be most salient based on that bank’s business model\nand evolving economic conditions.\nRegulation\nIn response to the recent bank failures, it is tempting to engage in a wholesale revision of\nthe bank regulatory framework. Before changing rules, we need to take a critical look at actual\nweaknesses, and acknowledge the strengths that should be preserved.\nAs a threshold matter, today’s regulatory system is fundamentally strong. But as the\nFederal Reserve continues to carefully monitor developments and changes to the banking\n10 Starting in the summer of 2022, the Federal Reserve took important steps to implement this shift in priorities for\nthe regional banking organization portfolio (which includes banking institutions with between $10 billion to $100\nbillion in assets), and community banking organization portfolio (which includes banking institutions with less than\n$10 billion in assets). These efforts culminated in internal outreach to examiners and external outreach to banks in\nboth the RBO and CBO portfolios to promote awareness and proactive management of these risks in the fall of\n2022. See, e.g., Ask the Fed, a Program of the Federal Reserve System, “A Discussion of Unrealized Losses at\nCommunity Banks in a Rising Interest Rate Environment” (December 16, 2022); Community Bank Connections,\n“2022 Year-End Message from Governor Bowman” (“… banks with unrealized securities losses need to carefully\nconsider the potential impact of holding securities with below-market interest rates, including, among other things,\nthe impact on their liquidity, capital, and earnings.”); and Ask the Fed, a Program of the Federal Reserve System,\n“Risk Considerations in a Rising Rate Environment: Applying a Sound Supervisory Approach (April 11, 2023).\n\n- 13 -\nsystem, we must recognize that the regulatory framework has been transformed through a broad\nrange of changes in response to the 2008 financial crisis. These changes have led to a strong and\nresilient banking system. Overall, our regulatory framework is also strong. This framework has\nmaterially increased bank capital and liquidity and added a number of other requirements to\nimprove resiliency, including new stress testing and resolution planning requirements.\nFollowing the 2008 crisis, the U.S. regulators implemented changes designed to improve\nthe quality and quantity of bank capital. This included the introduction of common equity tier 1\n(CET1) as a measure of the highest quality form of regulatory capital, and the capital\nconservation buffer. Today, large U.S. banks are also subject to additional capital requirements,\nbased on the tiering framework. For all banks with over $100 billion in assets, the requirements\ninclude the stress capital buffer and a number of additional GSIB and large firm-specific\nrequirements. The U.S. capital requirements are described as “gold plating” the standards set in\nthe Basel III reforms.\nThis is today’s starting point, and it is strong. With the commitment of U.S. regulators to\nimplement Basel III capital reforms, there will soon be additional changes to the capital\nframework.11 I would like to better understand the U.S. approach to these reforms before\npassing judgement, but if changes are implemented in a way that takes costs and benefits into\nconsideration and preserves capital neutrality, in my view, these reforms could improve the\ncapital framework.\nPrior to 2008, there were also no standardized, quantitative liquidity requirements for\nU.S. banks and their holding companies. Today, there are two: the Liquidity Coverage Ratio,\n11 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency, “Agencies Reaffirm Commitment to Basel III Standards” joint press release\n(September 9, 2022), https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20220909a.htm.\n\n- 14 -\nwhich supports short-term resilience by requiring banks to have liquidity to cover net cash\noutflows in a 30-day stress period; and the Net Stable Funding Ratio, which requires firms to\nmaintain stable funding over a one-year time horizon. There are also internal liquidity stress\ntesting and liquidity buffer requirements.\nWith this in mind, we should be careful and intentional about any significant changes to\nthe regulatory framework, including imposing new requirements that will materially increase\nfunding costs, like higher capital requirements or the requirement of firms to issue long-term\ndebt. Many of the issues related to the recent bank failures have been identified in bank\nmanagement and supervision. Therefore, a broad-based imposition of new capital requirements\non all banks with more than $50 billion in assets would be a far more costly solution than taking\nthe time to specifically identify and address known management and supervisory process issues.\nRelying on the timeless adage to guide us: if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.\nI do not mean to suggest that regulation has worked perfectly and needs no improvement\nor maintenance. I think where we find improvements are necessary, we should make them. But\nwe should also be working toward a defined goal and verifiable end state that incorporates the\nprinciple of efficiency. And of course, regulation should be durable throughout the economic\ncycle. Our regulatory framework is extremely complex with many overlapping and sometimes\ncontradictory requirements. Engaging in a piece by piece, regulation by regulation approach will\nlikely have a similar outcome.\nTechnology\nWe should also review and update the Fed services available to support banking system\nresiliency. In payments, the Federal Reserve offers payments-related services including\nFedwire® to facilitate wire transfers. In the U.S., the Federal Reserve serves as the “lender of\n\n- 15 -\nlast resort” to the banking system, providing loans at the discount window since the early part of\nthe twentieth century.\nThese tools are important but are not effective mechanisms to rescue troubled\ninstitutions. Discount window lending is available only to institutions that meet certain\nminimum eligibility standards, and that have collateral available to pledge. Its function is to\nprovide a solvent institution with a vital backup source of liquidity to meet unexpected customer\noutflows. Similarly, the ability to process fast, efficient payments can also facilitate effective\nmarket functioning, but its utility is limited.\nIn light of the extensive recent use of these tools and the lessons that can be learned, I\nthink it is time to review these tools—which operate during limited, fixed hours and rely to some\nextent on dated technology—to determine whether they have kept up with the pace of change for\nthe future payments landscape and expectations of liquidity planning. These tools must be\nnimble and flexible to support the banking system during times of stress. I think it is important\nthat we understand how well these tools functioned in early March as two U.S. banks\nexperienced stress and ultimately failed, and what can be improved regarding timeliness or\neffectiveness of fulfilling the lender of last resort function.\nThe Path Forward\nMy views on the path forward are informed by serving as the bank commissioner for the\nstate of Kansas as its lead regulator and supervisor, my experience as a banker, and especially by\nmy service on the Board of Governors since 2018, during a time when the banking system has\nexperienced many unique stresses including those associated with the COVID pandemic. There\nhave already been some preliminary and expedited internal reports published on the failures of\nSVB and Signature Bank, and I fully expect to see additional reports and analysis of these\n\n- 16 -\nfailures, and the failure of First Republic, in the coming months.12 These preliminary reviews\nare an important first step for the U.S. bank regulators working to identify root causes of these\nbank failures and holding themselves accountable for supervisory mistakes. There are additional\nsteps that we can take.\nFirst, I believe that the Federal Reserve should engage an independent third party to\nprepare a report to supplement the limited internal review to fully understand the failure of SVB.\nThis would be a logical next step in holding ourselves accountable and would help to eliminate\nthe doubts that may naturally accompany any self-assessment prepared and reviewed by a single\nmember of the Board of Governors.13 This external independent report should also cover a\nbroader time period, including the events of the weekend following the failure of SVB, and a\nbroader range of topics beyond just the regulatory and supervisory framework that applied to\nSVB, including operational issues, if any, with discount window lending, Fedwire services, and\nwith the transfer of collateral from the Federal Home Loan Banks.\nSecond, I believe we need to do a better job identifying the most salient issues and\nmoving quickly to remediate them. It is clearly evident that both supervisors and bank\nmanagement neglected key, long-standing risk factors that should be an area of focus in any\nexamination. These include concentration risk, liquidity risk, and interest rate risk. We have the\n12 See Government Accountability Office, “Bank Regulation: Preliminary Review of Agency Actions Related to\nMarch 2023 Bank Failures” GAO-23-106736 (Washington: Government Accountability Office, April 2023),\nhttps://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-23-106736.pdf; Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, “FDIC’s Supervision of\nSignature Bank” (Washington: Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, April 28, 2023),\nhttps://www.fdic.gov/news/press-releases/2023/pr23033a.pdf; Michael Barr, Vice Chair for Supervision of the\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Review of the Federal Reserve’s Supervision and Regulation\nof Silicon Valley Bank” (April 28, 2023), https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/svb-review-\n20230428.pdf.\n13 As noted in Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr’s review of the supervision and regulation of Silicon Valley\nBank, “[the] report was written with the benefit of hindsight on the particular facts and circumstances that proved\nmost relevant for SVB and SVBFG.

This will likely include a broad range of topics, including\ntaking a close look at deposit insurance reform, the treatment of uninsured deposits, and a\nreconsideration of current deposit insurance limits.14 We should avoid using these bank failures\nas a pretext to push for other, unrelated changes to banking regulation. Our focus should be on\nremediating known, identified issues with bank supervision and issues that emerge from the\npublic autopsy of these events.\nA debate about regulatory changes must also consider where we are today as compared to\nprior to the 2008 financial crisis. The banking system is strong and resilient despite recent\nbanking stress. The Fed has refined regulatory standards over time at the direction of Congress,\nmost recently pursuant to the bipartisan Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer\nProtection Act,15 and through so-called “tailoring” regulations designed to better align regulation\nwith risk. Even with the implementation of these changes, banks today are better capitalized,\nwith more liquidity, and are subject to a new range of supervisory tools that did not exist prior to\n2008. This paints a picture of a banking system that is not only strong today but is well prepared\nto continue supporting the provision of credit and the broader economy.\nCalls for radical reform of the bank regulatory framework—as opposed to targeted\nchanges to address identified root causes of banking system stress—are incompatible with the\n14 See Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, “Options for Deposit Insurance Reform” (Washington: Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation, May 1, 2023), https://www.fdic.gov/analysis/options-deposit-insurance-\nreforms/report/options-deposit-insurance-reform-full.pdf.\n15 Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, Public Law No. 115-174, 132 Stat. 1296\n(2018).\n\n- 18 -\nfundamental strength of the banking system. I am extremely concerned about calls for casting\naside tiering expectations for less complex institutions, given the clear statutory direction to\nprovide for appropriately calibrated requirements for these banks.\nI have heard the drumbeat calling for broad, fundamental reforms for the past several\nyears, shifting away from tailoring and risk-based supervision. I believe this is the wrong\ndirection for any conversation about banking reform. The unique nature and business models of\nthe banks that recently failed, in my view, do not justify imposing new, overly complex\nregulatory and supervisory expectations on a broad range of banks. If we allow this to occur, we\nwill end up with a system of significantly fewer banks serving significantly fewer customers.\nThose who will likely bear the burden of this new banking system are those at the lower end of\nthe economic spectrum, both individuals and businesses.\nThe American economy relies on a broad and diverse range of businesses supported by a\nbroad and diverse range of banks. The elimination of regional banks from the US banking\nsystem would be devastating to businesses and communities across America. Especially for\nthose regions whose communities are not sufficiently served by larger institutions.\nI appreciate your time and engagement, and I look forward to discussing how the\nparticipants view these issues, and what it might mean for the future of banking in your financial\nsystems.",

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\n(via pre-recorded video)\nat\nEconomic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act Outreach Meeting\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\nKansas City, Missouri\nOctober 30, 2025\n\nGood morning and welcome to the third public outreach meeting hosted by the\nfederal banking agencies related to the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork\nReduction Act (EGRPRA).1 The bank regulatory system has grown extensively in recent\nyears and has become overly complicated with often conflicting and overlapping\nrequirements. The growth of these requirements has imposed unnecessary and significant\ncosts on banks and their customers. I have spoken about my principles for supervision\nand regulation, which will continue to guide my approach to supervision and the bank\nregulatory framework. At the core of these principles is pragmatism, which focuses on\nfirst identifying the problem each new and existing regulation intends to solve and then\nreviewing and updating regulations as industries and conditions change. Once we have\nidentified a need for reform, or a problem to be solved, our next task is to conduct a\ncareful analysis of the intended and unintended consequences of any proposed policy\nsolution and to consider alternative approaches that lead to lower costs or better\noutcomes.\nThe EGRPRA process is the opportunity to do just this—take a step back and\nreview our frameworks with fresh eyes to eliminate unnecessary and outdated regulations\nand reduce burden. The bank regulatory framework must strike a balance between\nencouraging economic growth and innovation while guaranteeing the safety, soundness,\nand stability of the banking system.\nOne of the primary goals of the EGRPRA process is to maintain the regulatory\nframework to ensure it continues to be fit for purpose. As I’ve noted previously, system\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nmaintenance is something we should embrace. When regulators establish rules and\nguidance, they devote significant time, resources, and analysis to evaluate the costs and\nbenefits of new proposals. However, insufficient focus is given to updating and refining\nthese frameworks. Ideally, regulators should be adapting the regulatory structure to\nensure the existing plumbing continues to work, considering how different regulations\ninteract with each other, reflecting changes in the evolving financial landscape, or\naccommodating innovations such as new financial products, services, or market\nparticipants. So, our work to maintain an effective bank regulatory framework is never\nreally complete. If regulators do not consistently reassess what is already in place, it can\nprevent us from meeting our statutory obligation to promote a safe and sound banking\nsystem that enables banks to serve their customers effectively and efficiently.\nOver time, some of our regulations have unduly restrained the activities that\nbanks can engage in, incentivizing banks to limit those activities and pushing those\nfunctions outside of the banking system. We need to ask whether this is appropriate.\nSimilarly, the buildup of complexity in our regulatory system is also felt most acutely by\ncommunity banks. When our regulatory system is not appropriately tailored to the size,\nrisk, complexity, and business model of the institutions we supervise and regulate, we\nimpede the effectiveness of their operations. This can result in preventing banks from\nproviding competitive products and services, innovating, and engaging in appropriate\nrisk-taking. Incorporating graduated requirements avoids disproportionately burdening\nsmaller institutions.\nThe current EGRPRA review is the third time the agencies have undertaken a\ncomprehensive review of the bank regulatory system. The two prior reviews were\n\n- 3 -\nunderwhelming, resulting in no reduction in regulatory burden. This is an unacceptable\noutcome. We must take this process seriously, and through it, actually identify\nopportunities for change that will have lasting impact. We are implementing the current\nprocess to provide meaningful engagement for stakeholders to identify regulatory\nchanges that result in less complexity, lower compliance costs, and increased efficiency\nwhile also maintaining safety and soundness.\nAs part of the current review, the agencies have issued four Federal Register\nnotices and held two virtual outreach meetings. We have received comments from many\nstakeholders including banks, trade groups, and community organizations. This broad\nrange of commenters demonstrates the important role of the banking system in the lives\nof all Americans. We must strike the right balance and be responsive to public comments\nand through outreach meetings like this meeting today.\nA significant portion of the comments received so far highlight areas of regulation\nthat I have targeted for revisiting. Many of the Board’s regulations have not been\ncomprehensively reviewed or updated in more than 20 years. Given the dynamic nature\nof the banking system and how the economy and banking industry have evolved over that\nperiod, we should update and simplify many of the Board’s regulations, including\nthresholds for applicability and benchmarks. These thresholds should also be indexed to\naccount for economic growth and inflation.\nCommenters have offered suggestions to address a number of areas, including\nissues with the Board’s supervisory framework, regulatory capital, and the applications\nprocess. They have also discussed more specific issues ranging from outdated guidelines\non loans to insiders, bank activities, and anti-money laundering requirements. Many\n\n- 4 -\ncommenters have also remarked on the excessive burden created by information and\nregulatory data collections, with an emphasis on the Call Report and other information\ncollections. We are carefully considering these comments and are evaluating ways to\naddress related unnecessary regulatory burdens.\nWith this feedback in mind, the Board is already working to update and\nstreamline many of these requirements. For example, on regulatory capital, we are\npursuing several initiatives, including considering modifications to the Community Bank\nLeverage Ratio, changes to our stress testing process to reduce volatility of capital\nrequirements, and making proposed changes to the enhanced supplementary leverage\nratio. The Board also recently issued an FAQ to provide transparency and clarify the\nconsiderations a mutual banking organization should evaluate when proposing to issue a\nmutual capital instrument. We are also prioritizing work to assist in the fight against\nfraud and considering ways to streamline the mergers, acquisitions, and de-novo\nformations review and approval process.\nThe Board is also committed to refocusing our supervisory process on material\nfinancial risks rather than procedural or documentation issues and identifying and\neliminating the hidden costs and extra-regulatory burdens implemented through\nsupervision. As part of this initiative, the Board has initiated changes to our large bank\nratings framework to better align it with other supervisory ratings systems and ensure\nlarge banks’ ratings reflect their financial conditions and risks. In addition, we and the\nother FFIEC agencies are reviewing the CAMELS ratings system, which is long past due\nfor reform. The Board has also taken steps to ensure our supervisory framework is\nsupportive of innovation in the banking system, and we have ended the use of\n\n- 5 -\nreputational risk in our supervisory program to guarantee fair access to the banking\nsystem for all Americans.\nLooking ahead, the Board will review a broad set of issues to ensure our\nregulatory framework and supervisory approaches are appropriately tailored and\ntransparent. Through the EGRPRA process, we have a meaningful opportunity to reduce\nunnecessary and outdated regulatory requirements. Our responsibility is to promote\nsafety and soundness and consider the broader context of promoting an effective and\nefficient banking system that supports market functioning and encourages economic\ngrowth, business creation and expansion, and opportunity.\nI continue to prioritize outreach to banks of all sizes, especially community banks,\nbecause your voice must be a part of the conversation in Washington to shape a\nregulatory framework that fosters growth and innovation. We look forward to engaging\non your comments and concerns and constructive ideas for further improvements.\nThank you for your participation.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n9:30 a.m. EDT (8:30 a.m. CDT)\nAugust 17, 2022\nRemarks by\nMichelle W. Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nVenCent Fintech Summit\nLittle Rock, Arkansas\nAugust 17, 2022\n\nThank you, Commissioner Marshall, for the invitation to speak to you today. It’s really a\npleasure to be here, finally in person at the Venture Center.1 Much has happened over the past\nfew years, and I have been following your work closely.\nTechnology Is Changing Financial Services\nTechnology and innovation are a priority interest for my work at the Board of Governors.\nTechnology can offer increased speed, lower costs, and greater efficiency in providing services\nand products in the financial industry. This week’s conference agenda includes many of the\ntopics I follow closely through our work on innovation.\nMuch of the innovation in financial services is occurring in the nonbank sector, but\ntechnology is also changing the business of banking in profound ways. More and more\ncustomers interact with their banks exclusively through digital channels. They check their\nbalances, apply for credit cards, and make deposits and payments via their phones, rather than\nvisiting bank branches.\nBut the changes run deeper than that. Technology is also changing fundamental aspects\nof bank operations. For example, banks are beginning to use artificial intelligence (AI) in credit\nunderwriting, back-office operations, various aspects of risk management, and customer service.\nTechnology is also leading to new bank business models. Many banks are using\napplication programming interfaces and other technology to allow nonbank technology firms to\nprovide financial services. Under many of these arrangements, the technology firm maintains\nthe customer relationship, while the bank provides the underlying financial infrastructure,\nincluding deposit services and access to the payment rails.\n1 These remarks reflect my views and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of Governors or the\nFederal Open Market Committee. I am grateful for the assistance of Federal Reserve Board staff Jeff Ernst, Kavita\nJain, Molly Mahar, Jason Hinkle, and Kirstin Wells in preparing these remarks.\n\nFederal Reserve Support for Innovation\nThe Federal Reserve is monitoring these transformations closely, and we are encouraged\nby the potential for improvements that can be brought by responsible innovation.\nI think it is critically important for banking regulators to support innovation in banking.\nTraditionally, banking regulators may have viewed banking innovation solely as a risk on a long\nlist of risks that need to be appropriately managed. While that perspective won’t change, I\nrecognize that evolving consumer preferences are requiring banks to meet these technology-\nenabled expectations. It is true that new services and products present new risks, but these are\nnot unmanageable risks. And, frankly, there is greater risk in standing still—in not recognizing\nthe need to move forward. Failure to innovate can undermine a bank’s competitiveness, posing a\nthreat to safety and soundness just as innovating recklessly can. The Fed supports responsible\ninnovation in a variety of ways, and I will mention a few of them in this discussion.\nFor the past few years, I have been working to assist banks to address the challenges\nbrought by the process of partnering with a third-party service provider. Last year, the Fed,\nalong with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation, proposed interagency guidance to assist in the management of risks involved in\nthird-party engagement. The agencies received over 80 comment letters and are reviewing those\ncomments as we move toward finalizing the guidance. In my view, it is especially helpful to\nprovide clarity for banks in these kinds of relationships and to help them establish a solid\nfoundation as banks and fintechs continue to engage in partnerships.\nLast year at this time, the federal banking agencies released a guide designed to assist\ncommunity banks to assess risks in constructing and considering relationships with fintech\ncompanies.\n\nAnd lastly, this past September, the Federal Reserve published a paper detailing industry\nperspectives and experiences on the different types of partnerships between community banks\nand fintech companies.2 We conducted extensive outreach with community banks, fintechs, and\nother stakeholders and incorporated real world experiences of the strategic and tactical decisions\nthat led to effective partnerships.\nFor the remainder of my remarks, I will focus on several issues that are likely top of mind\nfor those who are engaged in financial services innovation.\nCrypto-Assets\nLet’s start with digital and crypto-assets. I am hearing more discussions involving banks’\ninterest in offering services involving crypto-assets. The chatter seems to originate more from\nthose outside the banking industry, but I’ll put that aside for now.\nThere seem to be a number of reasons for this interest and why customers might seek to\nengage in this type of activity. First, although the interest seemed to have cooled lately, given\nrecent developments in the crypto industry, we have seen significant consumer demand for\nengagement in these types of services. It seems reasonable that because bank customers are\naware of crypto and have discussed these assets with their banks, banks want to better understand\nthis type of engagement and potentially provide those services to their customers.\nSecond, we have also been told that banks have observed their deposits flowing to\nnonbank crypto-asset firms and, understandably, would like to stem that outflow by offering the\nservices themselves. I certainly recognize and appreciate these challenges. But before a bank\nbegins to engage in or offer crypto-asset-related services, it must seriously and carefully consider\n2 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Reserve Publishes Paper Describing Landscape of\nPartnerships Between Community Banks and Fintech Companies, news release, September 9, 2021,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20210909a.htm.\n\nthe risks involved—both to the bank and its customers. The recent turmoil in the digital-asset\nindustry only underscores that point.\nFederal Reserve staff is working to articulate supervisory expectations for banks on a\nvariety of digital asset-related activities, including\n• custody of crypto-assets\n• facilitation of customer purchases and sales of crypto-assets\n• loans collateralized by crypto-assets, and\n• issuance and distribution of stablecoins by banking organizations.\nWe understand that everyone involved in this space is seeking clarity. One of the most\nimportant tools that we have as a regulator is the ability to clearly articulate our supervisory\nexpectations. It is also our most direct path to encouraging and supporting responsible\ninnovation.\nEarlier this week, we released supervisory guidance addressing banks that are engaging\nin or seeking to engage in crypto-asset related activities.3 This guidance will provide banks with\nadditional information about the risks of crypto activities and remind them to ensure that the\nactivities are legal, and they should have adequate systems, risk management, and controls in\nplace to conduct the activities in a safe and sound manner consistent with applicable law.\nCritically, one important element of this release is that firms should contact their supervisors\nabout these types of activities and expect that supervisory staff will provide timely feedback, as\nappropriate.\n3 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Reserve Board Provides Additional Information for\nBanking Organizations Engaging or Seeking to Engage in Crypto-Asset-Related Activities, news release, August 16,\n2022, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20220816a.htm.\n\nBased on my conversations with bankers across the country, I believe that providing the\nrules of the road—highlighting the risks we are most concerned about and laying out our\nexpectations for how those risks should be managed—is invaluable for banks considering\nwhether and how to innovate.\nArtificial Intelligence\nThe Federal Reserve is taking a similar approach with respect to banks’ use of AI. Last\nyear, the Fed joined with four other financial agencies to issue a Request for Information and\nComment on Financial Institutions’ Use of Artificial Intelligence, Including Machine Learning.4\nAs noted in that document, banks are using AI in a variety of ways, including fraud monitoring,\npersonalization of customer services, credit decisions, risk management, and textual analysis.\nThese applications of AI can, to varying degrees, involve risk-management challenges around\nissues such as explainability, data governance, cybersecurity, third-party risk management, and\nconsumer compliance.\nThe banking agencies received over 100 responses to the Request for Information. Those\nresponses give us a window into what questions banks need regulators to answer about using AI.\nFederal Reserve staff is working with the other regulators to provide further clarity in this area.\nPayments: FedNow and Central Bank Digital Currencies\nPayments is another area where innovation continues to flourish, and the Federal Reserve\nis actively engaged in shaping the future payments landscape.\nThe FedNowSM Service will enable financial institutions of every size, and in every\ncommunity across America, to provide safe and efficient instant payment services. It is intended\nto be a flexible, neutral platform that will support a broad variety of instant payments. It will\n4 86 Fed. Reg. 16,837.\n\nallow depository institutions and their service providers to offer value-added services to their\ncustomers, ultimately enhancing competition in the market for payment services. Completing\nand implementing FedNow is a high priority, and we expect it to be available by mid-2023.\nFedNow will help transform the way payments are made through new services that allow\nconsumers and businesses to make payments conveniently, in real time, on any day, and with\nimmediate availability of funds for receivers. Our assessment of these benefits has not changed\neven as we consider whether a central bank digital currency (CBDC) might fit into the future\nU.S. money and payments landscape.\nMy expectation is that FedNow addresses the issues that some have raised about the need\nfor a CBDC. As I’m sure you are already aware, earlier this year we published a discussion\npaper that outlined some design principles, costs, and benefits of a CBDC and solicited public\ncomments.5 We received over 2,000 comments, and we are currently reviewing these comments\nand plan to publish a summary of them.\nNovel Charters and Access to Federal Reserve Account Services\nBefore I wrap up, let me touch on one more topic that relates to innovation in bank\ncharter types.\nIn recent years, there has been an increase in novel charter types being authorized or\nconsidered across the country at the state and national levels. As a result, Federal Reserve Banks\nare receiving an increased number of inquiries and requests for access to Reserve Bank master\naccounts and financial services, which could provide those institutions with access to the nation’s\npayment system.\n5 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Money and Payments: The U.S. Dollar in the Age of Digital\nTransformation, January 2022, https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/money-and-payments-\n20220120.pdf.\n\nOn August 15, the Board of Governors published final guidelines that govern how\nReserve Banks will evaluate requests for account access. The guidelines take into account the\nBoard’s goals to (1) ensure the safety and soundness of the banking system; (2) effectively\nimplement monetary policy; (3) promote financial stability; (4) protect consumers; and (5)\npromote a safe, efficient, inclusive, and innovative payment system.6\nThe approach articulated in the guidelines is based on a foundation of risk management\nand mitigation, recognizing that access to Fed accounts and services can create significant risks.\nThe systematic evaluation of these different risks is intended to establish a framework ensuring\nsimilar treatment for legally eligible institutions with similar risk profiles across the Reserve\nBanks. For example, requests for accounts and services from non-federally insured institutions\nwould generally be subject to a higher standard of review. The Board expects Reserve Banks to\ncollaborate on reviews of account and service requests, and conduct ongoing monitoring of\napproved accountholders, to ensure that the guidelines are implemented in a consistent manner.\nPublishing the guidelines is an important step to providing transparency and consistency\nacross the Federal Reserve System. However, more work remains to be completed before a\nprocess is established to fully implement the guidelines. In the meantime, there is a risk that the\nguidelines could establish false expectations regarding the timeline for evaluating and acting on\nthese requests.\nIn closing, I’d like to once again thank the Venture Center for hosting this event and for\nproviding the opportunity to get together to discuss innovation in financial services. It’s great to\n6\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Reserve Board Announces Final Guidelines That\nEstablish a Transparent, Risk-Based, and Consistent Set of Factors for Reserve Banks to Use in Reviewing Requests\nto Access Federal Reserve Accounts and Payment Services, news release, August 15, 2022,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20220815a.htm.\n\nfinally be back in Little Rock and to have the chance to meet so many of you in person after such\na long time.

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nPennsylvania Bankers Association\n2024 Convention\nNashville, Tennessee\nMay 17, 2024\n\nI would like to thank the Pennsylvania Bankers Association for the invitation to join you\ntoday.1 I appreciate the opportunity to engage with you on matters that affect the banking\nindustry. Before sharing my thoughts about the current bank regulatory environment, I will\ndiscuss my views on the economy and monetary policy.\nUpdate on the Economy and Monetary Policy Outlook\nOver the past two years, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has significantly\ntightened the stance of monetary policy to address high inflation. At our meeting earlier this\nmonth, the FOMC voted to continue to hold the federal funds rate target range at 5¼ to 5½\npercent and to continue to reduce the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings, but at a slower pace\nbeginning in June.\nAfter seeing considerable progress on slowing inflation last year, we have not yet seen\nfurther progress this year. The 12-month measures of total and core personal consumption\nexpenditures (PCE) inflation have moved roughly sideways since December and remained\nelevated at 2.7 percent and 2.8 percent, respectively, in March. With average core consumer\nprice index (CPI) inflation this year through April running at an annualized rate of 4.3 percent,\nwell above average inflation in the second half of last year, I expect inflation to remain elevated\nfor some time.\nThe recent pickup seems to be evident across many goods and services categories,\nsuggesting that inflation was temporarily lower in the latter half of last year. Prices continue to\nbe much higher than before the pandemic, which is weighing on consumer sentiment. Inflation\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nhas hit lower-income households hardest since food, energy, and housing services price increases\nfar outpaced overall inflation throughout this episode.\nEconomic activity increased at a strong pace last year but may have moderated early this\nyear. First-quarter gross domestic product growth was temporarily dampened by volatile\ncategories, like inventories and net exports, and over the past few months, including recent data\nrevisions, consumers appear to have pulled-back on goods spending through April. Still,\nconsumer services spending has remained strong, and residential activity and business\ninvestment in equipment and intangibles strengthened.\nSo far this year, payroll employment has increased at a strong pace through April, partly\nreflecting increased immigrant labor supply. Although we have seen signs that the labor market\nis coming into better balance, progress has slowed. Recent employment reports continue to show\na tight labor market, and the unemployment rate remains below 4 percent, with the number of job\nopenings relative to unemployed workers still above its pre-pandemic level. Throughout last\nyear, the average pace of job gains slowed, and the labor force participation rate rose, but in\nrecent months, job growth has rebounded. Labor force participation flattened out around last\nyear’s peak, which suggests no further improvement in labor supply along this margin, as labor\nforce participation among those aged 55 and older has been persistently low.\nAt its current setting, our monetary policy stance appears to be restrictive, and I will\ncontinue to monitor the incoming data to assess whether monetary policy is sufficiently\nrestrictive to bring inflation down to our target. As I’ve noted recently, my baseline outlook\ncontinues to be that inflation will decline further with the policy rate held steady, but I still see a\nnumber of upside inflation risks that affect my outlook.\n\n- 3 -\nFirst, much of the progress on inflation last year was due to supply-side improvements,\nincluding easing of supply chain constraints; increases in the number of available workers, due in\npart to immigration; and lower energy prices. It is unclear whether further supply-side\nimprovements will continue to lower inflation. Geopolitical developments could also pose\nupside risks to inflation, including the risk that spillovers from regional conflicts could disrupt\nglobal supply chains, putting additional upward pressure on food, energy, and commodity prices.\nThere is also the risk that the loosening in financial conditions since late last year and additional\nfiscal stimulus could add momentum to demand, stalling any further progress or even causing\ninflation to reaccelerate.\nFinally, there is a risk that strong consumer demand for services, increased immigration,\nand continued labor market tightness could lead to persistently high core services inflation.\nGiven the current low inventory of affordable housing, the inflow of new immigrants to some\ngeographic areas could result in upward pressure on rents, as additional housing supply may take\ntime to materialize. Wage growth has remained at an elevated rate of about 4 to 5 percent, still\nhigher than the pace consistent with our 2 percent inflation goal given trend productivity growth.\nIn light of these risks, and the general uncertainty regarding the economic outlook, I will\ncontinue to watch the data closely as I assess the appropriate path of monetary policy. The\nfrequency and extent of data revisions over the past few years make the task of assessing the\ncurrent state of the economy and predicting how the economy will evolve even more\nchallenging. I will remain cautious in my approach to considering future changes in the stance\nof policy.\nIt is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course. My colleagues and I\nwill make our decisions at each FOMC meeting based on the incoming data and the implications\n\n- 4 -\nfor and risks to the outlook. While the current stance of monetary policy appears to be at a\nrestrictive level, I remain willing to raise the target range for the federal funds rate at a future\nmeeting should the incoming data indicate that progress on inflation has stalled or reversed.\nRestoring price stability is essential for achieving maximum employment over the longer run.\nBank Regulatory Reform\nTurning to the bank regulatory reform agenda, there has been a significant volume of\nmatters that have recently been completed, that have been proposed, and that are in the pipeline.\nA number of these efforts have been met with criticism and public resistance, from informal\ncomments and ad campaigns to formal legal challenges, including litigation challenging the\nvalidity of these reforms. Reasonable minds can disagree on the appropriate path forward for\nbank regulatory policy, but the current period of regulatory reform feels more contentious than in\nthe past.\nThe current regulatory agenda is notable for its broad scope, both for the institutions that\nwould be subject to reforms, and the nature of the reforms. The proposals touch on a wide range\nof topics that directly or indirectly impact banks of all sizes. And they often represent significant\nshifts in regulatory requirements and supervisory expectations. My remarks today highlight two\nthemes related to the significant number of regulatory changes and proposals under\nconsideration.\nFirst, the volume and scope of revisions affect a wide range of banking activities and\npose significant challenges for all bankers. Reviewing, understanding, and then implementing\nthese reforms will involve bank management, compliance, legal, audit, and even frontline staff.\nAt the same time, banks must also balance the existing and ongoing compliance obligations to\nmeet supervisory expectations. Compliance has always been an important bank function, and it\n\n- 5 -\noften involves a shared responsibility and obligation across many different business lines and\npersonnel. Simply keeping up with the thousands of pages of new regulatory reforms poses a\nsignificant challenge, especially for banks with small staffs and a single compliance officer.\nThose same staff members, with already heavy compliance responsibilities, are also often\nbest positioned to provide feedback on pending regulatory proposals. Banker comments shared\nas part of the administrative rulemaking process help inform and influence proposals that are\nunder consideration. If there is a desire to influence change, stakeholders must engage and\nprovide input during this process.\nSecond, the large number of finalized, proposed, and potential changes suggest a lack of\nprioritization—whether we have effectively identified actual risks to the banking system and\ndevoted resources to the most pressing of these issues. Prioritization is something I have spoken\nabout at length in the past, and it remains just as critical today.2\nThe banking stress last spring revealed the presence of flaws and shortcomings in our\nbank regulatory and supervisory framework. A lack of prioritization in our approach risks losing\nfocus on making substantively responsive adjustments and reforms.\nOpportunities for Engagement\nReviewing and commenting on regulatory proposals should never be a distraction from a\nbanker’s core responsibility to ensure the bank continues serving its customers in a safe and\nsound manner, and in compliance with applicable laws. So, I do not want any of you to take my\nremarks today as a call to drop everything you are doing and open up the Federal Register and\n2 Michelle W. Bowman, “Remarks on the Economy and Prioritization of Bank Supervision and Regulation” (speech\nat the New York Bankers Association’s Financial Services Forum, Palm Beach, FL, November 9, 2023),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20231109a.pdf; Michelle W. Bowman, “Tailoring,\nFidelity to the Rule of Law, and Unintended Consequences” (speech at the Harvard Law School Faculty Club,\nCambridge, MA, March 5, 2024), https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20240305a.pdf.\n\n- 6 -\nstart reading. The banking system is a highly regulated environment, and as you see in your\nwork every day, requires banks to devote significant resources to compliance. A strong culture\nof compliance can help keep your bank safe, and in the aggregate promotes a safe and sound\nbanking system. Within a bank, virtually everyone has a role to play in promoting that culture of\ncompliance with applicable law, all while serving your customers.\nBut stakeholders, including bankers, have an important role in the stewardship of the\nbanking system that goes beyond compliance—namely, participating in the administrative\nrulemaking process. It is critical that you share your views with policymakers on regulatory\nreform proposals. All the comments, data, and analysis from commenters enable policymakers\nto make informed decisions throughout the rulemaking process, from the initial brainstorming\nstage, through the creation of a proposal, and in crafting a final rule.\nThis feedback is equally critical in understanding how the supervisory process is working\nas it evolves over time and incorporates new standards and expectations. Information about the\nintended and unintended impacts of reform initiatives is especially informative. Often, private-\nsector stakeholders are best positioned to understand and explain these impacts, and to identify\ngaps in the context, data, and analysis underpinning these initiatives.\nI recognize that in some instances, multiple, interrelated proposals out for comment at the\nsame time complicate or even frustrate the ability to provide meaningful feedback. For example,\nthe federal banking regulators have proposed significant reforms to capital requirements, while\nalso proposing new long-term debt requirements for banks with over $100 billion in assets.\nWhile these efforts are on their face distinct, the calibration of such requirements are directly\nlinked. The calibration of capital requirements is used to set long-term debt requirements.\nTherefore, these proposals present challenges not only to regulators, but also to public\n\n- 7 -\ncommenters trying to understand the potential and complete impact of reforms. Even so, I\nstrongly encourage your participation to inform the rulemaking process.\nI will share my views on a few of these proposals, but I certainly do not mean to suggest\nthat this list is exhaustive. All the proposals could benefit from public feedback.\nBank Mergers and Acquisitions\nSome prudential regulators and other policymakers are currently reconsidering the\napproach to the review and approval of bank mergers and acquisitions (M&A).3 M&A\ntransactions allow banks to evolve and thrive in our dynamic banking system and can promote\nthe long-term health and viability of banks. M&A also ensures that banks have a meaningful\npath to transitioning bank ownership. The absence of a viable M&A framework increases the\npotential for additional risks, including limited opportunities for succession planning, especially\nin smaller or rural communities when zombie banks continue to exist but have no competitive\nviability or exit strategy.\nThe impact of a more restrictive M&A framework affects institutions of all sizes,\nincluding larger institutions that are vying to compete with the very largest global systemically\nimportant banks (G-SIBs). They may choose to pursue M&A to remain competitive with larger\npeers who can achieve that growth organically through their sheer scale.\nM&A is an important part of a healthy banking system. So, when considering changes to\nthe framework, I think we need to first identify the problem that needs to be solved, and then ask\n3 Jonathan Kanter, “Merger Enforcement Sixty Years After Philadelphia National Bank” (speech at the Brookings\nInstitution’s Center on Regulation and Markets Event, Promoting Competition in Banking, Washington, DC, June\n20, 2023), https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/assistant-attorney-general-jonathan-kanter-delivers-keynote-address-\nbrookings-institution; Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, “Business Combinations Under the Bank Merger\nAct: Notice of Proposed Rulemaking,” OCC Bulletin 2024-4, January 29, 2024, https://occ.gov/news-\nissuances/bulletins/2024/bulletin-2024-4.html; Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, “FDIC Seeks Public\nComment on Proposed Revisions to its Statement of Policy on Bank Merger Transactions,” news release, March 21,\n2024, https://www.fdic.gov/news/press-releases/2024/pr24017.html.\n\n- 8 -\nwhether any proposed solution is fair, transparent, and consistent with applicable statutes. And\ncritically, whether the proposed solution has the potential to damage the long-term viability of\nthe banking system.\nAre there identified shortcomings in the current process or standards, and are the\nproposed reforms targeted and effective to address these shortcomings? One argument I have\nheard about the M&A regulatory approval process is that the lack of application denials\ndemonstrates that regulators are failing to meaningfully review and pressure test proposals and\nhave effectively become a rubber stamp. I think this argument lacks a strong foundation. There\nis ample evidence that undermines this argument, including the resource demands on institutions\nof pursuing M&A activity, and the protracted time it takes to complete the regulatory review and\napproval process (and the not insignificant failure rate we see represented in withdrawn\napplications).\nFirst, we have to acknowledge that choosing the path of a merger or acquisition is not\nundertaken lightly. These transactions require significant upfront and ongoing investment and\ncommitment of resources. At the outset, this includes finding an appropriate acquisition target,\nconducting due diligence, and negotiating the terms of the transaction. Once a target is\nidentified, the banks must prepare appropriate regulatory filings, engage with regulators during\nthe application process, and prepare for post-approval business processes including scheduling\nnecessary and costly systems conversions and customer transition. This is an expensive and\nreputationally risky process that bankers and their boards of directors take extremely seriously.\nSecond, one would expect to see different patterns emerging if regulators were truly\nacting as a “rubber stamp” for banking applications. We know from data published by the\nFederal Reserve that filing an application does not guarantee approval, even in the absence of a\n\n- 9 -\nregulatory denial. The Federal Reserve’s most recent report on banking applications activity\nidentifies a significant portion of bank M&A transactions in which applications have been\nwithdrawn.4\nThe processing timelines we see also seem inconsistent with a process that is operating\ntruly as a rubber stamp. To be clear, I think we have room to do better when it comes to timely\nregulatory action, while maintaining a rigorous review of applications. But extended review\nperiods are not uncommon, particularly when you include preliminary discussions and pre-filings\nwith regulators in the published processing timelines.\nSome contemplated regulatory reform efforts will likely make the M&A application\nprocess slower and less efficient. One of the key risks to an effective process is a lack of timely\nregulatory action. The consequences of delays can significantly harm both the acquiring\ninstitution and the target, causing greater operational risk (including the risk of a failed merger),\nincreased expenses, reputational risk, and staff attrition in the face of prolonged uncertainty.\nReducing the efficiency of bank M&A can be a deterrent to healthy bank transactions—\nlimiting activity that preserves the presence of community banks in underserved areas,\npreventing institutions from pursuing prudent growth strategies, and undermining competition by\npreventing firms from growing to a larger scale, effectively creating a “protected class” of larger\ninstitutions.\nUnfortunately, the past year has shown that regulatory attention is increasingly focused\non other issues, with the timeliness of regulatory action appearing to be lower on the list of\n4 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Banking Applications Activity Semiannual Report, June 1–\nJune 30, 2023, vol. 10, no. 2 (Washington: Board of Governors, September 2023),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/semiannual-report-on-banking-applications-20230929.pdf. This\nreport notes that in the first half of 2023, 46 M&A applications were approved by the Federal Reserve, while 12\nsuch applications were withdrawn.\n\n- 10 -\npriorities. However, I would like to highlight a change that may have significant impacts on\nM&A transactions depending on how the requirement is implemented.\nThe Federal Reserve recently proposed changes to its M&A application forms, the FR Y-\n3 and FR Y-3F, to include a requirement that an applicant submit an integration plan at the time\nof the initial application.5 Many applications often include plans for integration, as this can\nfactor into the consideration of an application’s likelihood of approval. However, depending\nupon how this requirement is implemented, it could result in significantly increased upfront costs\nand burdens for banks in preparing for and submitting applications for mergers and acquisitions,\nparticularly for smaller institutions.\nIt is important for industry participants to provide comments on changes to the bank\nmerger process—including changes to application forms—especially since cost and timing\nimplications could affect a bank’s consideration of these transactions. Ultimately, while banks\nare mindful of and do plan for integration, I am concerned that increased upfront requirements\nmay lead to additional delays in processing timelines. I would therefore encourage industry\nstakeholders to review and provide comment on the proposed changes to our applications forms.\nThird-Party Risk Management\nSimilarly, the agencies also recently released a guide for community banks regarding\nthird-party risk management.6 This guide took the agencies nearly a year to finalize after\nadopting third-party risk management guidance in June of last year. I am hopeful that this\ncommunity bank guide will be helpful to community banks. But I have yet to be convinced that\n5 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Proposed Agency Information Collection; Comment Request,\n89 Fed. Reg. 34,246 (April 30, 2024), https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2024-04-30/pdf/2024-09274.pdf.\n6 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Third-Party Risk Management: A Guide for Community\nBanks,” SR letter 24-2 / CA letter 24-1 (May 7, 2024),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/srletters/SR2402.pdf.\n\n- 11 -\nthe guide will effectively reduce the burden on smaller banks to comply with our third-party risk\nmanagement guidance. Since it is not yet clear that this guide will be effective, I encourage\nbanks to provide feedback on the guide, including on the clarity and transparency of supervisory\nexpectations for community banks in their management of third-party risk.\nReview of Regulations under the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act\nFinally, I’d like to highlight another opportunity for stakeholders to provide feedback on\nthe agencies’ regulations. In February, the Board announced the initiation of its review of its\nregulations to identify those regulations that are outdated, unnecessary, or overly burdensome in\naccordance with the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act (EGRPRA). It\nis my expectation that this review, and eventually the accompanying report to Congress, will\nprovide a meaningful process for stakeholders and the public to engage with the banking\nagencies in identifying regulations that are no longer necessary or are overly burdensome.\nAs a part of the comment process, I would encourage the public, particularly community\nbanks, to comment on the aggregate burden imposed on banks since the prior EGRPRA report 10\nyears ago. While there are many competing priorities on your time, these are valuable\nopportunities for you to shape the outcome of our regulations. I welcome the opportunity to\nlearn from all stakeholders how the Board and the other banking agencies could reduce burden,\nespecially for regional and community banks.\nPrioritization within Bank Regulation and Supervision\nI would also like to spend a few minutes on prioritization of regulatory actions. In my\nview, it is essential that regulators appropriately calibrate and prioritize supervisory and\nregulatory actions. Failing to do so could distract banks, bank management, supervisors, and\nregulators from focusing on key risks.\n\n- 12 -\nThe frenzy of regulatory reform activity we have seen over the past year raises a question\nas to whether the banking regulators are pursuing reforms in a prioritized way. Many reform\nproposals do not appear targeted to identified shortcomings or deficiencies in the existing\nregulatory framework.\nWhile regulators often identify evolving conditions and emerging risks before they\nmaterialize as pronounced stress in the banking system, too often regulators fail to take\nappropriately decisive measures to address them. In addition, regulators can also fall into the\ntrap of getting distracted from core financial risks, and instead focus on issues that are tangential\nto statutory mandates and critical areas of responsibility. Focusing on risks that pose fewer\nsafety and soundness concerns increases the risk that regulators miss other more foundational\nand pressing areas that require more immediate attention. Our recent actions suggest this could\nbe the case, and that we have taken steps that could distract bank management from focusing on\nimportant and key risks.\nThe Board’s focus on climate guidance is one example, but it is not the only example.\nWhile climate change is an important issue, climate change is not a core risk to the safety and\nsoundness of financial institutions. The lessons learned from supervisory failures during the\nbank stress last spring clearly illustrate that bank examiners and bank management should focus\non core issues, like credit risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk.\nI am concerned that focusing our regulatory reform and guidance efforts on issues like\nclimate change that do not represent core banking risks will only serve to further distract bank\nmanagement and supervisors.\nIn addition to issuing interagency supervisory guidance to banks on managing climate-\nrelated financial risks, the Board recently issued the results of a pilot climate scenario analysis,\n\n- 13 -\nwhich was designed to learn about large banks’ climate risk-management practices.7 This report\ngoes into significant detail on the technical aspects of the scenario analysis and underlying\nresults.\nWhile exploring even remote risks can help build resiliency for the future, I think the\nreport itself included some acknowledgment that these exercises may have limited utility in the\nshort-term for managing risk. For example, the report acknowledges that participants “suggested\nthat climate-related risks are highly uncertain and challenging to measure,” and that “[t]he\nuncertainty around the timing and magnitude of climate-related risks made it difficult . . . to\ndetermine how best to incorporate these risks into [banks’] risk-management frameworks on a\nbusiness-as-usual basis.”8 Participants also noted that scenario design choices, assumptions, data\nchallenges, and modelling challenges all played a material role in the analysis.\nBanks already have ongoing obligations to manage all material risks, and while scenario\nanalysis generally is not intended to be predictive, I think the uncertainty and unreliability of the\nresults from this exercise suggest that resources may be better devoted to dealing with more\ntangible and immediate financial risks.\nWe should rightly be concerned about regulatory pressure on a single issue that could\nlead to the misallocation of risk-management resources away from risks that may be more\nmaterial, such as interest rate, liquidity, and cyber risks.\n7 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Pilot Climate Scenario Analysis Exercise: Summary of\nParticipants’ Risk-Management Practices and Estimates (Washington: Board of Governors, May 2024),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/csa-exercise-summary-20240509.pdf.\n8 Pilot Climate Scenario Analysis Exercise, pp. 1-2.\n\n- 14 -\nClosing Thoughts\nWe continue to be at an inflection point in the bank regulatory reform agenda. The\npending proposals, including the Basel III capital proposal, the G-SIB surcharge, new long-term\ndebt requirements, amended resolution plan guidance, contemplated changes to the regulatory\napproval of merger and acquisition activity, and revisions to the interchange fee cap will have a\nlasting impact on banks of all sizes and their current and future customers.\nMy hope is that you and other interested stakeholders play an active role in this process\nby sharing your views and concerns with regulators. This input provides valuable insights into\nthe specific impacts—intended and unintended—of changes to the bank regulatory framework.\nVoicing your concerns enables us to identify, and where needed, address, the real-world\nconsequences of regulatory and supervisory reforms. Without your participation, we cannot\nfully appreciate the impacts of our regulatory and supervisory changes.\nThank you, and I look forward to our discussion.",

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nRoundtable on Central Bank Digital Currency\nHarvard Law School Program on International Financial Systems\nWashington, D.C.\nOctober 17, 2023\n\nThank you for the opportunity to speak with you today on the important topic of\ninnovations in money and payments. These issues continue to be of primary importance\nto the Federal Reserve.1 As part of its key functions, the Federal Reserve carries out a\nnumber of different responsibilities that include\n• fostering a safe and efficient payment system and providing services that support\nU.S. financial markets and private-sector payment, clearing, and settlement\narrangements;\n• promoting the safety and soundness of individual financial institutions and\nmonitoring their impact on the financial system as a whole;\n• setting U.S. monetary policy; and\n• helping to maintain the overall stability of the U.S. financial system and the\neconomy.\nAs a policymaker, I view responsible innovation through the lens of accomplishing these\npolicy goals.\nInnovation in money and payments can take many forms. We have continued to\nsee interest in digital assets, such as crypto-assets, stablecoins, central bank digital\ncurrency (CBDC), and programmable payment platforms, including those built on\ndistributed ledger technology (DLT). Alongside these innovations, we have embraced\nopportunities to improve the existing payment infrastructure by adopting and developing\ninstant payments, planning for future technology upgrades and improvements, and\n1 Thank you to Alex Sproveri and Priyanka Slattery of the Federal Reserve Board for their assistance in\npreparing this text. These views are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve\nBoard.\n\n- 2 -\nconsidering other more straightforward changes like expanding operating hours for the\nwholesale payment infrastructure.\nToday I will share my views on several of these potential improvements,\nincluding CBDC, other digital assets, and wholesale payments innovations. I will also\ndiscuss the importance of determining whether the benefits of innovation flow from the\nnew technology itself or, rather, result from policy choices that require new technology\nadoption.\nThroughout, I will lay out a vision for responsible innovation, which recognizes\nthe important role of private-sector innovation and leverages the strengths of the U.S.\nbanking system supported by clear prudential supervision and regulation, and I will\ndiscuss how policy can support the continued development of the payment system and\nbroader financial system.\nDigital Assets\nOften, discussions about the evolution of the payments landscape focus on novel\nforms of payment, including CBDC, stablecoins, and other forms of digital assets.\nCentral Bank Digital Currency\nFirst, I will touch on CBDC. For the purposes of this discussion, I will define\nCBDC as a new, digital form of central bank money widely available to the general\npublic. Some refer to this as a “general purpose” or “retail” CBDC. There are\nmeaningful differences between this type of retail CBDC and what is commonly referred\nto as a wholesale CBDC, which is a term some use to refer to digital central bank money\nused to settle large-value transactions among banks. While I will return to the concept of\n\n- 3 -\na wholesale CBDC in a moment, I would like to share my thoughts on the debate about\nthe introduction of a retail CBDC in the United States.\nAs I have noted before in other venues, there are two threshold questions that a\npolicymaker should ask when contemplating a CBDC. First: what problem is the\npolicymaker trying to solve, and is there a more efficient way to solve it? Second: what\nfeatures and considerations, including unintended consequences, should a policymaker\nthink about before deciding to adopt a CBDC and in designing the operation of a\nCBDC?2\nOn the first question, we have seen a range of arguments in the public debate\nabout issuing a CBDC, including addressing frictions within the payment system,\npromoting financial inclusion, and providing the public with access to safe central bank\nmoney. These are all important issues. I have yet to see a compelling argument that a\nU.S. CBDC could solve any of these problems more effectively or efficiently than\nalternatives, or with fewer downside risks for consumers and for the economy.\nYet in the United States, we have a safe and efficient payment system that\ncontinues to evolve with responsible innovations, like the FedNow Service, which is the\nFederal Reserve’s new interbank system for instant payments that launched in July of this\nyear. Through FedNow, participating banks, businesses, and consumers can send and\nreceive instant payments in real time, around the clock, every day of the year, with\nimmediately available funds.\n2 For additional discussion on CBDC, see Michelle Bowman, “Considerations for a Central Bank Digital\nCurrency” (speech at Georgetown University, Washington, D.C., April 18, 2023),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20230418a.htm.\n\n- 4 -\nFedNow, and a similar private sector service, is designed to help make everyday\npayments faster and more convenient, allowing consumers to instantly receive funds with\nsame-day access, and enabling small businesses to more efficiently manage cash flows\nwithout processing delays. Future innovations may further build upon these services to\nmore effectively address payment systems frictions and financial inclusion. It is quite\npossible that other proposed solutions may address many or all of the problems that a\nCBDC would address, but in a more effective and efficient way.\nFurther, the potential benefits of a U.S. CBDC remain unclear, and the\nintroduction of a U.S. CBDC could pose significant risks and tradeoffs for the financial\nsystem. These risks and tradeoffs include potential unintended consequences for the U.S.\nbanking system and considerable consumer privacy concerns. The U.S. banking system\nis a mature, well-functioning, and effective system that delivers important benefits to our\neconomy. Within this system, banks play a number of important roles, including\nproviding consumers with access to credit and other banking and payments services, all\nwithin an established regulatory perimeter. In addition, bank compliance and reporting\nprograms support important public policies, like deterring criminal activity and protecting\nconsumer financial data. Banks also play an essential role in the transmission of\nmonetary policy, and they provide the foundation for a well-functioning economy and\nfinancial system.\nThe U.S. intermediated banking model helps to insulate consumer financial\nactivities from unnecessary government overreach, and I believe this is an appropriate\nmodel for future financial innovation. If not properly designed, a CBDC could disrupt\nthe banking system and lead to disintermediation, potentially harming consumers and\n\n- 5 -\nbusinesses and presenting broader financial stability risks.3 As policymakers, we would\nneed to carefully consider how an intermediated CBDC, with private-sector service\nproviders, could be designed in a way that maintains financial institution involvement\nand minimizes, or ideally, eliminates related disruptions to the broader U.S. financial\nsystem.\nI believe it is important to continue to research the possible benefits, risks, and\ntradeoffs of a potential U.S. CBDC, and to follow international CBDC developments that\ncould have implications for the United States. However, given that we have a safe and\nefficient payment system and a well-functioning banking system, the potential uses of a\nU.S. CBDC remain unclear and, at the same time, could introduce significant risks and\ntradeoffs. That said, recognizing the interconnected and global nature of the financial\nsystem, I see value in continuing to research and understand the underlying technology\nand associated policy implications as other jurisdictions continue to actively pursue\nCBDCs. Doing so ensures we are aware of and can be responsive to any developments\nand can continue to support a safe and efficient financial system into the future.\nStablecoins\nBut a CBDC is just one potential piece of the evolving payments landscape.\nAnother alternative to traditional forms of money and payment, or to a CBDC, is\nstablecoins. This form of payment emerged primarily to support the trading of crypto-\nassets but increasingly has been proposed as an alternative to traditional payments and as\n3 The Federal Reserve’s initial analysis suggests that a potential U.S. CBDC, if one were created, would\nbest serve the needs of the United States by being privacy-protected, intermediated, widely transferable,\nand identity-verified. See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Money and Payments: The\nU.S. Dollar in the Age of Digital Transformation” (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System, January 2022), https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/money-and-payments-\n20220120.pdf.\n\n- 6 -\na store of value. Stablecoins purport to have convertibility one-for-one with the dollar,\nbut in practice have been less secure, less stable, and less regulated than traditional forms\nof money.\nDigital assets used as an alternative form of money and payment, including\nstablecoins, could pose risks to consumers and the U.S. banking system. Therefore, it is\nimportant to understand risks and tradeoffs associated with digital assets and new\narrangements used for banking and payments. While I support responsible innovation\nthat benefits consumers, I caution against solutions that could disrupt and disintermediate\nthe banking system, potentially harming consumers and contributing to broader financial\nstability risks. And, where the activity happens outside the regulatory perimeter,\nconsumers would be left without the adequate protections that our regulated and\nsupervised banks provide today in the United States.\nA Comprehensive Regulatory Framework\nFor these reasons, my vision for responsible innovation includes a clear and\nsensible regulatory framework, where we incorporate what works well today in the U.S.\nbanking system, allowing for private sector innovations within established guardrails.\nWithin this framework, it is imperative that the same activities that present the same risks\nare subject to the same regulations—regardless of what a product is called and by whom\nit is offered. I think the desire for “new” often leads us to overlook existing success, both\nin terms of regulatory approach and financial services. Rather than speculate about the\ncomposition of alternative regimes, we should ask how these new products and providers\ncan be held to the same standards as banks, especially with respect to consumer\nprotection.\n\n- 7 -\nAs an example, stablecoin issuers today typically are licensed or chartered at the\nstate level as money service businesses or trust companies, and, in some cases, offer\nbank-like services, including the ability to store funds. However, while many of these\nissuers are subject to state supervision, they are not subject to the full complement of\nprudential regulation applicable to banks like capital requirements and prudential\nsupervision. They also do not benefit from the backstops and protections available to\nbanks like deposit insurance coverage and access to central bank liquidity in times of\nstress. In order to protect consumers, it is imperative that activities that present the same\nrisks are subject to the same regulations and offer the same protections. This approach\nwould also allow banks to compete on a level playing field in introducing products and\nservices to benefit consumers. This type of regulatory clarity can provide support for\nresponsible innovation.\nWholesale Payments Innovation\nNext, I will speak to potential improvements, including technological innovations,\nin wholesale payments. Wholesale payments generally refer to large-value, interbank\ntransactions, and not consumers sending money to other consumers. This refers to the\nfinancial plumbing that banks use behind the scenes to settle payments.\nThe Federal Reserve continues to speak to a broad range of stakeholders and\nconduct research regarding emerging technologies, including those that could enable or\nbe supported by future Federal Reserve-operated payment infrastructures. The goal is to\nbetter understand potential opportunities and risks of new wholesale payment platforms,\nincluding those built on DLT, as well as the associated risks and benefits of depository\n\n- 8 -\ninstitutions transacting on these platforms with “tokenized” forms of digital central bank\nmoney, sometimes called wholesale CBDC.\nIn my view, the term “wholesale CBDC,” despite its wide use, is generally a\nmisnomer that leads to confusion since we already have central bank money in digital\nform that is available to banks for wholesale transactions.4 Today, banks and other\neligible entities hold central bank money as digital balances at the Federal Reserve—\nfrequently referred to as reserves. These reserves are held for a number of purposes,\nincluding settling large-value interbank payments. Interbank payment services, like the\nFedwire Funds Service and other private sector services, are critical to the functioning\nand stability of the financial system, and the economy more broadly, as they enable\nimportant financial market functions.5\nWholesale payment infrastructures operated by the central bank tend to underpin\ndomestic and international financial activities by serving as a foundation for payments\nand the broader financial system. This infrastructure allows payments to flow safely\nbetween consumers and businesses within the United States and internationally. Since\nthis infrastructure is so critical to the payments system, it is necessary that we investigate\nand understand the potential opportunities, risks, and tradeoffs for wholesale payments\ninnovation to support a safe and efficient U.S. payment system. These wholesale systems\n4 Fabio Panetta, member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, has argued that wholesale\nCBDC has existed for decades. See Fabio Panetta, “Demystifying wholesale central bank digital currency”\n(speech at the Deutsche Bundesbank Symposium on Payments and Securities Settlement in Europe,\nFrankfurt, Germany, September 26, 2022), https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2022/html/ecb.sp\n220926~5f9b85685a.en.html.\n5 For additional discussion on wholesale CBDC versus reserves on a wholesale payment platform, see Jon\nDurfee, Jesse Leigh Maniff, and Priyanka Slattery, “Examining CBDC and Wholesale Payments”\n(Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, September 8, 2023),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/examining-cbdc-and-wholesale-payments-\n20230908.html.\n\n- 9 -\nfunction safely and efficiently today, but we have seen new payment platforms built on\ninnovative technologies that have generated interest in new capabilities. This includes\ntransacting “tokenized” forms of money and assets and enhancing the programmability of\npayments through the transfer of money using so-called smart contracts. These platforms\nare also being explored as a way to improve the efficiency of payment, clearing, and\nsettlement of certain financial transactions, including for cross-border purposes.\nPolicymakers should be mindful of the specific features innovative wholesale\nplatforms could include, and the risks, tradeoffs, and other considerations they could\nentail. For example, one potential model under consideration is the concept of a common\nplatform or shared ledger that could facilitate digital asset transactions, including\ncommercial bank and central bank liabilities.6 This type of ledger could be specific to\none jurisdiction (such as U.S. dollar transactions only among regulated financial\ninstitutions) or across jurisdictions and containing multiple currencies.\nWhile there is interest in new capabilities and efficiencies that a shared ledger\ncould offer, transacting central bank money on a shared ledger may introduce additional\nrisks and operational complexities. This would depend on how a platform would be\ngoverned, and which entities would be allowed to participate. In the United States for\nexample, this technology would introduce risks and complexities that do not exist today\nbecause a shared ledger might allow central bank money to circulate on a platform that is\nnot owned and operated by the central bank. Important legal, policy, and operational\n6 Agustín Carstens, general manager of the Bank for International Settlements, has discussed the idea of a\n“unified ledger” run by the central bank to fully realize the potential of new technologies developed by the\nprivate sector. See Agustín Carstens, “Innovation and the Future of the Monetary System” (speech at the\nMonetary Authority of Singapore, February 22, 2023), https://www.bis.org/speeches/sp230222.htm.\n\n- 10 -\nquestions would need to be thoroughly considered alongside an assessment of potential\nbenefits.\nAnother potential model is one where central banks maintain their own ledgers—\njust as they do today—and use DLT as a bridge between distinct ledgers to achieve\ninteroperability and facilitate cross-border, cross-currency payments.7 Still other models\nexist across both wholesale and retail payments that would leverage existing\ninfrastructure. Examples include experiments that look at interlinking faster domestic\npayment systems to facilitate cross-border payments, or even exploring how existing\ndomestic payment infrastructures could be incrementally improved.8 Each model\ncontains its own set of potential features and tradeoffs. While my vision for responsible\ninnovation includes a broad understanding of different options, I continue to emphasize\nthat to help focus efforts, we must begin by asking “What specific problem are we trying\nto solve?”\nThe Importance of Policy Choices\nThis brings me to the question of whether the potential benefits from innovation\ncome from new technology or from changes to existing policy. While conversations on\npayments innovation often focus on the technological capabilities, policymakers must\napply a critical lens to understand whether changes to regulations or policies would be\nnecessary to address specific concerns. Some potential technology solutions assume—or\n7 For example, see Project Cedar, a technical experiment by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s\nInnovation Center, which examined whether distributed ledger technology could be used to improve the\nefficiency of cross-border payments and settlements involving multiple currencies, at\nhttps://www.newyorkfed.org/aboutthefed/nyic/project-cedar.\n8 For example, see the Bank for International Settlements Innovation Hub Project Nexus proof-of-concept,\nwhich explores the interlinking of domestic faster payment systems, at https://www.bis.org/about/bisih/\ntopics/fmis/nexus.htm.\n\n- 11 -\neven require—policy change, such as issues related to operating hours and account\naccess. In these cases, a new technology alone cannot solve the issue. Some point to a\ndecentralized infrastructure to support digital assets as a solution to address current\nfrictions in cross-border payments, like speed and cost of payments. However, these\nperceived payment limitations do not always stem from problems with existing\ntechnology, but rather from existing policies, laws, and even consumer and business\npreferences. And within the international context, some changes may require greater\nalignment across jurisdictions.\nSome purported payment limitations or frictions exist for specific reasons related\nto managing key risks that policymakers may not want to change, and it is important to\nunderstand the tradeoffs of these policy decisions. Let’s use the example of compliance\nrequirements that deter financial crimes and counter the financing of terrorism. These\npolicies exist to accomplish specific policy goals and are implemented by banks that\nbalance the need for transparency to deter crime and the protection of consumer financial\ninformation from government overreach. In these cases, the perceived barriers in existing\npayment systems are established for important public policy reasons and are not\nlimitations resulting from the existing technology itself. It is important to not only\nthoroughly understand what technological innovations can do, but also what these\ninnovations should be able to do within the broader context of a robust, well-functioning\nbanking and payments system.\nMy vision for responsible innovation requires that we continue to distinguish\nwhich specific payment frictions can benefit from technological innovation itself and\n\n- 12 -\nwhich are questions of policy and exist for good reasons, as well as the recognition that\nwe should not compromise vital public policies in the name of innovation.\nThe Importance of Continued Research\nThe Federal Reserve remains open to multiple options to improve the payments\nlandscape. We continue to conduct research to fully understand technological\ninnovations and their associated benefits, risks, and tradeoffs. We must also fully\nunderstand any related implications for Federal Reserve payment infrastructure and\npolicy outcomes.\nResearchers cover a wide range of policy areas, including payments policy,\nprivacy considerations, financial inclusion, financial stability, and monetary policy\nimplications. Because new digital assets are currently focused on tokenization of certain\ntraditional or even new types of money, tokenization is a research theme for the Federal\nReserve and for central banks globally. While this topic is relevant to CBDC research\nwork, it will also inform other issue areas—including discussions about stablecoin\nregulation, novel banking activities supervision, and efforts to improve the current\npayment system.\nTechnologists at the Board and the Reserve Banks have been conducting focused\nresearch and experimentation to provide insight into technical capabilities and risks\nassociated with digital assets, including CBDC, and the programmable platforms that\ncould support payment infrastructure improvements. These experiments give the\nresearchers hands-on experience with new technologies and allow the Federal Reserve to\nexamine the application of emerging technologies in retail, wholesale, and cross-border\nuse cases.\n\n- 13 -\nThe Federal Reserve Board continues to collaborate closely with international\ncounterparts on issues related to digital payments. This includes engagement with\nmultilateral institutions, such as the Bank for International Settlements, G7, Financial\nStability Board, and bilateral engagements with other central banks. This work reflects\nthe interconnectedness of the global financial system and allows us to follow actions\ntaken by other jurisdictions and understand any related implications for the United States.\nConclusion\nAs the money and payments landscape evolves, I continue to stress the\nimportance of looking ahead and analyzing potential changes that may emerge well into\nthe future. This can be done most effectively by understanding the broad range of\noptions that could be leveraged to improve payments, including technology,\nimprovements to existing payment infrastructure, and policy options and their\nimplications. Given the breadth of activity in this space, I believe that policymakers must\nspecify the problems they are trying to solve, understand the range of alternatives that\ncould address any problems, including policy and technology options, and thoroughly\nanalyze the associated risks and tradeoffs.\nFor all of the Federal Reserve’s involvement in this work, I support a responsible\napproach to innovation that recognizes the role of private sector innovations, benefits\nfrom the strengths of the U.S. banking system, and focuses policymakers on thinking\nabout payment and financial system infrastructure and effective policy. To achieve this, I\nsupport a clear regulatory framework that provides for responsible innovation while\nbuilding upon what works well today and preventing disruption of the U.S. banking and\npayment system.\n\n- 14 -\nThank you for the opportunity to share my views on these important issues.",

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nWomen in Housing and Finance Public Policy Luncheon\nWashington, D.C.\nNovember 8, 2021\n\nGood afternoon, everyone. It is a pleasure to join you today. Thank you for the\ninvitation. Developments in the housing and mortgage markets have a major effect on\nthe economy and the financial system, so the Federal Reserve Board monitors these\nmarkets closely. I am happy to share some of my observations about these markets and\nto learn from your knowledge and experiences as well.1\nI know I am speaking to an audience with considerable expertise in these areas,\nand so you know already that 2020 and 2021 have been interesting times, to say the least,\nin housing and mortgage markets. I will focus my comments today on three areas: the\nstrong increase in home prices in the past year and a half, the wind-down of forbearance\nprograms enacted after the advent of COVID-19, and what we learned about the financial\nstability risks associated with nonbank mortgage companies during the pandemic. As I\nhope will become apparent during these remarks, these three topics may seem unrelated\nbut they are actually connected.\nI will start with some comments on home prices. Home prices had been rising at\na moderate rate since 2012, but since mid-2020, their growth has accelerated\nsignificantly. In total, home prices in September were 21 percent higher than in June\n2020. Home price increases are also widespread. In September, about 90 percent of\nAmerican cities had experienced rising home prices over the past three months, and the\nhome price increases were substantial in most of these cities.2\n1 The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of other Federal Reserve Board members or\nFederal Open Market Committee participants.\n2 Staff estimate based on data from CoreLogic on 383 metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs). An MSA’s\nprice level is defined as having risen if its three-month percent increase exceeds 1 percent. All series are\nseasonally adjusted using the trend-cycle component of an ARIMA (autoregressive integrated moving\naverage) model. In 85 percent of MSAs, the home price increase, measured on an annualized basis, was\nmore than 10 percent.\n\n- 2 -\nThese sharp increases raise the concern that housing is overvalued and that home\nprices may decline. Historically, large home price increases are somewhat less\nconcerning if they are supported by economic fundamentals rather than speculation.\nFundamentals certainly seem to be a large part of the story behind the increases we’ve\nseen since the middle of last year. The demand for housing has risen for several reasons.\nInterest rates are low, families have accumulated savings, and income growth in the past\n18 months has been quite strong. Families are also reconsidering where, and in what\nkind of home, they want to live. Purchases of second homes, for example, have been\nsomewhat high in the past 18 months. Meanwhile, the supply of new homes has been\nheld back by shortages of materials, labor, and developed lots.\nAnother reason to be less concerned about the recent escalation in home prices is\nthat we do not see much of the decline in underwriting standards that fueled the home\nprice bubble in the mid-2000s. Mortgage underwriting standards have remained\nconservative relative to the mid-2000s, in part because of the mortgage policy reforms\nthat were put in place in the aftermath of the housing crisis. Investor activity is subdued\nrelative to that time as well.\nNonetheless, home prices do decline from time to time. In inflation-adjusted\nterms, U.S. home prices fell from 1979 to 1982 and from 1989 to 1993, although by\nmuch less than from 2006 to 2012.3 Although the declines in national home prices were\nmodest in some of these episodes, some areas of the country experienced sharp declines.\nAs we all know, home price declines cause problems and strain throughout the economy.\n3 Statistics are from historical housing market data used in Robert Shiller’s book Irrational Exuberance,\nwhich are updated monthly. See Robert J. Shiller (2015), Irrational Exuberance, 3rd ed., fig. 3.1\n(Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press), http://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/data/Fig3-1.xls.\n\n- 3 -\nTo give just one example, families and small business owners borrow against their homes\nto fund big-ticket purchases and business expansions, and house price declines make it\nharder to use homes as loan collateral. This effect can be amplified if a credit crunch\noccurs, in which lenders react to the decline in house prices by pulling back on their\nlending. With banks and the broader financial system currently quite robust, such a\ncredit crunch seems unlikely. Nonetheless, I know how painful these declines can be,\nespecially in certain markets. For example, from my experience living in rural Kansas, I\nunderstand how smaller communities with a less diversified housing and employment\nbase can take a long time to recover from a fall in home prices. I wonder also about\ncommunities with a sizable share of second-home owners. So I will continue to watch\nthe incoming data closely.\nFalling home prices would certainly be very dramatic, but continued outsized\nincreases could also be problematic. First, high home prices make it more difficult for\nlow- to moderate-income households to become homeowners, as larger down payments\nand other financing requirements effectively lock these households out of the housing\nmarket. Second, and related to one of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy goals,\nrising home prices and rents raise the cost of housing. Because housing costs are a large\nshare of living expenses for most people, these increases are adding to current\ninflationary pressures in the economy. Indeed, we are already seeing sizable increases in\nrent and owners’ equivalent rent in many parts of the country.\nIn addition, there are signs of underlying supply and demand imbalances that will\ncontribute to increases in housing costs and inflation. Early in the pandemic, the strength\nin home prices was thought to be driven by the decline in mortgage rates. But it has\n\n- 4 -\nbecome increasingly clear that the low supply of homes, in combination with a strong\ndemand for housing, is an important part of the story. Before this past year, the pace of\nconstruction of new homes was below its long-run average for more than a decade. The\nsupply chain bottlenecks that I mentioned earlier are slowing down construction further.\nThese issues affect the rental market too: The multifamily rental market is at historic\nlevels of tightness, with over 95 percent occupancy in major markets.4 I anticipate that\nthese housing supply issues are unlikely to reverse materially in the short term, which\nsuggests that we are likely to see higher inflation from housing for a while.\nI am also watching carefully what happens as borrowers reach the end of the\nforbearance on mortgage payments. As of October, 1.2 million borrowers were still in\nforbearance, down from a peak of 4.7 million in June 2020. Of these remaining\nborrowers, 850,000 will reach the end of their forbearance period by the end of January\n2022. Meanwhile, the temporary limitations on foreclosures put in place by the\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau will expire at the end of the year.5\nForbearance has been an important support for workers dislocated by the\npandemic and for their families. Transitioning the remaining borrowers from forbearance\nto a mortgage modification or other resolution may be a heavy lift for some servicers.\nEach transition requires getting in contact with the borrower, discussing options, and\nfiguring out which resolution makes the most sense for each borrower. This is time-\nconsuming and detailed work. It is also crucially important. Obviously, we want to\n4 See Jay Parsons (2021), “U.S. Apartment Vacancy Plunges in September to Record Low as Leave\nRenewals Surge,” RealPage Analytics Blog, October 6, https://www.realpage.com/analytics/apartment-\nvacancy-plunges-lease-renewals-surge-september-2021.\n5 The statistics in this paragraph are from Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia (2021), Examining\nResolution of Mortgage Forbearances and Delinquencies (Philadelphia: Philadelphia Fed, October 21),\nhttps://www.philadelphiafed.org/-/media/frbp/assets/consumer-finance/reports/21-10-tracking-resolutions-\nof-mortgage-forbearances-and-delinquencies.pdf.\n\n- 5 -\nensure that borrowers who are struggling financially receive the help that they need, and I\nwant to acknowledge that many of these borrowers are from communities that have\ntraditionally been underserved by the mortgage market. In addition, if servicers handle\nloan modifications poorly and on a large scale, the macroeconomy and financial stability\ncan be affected as well. In the aftermath of the last financial crisis, the flood of\nforeclosures led to downward pressure on home prices. The same dynamic has not\nunfolded during the pandemic. Forbearance, foreclosure moratoriums, and fiscal support\nhave kept distressed borrowers in their homes.6\nFed supervisory staff are communicating with significant supervised institutions\nto ensure that they are preparing for the increased operational risks. If the transition out\nof forbearance is handled smoothly, I am cautiously optimistic that it will not have a\nmaterial effect on the larger economy. The share of mortgages in distress—defined as\nthose in forbearance or seriously delinquent—was about 4.5 percent in October 2021,\nabout half the share of mortgages that were seriously delinquent in 2010.7 In addition,\nmany of the mortgages in distress now are insured by the Federal Housing\nAdministration or the Department of Veterans Affairs, and these agencies can require that\ncertain mortgage modification protocols are followed. Outside of these mortgages, the\nshare of borrowers who are not making mortgage payments has returned to pre-pandemic\nlevels. Nonetheless, we are aware of the risks and will monitor this situation closely.\n6 See Elliot Anenberg and Tess Scharlemann (2021), “The Effect of Mortgage Forbearance on House Prices\nduring COVID-19,” FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, March\n19), https://doi.org/10.17016/2380-7172.2872.\n7 The statistic for October 2021 is from Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia (2021) in note 5; the statistic\nfor 2010 is from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Consumer Credit Panel/Equifax. Serious\ndelinquency is defined as 90 or more days delinquent or in foreclosure.\n\n- 6 -\nMortgage servicing, however, has increasingly moved from Fed supervised banks\nand into nonbank mortgage companies that are supervised by state regulators. In a\nspeech late last year, I focused on some of the possible financial stability risks associated\nwith nonbank mortgage servicers.8 I would like to update you on my thinking about this\nissue today.\nWhen widespread forbearance was introduced last year, concerns were raised that\nit would impose strains on nonbank servicers. That is because when a borrower does not\nmake a mortgage payment, the servicer is required to make the payment on the\nborrower’s behalf. Servicers are eventually reimbursed for these advances, but they are\nrequired to finance the unpaid amounts. And unlike banks, nonbanks cannot turn to the\nFederal Reserve System or the Federal Home Loan Banks when they need liquidity.\nAs it turned out, nonbank mortgage servicers had cash to meet their operational\nneeds. Mortgage refinancing surged because of the drop in long-term interest rates, and\nnonbank servicers used the proceeds from these refinacings to fund the advances\nassociated with forbearance.\nHowever, if home prices had fallen, instead of rising so sharply, many borrowers\nmight have faced obstacles to refinancing because their homes had fallen in value, and so\nnonbank servicers would not have had revenue from refinancing to put toward paying\nadvances. Some nonbank servicers might obtain funds by borrowing against their\nmortgage servicing rights (MSRs). MSRs are a significant asset for nonbanks. In total,\n8 See Michelle W. Bowman (2020), “The Changing Structure of Mortgage Markets and Financial\nStability,” speech delivered at the “Financial Stability: Stress, Contagion, and Transmission,” 2020\nFinancial Stability Conference hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and the Office of\nFinancial Research, Cleveland, November 19,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20201119a.htm.\n\n- 7 -\nnonbanks hold about four times as much in MSRs as they do in cash.9 But MSRs decline\nin value when home prices fall, and so this borrowing might also have been less available\nas a funding source in those circumstances.\nThe Financial Stability Oversight Council raised concerns about the financial\nresilience of nonbank mortgage companies in its 2020 annual report and recommended\nthat state and federal regulators coordinate closely to collect data, identify risks, and\nstrengthen oversight of nonbank mortgage companies.10 I think this is appropriate. The\nideal mortgage finance system must have a place for institutions of many different types\nand sizes—both bank and nonbank—that are able to serve the varying needs of different\ncustomers. For this system to be sustainable, though, I think like activities should be\ntreated in a like manner, and I am concerned about some of the differences in the\nprudential oversight of banks and nonbanks in the mortgage market.\nTo return to my theme at the beginning: These are interesting times for housing\nand mortgage markets. And in such times, I think we can all agree that it’s wise to\nclosely monitor developments and be prepared for whatever the future may bring.\nFortunately, that is exactly what Women in Housing and Finance is all about. So I would\nencourage all of us—including the tremendous talent assembled here today—to continue\nthinking hard about how we can continue to build a resilient and dynamic housing market\nthat meets the needs of the American people.\n9 This calculation from the Board’s staff is based on data from the Conference of State Bank Supervisors,\nNationwide Multistate Licensing System & Registry.\n10 See Financial Stability Oversight Council (2020), 2020 Annual Report (Washington: FSOC),\nhttps://home.treasury.gov/system/files/261/FSOC2020AnnualReport.pdf.",

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nVirtual Symposium on Indigenous Economies: Bank of Canada, Tulo Centre of\nIndigenous Economics, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand\nVirtual event\nNovember 29, 2021\n\nThank you to the Bank of Canada for the invitation to speak at today’s\nsymposium.1 It is an honor to be with you virtually today as the Federal Reserve Board’s\nrepresentative to the Central Bank Network for Indigenous Inclusion. I am pleased to\nadd my voice to those of my colleagues today and to recognize and acknowledge that the\nUnited States and the foundation of its economy were built on land enriched by its\noriginal Indigenous inhabitants, and their stewardship of its natural resources.\nThe economic well-being of Indigenous people is an important aspect of the\nFederal Reserve’s goal to increase economic inclusion for all Americans, and it is one of\nthe reasons we are participating in today’s symposium and the Central Bank Network for\nIndigenous Inclusion. Over time, it has become evident that opportunities to succeed and\nbuild a better life for all economic participants is a central concept for a healthy and\ngrowing economy and a stable and strong financial system. The negative effects of past\npolicies and a lack of economic opportunity have impacted Indigenous people for\ngenerations. I would like to acknowledge this history, but also to acknowledge that no\ngreat nation can prosper when its people are left behind. The Federal Reserve, with all of\nthe powerful tools at its disposal, can’t fully succeed unless Native people, and others that\nhave existed on the margins of the economy, have the opportunity to become full\nparticipants. The discussions today, including those regarding access to credit for\nIndigenous communities, can advance this goal.\nThe Federal Reserve also makes progress on economic inclusion through the\nprocess of engagement. We rely on discussions like those from our Fed Listens events\nseries to supplement the quantitative data upon which central bankers rely to make\n1 I would like to thank Benjamin Horowitz and Casey Lozar for their assistance drafting my remarks.\n\n- 2 -\ndecisions that may have life-changing consequences for households across the United\nStates.2 In partnership with the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, the Board of\nGovernors recently held a Fed Listens event in Oklahoma to learn from tribal leaders that\nrepresent the 39 federally recognized tribes in that state.\nThe Board also gains perspective from formal advisory bodies like its Community\nAdvisory Council. The council “provides the Board with diverse perspectives on the\neconomic circumstances and financial services needs of consumers and communities,\nwith a particular focus on the concerns of low- and moderate-income populations.”3 An\nIndigenous leader on the council regularly shares insights on the economic conditions and\nopportunities within Indigenous communities.\nIn the U.S. context, effective outreach must be regular and extensive, so we are\nable to capture the wide range of perspectives represented within and across 574 federally\nrecognized tribes. Each tribal community’s experience differs and is shaped by its own\noften-complex history. I met with some of these leaders on a recent trip to South Dakota,\nand they reminded me of the importance of building understanding by meeting people\nwhere they are to better grasp what they have experienced. That said, there are some\ncommon experiences across Native American communities that are reflected in data:\nPer-capita income among Native Americans is about half that of the rest of the United\nStates.4 But since 1990, Native Americans’ gross domestic product per capita has nearly\n2 See the Federal Reserve Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review-of-\nmonetary-policy-strategy-tools-and-communications-fed-listens-events.htm.\n3 See the Federal Reserve Board website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/cac.htm.\n4 Randall Akee, Sovereignty and Improved Economic Outcomes for American Indians: Building on the\nGains Made Since 1990 (Washington: Washington Center for Equitable Growth, 2021),\nhttps://equitablegrowth.org/sovereignty-and-improved-economic-outcomes-for-american-indians-building-\non-the-gains-made-since-1990/.\n\n- 3 -\ndoubled in real terms.5 While reservation economies often offer fewer, less-diverse job\nopportunities relative to other rural areas,6 firms in Indian Country showed high levels of\nresiliency during the last financial crisis.7\nBank branches are harder to find in Indian Country.8 Credit is often more\nexpensive for reasons not fully explained by available borrower characteristics alone.9\nAs an example, 14 percent of American Indian/Alaska Native mortgages were “high-\npriced” compared with eight percent for other populations.10 In response, the number of\nNative-led Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) has quadrupled over\nthe past two decades.11 These Native CDFIs cannot singlehandedly resolve Indian\nCountry’s credit needs, but research and pilot programs demonstrate the power of cultural\n5 Randall Akee, Sovereignty and Improved Economic Outcomes for American Indians.\n6 Randall Akee, Elton Mykerezi, and Richard Todd, “Opportunities to Diversify: Reservation Workplaces\nand Job Numbers Compared to Nearby County Areas,” in Creating Private Sector Economies in Native\nAmerica: Sustainable Development through Entrepreneurship (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press,\n2019), https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/creating-private-sector-economies-in-native-\namerica/opportunities-to-diversify-reservation-workplaces-and-job-numbers-compared-to-nearby-county-\nareas/364712BB04F452AAD797A7B47397BE7E.\n7 Randall Akee, Elton Mykerezi, and Richard Todd, Business Dynamics on American Indian Reservations:\nEvidence from Longitudinal Datasets (Minneapolis: Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, 2021),\nhttps://www.minneapolisfed.org/~/media/assets/papers/cicdwp/2021/cicd-wp-2021-02.pdf.\n8 Indian Country is a broad term used to refer more generally to tribal governments and Native\ncommunities, cultures, and peoples as defined by the National Congress of American Indians. Staff\nresearch from the CICD shows that 15 percent of tribal entities meet the Board of Governors’ definition of\nbeing “branch poor” compared with just 1 percent of all U.S. counties.\n9 The strongest evidence on this front is in Donna Feir and Laura Cattaneo, The Higher Price of Mortgage\nFinancing for Native Americans, (Minneapolis: Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, 2019),\nhttps://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/cicd-working-paper-series/201906-the-higher-price-of-mortgage-\nfinancing-for-native-americans.\n10 High-priced mortgages are defined in Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data as having a rate greater than\nor equal to 1.5 points above average prime offer rate.\n11 Michou Kokodoko, Valentina Dimitrova-Grajzl, Peter Grajzl, and Joseph Guse, “Native CDFIs Improve\nCredit Outcomes for Indian Country Residents” (Minneapolis: Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis,\n2021), https://www.minneapolisfed.org/article/2021/native-cdfis-improve-credit-outcomes-for-indian-\ncountry-\nresidents#:~:text=The%20number%20of%20certified%20Native,increases%20in%20measures%20of%20c\nreditworthiness.\n\n- 4 -\nfit as they bring credit, financial services, and consumer education into tribal\ncommunities.12\nIn the context of the recent pandemic, we have also seen some Native\ncommunities’ approach to the pandemic health response be considered as potential case\nstudies for future best practice.13 Federal government stimulus has also led to historic\nlevels of funding for tribal communities in the wake of COVID-19, which may help to\naddress housing and other infrastructure needs created and exacerbated by generations of\nunfulfilled treaty and trust obligations.14,15\n12 Michou Kokodoko, et al., “Native CDFIs Improve Credit Outcomes for Indian Country Residents.” See,\nfor example, an initiative bringing U.S. Department of Agriculture resources to reservations in South\nDakota in Andrew P.

Continued research conducted by central banks can play an important role in\ngenerating new work to better understand where gaps may exist. Central banks can also\nleverage their unique role in the economy and society by fostering important connections\nbetween lenders, funders, other public agencies, and academics working with Indigenous\ncommunities.\nIn recent years, the Board of Governors has organized gatherings like the Native\nAmerican Financial Institution Conference, which promotes Indian Country economic\nresearch, and ensures that Indigenous-led institutions are served through collaborations\nlike the Partnership for Progress with minority depository institutions.16\nOur regional banks also support Indian Country in many ways. Six years ago, the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis formalized decades of Indian Country work and\nfounded The Center for Indian Country Development, or CICD. Today, the CICD is a\nnational leader in qualitative and quantitative research highlighting economic and credit\nconditions in Native communities. CICD’s practice is guided by a tribal leadership\ncouncil, and active engagement with American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native\nHawaiian community leaders.\nCICD staff lead research within tribal communities, gather information through\nsurveys of tribal institutions, and study financial markets for Indian Country as a whole.\nCICD functions as a true public resource, providing accessible information and data that\ncan serve as a foundation for the research of others. Their events serve as important\nmeeting grounds, where partnerships can form, and ideas can be thoughtfully considered.\n16 The Partnership for Progress website is www.fedpartnership.gov.\n\n- 6 -\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis with support from the Federal Reserve\nBanks of Atlanta and Kansas City provides multiple tribal nations and Native\ncommunities across the United States with personal finance and economic education\nprogramming. This culturally relevant programming offers the flexibility to adapt to\nlocal needs, including the use of Native language, to strengthen financial literacy in the\ntribal communities served. Other Federal Reserve community development staff partner\nwith tribes on best-practice manuals and convene regional and national leaders to\nencourage connections between tribal leaders and lenders.17\nOf course, research and outreach are not ends in and of themselves. Two recent\nexamples highlight how the Fed’s work in Indian Country translates information into\npractice. The first example comes from the Main Street Lending Program, a credit\nprogram created to address pandemic related financial challenges for certain businesses\nduring the COVID-19 pandemic. The program’s initial rules made the application process\nand funding approval challenging for tribal-nation-owned enterprises. In response, the\nprocedures were quickly adapted to accommodate these entities, which improved the\neffectiveness of the program and its reach to Indian Country applicants.\nThe second example comes from our work to modernize the Community\nReinvestment Act, or CRA. Among other things, the CRA provides a framework to\nassess banks’ service to and investments in economically distressed areas. In our first\nsteps to modernize the regulation, we posed a set of questions to the public. We included\nquestions about Indian Country, and CICD reached out to Indigenous leaders and\n17 See, for example, the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and U.S. Department of Agriculture,\nAlaska Rural Homeownership Resource Guide (San Francisco: FRBSF and USDA, 2017),\nhttps://www.frbsf.org/community-development/files/alaska-rural-homeownership-guide.pdf.\n\n- 7 -\norganizations to highlight the opportunity to provide feedback resulting in a significant\nnumber of public comments highlighting Indian Country considerations. As we move\nforward with the CRA modernization process, the consideration of these and other\ncomments will result in a more effective outcome.\nMy remarks today have really only scratched the surface of the Federal Reserve\nSystem’s efforts to improve our engagement with Indigenous communities. While these\nefforts have much room to grow, I am very pleased that they inform our System’s work\nto support economic opportunity during this important time. Today’s symposium has\nprovided me with much to consider and reflect upon as we continue our collective efforts\nto work with and support Indigenous people.\nI look forward to beginning our ongoing work together to understand how central\nbanks can more effectively include Indigenous communities.",

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nvia prerecorded video\nat\nThe Midwest Cyber Workshop\nThe Federal Reserve Banks of St. Louis, Chicago, and Kansas City\nSt. Louis, Missouri\nJune 25, 2024\n\nGood afternoon and welcome to the 2nd annual Midwest Cyber Workshop hosted\nby the Federal Reserve Banks of Chicago, Kansas City, and St. Louis.1 This workshop\nwas launched last year to further the conversation on cyber risks between community\nbankers, regulators, law enforcement, and industry stakeholders. It is an honor to be a\npart of this workshop again and to kickoff this year’s event.\nCybersecurity continues to be a key risk area for the banking industry and for\nregulators. Cyber-related events, including ransomware attacks and business email\ncompromises, are extremely costly and time-consuming experiences. For community\nbanks, maintaining the necessary resources and technology to support a successful\ncybersecurity program can feel especially challenging and financially burdensome. The\nevolving nature of cyberthreats requires banks to continually review and enhance\nprocesses and procedures to protect, detect, and respond to an incident, even if the\noperating environment has not significantly changed. Ten years ago, immutable backups\nand multifactor authentication on privileged access accounts were not common controls\ndeployed by community banks. Today, they are considered to be standard elements of a\ncyber risk management strategy.\nFinancial industry vendors and service providers add an additional layer of cyber-\nrelated vulnerability. Attacks on these third parties have enabled bad actors to create\noperational incidents and breaches of customer information at financial institutions.\nEffectively managing and monitoring third-party relationships is an essential component\nof a bank’s broader risk management function. Given the increased adoption of cloud-\nbased solutions, outsourcing of critical functions, and exploration of the use of artificial\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nintelligence (AI), banks must have robust strategies for cyber resilience. Generative AI\nhas the potential to transform operations and the customer experience. But it is also\nvulnerable to cyberthreats and will require an ongoing analysis of risk-identification and -\nmanagement.\nLast year, the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation,\nand the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency jointly issued new guidance titled\n“Interagency Guidance on Third-Party Relationships: Risk Management,” which was\nrecently supplemented by a community bank guide meant to assist these banks in\ntailoring their third-party risk management programs. Later this afternoon, you will hear\nmore on this from our panel of IT examiners on these resources, recent observations from\nthe field, and risks associated with AI.\nRansomware attacks continue to target individuals, businesses, and governments\nacross the country and often result in significant financial and operational harm.\nCombating ransomware requires that an organization make investments in people,\nprocesses, and technology. Often, these attacks are successful because well-intentioned\nstaff have their guard down, or they are not effectively trained to identify and respond to\na potential incident.\nEmployees can be your greatest strength, but also your weakest link when it\ncomes to protecting digital assets. That’s why it is critical that cyberprograms are built\nupon a solid foundation that includes training staff to quickly respond to suspicious\nactivity. This reinforces the importance of a skeptical approach in helping to safeguard\ninformation. Today and tomorrow, Federal Reserve staff, law enforcement, and industry\nstakeholders will share their perspectives on ransomware incidents, including restoration\n\n- 3 -\nof key payments-related functions, cyberinsurance, payments-related risks, and financial\nconsiderations during an incident.\nFinally, a cybersecurity program would not be complete without a comprehensive\ntesting and exercise plan. By incorporating regular testing, a bank can identify strengths\nand weaknesses in their current strategies. They can then leverage this information to\nenhance resiliency, resulting in a higher level of preparedness when an incident occurs.\nTabletop exercises like the one facilitated tomorrow with IBM are an excellent way to\ntest a cyberdefense strategy against multiple scenarios, including those involving a third\nparty and payment systems.\nIn closing, outreach events like this workshop, the February 2024 Ask the Fed®\nsession with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and our recent virtual\n“office hours” on the 2023 third-party risk management guidance enable us to connect\nand share resources. These opportunities help us to better support industry management\nof cybersecurity and other operational risks.\nI would like to thank the Federal Reserve Banks of Chicago, Kansas City, and St.\nLouis for organizing this event, and I hope you enjoy the workshop.",

Bowman\nVice Chair for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\n(via pre-recorded video)\nat\n2025 Community Banking Research Conference\nSt. Louis, Missouri\nOctober 7, 2025\n\nWelcome to the 2025 community banking research conference.1 While I regret\nthat I cannot join you in person this year, I would like to take a moment to acknowledge\nthe contributions this conference has made and continues to make in promoting research\non community banking and related issues.\nSince 2013, this conference has synthesized insights and perspectives from\nresearch and regulatory and banking communities with a single goal: deepening our\nunderstanding of the community bank business model in order to better inform future\npolicy decisions.\nWe share this goal, and the sponsorship of this event with the Conference of State\nBank Supervisors (CSBS) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). We\nare proud of this ongoing partnership with CSBS and FDIC and the effort to further\nactionable bank industry research.\nAs the former Kansas state bank commissioner and a community banker, I very\nmuch appreciate the goals of this conference. And again this year, the organizers have\nincluded valuable research and created a conference program that includes a wide range\nof perspectives that create an opportunity for discussion and debate.\nEnsuring the future and viability of the community banking industry continues to\nbe a top priority, especially as the President appointed me to serve as the Vice Chair for\nSupervision of the Federal Reserve Board.\nThis position, which was created under the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010, requires the\nVice Chair to “develop policy recommendations for the Board regarding supervision and\nregulation of depository institution holding companies and other financial firms\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nsupervised by the Board” and to also “oversee the supervision and regulation” of these\nfirms.\nIt is an honor and an absolute privilege to be entrusted with these important\nresponsibilities, and I look forward to working with all of our stakeholders in the\nfinancial industry to modernize supervision and regulation that allows for continued\neconomic growth and innovation in the banking system and that enhances the critical role\nof community banks.\nCommunity banks are the cornerstone of local economies, providing credit to\nlocal customers and businesses with few alternatives for accessing financial services.\nThe community bank relationship model requires just that relationship. Direct\nknowledge of and a connection with the community, which makes this banking model\ntruly unique and even more valuable.\nBut this model continues to face challenges—challenges that I am confident this\nconference will explore in greater detail that will help us to inform future policy\ndevelopments.\nWhen I spoke at this conference last year, I described a framework for community\nbanking regulation for the future.\nIn those remarks, I discussed the necessary building blocks for building an\neffective framework, which include\n• reviewing, reconsidering, and indexing the asset size thresholds that are used\nthroughout our current supervisory and regulatory framework;\n• gaining a better understanding of the tradeoffs of regulation;\n• identifying the hidden costs of supervision and supervisory guidance;\n\n- 3 -\n• streamlining the mergers and acquisitions review and approval process; and\n• identifying ways to promote new bank formation.\nSince that time, the Federal Reserve has already launched several initiatives to\nadvance these goals, but there’s more work ahead.\nWe are refocusing supervisory efforts on core material financial risks, reviewing\nthe CAMELS ratings framework, revising the community bank leverage ratio, and\nconsidering ways to improve the treatment of mutual banks. We are also prioritizing\nwork to assist in the fight against fraud.\nIn the coming years, this conference will be an important mechanism for\ncontinuing to explore challenges facing the banking industry, and especially community\nbanks. And with the work we are undertaking, we will continue to prioritize changes to\nthe community bank regulatory and supervisory framework that will allow community\nbanks to continue to thrive.\nOver the years, this conference has highlighted the important role community\nbanks play in our economy, the impacts of regulation on our banks, the disproportionate\ncost burden from regulation on our nation’s smallest banks, and the importance of having\na strong diversified network of community banks. It is critical that our regulatory and\nsupervisory framework continues to support a network of these banks across and\nthroughout the country so that they are positioned to support the economy and to meet the\ncredit needs of their communities.\nAs I work with staff across the Federal Reserve to enhance the Fed’s supervision\nof banks, I’m reminded how the research presented at this conference over the years,\nalong with the findings from the CSBS annual survey of community banks, has\n\n- 4 -\nconsistently demonstrated the need for regulatory tailoring. This has given us a better\nperspective to understand and measure the cost of compliance.\nIn short, this conference truly matters.\nEach year, the research presented here moves us forward; improves our\nunderstanding; and, combined with other insights from key stakeholders and our own\nexperiences, enables us to make better regulatory and supervisory decisions.\nFrom the first year of the conference in 2013, we’ve seen a number of changes in\nthe banking and financial systems, in our economy, and in our supervisory and regulatory\nstructures. The research presented here each year has evolved with these changes and has\ndelivered critical and timely insights.\nI’m so pleased that this conference has not strayed from its original mission and\ncontinues to provide a forum for the discussion of thoughtful, timely research into our\ncountry’s unique community banking business model.\nCommunity banks are vital to the U.S. economy and to the thousands of smaller\nlocal economies they serve across the country. It’s important that we continue to study\nand understand the important role they play.\nThis conference helps to increase this understanding.\nIn addition to presenting thoughtful research, it provides an opportunity for open\ndialogue between community bankers, academics, regulators, and policymakers.\nIn these ever-changing times, the unique combination of research presented in\ncombination with real-world perspectives provides insights that help to ensure that the\ncommunity banking model endures well into the future.\n\n- 5 -\nThis conference is just one aspect of the Federal Reserve System’s engagement on\nissues affecting community banks. Outreach to banks of all sizes, including community\nbanks, has been a top priority for my work because your voices must be a part of the\nconversation in Washington. In a few days, the Board will host a Community Bank\nConference in D.C., bringing together bankers, industry experts, and other stakeholders to\ndiscuss and identify the most relevant issues facing the industry.\nThis event will be live-streamed on the Board’s website and will include several\nunique and exciting speakers and panelists, covering a number of current issues.\nThank you for your continued interest and engagement in supporting this\nconference.",

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nEconomic Club of Oklahoma\nOklahoma City, Oklahoma\n(via webcast)\nMarch 22, 2021\n\nThank you, Doug, and thank you to the members of the Economic Club of\nOklahoma for the opportunity to speak about a subject of vital interest to all of us—the\noutlook for the U.S. economy in 2021. Our nation has made considerable progress since\nCOVID-19 hit the economy with great force a year ago, but we still have further to go,\nand risks remain.1\nAs we all know, starting in late February or March of last year, widespread\neconomic and social lockdowns and other effects of the COVID-19 pandemic caused the\nswiftest and deepest contraction in employment and economic activity since the Great\nDepression. Money markets, the Treasury market, and other parts of the financial system\nseized up, and there were fears of another severe financial crisis. The Federal Reserve\nstepped in quickly to assist, reviving several lending facilities used in the previous crisis\nand creating several new facilities. We also cut short-term interest rates to near zero and\nbegan purchasing large quantities of Treasury and agency securities to help sustain the\nflow of credit to households and businesses. Congress and the Administration also\nworked together to provide effective and timely support. Calm was restored in financial\nmarkets, and employment and output began growing in May, but it was a very deep hole\nto fill. Rapid progress over the summer gave way to slower growth over the past winter\nas COVID-19 infection rates surged. But in recent weeks, with steep declines in virus-\nrelated hospitalizations and deaths, the outlook has brightened. Job creation had stalled\nover the winter months but picked up in February, with an increase of around 380,000\njobs. The pace of vaccinations has accelerated, COVID-related restrictions on economic\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my Federal Open Market\nCommittee colleagues. I would also like to acknowledge the valuable contributions of Federal Reserve\nstaff member Wendy Dunn.\n\n- 2 -\nactivity are beginning to ease, and the latest round of stimulus is boosting consumer\nspending.\nDespite the news of the spread of more-contagious COVID-19 variants, efforts to\nincrease vaccine shipments and recently announced plans for distribution to the broader\npublic are encouraging and, if successful, give me some confidence that our economic\nperformance will continue to improve quickly over the remainder of the year.\nMy outlook for the economy is broadly in line with the median of projections of\nother members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), published following our\nmeeting last week. Most of my FOMC colleagues expect the economy to grow between\n5.8 percent and 6.6 percent in 2021, and the median projection is that the unemployment\nrate will fall to 4.5 percent by the end of the year. My own expectation is for strong\ngrowth and a rebound in the labor force participation rate once the economy fully\nreopens. This would include schools resuming fulltime in-person learning, which would\nenable parents who reduced their hours or left the workforce to oversee virtual education\nand childcare to return to fulltime work.\nAs of February, the level of payroll employment is still 9-1/2 million below the\npre-pandemic peak and more than 11 million below where it would have been based on\nthe trend before the pandemic. I believe that job creation will continue, but I still see\nconsiderable uncertainty about the strength of that improvement and how long it may\ntake to reach the Federal Reserve’s maximum-employment goal. I am also concerned\nthat the extended period of economic restrictions will contribute to further business\nclosures. Severe restrictions on mobility and commerce were implemented in many areas\nto control the spread of the virus, but they came at a very high economic cost. There is\n\n- 3 -\nsome evidence, which I will discuss in a moment, that small businesses fared better in\nstates with less-stringent restrictions. While the headline unemployment rate has\ncontinued to fall, the number of people who report being unemployed for more than six\nmonths has continued to rise, suggesting a risk of scarring—meaning that some\nindividuals could see an erosion of their skills and their connections to the labor market.\nAlthough economic activity in the travel, leisure, and hospitality sectors has\ncontinued to lag the recovery, there have been some bright spots elsewhere. Two that are\nparticularly important for Oklahoma are agriculture and energy. Commodity prices for\nsome crops have increased dramatically in the past few months, particularly soybeans and\ncorn, reflecting higher export demand and some limits on global supply. Increased prices\nare providing better cash flow and improved credit terms for farmers. Agricultural\nmanufacturers and other suppliers are reporting order backlogs through the summer\nmonths, and there are some reports of firmer or increased prices for farmland.\nMeanwhile, the recent surge in oil prices has returned West Texas Intermediate\nback up near the levels of early 2020, when it began to fall sharply. The rebound in\nprices reflects the improved outlook for the global economy given significant progress\ntoward widespread vaccinations in many countries. This recovery has not had a dramatic\neffect yet on businesses engaged in or supporting oil and gas extraction, but there are\nsigns of a turnaround. So far this year, retail gasoline prices have been rising sharply,\nand the North American rig count is now the highest it has been since last April.\nBut in contrast to the broadening improvements in many sectors of the economy,\nan area I continue to be concerned about is the outlook for U.S. businesses, particularly\nsmall businesses, which have borne the brunt of the effects of the pandemic. We are now\n\n- 4 -\nmore than a year into the pandemic, and many small businesses are continuing to struggle\nin their efforts to remain open. Recently, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) released\ncounts of business closures for the second quarter of last year, when most face-to-face\nbusinesses were largely shuttered.2 In that quarter, the closure rate for establishments\nshowed a sharp increase to 9 percent, compared with an average of about 5 percent\nduring 2019.\nAs part of the fiscal stimulus package passed in June last year, the Paycheck\nProtection Program (PPP) and other government supports helped many businesses\nwithstand the extended period of inactivity over the spring and summer. Many of the\nshuttered businesses were at least partially reopened in the second half of last year. But\nas virus cases surged toward the end of 2020, many state and local governments\nreimposed restrictions on business activity, and others postponed plans to lift their\nexisting restrictions.\nEven today, more than a year later, some sectors, like restaurants, leisure, and\ntourism, are continuing to face major effects from pandemic-related social distancing,\nforced closures, and capacity limits. These restrictions may have been helpful in\ncontaining the pandemic, but they appear to have disproportionately impeded small\nfirms’ ability to maintain their operations and revenue sources, leading to substantial cash\nflow pressures. Small businesses will be helped in the near term with a new round of\nPPP lending, which included adjustments to terms that will make forgiveness of these\nloans less onerous than before. Even with this, financial pressures on many small\n2 The BLS counts an establishment as “closed” if it reports no employment (or does not report at all) in the\nthird month of the quarter after reporting positive employment in the third month of the previous quarter.\nThe BLS will eventually categorize closed businesses as “deaths” if they stay closed for four quarters. In\nrecent years, the annual establishment death rate has been around 8.5 percent.\n\n- 5 -\nbusinesses remain acute, and I am concerned that a growing number of small businesses\nhave already been closed permanently or are on the verge of failure.\nThe BLS data are not yet available beyond the second quarter of last year, so,\nfrom that source, it’s difficult to assess the full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic\nresulted in permanent business closures. But research by the Board’s staff using\nnontraditional data sources finds that, in 2020, business exits were especially elevated\namong small firms and particularly in industries most sensitive to social distancing.3 The\nauthors found that the permanent exit rate of restaurants in 2020 was about 50 percent\nhigher than average historical rates.\nOn a related note, I would emphasize that, up to this point, the national data on\nbusiness loan delinquencies and bankruptcy filings have not been especially concerning.\nThat said, small businesses are often unincorporated, and many go under without\ndeclaring bankruptcy or defaulting on loans. In fact, many small business owners rely on\ncredit cards or home equity loans for financing, so their failure to make timely payments\nwould not be reflected in data on business loan delinquencies.\nElsewhere, evidence of small business finance fragility is shown in Federal\nReserve survey data. In the latest reading from the Small Business Credit Survey\nconducted in October 2020, 80 percent of firms reported seeing a decline in revenue over\nlast year, and two-thirds of those reported declines of at least 25 percent. Since then,\nthere have been indications that things have gotten worse. For example, in February,\nsurvey data from the National Federation of Independent Business indicate that a net\n3 See Leland Crane, Ryan Decker, Aaron Flaaen, Adrian Hamins-Puertolas, and Christopher Kurz (2020),\n“Business Exit during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Non-Traditional Measures in Historical Context,”\nFinance and Economics Discussion Series 2020-089 (Washington: Board of Governors, October),\nhttps://doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2020.089.\n\n- 6 -\nmajority of small businesses reported declines in earnings over the past three months, and\na net majority expect their sales to worsen over the next three months.\nThese economic data align with conversations that I have had with bankers across\nthe country, which consistently point to the emerging credit challenges among small and\nmedium-sized businesses as a major source of concern. Bankers note that the substantial\nsupport from the Paycheck Protection Program and other fiscal policies have postponed,\nbut not eliminated, these financial pressures. The bankers I speak with have also noted\nthat, while monetary policy has successfully delivered favorable borrowing conditions,\nmany firms are reluctant to take on debt or additional borrowing because of the highly\nuncertain business climate. Recent data from the from the Fed’s Senior Loan Officer\nOpinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices tell a similar story: The January edition of\nthat survey showed a majority of banks reporting weaker demand for commercial and\nindustrial loans to firms of all sizes.\nThe sharp, and largely voluntary, pullback in consumer spending that followed\nthe onset of the pandemic was undoubtedly a major trigger for the financial struggles that\nbusinesses are now facing. But in addition, there is evidence that the economic\nrestrictions imposed by many state and local governments have played a role in the\ndeteriorating health of small businesses. Using data from the Small Business Pulse\nSurvey conducted by the Census Bureau, the Board’s staff found that, in states with\ntighter restrictions on business activity, small firms were more likely to report large\ndeclines in their business operations. Firms in relatively restrictive states were also more\nlikely to report that they expect to operate at reduced capacity for an extended period, and\nthey were more likely to expect to need financial assistance in the next six months.\n\n- 7 -\nWhile obviously not conclusive, the visible relationship between state-level economic\nrestrictions and small business damage is both striking and concerning.\nYou may be tempted to ask why I am so focused on small businesses. For one, it\nis because the roughly 32 million small businesses in the United States comprise an\nimportant source of job growth in the macroeconomy, and they have an outsized impact\non their local communities. Over the past decade, small businesses created 10.5 million\nnet new jobs, accounting for roughly two-thirds of overall net new job creation. This, as\nI see it, is why the potential for a wave of small business failures is one of the main risks\nto my expectation that our economy will make further substantial progress toward our\ngoal of full employment. Moreover, from my vantage point as a former community\nbanker, I see other potential negative consequences: Because small businesses often\nform the backbone of the communities where they are located, their disappearance could\nhave profound and long-lasting community-level effects as well.\nAs I look further down the road, there are some tentative signs that the pickup in\noverall economic activity will eventually bring an improvement in conditions for small\nbusinesses. For example, the latest responses to the same Small Business Pulse Survey I\nmentioned earlier now indicate that expectations of small business failures—which were\nquite high during most of 2020—have dropped noticeably and are now tracking below\nthe average rate of failures observed over the five years preceding the pandemic.\nI spoke earlier about employment, and I will now turn to the price-stability side of\nthe Fed’s mandated goals for monetary policy. In recent months, we have seen consumer\nprice inflation moving up, and I anticipate that the 12-month rates in the next few months\nwill very likely track above our 2 percent benchmark as the unusual softness in prices\n\n- 8 -\nthat we saw in April and May last year drops out of the calculation. The marked rise in\nfood prices over the past 12 months has also pushed up the headline measures of price\ninflation. For many other categories of consumer goods, high order backlogs and tight\nsupplies of key production inputs—like lumber and semiconductors—as well as logjams\nat the nation’s ports and a shortage of truck drivers are likely to push up prices over the\nnext several months. But I expect that these pricing pressures will be temporary, easing\nover the course of this year as supply bottlenecks are gradually resolved.\nBeyond this year, some observers have expressed concern that a rapid recovery in\naggregate demand amid substantial fiscal support and accommodative monetary policy\ncould lead to undesirably high inflation. While I expect that the stronger economy will\npush up inflation somewhat, let me explain why I do not expect pricing pressures to be\nexcessive and why I believe the Federal Reserve is likely to continue supporting the\neconomy for some time through accommodative monetary policy.\nHere I will point to what has in the past seemed to be a relationship between\ninflation and unemployment, known as the Phillips curve. Over the past several decades,\ndespite large swings in unemployment, inflation has been extremely stable. As an\nexample, up to the beginning of the pandemic, when the economy was growing and\nunemployment was at a 50 year low of 3.5 percent, inflation was still very low and stable.\nEconomists often attribute this so-called flat Phillips curve to the fact that individuals’\ninflation expectations are well anchored and unlikely to respond to short-term pricing\nmovements. Survey data on long-run inflation expectations tend to back up this idea.\nThey have been remarkably stable over the past decade, and, although they declined\n\n- 9 -\nmoderately during the middle of last year, most measures have edged up again in recent\nmonths and now stand roughly at the levels observed during the pre-pandemic period.\nWith all of that said, given our lack of historical experience with both this level of\nsubstantial fiscal stimulus and highly accommodative monetary policy, my outlook for\ninflation is fairly uncertain. When making monetary policy decisions, we would be\nconcerned about a significant increase in inflation above our 2 percent goal that was\nsustained for some time. But as my Fed colleagues and I have said many times, monetary\npolicy is not on a preset course. I will continue to monitor economic developments\ncarefully, and, if my outlook for inflation were to change materially, my assessment of\nthe appropriate stance of monetary policy would change as well.\nI will wrap up by noting that the economy has made great progress since last\nspring, and I am optimistic that will continue in 2021, but we still have significant ground\nto make up and new strains of COVID-19 could slow progress in containing the\npandemic. Last year’s sharp contraction in economic activity was like nothing we had\nseen before, and we are still assessing its impact. One unresolved question, in my mind,\nis how resilient small businesses will prove to be after the extended period of reduced\nactivity.\nWhat does all of this mean for the outlook for monetary policy? As we indicated\nin the policy statement released last week, my FOMC colleagues and I expect to maintain\nan accommodative stance of monetary policy until employment and inflation achieve\nlevels consistent with our maximum employment and inflation goals. At this point, the\neconomy is still a long way from those goals. We are making progress, but I think it will\ntake some time for us to get there.",

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n2022 CEO & Senior Management Summit sponsored by\nthe Kansas Bankers Association\nColorado Springs, Colorado\nAugust 6, 2022\n\nThanks to the Kansas Bankers Association for the invitation to share my\nperspective on the economy and bank regulation. It is always a pleasure to be here with\nyou for this annual gathering. I am especially looking forward to hearing what is on your\nminds about supervision and regulation, how you are navigating current economic\nconditions, and your expectations going forward.\nI’ll start with a recap of the decision from July’s Federal Open Market Committee\nmeeting and then move on to my thoughts about the current economic uncertainty and\nchallenges that lie ahead. The number one challenge, of course, is inflation, which\ncontinues to be much too high, and a heavy burden for households and businesses. As\nI’m sure you all already know, the Federal Open Market Committee decided last week to\nraise the federal funds rate by 75 basis points, to a range of 2¼ to 2½ percent. I will\nshare my reasoning for supporting this increase and why I support continued increases\nuntil inflation is on a consistent path to significantly decline. I will then touch on the\ncurrent federal regulatory climate and the Fed’s agenda for supervision.\nInflation continued to climb in June, reaching 9.1 percent as measured by the\nconsumer price index. This is yet another concerningly high reading, and it set another\n40-year record high despite the expectation of many forecasters that inflation had peaked\nearlier in the year. I have seen few, if any, concrete indications that support this\nexpectation, and I will need to see unambiguous evidence of this decline before I\nincorporate an easing of inflation pressures into my outlook.\nMany of the underlying causes of excessive inflation are the same as they have\nbeen over the past year or so—supply chain issues, including those related to China’s\n\n- 2 -\nCOVID containment policies, constrained housing supply, the ongoing conflict in\nUkraine, fiscal stimulus, and limitations on domestic energy production.\nRegardless of the source of the inflationary pressure, the Federal Reserve has a\nduty to bring inflation down to our 2 percent target. This duty is mandated by Congress\nto carry out monetary policy that results in price stability—meaning low and stable\ninflation. We all understand why this is a critically important responsibility, especially in\ntimes of extreme inflation. Rising prices for food, housing, and energy negatively impact\naffordability for all Americans, but especially those with low or moderate incomes. For\nthose workers who drive long distances to get to work, high inflation is especially\nconcerning, requiring some to make tradeoffs between feeding their families and buying\nfuel to fill gas tanks. Some workers have seen their wages grow significantly over the\npast two years, but most have seen any gains in wages far outpaced by higher prices.\nTherefore, in my mind, it is absolutely critical that we continue to use our monetary\npolicy tools until we are successful in returning inflation to our 2 percent goal.\nBusinesses are also suffering from elevated inflation through rising and volatile\nprices for inputs and the need to price their own goods and services to cover costs without\nlosing customers. This dynamic is evident in agriculture and what we are hearing\ndirectly from farmers and ranchers, who are dealing with added weather challenges and\non-going drought. Prices for commodities have declined lately but are still at historically\nhigh levels. In contrast, prices for fertilizer and many crop inputs continue to rise. In\nsome areas, high input costs and drought conditions are contributing to record early\nseason cattle auction sales, as many ranchers choose to sell herds early to limit further\noutlays for input expenses.\n\n- 3 -\nI see a significant risk of high inflation into next year for necessities including\nfood, housing, fuel, and vehicles. Rents have grown dramatically, and while home sales\nhave slowed, the continued increasing price of single-family homes indicates to me that\nrents won’t decline anytime in the near future. Recently, gasoline prices have moderated\nbut are still roughly 80 percent higher than pre-pandemic levels due to constrained\ndomestic supply and the disruption of world markets. And I see continued inflation risk\nfrom motor vehicle prices, as auto manufacturers struggle with supply chain problems\nthat haven’t improved significantly. Demand for cars continues to exceed supply, and\nretail used car prices are still very high, about 50 percent more than before the pandemic.\nThe supply problems pushing up inflation seem likely to persist. Indications are\nthat the conflict in Ukraine will continue, and that the effects of shipping disruptions of\nagriculture products and limits on energy supplies from Russia will continue to be a\nsignificant problem. Even with the recent agreement intended to facilitate Ukrainian\ngrain exports, it is unclear whether supply pressures on global markets will ease as a\nresult. An announced reduction in Russian natural gas supplies to Western Europe has\ndriven European prices even higher, causing ripple effects on world energy markets and\nraising concerns about shortages this winter. China has eased some of its most stringent\nCOVID containment measures but recently revived travel restrictions in some areas, and\nits approach to the pandemic remains an upside risk for inflation. Despite a slowdown in\nsales of new and existing homes, inventories of homes for sale and rental vacancies\nremain low, supporting ongoing increases in housing costs.\nOn the other side of our dual mandate, maximum employment, we continue to see\na tight labor market, though there are some emerging signs that would support\n\n- 4 -\nexpectations of loosening. Yesterday’s job report showed continued significant growth in\nhiring with the unemployment rate finally returning to the pre-pandemic level of 3.5\npercent. As I am sure you all know, the job market in Kansas is even stronger, with an\nunemployment rate of 2.4 percent in June. In our state, finding workers is a bigger\nproblem in most communities than finding a job.\nOne aspect of the job market that has not recovered is labor force participation.\nBased on the pre-pandemic trend, there are nearly four million people who are still sitting\nout of a strong labor market.\nIn contrast to this labor market strength in Kansas and nationwide, output growth\nhas slowed this year. Real gross domestic product, GDP, edged lower in the second\nquarter, following a larger decline in the first quarter.\nMy base case is for a pickup in growth during the second half of this year and for\nmoderate growth in 2023. As we learned during the summer and fall of 2021, both GDP\nand jobs numbers are subject to significant revision, both in subsequent months and then\nagain the next year. From my perspective, had we known at the time about the eventual\nlarge upward revisions in last year’s employment data, we likely would have significantly\naccelerated our monetary policy actions. Going forward, we have to consider the\npossibility of these kinds of revisions when making real-time judgments as policymakers,\nwhich includes looking at other kinds of indicators instead of relying too heavily on the\ndata. Taking all of that on board, while the data on economic activity are indeed lower\nand the view is murky, the evidence on inflation is absolutely clear, which brings me to\nthe implications for monetary policy.\n\n- 5 -\nBased on current economic conditions and the outlook I just described, I\nsupported the FOMC’s decision last week to raise the federal funds rate another 75 basis\npoints. I also support the Committee’s view that “ongoing increases” would be\nappropriate at coming meetings. My view is that similarly-sized increases should be on\nthe table until we see inflation declining in a consistent, meaningful, and lasting way.\nOn the subject of forward guidance, I am pleased to see that following the July\nmeeting, the FOMC ended the practice of providing specific forward guidance in our\npost-meeting communications. I believe that the overly specific forward guidance\nimplemented at the December 2020 FOMC meeting requiring “substantial further\nprogress” unnecessarily limited the Committee’s actions in beginning the removal of\naccommodation later in 2021. In my view, that, combined with data revisions that were\ndirectly relevant to our decision making, led to a delay in taking action to address rising\ninflation.\nIt is helpful that the FOMC provided clear direction earlier this year that it was\nprepared to act quickly to tighten monetary policy. Since we have now taken actions to\nraise rates and finally reduce the Fed’s balance sheet, we are following through on that\ncommitment. Looking ahead, the FOMC will be getting two months of data on inflation\nand another month on employment before our next meeting in September, and while I\nexpect that ongoing rate increases will be appropriate, given the uncertainty in how those\ndata and conditions will evolve, I will allow that information to guide my judgment on\nhow big the increases will need to be.\nI do expect that the labor market will remain strong as we continue to increase\ninterest rates and allow the balance sheet to run off, but there is a risk that our actions will\n\n- 6 -\nslow job gains, or even reduce employment. Growth has softened, and perhaps this is an\nindication that our actions to tighten monetary policy are having the desired effect, with\nthe ultimate goal of bringing demand and supply into greater balance.\nWhen considering the risks to the labor market, these risks must be viewed in the\ncontext of its current strength and with the understanding that our primary challenge is to\nget inflation under control. In fact, the larger threat to the strong labor market is\nexcessive inflation, which if allowed to continue could lead to a further economic\nsoftening, risking a prolonged period of economic weakness coupled with high inflation,\nlike we experienced in the 1970s.\nIn any case, we must fulfill our commitment to lowering inflation, and I will\nremain steadfastly focused on this task.\nWith my outlook out of the way, let me turn to another of my responsibilities at\nthe Fed, which is bank regulation and supervision. I am sure that we will have the\nopportunity to discuss many issues of interest to you during our discussion, but I’d like to\nmention a pending rulemaking that would update the Community Reinvestment Act. I\nunderstand that the draft rule was intended to provide greater clarity to banks regarding\ncommunity development activities and their consideration for CRA. While I am a strong\nsupporter of the fundamentals behind CRA, and I support community development\nactivities, I am concerned that the proposal does not adequately account for the costs and\nbenefits of certain provisions, and that no attempt has even been made to either ensure\nthat or to analyze whether the benefits exceed the costs, which is a fundamental element\nof effective regulation. The comment period for the proposal ended on August 5, and I\nwill repeat what I have said in the past: if this proposal affects you or your business, I\n\n- 7 -\nhope that you made your voice heard by submitting a comment to the more than 600-\npage proposal within the short 90-day comment period. Public comments really do\nmatter when considering the content of proposed rulemakings.\nOf course, my comments about the benefits of public participation in rulemaking\napply beyond the CRA proposal, and there are other regulatory topics on the horizon that\nwould benefit from robust engagement. One that comes to mind is the regulatory\nframework for analyzing bank mergers. Earlier this year, the Justice Department\nrequested comment on whether to revise their 1995 Bank Merger Competitive Review\nguidelines, seeking input on a wide range of issues. The FDIC also issued a request for\ninformation on the Bank Merger Act framework. I expect this review will be a focus\nacross the banking agencies, and I will be very interested to see how the framework for\nsmall and regional banks is affected by any proposed change. I would be concerned\nabout any changes that would result in making mergers among these institutions more\ndifficult or would not address some of the longstanding issues with the existing\nframework. Among those are that the framework doesn’t account for new technologies\nor overwhelming competition posed by credit unions, internet based financial services,\nand non-bank financial companies. Another concern is that overly strict criteria for\nmergers could have the unintended consequence of depriving consumers in some areas of\naccess to any banking services. “Banking deserts” in rural and underserved areas are a\nreal problem and regulators should guard against this outcome when proposing or\nevaluating rules.\nI should also briefly mention three other regulatory topics of interest to all banks,\nincluding those here today.\n\n- 8 -\nFirst, the Fed’s LIBOR proposal is currently out for comment on a short timeline.\nThat proposal implements the recently passed LIBOR Act by providing default rules for\ncertain contracts that use the soon to be discontinued reference rate. Second, comments\nare currently under review for the third-party risk management guidance jointly proposed\nby the Fed with the other banking agencies. Banks and third parties will benefit from\nclear guidance that helps banks navigate the challenging issues and risks raised by third\nparty engagement.\nFinally, another area that could benefit from more regulatory clarity is digital\nassets, including stablecoins and crypto assets. Some banks are considering expanding\ninto a range of crypto activities, including custody, lending backed by crypto collateral,\nand facilitating the purchase and sale of these assets for their customers. In the absence\nof clear guidance, banks should consult with their primary regulator and exercise caution\nwhen engaging with customers in these types of activities.\nI will conclude with a brief comment on supervision. While the trend of returning\nto on-site bank examination is continuing, progress has been somewhat slow. This may\nbe driven in part by the varied pace of employees returning to the office. That said, the\nFed intends to return to some form of on-site supervision. We find substantial value in\nthose in-person interactions during bank examinations.\nIn closing, thank you again for the opportunity to speak to you today. I look\nforward to hearing how high inflation is affecting you and your communities and your\nthoughts on the regulatory agenda.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n1:00 p.m. EDT\nApril 18, 2023\nConsiderations for a Central Bank Digital Currency\nRemarks by\nMichelle W. Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nGeorgetown University McDonough School of Business\nPsaros Center for Financial Markets and Policy\nWashington, DC\nApril 18, 2023\n\nIt is a pleasure to be with you today to discuss the evolving money and payments\nlandscape in the United States, which is a topic of primary importance to the Federal Reserve.\nTechnological innovation has changed this landscape in recent years, as we have seen the\nemergence of new financial services entrants offering payments services, new platforms\ndesigned to increase the speed of payments, clearing, and settlement, and new forms of digital\nmoney. Over the past several years, and as a direct result of these developments, we have seen a\nsignificant increase in attention on central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) from central banks\naround the world in addition to a great deal of international and domestic engagement on CBDC.\nA number of central banks have taken steps to begin exploring the potential uses of a CBDC in\ntheir home countries. A very small number have adopted a CBDC for their local jurisdictions.\nAnd of course, discussions of the purpose, design, and potential risks of a U.S. CBDC, and\ntechnical research about key design elements, continue here in the United States. While the\nFederal Reserve plays an important role in these ongoing discussions and technical research, the\nFed would not implement a U.S. CBDC without the approval of Congress.\nIn broad terms, a CBDC is simply a new form of digital liability of a central bank.\nBecause it is issued by a central bank, CBDC is typically thought of as being denominated in the\ncurrency of that central bank. One could imagine a digital U.S. dollar, a digital euro, or a digital\npound. Beyond this baseline definition though, “what is a CBDC” defies a simple definition. A\nCBDC built on distributed ledger technology offers a wide range of design and potential use\noptions, as well as potential risks. This variability complicates any discussion of a CBDC simply\nbecause we may not be talking about the same thing.\nThere are two threshold questions that a policymaker needs to ask before any decision to\nmove forward with a CBDC. First, what problem is the policymaker trying to solve, and is a\n\n- 2 -\nCBDC a potential solution? Second, what features and considerations—including unintended\nconsequences—may a policymaker want to consider in deciding to design and adopt a CBDC?\nWhile it would be impossible for me to provide a comprehensive analysis of every issue\nsurrounding CBDC, my goal today is to offer a perspective on these two threshold questions and\nto conclude with some thoughts about the imperative for future research on CBDCs and the\npotential future of CBDCs in the United States.\nWhat Problem Could a CBDC Solve?\nIn my view, the fundamental question is: what problem could a CBDC solve?\nCBDC and the Payment System\nOne issue being examined is whether a CBDC or even broader forms of digital money\ncould make the payment system more efficient. Do these new technologies present opportunities\nto increase the speed of payments and/or lower costs and frictions within the payment system?\nOf course, this question takes place in the context of the payments infrastructure in each\njurisdiction, both for domestic payments and for cross-border payments. Many countries have\nlaunched faster payment systems and continue to investigate how central banks can support these\npayment systems. We have seen a wide range of motivations for this work, including addressing\nspecific inefficiencies in the payment system, providing a CBDC if cash use were to decline, or\npromoting broader private-sector innovation for future generations of payments.1\n1 For example, The Bank of England and HM Treasury have stated that they judge that it is likely a digital pound\nwill be needed in the future and that further preparatory work is justified. See Bank of England and HM Treasury,\nThe Digital Pound: A New Form of Money for Households and Businesses? Consultation Paper (London: Bank of\nEngland, February 2023), https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/paper/2023/the-digital-pound-\nconsultation-working-paper.pdf?la=en&hash=5CC053D3820DCE2F40656E772D9105FA10C654EC.\nHowever, the UK parliament has previously expressed skepticism. See House of Lords, UK Parliament, Central\nBank Digital Currencies: A Solution in Search of a Problem?, HL Paper 131, (London: House of Lords, UK\nParliament, January 2022), https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/175/economic-affairs-\ncommittee/news/160221/central-bank-digital-currencies-a-solution-in-search-of-a-problem-report-published/.\nSimilarly, a government-appointed report in Sweden did not find a current need for a CBDC, though the Riksbank\n\n- 3 -\nImproving the speed of payments, particularly retail payments, can be accomplished\nwithout the introduction of a CBDC. In the United States, beginning later this year, the Federal\nReserve’s FedNowSMService will enable banks in the United States to offer their customers the\nability to send and receive payments in real-time.2\nPolicymakers have also raised other arguments for why a CBDC may be suitable in their\nhome countries. Some have argued that a CBDC would facilitate large-value transactions\nbetween financial institutions.3 Others see CBDC as a vehicle to improve upon international\npayments. And still others view CBDCs as necessary to preserve the role of central bank money\nas a stabilizing force in the payments system and to safeguard monetary sovereignty,4 or to\nensure that digital money has a high degree of safety and uniformity to promote innovation and\ncompetition.5\nCBDC and Financial Inclusion\nAnother issue that some have raised is whether innovation in money and payments,\nincluding a potential U.S. CBDC, could improve financial inclusion. We can all agree that\ncontinues to investigate how an e-krona could work if a decision is taken in the future to issue digital central bank\nmoney. See Centralbanking.com, “Sweden Does Not Yet Need CBDC, Inquiry Finds,” web article,\nhttps://www.centralbanking.com/fintech/cbdc/7957236/sweden-does-not-yet-need-cbdc-inquiry-finds and Sveriges\nRiksbank, E-krona Pilot Phase 3 (Sweden: Riksbank, April 2023), https://www.riksbank.se/en-gb/payments--\ncash/e-krona/e-krona-reports/e-krona-pilot-phase-3/.\n2 FedNow is expected to be available to financial institutions in July that are early adopters and have completed a\nprogram for customer certification and testing. See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Federal\nReserve Announces July Launch for the FedNow Service,” news release, March 15, 2023,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20230315a.htm.\n3 Agustín Carstens, general manager of the Bank for International Settlements has discussed the idea of a “unified\nledger” run by the central bank to fully realize the potential of new technologies developed by the private sector.\nSee Agustín Carstens, “Innovation and the Future of the Monetary System,” speech at the Monetary Authority of\nSingapore, Singapore, February 22, 2023, https://www.bis.org/speeches/sp230222.htm.\n4 Fabio Panetta, “Central Bank Digital Currencies: Defining the Problems, Designing the Solutions,” speech at U.S.\nMonetary Policy Forum, New York, February 18, 2022, https://www.bis.org/review/r220223o.pdf.\n5 Jon Cunliffe, “The Digital Pound,” speech at UK Finance, February 7, 2023,\nhttps://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2023/february/jon-cunliffe-speech-at-uk-finance-update-on-central-bank-\ndigital-currency.\n\n- 4 -\nfinancial inclusion is an important goal when considering improvements in access to financial\nservices, banking, and the payment system. However, in the United States today, over 95\npercent of households have a least one member of the household with a banking relationship\nholding a checking or savings account.6 Of the remaining 4.5 percent who are not banked,\nnearly three-quarters have no interest in having a bank account, and approximately one-third\ncited a lack of trust in banks as the reason for not having a bank account. I think it is unlikely\nthat this group would find the government somehow more trustworthy than highly regulated\nbanks. Unbanked households are also less likely to own mobile phones or have access to the\ninternet, which would present barriers to CBDC adoption. While there has been important\nresearch on these barriers to adoption, including consumer attitudes and technology\nrequirements, policymakers also need to consider whether there are other means to improve\nfinancial inclusion, such as alternatives for making the distribution of government benefits more\nefficient and effective like promoting financial literacy.7\nCBDC for Implementation of Policy Objectives\nAnother issue is whether the government should use new technologies, including a\npotential CBDC, to accomplish a variety of policy objectives beyond those directly related to the\noperating of an efficient and safe financial system. Imagine a scenario in which fiscal spending,\nin the form of government benefits or payments, could be transferred via CBDC and could\ninclude a limited timeframe in which they could be spent before expiring. Enabling this type of\n6 2021 FDIC National Survey of Unbanked and Underbanked Households:\nhttps://www.fdic.gov/analysis/household-survey/2021report.pdf\n7 For additional discussion on CBDC design and financial inclusion, see Maniff, Jesse Leigh, “Inclusion by Design:\nCrafting a Central Bank Digital Currency to Reach All Americans”\nhttps://www.kansascityfed.org/research/payments-system-research-briefings/inclusion-by-design-crafting-central-\nbank-digital-currency/\n\n- 5 -\nlimit through a CBDC would stand in stark contrast to the flexibility and freedom embedded in\nphysical currency or bank deposits and could serve to control or even harm consumers and\nbusinesses. There is also a risk that this type of control could lead to the politicization of the\npayments system and at its heart, how money is used. A CBDC that permitted this type of\ncontrol not only has the potential to allow the government to limit certain types of private\nspending or limit access to banking accounts, it could also threaten the Federal Reserve’s\nindependence.\nThe Efficiency and Speed of the Payments System\nCBDCs are often discussed in the context of providing fast or instant payments for a\nvariety of transactions, whether consumer-to-business or person-to-person transactions. As I\npreviously noted, the introduction of the FedNow Service in the United States and other instant\npayments platforms globally leads me to ask: What could a CBDC accomplish, if anything, over\nand above what instant payments platforms alone can accomplish? There are potential use cases\nin the context of certain interbank transactions in wholesale markets, where some transactions\nare slow and heavily resource-intensive to clear and settle. Participants in the wholesale\nfinancial markets have been considering innovative ways to address these frictions with newer\ntechnologies such as distributed ledger technology in which shared information across\ncounterparties could be leveraged to increase speed and reduce back-office costs to reconcile\ntransactions before they settle. In the public debate about CBDC, some have argued that the\nintroduction of a wholesale version of a CBDC could fully unlock the benefits of these newer\ntechnologies for these financial market use cases. Similar to the questions noted for a retail level\nCBDC, policymakers must carefully consider the wholesale use cases, including whether there is\n\n- 6 -\nadded value of a wholesale version of CBDC in supporting new infrastructure to financial\ntransactions over and above existing methods.\nCross-Border Activities\nIn the international context, frictions and high costs are pain points often associated with\ncross-border payments. Many policymakers have discussed whether CBDCs could play a role in\nstreamlining cross-border payments by using new technologies, introducing simplified\ndistribution channels, and creating additional opportunities for cross-jurisdictional collaboration\nand interoperability. Of course, these opportunities may be limited by the regulatory and legal\nsafeguards in place for payments between countries with different legal structures, including\ncustomer identification, customer due diligence, and sanctions screening for compliance with\nregulations and policies for Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering (BSA/AML). These\ncompeting priorities are challenging to reconcile. While cross-border payments are among the\nslowest and least efficient, they also raise substantial legal and regulatory compliance concerns\nthat would apply equally to CBDCs.\nInternational Role of the U.S. Dollar\nAnother consideration is whether a CBDC (or lack of it) would affect the role of the U.S.\ndollar in international trade.8 In my view, the dollar serves this role because of the size of the\nU.S. economy, its deep and liquid financial markets, the strength of U.S. institutions, and its\ncommitment to the rule of law. A CBDC, or lack of it, may not meaningfully change the\nexisting incentives for people, firms, or countries to conduct business in the dollar. Therefore,\n8 See Christopher J. Waller, “The U.S. Dollar and Central Bank Digital Currencies,” speech at Digital Currencies\nand National Security Tradeoffs, a symposium presented by the Harvard National Security Journal, Cambridge,\nMassachusetts, October 14, 2022, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20221014a.htm. (“I\ndon’t think there are implications …[on the adoption of a U.S. CBDC] for the role of the United States in the global\neconomy and financial system.”)\n\n- 7 -\nmaintenance of the dollar as a reserve global currency will require broad policies that foster\neconomic growth, liquid markets, and an unwavering commitment to the rule of law. And we\nshould have an imperative to research and experiment with new technological innovation. I will\nsay more on that shortly.\nDeclining Cash Use and CBDC\nIn jurisdictions that have not adopted a CBDC, cash is generally the only central bank\nmoney available to the public, and it remains an important and popular means of payment.9 In\nsome countries, however, digital payments have rapidly supplanted the use of cash. As a result\nof this trend, many central banks have cited the importance of access to central bank money by\nthe general public as a potential reason to issue a CBDC. For example, Sir Jon Cunliffe of the\nUnited Kingdom examined the central role money plays in social and economic stability and\nconcluded that, because private money has been replacing the use of government money over\ntime, at some point “a retail, general purpose digital currency …will be needed in the U.K.”10\nBecause the Federal Reserve is committed to ensuring the continued safety and availability of\ncash, a CBDC could be considered as a means to expand safe payment options, not to reduce or\nreplace them. So, an important issue for us to consider would be whether a CBDC could provide\nthe public with a more attractive alternative to cash in a world that may be shifting away from\ncash-based payments. In probing this question, we need to also consider the privacy\nimplications, and whether a CBDC would be a better alternative than private-sector solutions.\n9 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Money and Payments: The U.S. Dollar in the Age of\nDigital Transformation (Washington: Board of Governors, January 2022),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/money-and-payments-20220120.pdf.\n10 Jon Cunliffe, “The Digital Pound,” https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2023/february/jon-cunliffe-speech-\nat-uk-finance-update-on-central-bank-digital-currency.\n\n- 8 -\nStablecoins and CBDC\nSome new private forms of money, often referred to as stablecoins, have emerged mainly\nto support trading in the crypto-asset ecosystem both as a means of payment and as a store of\nvalue. These stablecoins, which purport to have convertibility one-for-one with the dollar, have\nalso been discussed as an alternative to traditional payments. However, stablecoins are less\nsecure, less stable, and less regulated than traditional forms of money. and their structures and\nframeworks are opaque. To the extent stablecoins become widely used in day-to-day payments,\nthese features could raise significant concerns. Of course, issuing a CBDC has been discussed as\na potential alternative to stablecoins that could address some of these shortcomings. It is also\npossible that Congress could pass legislation to strengthen the regulation and oversight of\nstablecoins to mitigate some of these issues. I will be following developments in Congress\nclosely on this and other digital assets. Regardless, it is important for us to continue to evaluate\nthe evolving landscape of digital assets and understand whether and how well-regulated\nstablecoins or a CBDC would interact with each other and with the broader payments system.\nDesign Features and Policy Considerations\nThe Fed’s ongoing exploratory work helps us to think critically about a future shaped by\ninnovations in payments and the broader economy, including instant payments and new potential\nforms of money and payment systems like CBDCs and other digital assets that could potentially\nplay a larger role in the economy. While the investigation of CBDC raises many policy\nquestions, for the purposes of today’s discussion I will focus on a few key areas that are\nimportant from my perspective.\n\n- 9 -\nPrivacy Considerations\nAs we consider these potential opportunities for improvements and innovation, we must\nalso note that the introduction of a CBDC could present significant risks, challenges, and\ntradeoffs. First, in my view safeguarding privacy is a top concern and is also often identified as a\ntop concern of consumers and other stakeholders. As a baseline, we need to think about how to\nprotect the privacy of consumers and businesses, while also establishing an appropriate level of\ntransparency that would deter criminal activity.\nWe must ensure that consumer data privacy protections embedded in today’s payment\nsystems continue and are extended into future systems. In thinking about the implications of\nCBDC and privacy, we must also consider the central role that money plays in our daily lives,\nand the risk that a CBDC would provide not only a window into, but potentially an impediment\nto, the freedom Americans enjoy in choosing how money and resources are used and invested.\nSo, a central consideration must be how a potential U.S. CBDC could incorporate privacy\nconsiderations into its design, and what technology and policy options could support a robust\nprivacy framework.\nThe issue of privacy may be less difficult to address in the case of wholesale use cases, in\nwhich a CBDC would only be used by traditional financial institutions to conduct a limited range\nof financial market transactions. As with many of these considerations, the purpose and intended\nfunction of a CBDC has a major impact on its policy and design considerations.\nInteroperability and Innovation\nRelatedly, one possible way to design a CBDC could be to focus on providing a\nfoundational layer on top of which banks and other eligible institutions could build their own\ntechnology. In such an intermediated model, banks and other eligible institutions would build\n\n- 10 -\ntechnology on top of a CBDC that could be offered to retail consumers and others to provide\nproducts and services that may not be available today. It would be important to understand how\nsuch a layer would connect or interact with existing and new payments infrastructures. It is\nuseful to consider what types of innovations this could encourage. Some of the research on the\ndesign and functionality of CBDCs contemplates things like increased programmability—\nallowing the efficient transfer of money through the use of so-called smart contracts—that could\nimprove upon existing, regulated forms of money and payments. These are important questions\nworth exploring, but they link back to the identification of “problems” that a CBDC would be\ndesigned to solve.\nUnintended Effects on the U.S. Banking System\nIt is also necessary to consider the potential impacts of a CBDC on the banking sector.\nToday’s banking system delivers important benefits to our economy and, as I noted earlier, is\ncontinuing to evolve through innovations, like the improved availability of instant payments\nalready discussed.\nThere are significant risks in adopting a CBDC that cannibalizes rather than complements\nthe U.S. banking system. The U.S. banking system is a mature, well-functioning, effective and\nefficient system. Banks provide consumers access to credit and other banking and payments\nservices. Banks also support important public policies, including reporting on suspicious or\ncriminal activity through their BSA/AML compliance and reporting.\nMore importantly, banks play an essential role in the transmission of monetary policy and\nsupporting a well-functioning economy and financial system. If the Federal Reserve were to be\nauthorized and directed to implement a U.S. CBDC, we would need to carefully consider how an\nintermediated CBDC, with private-sector service providers, could be designed in a way that\n\n- 11 -\nmaintains financial institution involvement and minimizes disruptions to the financial system. A\nCBDC, if not properly designed, could disrupt the banking system and lead to disintermediation,\npotentially harming consumers and businesses, and could present broader financial stability\nrisks.11 Consider the consequences of a CBDC that pays interest at comparable or better rates\nthan commercial bank deposits and other low-risk assets. It seems likely that such a CBDC\nwould reduce the funds available to lend and increase the cost of capital across the economy.\nLikewise, we need to consider the effect on bank stability, and the potential of even more rapid\nbank runs, in a world where there are fewer constraints on the volume and velocity of payments.\nThe ongoing demand for private and public options to facilitate instant payments may exacerbate\nthese concerns.\nThese are exactly the types of issues that policymakers must confront. It would be\nirresponsible to undermine the traditional banking system by introducing a CBDC without\nappropriate guardrails to mitigate these potential impacts on the banking sector and the financial\nsystem.\nThe Imperative of Continuing Research\nThe Federal Reserve’s work continues to explore an array of CBDC design choices and\nthe challenging consideration of policy tradeoffs that this multitude of choices presents. It is\nimperative that each of these tradeoffs is carefully evaluated and thoroughly understood. Where\nopportunities for improvements may exist, we should ask whether a U.S. CBDC is the most\n11 For discussion on CBDC implications for bank funding, lending, and resilience, see Bank for International\nSettlements, “Central Bank Digital Currencies: Financial Stability Implications (Basel: BIS, September 2021),\nhttps://www.bis.org/publ/othp42_fin_stab.pdf; and Sebastian Infante, Kyungmin Kim, Anna Orlik, André F. Silva,\nand Robert J. Tetlow, “The Macrcoeconomic Implications of CBDC: A Review of the Literature,” Finance and\nEconomics Discussion Series 2022-076 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, October\n2022), https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/the-macroeconomic-implications-of-cbdc-a-review-of-the-\nliterature.htm.\n\n- 12 -\nefficient and effective means to make such improvements, or are there better alternatives, such as\nenhancements to current payment infrastructures? Apart from focusing on payments alone, it is\nalso worth considering whether other policies would more effectively target financial inclusion,\nincluding policies that are beyond the remit of the Federal Reserve. And in the absence of a\nCBDC, some of these risks I noted may still exist as the private sector continues to innovate,\nincluding the risk of substitution from commercial bank deposits to digital wallets, and the\nmigration to less regulated digital assets, including stablecoins. With such significant potential\nopportunities, risks, and tradeoffs, it is essential that the Federal Reserve continue to thoroughly\nresearch and engage with stakeholders to further understand these issues. Future decisions about\nthe implementation of technology innovations in money and payments, including a potential U.S.\nCBDC, must be informed by a deep and thorough understanding of potential intended and\nunintended consequences, as well as understanding whether a CBDC would be the most effective\nand efficient means to improve the payment system and address identified problems.\nThe Federal Reserve has continued its independent research and technical\nexperimentation on digital innovations, including digital assets and CBDC. Specific to CBDC,\nthe Federal Reserve established a program of work that aims to (1) carry out policy analysis to\nprovide perspectives on issues articulated in the Board’s January 2022 discussion paper;\n(2) conduct technology research and experimentation to inform potential CBDC designs; and\n(3) invest in engagement with the public, industry, academia, and the public sector to bring along\nstakeholders and obtain needed expertise.\nConcluding Thoughts: The Potential Future of CBDC in the United States\nOf course, as the evolution of money and payments continues, it is important for the\nFederal Reserve to continue looking ahead to anticipate potential changes to money and\n\n- 13 -\npayments well into the future. With this in mind, our consideration of other potential\ninnovations to money and payments, including a potential U.S. CBDC, must be viewed through\nthe lens of whether and how the payment system would be improved beyond what instant\npayment services will achieve. We should ask “what current frictions exist or may emerge in the\npayment system that only a CBDC can solve, or that a CBDC can solve most efficiently?”\nIn my view, it is important that the Federal Reserve is a part of the ongoing conversations\naround CBDCs, whether or not a CBDC is ultimately created in the United States. As the\nFederal Reserve continues to monitor developments in other jurisdictions, we will work closely\nwith international counterparts on payments innovation, CBDC, and other related topics. This\nincludes work with multilateral institutions such as the Bank for International Settlements, the\nG7, and the Financial Stability Board, as well as bilateral engagements with other central banks.\nFrom my perspective, there could be some promise for wholesale CBDCs in the future\nfor settlement of certain financial market transactions and processing international payments.\nWhen it comes to some of the broader design and policy issues, particularly those around\nconsumer privacy and impacts on the banking system, it is difficult to imagine a world where the\ntradeoffs between benefits and unintended consequences could justify a direct access CBDC for\nuses beyond interbank and wholesale transactions.\nIt is important that we thoughtfully examine the evolving money and payments landscape\nand digital innovations broadly, including a potential U.S. CBDC. In addition to understanding\ninternational approaches to these issues, the Federal Reserve’s research, experimentation, and\noutreach to stakeholders help us to gain important input and perspective on these issues. Apart\nfrom these ongoing CBDC-related efforts, the Federal Reserve is committed to the successful\nimplementation of FedNow, which is expected to support the broader adoption of instant\n\n- 14 -\npayments in the U.S., meaningfully evolving and upgrading the U.S. payments infrastructure for\nconsumers and businesses.\nThank you for the opportunity to share my thoughts on these important issues.",

When we began Fed Listens in\n2019, the initiative was part of a broad, comprehensive review of the decisionmaking\nframework the Federal Open Market Committee uses when making decisions that impact\nthe economy. Since that time, we have met with people across the country from a wide\nrange of backgrounds and perspectives, and we’ve learned about how our monetary\npolicy actions affect them, their businesses, and their communities. In light of the\ninsights we gained during those original listening sessions, we decided to expand the\nscope of Fed Listens to become an ongoing process of consultation with the public to\nbetter understand economic conditions from their point of view.\nThese Fed Listens events provide us with a valuable opportunity to learn about\nthe economy by engaging directly with those experiencing economic conditions. These\nconversations provide context for the economic and financial data that we monitor, and\nthey help us look beneath the national-level data reporting to see how Americans in\ndifferent areas of the country are faring. So, again, I am very happy to be here in\nChicago with President Goolsbee to learn about the topic of today’s Fed Listens, which\nfocuses on the experiences of young people as they enter the workforce.\nAn important aspect of that transition to employment is whether young people are\neffectively prepared, and whether our economy has enough skilled workers to meet the\ngrowing demand. It’s not possible for America to achieve sustained economic prosperity\nunless young people are equipped with the benefit of an effective education system and\nhave access to opportunity. Like many families during the pandemic, my family faced\n\n- 2 -\nchallenges with school closures and a lack of access to normal childhood activities and\nsocial interactions. As our education system works to address the lasting impacts of\nstudent learning losses and the increased emergence of mental health issues, it is critical\nthat we recognize the challenges many are facing as they prepare to enter the workforce.\nThe pandemic was a very difficult period for young people and their parents,\nmany of whom were forced to choose between continuing to work and caring for their\nchildren. It is encouraging to see that many of these challenges have eased, and that we\ncan focus more intently on what young people need most to succeed.\nOne positive development that is supporting the transition of young people into\nthe labor force has been the tight labor market and the reversal of pandemic-period trends\nfor young workers, who typically have limited work experience. In the wake of\neconomic downturns, it is usually those young workers who are most impacted by\nunemployment and take the longest to regain lost ground. During this period, however,\nthe share of 18-to-24-year-olds who are employed has recovered to around where it was\njust before the pandemic and has outpaced the employment recovery since the pandemic\nlow for those in their prime working years, between ages 25 and 54. In addition, wages\nfor young workers have grown more quickly over the past several years than wages for\nprime-age workers.1\nAlthough this is great news for today’s youth, young people still face significant\nlonger-term challenges. For example, the share of “disconnected” young adults, who are\nnot participating in the workforce or continuing their education, has been rising over the\n1 See Elise Gould, Katherine DeCourcy, and Jori Kandra (2023), “Class of 2023: Young Workers Have\nExperienced Strong Wage Growth since 2020,” Economic Policy Institute, Working Economics Blog,\nMay 4, https://www.epi.org/blog/class-of-2023-young-workers-have-experienced-strong-wage-growth-\nsince-2020.\n\n- 3 -\npast 20 years.2 Young adults who disengage from these wealth- and income-building\nopportunities often face long-term disadvantages, which is concerning both for the\nindividual and for the economy as a whole.\nEducating young people and preparing them with skills required to participate in\nthe future workforce will have long-lasting, positive impacts on economic productivity.\nRising productivity allows living standards to improve without contributing to inflation.\nIn this way, the successful transition of today’s youth into the workforce is directly tied to\nthe Fed’s mission and to our monetary policy goals of maximum, inclusive employment\nand price stability. The decisions we face must be, and will continue to be, informed by\nthe perspectives that each of you brings to the table today about how to help young\npeople transition successfully into the workforce. Those decisions will be better\ndecisions once we have had the opportunity to learn from today’s participants and have\ngained a better understanding of the challenges and possible solutions.\nThank you again for the opportunity to participate in today’s Fed Listens event. I\nlook forward to our discussion.\n2 See Anna Crockett and Xiaohan Zhang (2023), “Young Adults Are Disconnected from Work and School\ndue to Long-Term Labor Force Trends,” Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, Communities Blog, April 6,\nhttps://www.dallasfed.org/cd/communities/2023/2303.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n11:00 a.m. EDT (10:00 a.m. CDT)\nSeptember 28, 2022\nThe New Landscape for Banking Competition\nRemarks by\nMichelle W. Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n2022 Community Banking Research Conference\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\nSeptember 28, 2022\n\nGood morning and thank you, it’s great to be back here in St. Louis for this year’s\nresearch conference.1 While the Federal Reserve learned a lot about how to operate\nvirtually during these past two-and-a-half years of the pandemic, there are certain\ninteractions and discussions that are just better face to face. For me, this conference is\none of them.\nIt’s also significant that we’re able to be here in person to commemorate the 10th\nyear of these proceedings. I’d like to share a few thoughts on how we got here.\nBack in 2013, in the wake of the financial crisis and the passage of the Dodd-\nFrank Act, the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and\nthe Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS) created this conference, based on the\nunderstanding that research plays a vital role in shaping our nation’s supervisory and\nregulatory policy. Simply put, good research leads to good policy, and the decision was\nmade to create a conference that could attract high-caliber research on community\nbanking from all over the world.\nThe conference was also designed to be a forum for multiple stakeholders—\nresearchers, policymakers, and community bankers—to come together annually to share\ninsights and perspectives, all in the interest of better informing current and future\nresearch. In my view, this gathering has certainly delivered on, and expanded upon, these\npromises.\nSadly, two of the pioneers of this conference are no longer with us to celebrate\nthis important 10-year milestone: John Ryan, president and CEO of the Conference of\nState Bank Supervisors, and Rich Brown, chief economist at the FDIC, both have passed\n1 I would like to acknowledge the assistance of Jim Fuchs of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis in\npreparing these remarks.\n\n- 2 -\naway since the last time we were able to be here together in person. John created the\nvision for this conference and oversaw its success to this point, while Rich served for\nmany years on the conference research committee, and even served as an academic\ndiscussant. Both have shaped this conference in important ways, and both will be deeply\nmissed.\nIn 2014, CSBS, under John Ryan’s leadership, identified a need for more\nforward-looking data and information on community banks and the banking industry.\nThis led to the creation of the CSBS National Survey of Community Banks. The survey\ngathered data and insights that were previously unavailable on this scale directly from\ncommunity bankers. As a former state bank commissioner, I know how much effort\ncommunity banks put in each year to provide accurate and detailed responses to the\nsurvey. We have all benefitted from and appreciate the insights they share.\nThe survey has enhanced our understanding of how much the banking industry\nhas changed. It has also provided data that have been used in academic research, policy\npapers, and official government reports. Among its many contributions, the survey\nprovides data on the costs of regulatory compliance and trend data on products and\nservices being offered, and in some cases, discontinued, by community banks. The\nCSBS survey also shows how competition has changed community banking in recent\nyears. It is this topic of competition that I will focus on for the remainder of my remarks\ntoday.\nOne of the more interesting findings from the CSBS survey has been how\ncommunity banks have reported changes in competition for both deposits and loans.\nAlthough the majority of community banks report that other community banks are still\n\n- 3 -\ntheir primary competitors, that majority has steadily declined in each year of the survey\nas credit unions and larger banks have become the dominant competitors for deposits in\nan increasing number of markets.\nThe situation is even more interesting for loan competition. Each year, a larger\npercentage of community banks report fintech firms as their primary competitors for\nconsumer loans, the Farm Credit System as their primary competitor for agricultural\nloans, and nonbanks as their primary competitor for mortgage loans.\nWhile not necessarily surprising, these and other data underscore that there is a\nnew and evolving competitive landscape for banking services in the United States. As\nthe nature of competition changes, it creates an opportunity for us to rethink how we\nevaluate bank mergers, how we define banking markets, and how we develop a more\ncomprehensive understanding of the ways consumers and businesses access financial\nproducts and services today and how they might do so in the future.\nUnderstanding the New Competitive Landscape\nSo how has the competitive landscape for banking services changed in the United\nStates?\nOne of the most obvious changes has been in the number of commercial bank\ncharters. In just 10 years, the number of bank charters has declined by approximately 20\npercent. At the end of 2012, there were about 5,900 commercial banks in the United\nStates. The current number of charters today stands at just below 4,800. This decline in\ncharters has been concentrated among banks with less than $250 million in total assets.\nUp until 2009, the number of bank branches increased, despite the decline in the\nnumber of bank charters. However, since the 2009 financial crisis, the number of\n\n- 4 -\nbranches has declined each year. This decline was particularly pronounced during the\npandemic when, between 2020 and 2021, the number of bank branches declined by\nalmost 4 percent as more than 3,200 branches were closed.\nBefore discussing how declines in bank charters and bank branches influence how\nwe think about the competitive impact of mergers in certain markets, it should be noted\nthat how we measure competition today largely springs from a 1963 Supreme Court\ndecision where the court held that the relevant product market for the purposes of\nanalyzing a bank merger is the “cluster of products . . . and services” that constitute\n“commercial banking” in each banking market.2 This means that to evaluate banking\ncompetition, we essentially require two key inputs:\n1. The geographical definition of the banking market, and\n2. An understanding of the bank products and services that are provided to most\nhouseholds and small businesses by the banks in those markets.\nThe geographic definition of banking markets is a Federal Reserve responsibility, and\nthe Fed has currently defined more than 1,400 banking markets nationwide. This\ngeographic definition requires constant analysis and regular updating. One only needs to\nthink of how the growth of the suburbs has increased the distances residents are willing to\ntravel for their jobs and other important services, including banking services, to\nappreciate how banking markets have changed and will continue to change. As\ncommunities change, so do their banking markets.\nThe second part of this evaluation is more daunting because there is currently no\nway to comprehensively measure the full “cluster” of commercial banking products and\n2 United States v. Philadelphia National Bank, 374 U.S. 321, 356 (1963).\n\n- 5 -\nservices in a given market. This challenge is compounded by the fact that the products\nand services banks offer also frequently change to meet evolving customer and business\ndemand.\nHistorically, we’ve used a bank’s share of deposits in a market as a proxy for\nmarket power for the broader cluster of commercial banking products and services. The\nidea is that both consumers and small businesses often access commercial banking\nproducts through their deposit relationship institution. This approach also has the\nadvantage of being measurable since banks are required to report deposits at the branch\nlevel annually through the FDIC’s Annual Survey of Branch Office Deposits.3 To better\nreflect competition from thrift institutions, for many years the calculation of local deposit\nand market share data has also included a weighted consideration of their account\ndeposits.4\nIn 1995, to “speed [the] competitive review [process] and reduce regulatory\nburden on the banking industry” the Department of Justice and the federal banking\nagencies developed several initial “screens” to identify mergers that would not have\nadverse effects on competition and would therefore not require significant review.5\nThese screens were part of a broader set of Competitive Review Guidelines that also\npresented additional information that could be considered in the analysis of a merger\ntransaction. The initial screens are based on deposit market share using the Herfindahl-\nHirschman index, or HHI. Under this scale, a perfect monopoly would report an HHI of\n3 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), Bank Call Report Information—Summary of Deposits,\nhttps://www.fdic.gov/resources/bankers/call-reports/call-summary-of-deposits.html.\n4 See, e.g., First Hawaiian, Inc., 77 Federal Reserve Bulletin 52 (1991); Midwest Financial Group, 75\nFederal Reserve Bulletin 386 (1989); National City Corporation, 70 Federal Reserve Bulletin 743 (1984).\n5 See U.S. Department of Justice, Bank Merger Competitive Review—Introduction and Overview (1995),\nhttps://www.justice.gov/atr/bank-merger-competitive-review-introduction-and-overview-1995.\n\n- 6 -\n10,000, while a perfectly competitive market would be close to zero. Under these\nscreens, any merger that does not result in the HHI exceeding 1,800, post-merger, or\nincreases the market HHI by less than 200, would likely not require further review. Of\nnote, some argue that these guidelines are uniquely strict because the 1,800 HHI level for\nbanking is lower than the 2,500 level set in the Horizontal Merger Guidelines used to\nevaluate transactions in other industries.\nIn this context, evaluating how a decline in bank charters and bank branches\naffects how we understand competition is a simple math problem: as banks merge or\nclose branches in a market, the market becomes more concentrated and the HHI\nincreases. In fact, more than 60 percent of the currently defined geographic banking\nmarkets in the United States are above the 1,800 threshold.\nTo some, these data are evidence that the marketplace for banking products and\nservices is increasingly anticompetitive, warranting tougher scrutiny of mergers or even a\nmoratorium on any deals.\nTo others, these numbers illustrate a narrow view of bank services in a diverse\nand complex marketplace. Therefore, they also highlight the importance of including the\nfull “cluster of commercial banking products and services” provided to customers in a\nbanking market, since these numbers only provide information on banks. As any quick\nscan of the marketplace for financial products and services will tell you, in recent\ndecades, the number of competitors to banks, if anything, has significantly increased,\nrather than decreased.\nWith that in mind, I’d like to discuss what I see as some of the key changes in the\ncompetitive landscape for banking products and services. I will also offer some ideas on\n\n- 7 -\nhow I think we can modernize our analysis of competition while still preserving a vibrant\nand competitive marketplace that promotes innovation and enhances consumer choice.\nCredit Unions\nLet’s start with the changes that have been taking place in the credit union\nindustry. Historically, credit unions were not seen as competitors to banks because they\noffered fewer small business and commercial lending products and were limited in their\ncustomer base because of field of membership restrictions. For this reason, credit union\ndeposits were not factored into the initial competitive screens at all under the 1995 Bank\nMerger Guidelines.\nHowever, in the past few decades, we’ve seen credit unions expand their fields of\nmembership. Many credit unions now go well beyond the traditional “common bond”\nrequirements for membership and increasingly allow membership based on geography.\nWe’ve also seen an increase in the percentage of credit unions offering small business\nloans. The National Credit Union Administration has reported that 94 percent of credit\nunions with $500 million or more in assets offer business loans. Total business loans at\nfederally insured credit unions grew at an annualized rate of 14 percent from 2004\nthrough 2015.6\nUnderscoring just how much credit unions are competing directly with banks,\nparticularly community banks, is the recent increase in acquisitions of community banks\nby credit unions.7 Credit unions today are much more likely to compete directly with\ntraditional banks offering the full “cluster” of banking products and services than they did\n6 Member Business Loans; Commercial Lending, 81 Fed. Reg. 13,529, 13,530 (March 14, 2016).\n7 Nineteen credit unions acquired commercial banks in 2019, up from seven in 2018 and three in 2017.\n\n- 8 -\nin 1995, which supports the argument that our analysis needs to give more weight to\ncompetition from credit unions.\nOnline Deposit Gathering\nAnother development impacting the competitive landscape for banking services is\nthe ability of all banks, regardless of size, to gather deposits across markets and across\ngeographies. Although we’ve known that online banking gives customers an opportunity\nto open accounts and establish deposit relationships with any bank in the United States,\nwe’ve only recently been able to measure how many deposits are gathered via the\ninternet.\nThe FDIC recently began collecting data on deposits through accounts opened\nonline. The data show that online deposits increased by more than 62 percent from 2019\nto 2020. Over that same time, deposits at brick-and-mortar branches grew by slightly\nmore than 21 percent. Online deposits increased by another 42 percent from 2020 to\n2021, while brick-and-mortar deposits grew by around 10 percent. Online deposits now\naccount for more than 5 percent of all deposits at U.S. commercial banks, and that\npercentage is expected to increase. Since we know that deposit relationships generally\nlead customers to develop other types of banking relationships, a comprehensive analysis\nof competition needs to account for the ubiquity of out-of-market banks with a strong\nnational presence.\nNonbank Competitors\nOn the lending side, we’ve seen nonbanks compete directly with banks for\ntraditional lines of business, including for agricultural loans, one-to-four family mortgage\nloans, small business loans, and consumer loans. For years, we’ve seen finance\n\n- 9 -\ncompanies compete with banks for consumer and small business loans and the Farm\nCredit System compete for agricultural loans. Today we’re seeing mortgage companies\nnot only compete, but dominate, the market for residential mortgage loans. Nonbank\nfintech firms have become viable competitors for nearly all types of loan products, but\nmost prominently consumer loans, small business loans, and student loans. One\nchallenge is that we don’t have the same consistent set of data from nonbank entities that\nwe do for banks. Nonbanks are generally not subject to the same types of reporting\nrequirements as banks, and analysts have to get creative when trying to measure how\nthese entities impact competition.\nA few years ago, research presented at this conference by economists at the\nKansas City Fed outlined a process to measure the effects of Farm Credit System lending\non market competition.8 The authors concluded that including Farm Credit lending in\ncompetitive analysis of a market “significantly reduces measures of concentration.” The\nauthors found that “excluding [Farm Credit] from market structure analyses may\nunderstate market competitiveness in rural markets where agriculture is an important part\nof the local economy.” The authors also state that similar results would likely apply if\nother significant product lines offered by nonbank competitors were analyzed.\nModernizing Our Competitive Analysis\nWith the proliferation of new competitors to traditional banks, it’s imperative that\nwe modernize our evaluation of competition to more consistently and comprehensively\n8 Charles S. Morris, James Wilkinson, and Eric Hogue, “Competition in Local Agricultural Lending\nMarkets: The Effect of the Farm Credit System,” Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas Economic Review,\nfourth quarter 2015 (Kansas City: Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas, 2015),\nhttps://www.kansascityfed.org/documents/645/Competition_in_Local_Agricultural_Lending_Markets_The\n_Effect_of_the_Farm_Credit_System.pdf.\n\n- 10 -\nfactor in all competitors in a market and consider how to address markets where deposits\nare a poor proxy for the full cluster of products and services offered to consumers and\nsmall businesses.\nGetting this right is particularly important for community banks. The Federal\nReserve has long recognized the important public benefits that community banks provide\nto their communities. Not fully accounting for all competitors in a market limits the\noptions available to banks that need to achieve scale to offer the products and services\nthat customers want while managing the high overhead costs that come with being a\nregulated depository institution.\nThe consequences of getting this wrong will be felt acutely in rural\ncommunities—especially in markets where populations have declined to such an extent\nthat local institutions have trouble achieving the scale they need to compete with out-of-\nmarket banks or nonbanks operating on a national or regional scale. As noted in the\nCSBS National Survey, 30 percent of respondents reported that depopulation was either\nimportant or very important to a rural bank’s ability to attract and retain deposits.9\nBanks in rural areas may also struggle with succession planning. Attracting and\nretaining qualified management and staff can be very difficult, and in some cases may\nforce a bank to close its doors, to the detriment of its customers. For banks in these types\nof communities, the best option might be to merge with another local bank to continue to\nprovide banking services for residents and small businesses. In markets already\ndesignated as concentrated or uncompetitive, however, the current guidelines limit\n9 See Conference of State Bank Supervisors, “2021 CSBS National Survey Shows Pandemic Impact on\nCommunity Banks,” news release, CSBS, https://www.communitybanking.org/news/csbs-national-survey-\nshows-pandemic-impact-on-community-banks.\n\n- 11 -\nprospective merger partners to out-of-market institutions—and acquisition offers from\nout-of-market banks in areas of declining population are exceedingly rare. Fortunately, I\nthink we have a unique opportunity today to address these issues.\nFor example, the federal banking agencies and the Department of Justice have\nacknowledged in recent months that significant changes in the banking industry and in\nthe competitive landscape for banking services will require us to rethink banking\ncompetition and mergers. Last year, the President issued an Executive Order on\ncompetition encouraging the Attorney General, in consultation with the heads of the\nfederal banking agencies, to review current bank merger review practices and adopt a\nplan for “revitalizing” merger oversight under the Bank Merger Act and Bank Holding\nCompany Act.\nWhile my remarks today and these following recommendations highlight issues\nfor community banks, the framework for analyzing bank mergers for large banks also\nneeds to be updated. The goal should be to apply a transparent, dynamic framework that\nallows the industry to evolve with market conditions and apply sensible regulatory\noversight. Size should not be the controlling factor. A review and examination of a\nmerger application should be based on a careful analysis of risks.\nI believe any review of banking merger oversight should ensure that the\nframework that is used is known and understood by the public and by the banks, that it\nreflects actual market conditions, and that it factors in the broader range of competitors to\nbanks for financial products and services.\nI will outline a few specific areas that, in my view, should be included as part of\nany modernization proposal for competitive analysis:\n\n- 12 -\nMore systematically include credit unions in all competitive analyses. As I\nnoted earlier, credit unions were historically not considered competitors to banks,\nbut changes to their business models and membership criteria now make them\ndirect competitors in many markets. Credit unions whose field of membership\nincludes all, or almost all, of the market populations, whose branches are easily\naccessible to the public, who engage in a significant amount of commercial\nlending and who have staff available for small business services, or who have\nacquired a community bank should be part of any initial competitive screen. It’s\nalso important that the National Credit Union Administration collect more\ngranular deposit information from credit unions so we can better understand their\nlocal market power. Similar activity should be subject to similar data collection\nand regulation.\nFactor in deposits at digital banks. Since online deposits are not reportable at\nthe branch level, it’s important that we account for deposits and loans offered by\nbanks that have established a national digital presence. As mentioned earlier,\nrecent data suggest that more than 5 percent of all deposits in the banking system\nwere collected through online means. In the absence of specific data about a\ndigital bank’s presence in a market, those deposits should be weighed in pro rata\nin each banking market at the percentage reported annually in the Summary of\nDeposits in any competitive analysis.\nConsider nonbank financial firms in all competitive analyses. Although\nnonbank financial firms do not generally provide the full range of banking\nproducts and services to consumers, they do exert competitive pressures in\n\n- 13 -\nbanking markets across the United States. Since 1995, nonbanks have\nincreasingly become important competitors for banks, capable of exerting\nsubstantial market pressure in some product markets. We need to capture these\ngranular competitive effects across different geographic and product markets.\nOne way to do this is by relaxing the deposit-market-based HHI thresholds in the\ncurrent bank merger guidelines to reflect the increased competitive influence\nbanks face from nonbanks today. This is also an area where I think our research\npartners can help us better understand how to factor in competition from nonbank\nentities.\nIn my view, in order to support increased transparency, the Federal Reserve\nshould review its approach to defining banking markets to ensure they are updated\nconsistently and reflect the changes in how consumers in a community access banking\nproducts and services.\nSince 2006, the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis has supported competitive\nfactors analysis through its development and maintenance of the Competitive Analysis\nand Structure Source Instrument for Depository Institutions, or CASSIDI tool.10 The tool\ngives the public direct insights into the currently defined banking markets in the United\nStates and allows for the pro forma evaluation of the competitive effects of actual and\neven hypothetical mergers. The initial screens that are currently used in competitive\nanalysis are built into the tool and can be updated as things change. As we work to\ndevelop a more comprehensive process for evaluating competition, the CASSIDI team\n10 See CASSIDI: Competitive Analysis and Structure Source Instrument for Depository Institutions,\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (2021), https://cassidi.stlouisfed.org.\n\n- 14 -\nshould add data and even new functionality to the tool to ensure that we are working from\na common set of rules in our analysis.\nConclusion\nTo wrap up, competition is vital to ensuring that we continue to have a vibrant\nand innovative banking industry. In the 10 years of this research conference, we’ve seen\nhow competition has led to the adoption of a suite of digital products and services by\nbanks of all sizes. From remote deposit capture, online account openings, and automated\nunderwriting, to interactive teller machines, banks with more than $1 trillion in assets and\nthose with less than $100 million in assets are both able to quickly onboard new\ntechnology to meet consumer demand. This has further led to a proliferation of tailored\nproducts and services that meet the unique needs of bank customers. We’ve seen how\ncompetition from new, tech-savvy, core service providers has led legacy providers to\nenhance their product offerings and capabilities. At the same time, we’ve seen how these\nsame technologies that enhance the banking experience can also be used by nonbanks to\ncompete directly with banks.\nWhile banks have adjusted their business models to address new competitive\nthreats and changing customer demand, the framework for evaluating competition has not\nchanged significantly since 1995. As these new competitors increasingly provide\nconsumers with alternative delivery channels for the cluster of banking products and\nservices they desire, we need to make sure we take appropriate steps to understand the\ncompetitive pressure they exert and modernize our approaches to measuring competition.\nOur current framework is meant to promote a competitive marketplace for\nbanking products and services. But if that framework does not account for the full range\n\n- 15 -\nof competitors, we’re only restricting banks from making strategic merger choices, while\nallowing those outside the framework to proliferate.\nCompetition is at the foundation of our financial and economic system. As the\nbanking industry changes, we need to change how we think about competition for\nbanking products and services and modernize our approach to competitive analysis that\npromotes a healthy banking and financial system, supports consumer choice, and creates\nthe right incentives for continued innovation.",

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nGeorgia Bankers Association President/CEO Conference\nCharleston, South Carolina\nSeptember 30, 2024\n\nGood morning. I would like to thank the Georgia Bankers Association for the invitation\nto join you today for your annual conference.1 I appreciate the opportunity to share my views on\nthe U.S. economy and monetary policy before we engage on community banking issues and\nother matters affecting the banking industry.\nIn light of the recent Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, I will begin my\nremarks by providing some perspective on my vote and will then share my current views on the\neconomy and monetary policy.\nUpdate on the Most Recent FOMC Meeting\nIn order to address high inflation, for more than two years, the FOMC increased and held\nthe federal funds rate at a restrictive level. At our September meeting, the FOMC voted to lower\nthe target range for the federal funds rate by 1/2 percentage point to 4-3/4 to 5 percent and to\ncontinue reducing the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings.\nAs the post-meeting statement noted, I dissented from the FOMC’s decision, preferring\ninstead to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point to 5 to\n5-1/4 percent. Last Friday, once our FOMC participant communications blackout period\nconcluded, the Board of Governors released my statement explaining the decision to depart from\nthe majority of the voting members. I agreed with the Committee’s assessment that, given the\nprogress we have seen since the middle of 2023 on both lowering inflation and cooling the labor\nmarket, it was appropriate to reflect this progress by recalibrating the level of the federal funds\nrate and begin the process ofi moving toward a more neutral stance of policy. As my statement\n1 The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee or the Board of Governors.\n\n- 2 -\nnotes, I preferred a smaller initial cut in the policy rate while the U.S. economy remains strong\nand inflation remains a concern, despite recent progress.\nEconomic Conditions and Outlook\nIn recent months, we have seen some further progress on slowing the pace of inflation,\nwith monthly readings lower than the elevated pace seen in the first three months of the year.\nThe 12-month measure of core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation, which\nprovides a broader perspective than the more volatile higher-frequency readings, has moved\ndown since April, although it came in at 2.7 percent in August, again remaining well above our\n2 percent goal. The persistently high core inflation largely reflects pressures on housing prices,\nperhaps due in part to low inventories of affordable housing. The progress in lowering inflation\nsince April is a welcome development, but core inflation is still uncomfortably above the\nCommittee’s 2 percent goal.\nPrices remain much higher than before the pandemic, which continues to weigh on\nconsumer sentiment. Higher prices have an outsized effect on lower- and moderate-income\nhouseholds, as these households devote a significantly larger share of income to food, energy,\nand housing. Prices for these spending categories have far outpaced overall inflation over the\npast few years.\nEconomic growth moderated earlier this year after coming in stronger last year. Private\ndomestic final purchases (PDFP) growth has been solid and slowed much less than gross\ndomestic product (GDP), as the slowdown in GDP growth was partly driven by volatile\ncategories including net exports, suggesting that underlying economic growth was stronger than\nGDP indicated. PDFP has continued to increase at a solid pace so far in the third quarter, despite\n\n- 3 -\nsome further weakening in housing activity, as retail sales have shown further robust gains in\nJuly and August.\nAlthough personal consumption has remained resilient, consumers appear to be pulling\nback on discretionary items and expenses, as evidenced in part by a decline in restaurant\nspending since late last year. Low- and moderate-income consumers no longer have extra\nsavings to support this type of spending, and we have seen loan delinquency rates normalize\nfrom historically low levels during the pandemic.\nThe most recent labor market report shows that payroll employment gains have slowed\nappreciably to a pace moderately above 100,000 per month over the three months ending in\nAugust. The unemployment rate edged down to 4.2 percent in August from 4.3 percent in July.\nWhile unemployment is notably higher than a year ago, it is still at a historically low level and\nbelow my and the Congressional Budget Office’s estimates of full employment.\nThe labor market has loosened from the extremely tight conditions of the past few years.\nThe ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers has declined further to a touch below the\nhistorically elevated pre-pandemic level—a sign that the number of available workers and the\nnumber of available jobs have come into better balance. But there are still more available jobs\nthan available workers, a condition that before 2018 has only occurred twice for a prolonged\nperiod since World War II, further signaling ongoing labor market strength despite the reported\ndata.\nAlthough wage growth has slowed further in recent months, it remains indicative of a\ntight labor market. At just under 4 percent, as measured by both the employment cost index and\naverage hourly earnings, wage gains are still above the pace consistent with our inflation goal\ngiven trend productivity growth.\n\n- 4 -\nThe rise in the unemployment rate this year largely reflects weaker hiring, as job seekers\nentering or re-entering the labor force are taking longer to find work, while layoffs remain low.\nIn addition to some cooling in labor demand, there are other factors likely contributing the\nincreased unemployment. A mismatch between the skills of the new workers and available jobs\ncould further raise unemployment, suggesting that higher unemployment has been partly driven\nby the stronger supply of workers. It is also likely that some temporary factors contributed to the\nrecent rise in the unemployment rate, as unemployment among working age teenagers sharply\nincreased in August.\nPreference for a More Measured Recalibration of Policy\nThe U.S. economy remains strong and core inflation remains uncomfortably above our\n2 percent target. In light of these economic conditions, a few further considerations supported\nthe case for a more measured approach in beginning the process to recalibrate our policy stance\nto remove restriction and move toward a more neutral setting.\nFirst, I was concerned that reducing the target range for the federal funds rate by\n1/2 percentage point could be interpreted as a signal that the Committee sees some fragility or\ngreater downside risks to the economy. In the current economic environment, with no clear\nsigns of material weakening or fragility, in my view, beginning the rate-cutting cycle with a\n1/4 percentage point move would have better reinforced the strength in economic conditions,\nwhile also confidently recognizing progress toward our goals. In my mind, a more measured\napproach would have avoided the risk of unintentionally signaling concerns about underlying\neconomic conditions.\nSecond, I was also concerned that reducing the policy rate by 1/2 percentage point could\nhave led market participants to expect that the Committee would lower the target range by that\n\n- 5 -\nsame pace at future meetings until the policy rate approaches a neutral level. If this expectation\nhad materialized, we could have seen an unwarranted decline in longer-term interest rates and\nbroader financial conditions could become overly accommodative. This outcome could work\nagainst the Committee’s goal of returning inflation to our 2 percent target.\nI am pleased that Chair Powell directly addressed both of these concerns during the press\nconference following the most recent FOMC meeting.\nThird, there continues to be a considerable amount of pent-up demand and cash on the\nsidelines ready to be deployed as the path of interest rates moves down. Bringing the policy rate\ndown too quickly carries the risk of unleashing that pent-up demand. A more measured approach\nwould also avoid unnecessarily stoking demand and potentially reigniting inflationary pressures.\nFinally, in dialing back our restrictive stance of policy, we also need to be mindful of\nwhat the end point is likely to be. My estimate of the neutral rate is much higher than it was\nbefore the pandemic. Therefore, I think we are much closer to neutral than would have been the\ncase under pre-pandemic conditions, and I did not see the peak stance of policy as restrictive to\nthe same extent that my colleagues may have. With a higher estimate of neutral, for any given\npace of rate reductions, we would arrive at our destination sooner.\nOngoing Risks to the Outlook\nTurning to the risks to achieving our dual mandate, I continue to see greater risks to price\nstability, especially while the labor market continues to be near estimates of full employment.\nAlthough the labor market data have been showing signs of cooling in recent months, still-\nelevated wage growth, solid consumer spending, and resilient GDP growth are not consistent\nwith a material economic weakening or fragility. My contacts also continue to mention that they\nare not planning layoffs and continue to have difficulty hiring. Therefore, I am taking less signal\n\n- 6 -\nfrom the recent labor market data until there are clear trends indicating that both spending\ngrowth and the labor market have materially weakened. I suspect the recent immigration flows\nhave and will continue to affect labor markets in ways that we do not yet fully understand and\ncannot yet accurately measure. In light of the dissonance created by conflicting economic\nsignals, measurement challenges, and data revisions, I remain cautious about taking signal from\nonly a limited set of real-time data releases.\nIn my view, the upside risks to inflation remain prominent. Global supply chains\ncontinue to be susceptible to labor strikes and increased geopolitical tensions, which could result\nin inflationary effects on food, energy, and other commodity markets. Expansionary fiscal\nspending could also lead to inflationary risks, as could an increased demand for housing given\nthe long-standing limited supply, especially of affordable housing. While it has not been my\nbaseline outlook, I cannot rule out the risk that progress on inflation could continue to stall.\nAlthough it is important to recognize that there has been meaningful progress on\nlowering inflation, while core inflation remains around or above 2.5 percent, I see the risk that\nthe Committee’s larger policy action could be interpreted as a premature declaration of victory\non our price-stability mandate. Accomplishing our mission of returning to low and stable\ninflation at our 2 percent goal is necessary to foster a strong labor market and an economy that\nworks for everyone in the longer term.\nIn light of these considerations, I believe that, by moving at a measured pace toward a\nmore neutral policy stance, we will be better positioned to achieve further progress in bringing\ninflation down to our 2 percent target, while closely watching the evolution of labor market\nconditions.\n\n- 7 -\nThe Path Forward\nDespite my dissent at the most recent FOMC meeting, I respect and appreciate that my\nFOMC colleagues preferred to begin the reduction in the federal funds rate with a larger initial\ncut in the target range for the policy rate. I remain committed to working together with my\ncolleagues to ensure that monetary policy is appropriately positioned to achieve our goals of\nattaining maximum employment and returning inflation to our 2 percent target.\nI will continue to monitor the incoming data and information as I assess the appropriate\npath of monetary policy, and I will remain cautious in my approach to adjusting the stance of\npolicy going forward. It is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course. My\ncolleagues and I will make our decisions at each FOMC meeting based on the incoming data and\nthe implications for and risks to the outlook guided by the Fed’s dual-mandate goals of\nmaximum employment and stable prices. We need to ensure that the public understands clearly\nhow current and expected deviations of inflation and employment from our mandated goals\ninform our policy decisions.\nBy the time of our next meeting in November, we will have received updated reports on\ninflation, employment, and economic activity. We may also have a better understanding of how\ndevelopments in longer-term interest rates and broader financial conditions might influence the\neconomic outlook.\nDuring the intermeeting period, I will continue to visit with a broad range of contacts to\ndiscuss economic conditions as I assess the appropriateness of our monetary policy stance. As\nI noted earlier, I continue to view inflation as a concern. In light of the upside risks that I just\ndescribed, it remains necessary to pay close attention to the price-stability side of our mandate\nwhile being attentive to the risks of a material weakening in the labor market. My view\n\n- 8 -\ncontinues to be that restoring price stability is essential for achieving maximum employment\nover the longer run. However, should the data evolve in a way that points to a material\nweakening in the labor market, I would support taking action and adjust monetary policy as\nneeded while taking into account our inflation mandate.\nClosing Thoughts\nIn closing, thank you again for welcoming me here today. It is a pleasure to join you and\nto have the opportunity to discuss my views on the economy and monetary policy. And given\nthe recent FOMC meeting decision and my dissent, I appreciate being able to provide a more\ndetailed explanation of the reasoning that led me to dissent in favor of a smaller reduction in the\npolicy rate at the FOMC meeting.\nI look forward to answering your questions and to engaging with your members on bank\nregulatory and supervisory matters.\ni On September 30, 2024, the speech was updated to clarify the references to the September 17-18, 2024 FOMC\nmeeting.",

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe ISDA Board of Directors\nLondon, England\nJune 26, 2024\n\nI would like to thank the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) for the\ninvitation to speak to you today.1 I appreciate the opportunity to engage with you on matters that\naffect the swaps and derivatives industry, specifically how we can best consider and address the\npotential consequences of bank capital reform measures, both in the United States and around the\nworld. Before doing so, I will share my views on the economy and monetary policy in the\nUnited States.\nUpdate on the Economy and Monetary Policy Outlook\nOver the past two years, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has significantly\ntightened the stance of monetary policy to address high inflation. At our meeting earlier this\nmonth, the FOMC voted to continue to hold the federal funds rate target range at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2\npercent and to continue to reduce the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings.\nAfter seeing considerable progress on slowing inflation last year, we have seen only\nmodest further progress this year. The 12-month measures of total and core personal\nconsumption expenditures (PCE) inflation have moved roughly sideways or slightly down since\nDecember and remained elevated at 2.7 percent and 2.8 percent, respectively, in April. The\nconsumer price index (CPI) report for May showed 12-month core CPI inflation slowing to\n3.4 percent from 3.6 percent in April. However, with average core CPI inflation this year\nthrough May running at an annualized rate of 3.8 percent, notably above average inflation in the\nsecond half of last year, I expect inflation to remain elevated for some time.\nThe recent pickup in inflation in the first several months of 2024 was evident across\nmany goods and services categories, suggesting that inflation was temporarily lower in the latter\n1 The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee or the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n- 2 -\nhalf of last year. Prices continue to be much higher than before the pandemic, which is weighing\non consumer sentiment. Inflation has hit lower-income households hardest since food, energy,\nand housing services price increases far outpaced overall inflation throughout this episode.\nEconomic activity increased at a strong pace last year but appears to have moderated\nearly this year. First-quarter gross domestic product growth was slower than in the second half\nof last year, though private domestic final purchases continued to rise at a solid pace. Continued\nsoftness in consumer spending and weaker housing activity early in the second quarter also\nsuggest less momentum in economic activity so far this year.\nPayroll employment continued to rise at a solid pace in April and May, though slightly\nslower than in the first quarter, partly reflecting increased immigrant labor supply. Despite some\nfurther rebalancing between supply and demand, the labor market remains tight. The\nunemployment rate edged up to 4.0 percent in May, while the number of job openings relative to\nunemployed workers declined further to near its pre-pandemic level. Labor force participation\ndropped back to 62.5 percent in May, which suggests no further improvement in labor supply\nalong this margin, as labor force participation among those aged 55 and older has been\npersistently low.\nAt its current setting, our monetary policy stance appears to be restrictive, and I will\ncontinue to monitor the incoming data to assess whether monetary policy is sufficiently\nrestrictive to bring inflation down to our target. As I’ve noted recently, my baseline outlook\ncontinues to be that inflation will decline further with the policy rate held steady. And should the\nincoming data indicate that inflation is moving sustainably toward our 2 percent goal, it will\neventually become appropriate to gradually lower the target range for the federal funds rate to\nprevent monetary policy from becoming overly restrictive. However, we are still not yet at the\n\n- 3 -\npoint where it is appropriate to lower the policy rate, and I continue to see a number of upside\nrisks to inflation.\nFirst, much of the progress on inflation last year was due to supply-side improvements,\nincluding easing of supply chain constraints; increases in the number of available workers, due in\npart to immigration; and lower energy prices. It is unlikely that further improvements along this\nmargin will continue to lower inflation going forward as supply chains have largely normalized;\nthe labor force participation rate has leveled off in recent months below pre-pandemic levels; and\nan open U.S. immigration policy over the past few years, which added millions of new\nimmigrants in the U.S., may become more restrictive.\nGeopolitical developments could also pose upside risks to inflation, including the risk\nthat spillovers from regional conflicts could disrupt global supply chains, putting additional\nupward pressure on food, energy, and commodity prices. There is also the risk that the loosening\nin financial conditions since late last year, reflecting considerable gains in equity valuations, and\nadditional fiscal stimulus could add momentum to demand, stalling any further progress or even\ncausing inflation to reaccelerate.\nFinally, there is a risk that increased immigration and continued labor market tightness\ncould lead to persistently high core services inflation. Given the current low inventory of\naffordable housing, the inflow of new immigrants to some geographic areas could result in\nupward pressure on rents, as additional housing supply may take time to materialize. With labor\nmarkets remaining tight, wage growth has been elevated at around or above 4 percent, still\nhigher than the pace consistent with our 2 percent inflation goal, given trend productivity growth.\nIn light of these risks, and the general uncertainty regarding the economic outlook, I will\ncontinue to watch the data closely as I assess the appropriate path of monetary policy. The\n\n- 4 -\nfrequency and extent of data revisions over the past few years make the task of assessing the\ncurrent state of the economy and predicting how the economy will evolve even more\nchallenging. I will remain cautious in my approach to considering future changes in the stance\nof policy.\nIt is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course. In my view, we\nshould consider a range of possible scenarios that could unfold when considering how the\nFOMC’s monetary policy decisions may evolve. My colleagues and I will make our decisions at\neach FOMC meeting based on the incoming data and the implications for and risks to the\noutlook. While the current stance of monetary policy appears to be at a restrictive level, I remain\nwilling to raise the target range for the federal funds rate at a future meeting should the incoming\ndata indicate that progress on inflation has stalled or reversed. Restoring price stability is\nessential for achieving maximum employment over the longer run.\nGrappling with the Unintended Consequences of Bank Capital Reform\nI will turn now to the issue of bank capital reform, and the implications of adopting and\nimplementing the Basel III “endgame” standards both in the United States and around the world.\nConsidering capital and debt requirements in the aggregate\nCapital requirements are an important component of the prudential regulatory\nframeworks and interconnected banking and financial systems around the world. As you know,\nthe U.S. has lagged our E.U. and U.K. counterparts in fully implementing the Basel III capital\nstandards. In July 2023, the U.S. federal banking agencies issued a public consultation on\nimplementing what the U.S. calls the Basel III “endgame” capital reforms.2 The response to the\n2 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and Office of\nthe Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), “Agencies Request Comment on Proposed Rules to Strengthen Capital\nRequirements for Large Banks,” news release, July 27, 2023,\n\n- 5 -\nU.S. capital proposal has been overwhelmingly negative, including from a broad range of\nstakeholders. I have previously spoken at length about my concerns with the proposal, and as\npublic commenters have reviewed it, they have identified additional areas of concern.3\nIn my view, the concerns are well-founded. The proposal acknowledged that the\nrevisions, if implemented, would result in an estimated 20 percent aggregate increase in total\nrisk-weighted assets across bank holding companies subject to the rule. Individual impacts\nwould vary not only by firm, but also by business line. For any particular business line or\nproduct, the aggregate impact of the proposed capital changes could result in a more significant\nincrease, depending upon the firm’s characteristics. Consider the impact on business lines\nsubject to the market risk capital rule. As noted in the proposal, the revisions to the market risk\nrule alone would increase risk-weighted assets from $430 billion to $760 billion for Category I\nand II firms, and from $130 billion to $220 billion for Category III and IV firms.4\nEven this example ignores the additive capital increases from other aspects of the rule,\nsuch as the operational risk charge “overlay” that may separately result in a higher capital charge\nfor the same business line, if that line is also generating fee income. The changes that may affect\nany particular financial product or service vary but could include impacts across all aspects of\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20230727a.htm; OCC, Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System, and FDIC, “Regulatory Capital Rule: Large Banking Organizations and Banking\nOrganizations with Significant Trading Activity,” 88 Fed.

For many of the derivatives and swaps activities in which banking entities engage,\nthe aggregate impacts on different business lines could result from changes to the market risk\nrule, the calculation of credit valuation adjustments, and the treatment of securities financing\ntransactions, among others.\nSo far, what I have described are just the aggregate effects of capital increases that would\nappear within the four corners of the U.S. Basel III endgame proposal. We know that these\nchanges do not exist in a vacuum. A particular firm can also be impacted by changes to the\nglobal systemically important bank (G-SIB) surcharge and long-term debt requirements. The\nfirm’s business planning would also need to consider existing requirements, such as leverage and\n“total loss-absorbing capacity” requirements. By design, these elements are intended to be\ncomplementary, often seeking to capture different risks, operate as “backstop” capital standards,\npromote resiliency, and be available for recapitalization in resolution.\nDespite the goal that the capital framework operates in a holistic fashion, the rulemaking\nprocess in the United States has taken a fragmented approach. This process has seemed to ignore\nthe interrelationships of the requirements. We cannot fully understand the intended and\nunintended consequences of any regulatory reform, including capital reform, without using a\nbroader lens to consider the interconnections and interrelationships among different capital and\ndebt requirements that apply in the banking system.\nThis narrow approach to rulemaking—focusing on a specific reform, without considering\nthe broader framework—has created a corresponding narrowness when we think about the\nconsequences of regulatory reform. This challenge has been particularly acute in the capital and\ndebt space simply because there are so many requirements that are intended to operate in a\ncomplementary way, and that in the aggregate may overlap or conflict, generating unintended\n\n- 7 -\nconsequences. The Federal Reserve has expressly acknowledged the complementary nature of\nthese requirements, for example in noting that some leverage ratio requirements operate as a\nbackstop to risk-based capital requirements.5 And yet, the discussions of costs and benefits of\nreform tend to disregard the aggregate impact across rules, even when related reforms are\nproposed at the same time and the aggregate impacts can be identified and assessed.6\nConsidering direct and indirect consequences\nWith respect to the Basel III “endgame” reforms, much of the discussion of consequences\nhas focused on the direct consequences to the availability and price of credit, resulting from the\nproposed changes to risk-weighted assets. These issues resonate with households and\nbusinesses. Everyone understands the direct impact on their own household finances or their\nbusiness’s bottom line from higher costs of lending. Often overlooked are the direct and indirect\nconsequences of capital reforms on financial products such as derivatives and swaps. These\nproducts can seem exotic to the public, but we know they play a significant role in the financial\n5 See, e.g., Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Interim Final Rule and Request for Comment,\n“Temporary Exclusion of U.S. Treasury Securities and Deposits at Federal Reserve Banks from the Supplementary\nLeverage Ratio,” 85 Fed. Reg. 20,578, 20,579 (April 14, 2020) (“This interim final rule does not affect the tier 1\nleverage ratio, which will continue to serve as a backstop for all banking organizations subject to the capital rule.”),\nhttps://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2020-04-14/pdf/2020-07345.pdf.\n6 See, e.g., OCC, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and FDIC, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking,\n“Long-Term Debt Requirements for Large Bank Holding Companies, Certain Intermediate Holding Companies of\nForeign Banking Organizations, and Large Insured Depository Institutions,” 88 Fed. Reg. 64,524, 64,551, n. 97\n(“The agencies recognize that their Basel III reforms proposal would, if adopted, increase risk-weighted assets\nacross covered entities. The increased risk-weighted assets would lead mechanically to increased requirements for\nLTD under the LTD proposal. The increased capital that would be required under the Basel III proposal could also\nreduce the cost of various forms of debt for impacted firms due to the increased resilience that accompanies\nadditional capital (which is sometimes referred to as the Modigliani–Miller offset). The size of the estimated LTD\nneeds and costs presented in this section do not account for either of these potential effects of the Basel III\nproposal.”) (emphasis added), https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2023-09-19/pdf/2023-19265.pdf. Even\nwhen the agencies estimate the effect of a proposal on other rules, the impact analysis tends to be narrow, such as\nfocusing on the estimated shortfall that would be created by the interrelated rules and may overlook other pending\nrules.

And it is certainly foreseeable that proposed capital reforms could impair\nmarket liquidity.\nWe also know that regulatory reforms—especially capital reforms with a direct link to\nparticular products, services, and markets—can cause broader changes in firm behavior. Some\nbanks may raise prices on particular products based on their internal allocation of increased\ncapital charges. And some banks may discontinue certain products or services that cannot be\noffered in a cost-effective way. These choices will impact the competitive landscape into the\nfuture, and in some cases—such as where significant economies of scale are required to offer a\nproduct or service—the end result may be that some banks exit certain product markets, resulting\nin increased concentration and higher prices for households and businesses.\nWhile I am acutely aware of our need to consider these costs and price effects, I am also\naware that regulators sitting in Washington, D.C. are not well-equipped to query and understand\nthese real-world consequences of reform. In my view, the commenter feedback we have\nreceived on these issues has helped to illuminate these consequences. My hope is that we take\nthem into account when moving forward to implement the Basel III endgame standards.\nThe path forward\nI do see a path forward to implement Basel III, one that not only addresses the overall\ncalibration and international consistency and comparability, but also makes more granular\nchanges that will improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the rule. In terms of this path, I\nwill briefly outline what I see as necessary procedural steps, while also providing a non-\nexclusive list of substantive changes that I believe are necessary to improve the proposal.\n\n- 9 -\nIn October 2023, the Federal Reserve initiated a data collection to gather information\nfrom the banks affected by the U.S. proposal. I am hopeful that these data will allow regulators\nto better understand the proposal’s impact and identify areas for revision. Any next step in this\nrulemaking process will require broad and material changes. It should also be accompanied by a\ndata-driven analysis of the proposal and be informed by the significant public input received\nduring the rulemaking process. This should assist policymakers in creating a path to improve the\nrulemaking. My hope is that policymakers pay closer attention to the balance of costs and\nbenefits while considering the direct and indirect consequences of the capital reform.\nI have previously identified a number of specific areas and procedural steps that would be\nnecessary to address in any future efforts to revise this proposal. Some of these issues include\n• addressing redundancy in the capital framework (for example, between the new market\nrisk and operational risk requirements, and the stress capital buffer);\n• recalibrating the market risk rule specifically, where some of the biggest outlier increases\nin risk-weighted assets would appear;\n• adopting a more reasonable treatment for non-interest and fee-based income through the\noperational risk requirements, which could deter banks from diversifying revenue\nstreams, even though such diversification can enhance an institution’s stability and\nresilience;\n• reviewing the impact of capital requirements, including leverage ratio requirements, on\nU.S. Treasury market intermediation and liquidity;\n• incorporating tailoring in the applicability of Basel III capital reforms, specifically\nlooking at whether each element of the Basel III capital proposal is appropriate for non-\nG-SIB firms that are not internationally active; and\n\n- 10 -\n• re-proposing the Basel III standards to address the broad and material reforms that I\nbelieve should be included in any final rule, including granular changes to address the\nspecific issues raised by commenters, as appropriate.7\nWhile these steps would be a reasonable starting place, they are not a replacement for a data-\ndriven analysis and a careful review of the comments submitted. This would result in a better\nproposal that includes not only changes to address these concerns, but also the many other\nconcerns raised by the public.\nClosing Thoughts\nIt has been a pleasure speaking with you today. Your industry plays an important role\nnot only in the U.S. economy, but also in the broader world economy. It is imperative that\nregulators not lose sight of the practical implications of regulatory reform, even as the U.S.\nconsiders the next steps in moving forward to adopt the final Basel III capital reforms.\n7 See dissenting statement, “Statement by Governor Michelle W.

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Frameworks for Monetary Policy, Regulation, and Bank Capital”\nSpring 2024 Meeting of the Shadow Open Market Committee, hosted by\nthe Manhattan Institute\nNew York, New York\nApril 5, 2024\n\nThank you for the invitation to speak to the Shadow Open Market Committee (SOMC).1\nThe SOMC has a distinguished reputation for fostering substantive analysis and debate regarding\nindependent, transparent, and systematic approaches to central bank policymaking. It’s a\npleasure to join you today and to discuss some of the current issues facing central banks and\nmonetary policymakers.\nIn my remarks today, I will review some of the notable developments in the U.S.\neconomy and financial system—as well as review key monetary policy actions and\ncommunications—since I joined the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and\nbecame a permanent voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) in late\nNovember 2018. As I look back over these five-plus years, I will consider how a range of\nuncertainties and risks regarding the macroeconomy and its measurement have affected\nmonetary policy decisions and communications. I will also highlight some considerations\nregarding financial stability risks and monetary policy. I will conclude with my own views on\nthe near-term economic outlook, some of the prominent risks and uncertainties surrounding my\noutlook, and my views on the implications for monetary policy.\nSetting Monetary Policy amid a Wide Range of Uncertainties and Risks\nAn omni-present challenge monetary policymakers face is how to account for\nuncertainties surrounding the current state of the economy and the economic outlook when\nsetting monetary policy. Macroeconomic models that can help guide the setting of monetary\npolicy often invoke unobservable concepts such as the natural rate of unemployment, potential\noutput, or the neutral real interest rate. These unobservable concepts can be estimated but only\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nwith a considerable degree of uncertainty, and the estimates may vary over time—for example,\nbecause of structural changes in the economy. Macroeconomic models are also subject to\nuncertainty, since they must make simplifying assumptions regarding the complex set of\nrelationships and interactions among households, businesses, governments, and the financial\nsystem that also evolve and change. Moreover, the data that are used to estimate model\nparameters and to formulate the economic outlook are inherently uncertain and are often revised\nas the statistical agencies refine their estimates or gather more information.\nIn addition to uncertainties surrounding macroeconomic models and measurement, there\nare a number of risks that, if realized, could shock the economy and financial system, making it\nmore difficult for policymakers to confidently assess the economy and the economic outlook.\nDespite these challenges, monetary policymaking requires a forward-looking approach, since its\nactions affect the economy, labor markets, and inflation with a lag.2\nThe post–financial crisis economy and monetary policy at the zero lower bound\nWhen I joined the FOMC in late 2018, despite nearly a decade of accommodative\nmonetary policy following the financial crisis and subsequent recession, one of the primary\nconcerns was that inflation had persistently been running slightly below the Committee’s\n2 percent inflation target. There was a recognition that the “natural rate of unemployment” may\nhave been lower than many on the FOMC had estimated, and that inflation may have become\n2 Greenspan (2004), Bernanke (2007), and Powell (2018) offer discussions of how risk and uncertainty may\ninfluence monetary policy in practice.

There was also a concern that the\nfederal funds rate, the FOMC’s key policy rate, was too close to the “zero lower bound.” And\nthat this proximity could limit the Committee’s ability to respond effectively to an adverse shock\nby using our primary monetary policy tool of lowering the target range for the federal funds rate.\nMore broadly, many central banks around the world were grappling with the prospect of\nstructurally lower interest rates due to a variety of factors, including demographic changes and\nhigher savings rates, lower potential output and productivity growth, and greater investor\ndemand for safe assets like Treasury securities.\nAt the time, the FOMC assessed that downward risks to both employment and inflation\nwere likely to remain prominent due to the proximity of interest rates to the zero lower bound.\nIn August 2020, the FOMC significantly revised its Statement on Longer-Run Goals and\nMonetary Policy Strategy to reflect this assessment.4 A notable change relative to the initial\n3 For example, the range of estimates of the longer-run level of the unemployment rate in the Summary of Economic\nProjections (SEP) in March 2013 was 5.0 to 6.0 percent. This range shifted lower over time. In the most recent\n(March 2024) SEP, the range of estimates of the longer-run unemployment rate was 3.7 to 4.3 percent.

The new statement noted that the Committee would seek “to mitigate\nshortfalls [emphasis added]”—rather than “deviations”—“of employment from the Committee’s\nassessment of its maximum level and deviations of inflation from its longer-run goal.”5 By\nreplacing the word “deviations” with “shortfalls” when describing employment and the\nCommittee’s reaction to changes in employment relative to estimates of its maximum level, the\nCommittee indicated that it would not act preemptively to curb inflation based only on the\nperception of labor market tightness.\nAnother notable change to the strategy statement was the adoption of what some refer to\nas “asymmetric flexible average inflation targeting” or “temporary price level targeting.”6\nSpecifically, the new statement noted that “in order to anchor longer-term inflation expectations\nat [its 2 percent goal], the Committee seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over\ntime, and therefore judges that, following periods when inflation has been running persistently\nMonetary Policy,” a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, held in Jackson Hole, Wyo.\n(via webcast), August 27, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm; and Richard\nH.

Although the revised statement reaffirmed the commitment to the\nCommittee’s inflation target, it did not describe how the Committee would respond if inflation\nwere to run persistently above its 2 percent goal.8\nGiven the timing of its implementation, the revised strategy guided how the FOMC\nresponded to one of the largest shocks experienced by the U.S. economy in recent years—the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. This shock—combined with the policy responses of governments and\ncentral banks around the world—disrupted many of the dynamics that had influenced the\neconomy over the previous several decades and the post–2008 financial crisis approach to\nmonetary policy. These impacts will affect how we think about monetary policy going forward,\nbut let’s first put the COVID-19 event and response into better context.\nThe COVID-19 shock and monetary policy response\nToward the latter part of the FOMC’s monetary policy framework review, in March\n2020, the COVID-19 pandemic created an unprecedented shock to the global economy and\nfinancial system. Widespread economic lockdowns and social distancing, combined with other\npandemic effects, caused the swiftest and deepest contraction in employment and economic\nactivity since the Great Depression. Many critical parts of the U.S. financial system experienced\n7 See the latest Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, in note [5] (quoted text in\nparagraph 4).\n8 The statement did note that if the Committee’s employment and inflation objectives were no longer\ncomplementary, the Committee would take into account both employment shortfalls and inflation deviations as well\nas the time horizons over which employment and inflation were projected to return to levels judged consistent with\nits mandate.\n\n- 6 -\nsignificant disruption or completely ceased to function. The Federal Reserve responded\nforcefully to mitigate the financial market turmoil and the economic effects of the rapid\nshutdown of the U.S. economy (and I’ll have more to say on this topic later).\nAs a part of its response, the FOMC quickly lowered the target range for the federal\nfunds rate back to 0 to 1/4 percent and began purchasing large amounts of Treasury and agency\nmortgage-backed securities. These purchases were initially designed to support the smooth\nfunctioning of securities markets and the flow of credit to businesses and households. Later, the\npurchases provided additional monetary policy accommodation to support economic activity and\nlabor markets.9\nFollowing the return to the zero lower bound, in addition to conducting asset purchases,\nthe FOMC used forward guidance to provide additional monetary policy accommodation to keep\nboth short- and longer-term interest rates low. In its March 15, 2020, statement, the FOMC\nnoted that it expected to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent\n“until it [was] confident that the economy [had] weathered recent events and [was] on track to\nachieve its maximum employment and price stability goals.”10 Following the release of the\nrevised framework in August 2020, the FOMC revised the forward guidance in its September\npost-meeting statement to be more explicitly outcome-based to state that the target range would\nremain at 0 to 1/4 percent “until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the\n9 The Federal Reserve implemented 13 emergency lending and liquidity facilities under its emergency lending\nauthorities and undertook supervisory and regulatory actions to support the flow of credit to households, businesses,\nand local governments.

The guidance was also quite restrictive in the criteria for slowing the pace of asset\npurchases, especially since the FOMC would stop asset purchases before it would raise the\nfederal funds rate.13\nOne could argue the December forward guidance made it much more difficult for the\nFOMC to react to new information suggesting that risks and uncertainties had evolved in\nresponse to pandemic-related changes in the economy. Other uncertainties such as the accuracy\nof real-time economic measurements also presented challenges, as did significant supply-side\ndisruptions and the uncertainty about the timing of progress toward their resolution, which I will\ndiscuss next.\n11 The September 2020 FOMC statement is available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm (quoted text in paragraph 4).\n12 The December 2020 FOMC statement is available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm (quoted text in paragraph 4).\n13 See, for example, the discussion of policy normalization principles in the December 2021 FOMC minutes, which\ncan be found on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.\n\n- 8 -\nThe post-pandemic economy, the resurgence of inflation, and the rapid tightening in\nmonetary policy\nIn the early phases of the pandemic, fiscal authorities around the world implemented\nsupport programs for labor markets and households and businesses.14 These generous policies,\ncombined with very accommodative monetary policies, bolstered private-sector and state and\nlocal government balance sheets. In particular, they led to what has come to be known as\n“excess savings”—above-normal household savings from extraordinary levels of fiscal support\nand a limited ability to freely spend it due to economic lockdowns, supply chain disruptions, and\nother pandemic- and recession-related factors.\nIn 2021, novel medical treatments, reduced social distancing, and innovative business\napproaches in adapting to the restrictive pandemic environment led to a sharp economic rebound.\nStrong demand (supported by stimulative fiscal and monetary policies), a reduced labor supply\n(due in part to early retirements, childcare responsibilities, and concerns about COVID-19), and\na mismatch between available jobs and workers all contributed to a very tight labor market. The\nunusually rapid rebound in economic activity, pandemic-driven shift to consumer goods\nspending, supply chain fragilities, and manufacturing component shortages led to crippling\nbottlenecks for a number of industries. These supply and demand imbalances, likely amplified\nby fiscal and monetary policies, led to a sharp rise in inflation over a period of just a few months.\nBy the second half of 2021, inflationary pressures intensified and became more broad-\nbased. Labor markets were extremely tight, though it was difficult to assess the true extent of\ntightness, given the decrease in labor force participation and mixed data signals at the time,\n14 In the U.S., fiscal programs and policies included stimulus checks, expanded unemployment insurance, the\nPaycheck Protection Program, and other CARES Act (Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act) and\nARP Act (American Rescue Plan Act) programs designed to support businesses, households, and state and local\ngovernments.\n\n- 9 -\nwhich all were later revised. Of the many difficult issues the Committee faced, one of the most\nimportant was whether inflation would persist or would resolve as supply-side issues eventually\neased.\nThe September 2021 Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) showed the median\nFOMC expectation for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation of 4.2 percent at the\nend of 2021, largely reflecting high inflation readings in the first half of 2021. But for year-end\n2022, the median expectation was for PCE inflation to decline to 2.2 percent. 15 Private-sector\nforecasters expected higher inflation of 5.1 percent at year-end 2021 but also projected a slowing\nto just over 2 percent by the end of 2022.16 With the benefit of hindsight, we now know that\nmost forecasters, ourselves included, vastly misjudged the persistence of inflation at that time,\nwith 5.9 percent PCE inflation for both 2021 and 2022. This example underscores the challenge\nwe faced in identifying which factors were driving inflation and how long those forces would\npersist.\nIn the second half of 2021, it became clear that the FOMC’s monetary policy stance was\ntoo accommodative in the presence of growing inflationary pressures and that the Committee\nneeded to move toward a tighter policy stance. It seems likely to me that the experience of the\nyears leading up to the pandemic, when inflation was persistently low, made it hard for many to\nforesee how quickly that situation could change. Of course, the inflation and labor data did not\naccurately reflect the economic conditions prevailing at the time and were subsequently\n15 See the SEP released following the September 2021 FOMC meeting, which is available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.\n16 Private-sector forecasts reflect the consensus estimate in the Blue Chip survey of business forecasters in June\n2021.\n\n- 10 -\nsubstantially revised.17 Together, these factors, combined with the FOMC’s forward guidance\ndiscussed earlier, contributed to a delay in the removal of monetary policy accommodation in\n2021.\nThe shift in the Committee’s forward guidance toward the end of 2021 and in early 2022\nwas effective in moving longer-dated interest rates higher and in tightening financial conditions,\neven before the FOMC raised the federal funds rate.18 At our November 2021 meeting, we\nannounced that we would begin to slow the pace of purchases later that month. At the December\n2021 meeting, we doubled the pace of tapering, which accelerated the end of purchases to the\nfollowing March. At the March 2022 FOMC meeting, the FOMC raised the target range for the\nfederal funds rate by 25 basis points. And in May, the FOMC announced its plan to reduce the\nsize of the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings—which then stood at around $8.5 trillion—\nstarting in June and at a pace much faster than in the previous episode of balance sheet\nreduction.19 The FOMC also continued to increase the target range for the federal funds rate\nover the course of 2022 at a pace much faster than in previous tightening cycles, as it became\nclear that inflation was higher and more persistent than many forecasters had expected. By July\n2023, the FOMC had increased the federal funds rate to 5-1/4 percentage points, and into\nrestrictive territory, where it has remained. And we have continued to reduce the size of our\nsecurities holdings.\n17 For example, both the August and September 2021 employment reports suggested much lower job growth than\ndid consensus forecasts, and these initial estimates were subsequently sizably increased. Similarly, total PCE\ninflation for nearly all quarters in 2021 has been revised higher than initially reported.

An important question I will be thinking about going forward is\nhow to make monetary policy decisions and communications more robust to these types of risks.\nSeparate tools for monetary policy and financial stability\nWe know that monetary policy transmission is most effective during periods of stable\nfinancial conditions, and that financial stability risks, if realized, can affect the economic\noutlook. While monetary policy and financial stability are connected, financial stability\nvulnerabilities and risks are most appropriately addressed using macro- and micro-prudential\nregulation and bank supervision. During periods of extreme financial stress, well-calibrated\nlending and liquidity programs can be used to address such conditions. Of course, where risks\nimpact the outlook for economic activity, employment, and inflation, a monetary policy response\nmay also be required.\nThe Federal Reserve’s use of liquidity and lending programs during the early stages of\nthe pandemic demonstrated the effectiveness of emergency lending tools as backstops to support\nmarket functioning and the flow of credit in times of stress.20 Lending programs are most\neffective as backstops when loans are offered at a penalty rate and are of short duration. When\nappropriately calibrated, they can help promote market functioning and the effective\ntransmission of monetary policy but limit the Federal Reserve’s overall footprint in financial\nmarkets in the longer term. This experience also highlights the importance of clearly\n20 For details on these programs, see Board of Governors, “Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): Funding,\nCredit, Liquidity, and Loan Facilities,” in note [9]. The Federal Reserve also took a number of other actions,\nincluding easing terms on discount window lending and supervisory and regulatory actions, to encourage banks to\nlend and act as market intermediaries.\n\n- 12 -\ndistinguishing monetary policy actions from temporary central bank asset purchase programs\nused to promote core financial market functioning, like those created to support Treasury\nmarkets in the spring of 2020.21\nMore recently, the bank failures last spring highlight that responsive, efficient, and\neffective bank supervision is a strong mitigant for financial system risks and vulnerabilities. The\nfailures revealed that shortcomings in bank supervision can heighten financial stability risks.\nThe primary focus of supervision should be to address a bank’s critical shortcomings in a timely\nway.22 To effectively support financial stability, bank supervision cannot simply rely on\npinpointing compliance issues, failed processes, or rule violations. It must go further to examine\na bank’s risk exposures, including anticipating how the evolving economic environment may\ninfluence a bank’s financial condition and its assessment of risks. If the supervisory process fails\nto identify and escalate critical risks, or to hold management accountable for known deficiencies,\nlike excess interest rate risk and disproportionately large levels of uninsured deposits, this raises\nthe potential for safety and soundness concerns.\nLast year’s bank stress also revealed that the Fed’s bank liquidity and payments tools—\nincluding the Fed’s discount window operations and FedWire®—should be available for\nextended operating hours and prepared to provide support during times of stress. We should also\nconsider what further steps may be needed to ensure that banks have access to liquidity support.\nIn addition, we should encourage, but not mandate, the exercise of contingency funding plans\n21 See Michelle W. Bowman (2023), “Panel on ‘Design Issues for Central Bank Facilities in the Future,’ ” speech\ndelivered at the Chicago Booth Initiative on Global Markets Workshop on Market Dysfunction, Chicago, March 3,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20230303a.htm.\n22 See Michelle W.

Some measure of risk is inherent and necessary in the business of banking.\nWhile some changes to the regulatory framework may be appropriate to promote\nfinancial stability, we should be cautious that these changes do not impair the long-term viability\nof banks, especially mid-sized and smaller banks.24 In my view, regulatory reform can pose\nsignificant financial stability risks, particularly if those regulatory changes fail to take sufficient\naccount of the incentive effects and potential consequences, like pushing activity into the more\nopaque nonbank financial sector.25 Poorly calibrated regulatory actions can also negatively\naffect economic activity and reduce the availability of credit by limiting the offering of other\nfinancial products or services. These concerns are most acute when the reforms may be\ninefficient or poorly targeted. As an example, policymakers should carefully consider whether\nthe significant capital increases included in the U.S. Basel III proposal meet this standard of\nbeing efficient and appropriately targeted.26\nWhat’s Next for the Economy and Monetary Policy?\nLooking ahead, the FOMC will continue to face a number of risks and uncertainties as it\nseeks to return inflation to its 2 percent goal. It will be important to evaluate how these\n23 See Michelle W.

As this audience\nknows, members of the FOMC consult a range of models that consider several scenarios and\ntheir potential economic outcomes using different benchmark monetary policy rules.27 This type\nof analysis can provide helpful input in informing my own views on the appropriate path of\nmonetary policy. Given the importance of transparency, it is also necessary that our\ncommunications explain not only how the economic outlook affects our monetary policy\ndecisions, often referred to as the FOMC’s “reaction function,” but also how the risks and\nuncertainties surrounding the economic outlook matter for those decisions.\nWith that in mind, I will conclude my remarks with my own views on the near-term\neconomic outlook, including some prominent risks and uncertainties, and the implications for\nmonetary policy.\nAt our most recent FOMC meeting, I supported keeping the target range for the federal\nfunds rate at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent and continuing to reduce our securities holdings. At its\ncurrent setting, our monetary policy stance is restrictive and appears to be appropriately\ncalibrated to reduce inflationary pressures. We have seen significant progress on lowering\ninflation over the past year while economic activity and the labor market have remained strong.\nConsumer services spending has shown continued strength through February, and payroll\nemployment increased at a very strong pace in the first quarter.\nHowever, most employment gains over the past year have been in part-time employment,\nand some of the recent strength in job gains may reflect stronger labor supply due to increased\n27 See, for example, the box “Monetary Policy Rules in the Current Environment” in Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System (2024), Monetary Policy Report (Washington: Board of Governors, March), pp. 41–43,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/20240301_mprfullreport.pdf; and Federal Reserve Bank of\nCleveland (2024), “Simple Monetary Policy Rules,” webpage, https://www.clevelandfed.org/indicators-and-\ndata/simple-monetary-policy-rules.\n\n- 15 -\nimmigration. The 12-month readings of total and core PCE inflation through February printed at\n2.5 and 2.8 percent, respectively, much lower than a year ago. However, with the annualized\n3-month PCE inflation readings moving well-above the 12-month measures in February, I expect\nfurther progress in bringing inflation down to 2 percent will be slower this year.\nStill, my baseline outlook continues to be that inflation will decline further with the\npolicy rate held steady at its current level, and that the labor market will remain strong but with\nlabor demand and supply gradually rebalancing as the number of job openings relative to\nunemployed workers declines. And should the incoming data continue to indicate that inflation\nis moving sustainably toward our 2 percent goal, it will eventually become appropriate to\ngradually lower the federal funds rate to prevent monetary policy from becoming overly\nrestrictive. However, we are still not yet at the point where it is appropriate to lower the policy\nrate, and I continue to see a number of upside risks to inflation.\nFirst, much of the progress on inflation last year was due to supply-side improvements,\nincluding easing of supply chain constraints; increases in the number of available workers, due in\npart to immigration; and lower energy prices. It is unclear whether further supply-side\nimprovements will continue to lower inflation. For example, the rebound in labor productivity\nlast year may have reflected an unwinding of temporary pandemic-related labor market\ndynamics, such as a slowing in the high levels of employee turnover during that time. Therefore,\nif wage gains remain elevated going forward, these effects may no longer contribute to lower\nprice inflation in the future.\nGeopolitical developments could also pose upside risks to inflation, including the risk of\nspillovers from geopolitical conflicts and the extent to which food and energy markets and\nsupply chains remain exposed to these influences.\n\n- 16 -\nAnother upside inflation risk I see is from additional fiscal stimulus or a higher spend-out\nrate from existing and new appropriations. Although some of the recent policies may increase\nproductive capacity in the medium term, they may add to inflationary pressures by boosting\naggregate demand.\nI also see upside risks to housing services inflation. Given the current low inventory of\navailable and affordable housing, the inflow of new immigrants to certain regions could result in\nupward pressure on rents, as additional housing supply may take time to materialize. There is\nalso a risk that continued labor market tightness and continued strong services demand could\nlead to persistently higher core services inflation. Inflation readings over the past two months\nsuggest progress may be uneven or slower going forward, especially for core services.\nFinally, there is uncertainty regarding whether the federal funds rate will need to remain\nat a higher level than before the pandemic in order to effectively foster low and stable inflation\nand support full employment. In my view, given potential structural changes in the economy,\nlike higher investment demand relative to available savings, it is quite possible that the level of\nthe federal funds rate consistent with low and stable inflation will be higher than before the\npandemic. If that is the case, fewer rate cuts will eventually be appropriate to return our\nmonetary policy stance to a neutral level. In the most recent SEP, some FOMC participants\nindicated that they now see fewer rate cuts over 2024 and over the next two years than in\nDecember. Some also included a higher longer-run level of the federal funds rate than in the\npast.28\n28 See the March 2024 and December 2023 SEPs, available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.\n\n- 17 -\nWhile it is not my baseline outlook, I continue to see the risk that at a future meeting we\nmay need to increase the policy rate further should progress on inflation stall or even reverse.\nGiven the risks and uncertainties regarding my economic outlook, I will continue to watch the\ndata closely as I assess the appropriate path of monetary policy, and I will remain cautious in my\napproach to considering future changes in the stance of policy. Reducing our policy rate too\nsoon or too quickly could result in a rebound in inflation, requiring further future policy rate\nincreases to return inflation to 2 percent over the longer run.\nClosing Thoughts\nTo conclude, the experience over the past five years highlights the enduring challenge of\nsetting forward-looking monetary policy amid a wide and evolving range of risks and\nuncertainties. Taking into account this experience and the lessons I have learned over my tenure\non the FOMC, an important question I will be considering is how to make monetary policy\nstrategy and its related communications durable to a wide range of possible shocks and changes\nin the macroeconomy. We will continue to learn about the post-pandemic economy, and, if\nhistory is any guide, new shocks to and changes in the economy will eventually and inevitably\noccur. While the future is full of risks and uncertainties, the FOMC’s mandate of fostering price\nstability and maximum employment remains very clear. Restoring price stability is essential for\nachieving maximum employment over the longer run.\nThank you again for the opportunity to speak with you today. I look forward to our\nconversation.",

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nOutstanding Women of Kansas Awards Ceremony\nTopeka, Kansas\nAugust 19, 2020\n\nThank you to the 19th Amendment Centennial Celebration Committee for the\nhonor of being included among these distinguished awardees, whose achievements have\ndone so much for our state and our nation.\nWe are here today because of the tireless efforts of brave women—including\nKansas women—demanding that men and women have an equal right to vote and shape\ntheir destiny. The suffragettes didn’t only achieve something for women. Through their\nefforts, our country became a stronger democracy by extending the full opportunity for\nwomen to be counted and to take part in the political process.\nThe passage of the 19th Amendment in 1920 enabled women to directly\nparticipate in selecting our country’s leaders. It paved the way for women to take part on\nequal terms, including by serving as leaders themselves. None of us singled out today\nwould be here without the extraordinary efforts of those who secured the vote for women.\nIn my case, it was serving as Kansas’s first female State Bank Commissioner, and the\nfirst person to serve on the Federal Reserve Board in the role designated by Congress for\nsomeone with community banking experience. The sacrifice and persistence of those\nwomen more than a century ago set an example for future generations of women and\nallows our daughters to dream that anything is possible with hard work, commitment, and\ndetermination.\nThat legacy has deep roots in Kansas. As many here know, in 1861, Kansas\ngranted women a limited right to vote in school district elections; and, by 1867, Kansas\nbecame the first U.S. state to hold a statewide referendum on women’s suffrage. Even\nthough this first referendum was defeated, it reflected and contributed to a new way of\nthinking about what it meant to be a woman and citizen. In 1887, Kansas elected the first\n\n- 2 -\nfemale mayor in America. And in 1912, Kansas became the eighth state to approve\nwomen’s voting rights in all elections. I could not be more proud of my Kansas heritage.\nThe participation of women in the political and policymaking process brings a\nbroader perspective. Throughout my career, and as an attorney and a public servant, I\nhave found that the inclusion of individuals with a broad range of experiences deepens\nour understanding of the issues and results in better discussions and more thoughtful\ndecisionmaking.\nIn my current role, I bring the perspective of someone from a small, rural,\nagricultural community, who has worked as a community banker and as a state regulator.\nThose aren’t typical experiences for a Fed policymaker. This diversity is a strength, as\nCongress recognized by creating a role on the Federal Reserve Board designated for\nsomeone with community banking experience. I am the first to serve in this capacity, and\nI strongly believe that our economic and financial system is strengthened when we\nconsider the implications of our regulatory decisions for bankers on Main Street as well\nas on Wall Street.\nI approach our monetary policy deliberations in a similar way. Our actions in\nresponse to the recent pandemic have clearly benefited from this perspective, as we\nunderstand how the varying state and local approaches have affected economic\nconditions across the nation.\nIn closing, it is appropriate that during this election season we honor the women\nwho secured that right, first in Kansas, and then through their campaign to ratify the 19th\namendment. The greatest tribute to those women, and the best way to honor their legacy,\nis to vote. Another way is through public service, and I would strongly encourage all—\n\n- 3 -\nbut in particular women—to consider serving in government at the local, state, or federal\nlevel. It is the most challenging, but by far the most rewarding work that I have done,\nand I hope you will consider serving as well.\nThank you again for this honor.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n2:05 p.m. EDT (11:05 a.m. PDT)\nJune 27, 2024\nBrief Remarks on the Economy, Monetary Policy, and Bank Regulation\nRemarks by\nMichelle W. Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nIdaho, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington Bankers Associations\n2024 Annual Convention\nStevenson, Washington\nJune 27, 2024\n\nI would like to thank the Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington Bankers Associations\nfor the invitation to join you this morning.1 It’s a pleasure to be here in Washington State to\nspeak with your members. Direct interactions like this, outside of Washington, D.C., enable me\nto develop a deeper understanding of what is happening in the banking industry and the regional\neconomy. Before sharing some thoughts about the current trajectory of regulatory approvals and\nbank merger policy, I will discuss my views on the economy and monetary policy.\nUpdate on the Economy and Monetary Policy Outlook\nOver the past two years, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has significantly\ntightened the stance of monetary policy to address high inflation. At our meeting earlier this\nmonth, the FOMC voted to continue to hold the federal funds rate target range at 5-1/4 to\n5-1/2 percent and to continue to reduce the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings.\nAfter seeing considerable progress on slowing inflation last year, we have seen only\nmodest further progress this year. The 12-month measures of total and core personal\nconsumption expenditures inflation have moved roughly sideways or slightly down since\nDecember and remained elevated at 2.7 percent and 2.8 percent, respectively, in April. The\nconsumer price index (CPI) report for May showed 12-month core CPI inflation slowing to\n3.4 percent from 3.6 percent in April. However, with average core CPI inflation this year\nthrough May running at an annualized rate of 3.8 percent, notably above average inflation in the\nsecond half of last year, I expect inflation to remain elevated for some time.\nThe recent pickup in inflation in the first several months of 2024 was evident across\nmany goods and services categories, suggesting that inflation was temporarily lower in the latter\nhalf of last year. Prices continue to be much higher than before the pandemic, which is weighing\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\non consumer sentiment. Inflation has hit lower-income households hardest since food, energy,\nand housing services price increases far outpaced overall inflation throughout this episode.\nEconomic activity increased at a strong pace last year but appears to have moderated\nearly this year. First-quarter gross domestic product growth was slower than in the second half\nof last year, though private domestic final purchases continued to rise at a solid pace. Continued\nsoftness in consumer spending and weaker housing activity early in the second quarter also\nsuggest less momentum in economic activity so far this year.\nPayroll employment continued to rise at a solid pace in April and May, though slightly\nslower than in the first quarter, partly reflecting increased immigrant labor supply. Despite some\nfurther rebalancing between supply and demand, the labor market remains tight. The\nunemployment rate edged up to 4.0 percent in May, while the number of job openings relative to\nunemployed workers declined further to near its pre-pandemic level. Labor force participation\ndropped back to 62.5 percent in May, which suggests no further improvement in labor supply\nalong this margin, as labor force participation among those aged 55 or older has been persistently\nlow.\nAt its current setting, our monetary policy stance appears to be restrictive, and I will\ncontinue to monitor the incoming data to assess whether monetary policy is sufficiently\nrestrictive to bring inflation down to our target. As I’ve noted recently, my baseline outlook\ncontinues to be that inflation will decline further with the policy rate held steady. And should the\nincoming data indicate that inflation is moving sustainably toward our 2 percent goal, it will\neventually become appropriate to gradually lower the federal funds rate to prevent monetary\npolicy from becoming overly restrictive. However, we are still not yet at the point where it is\nappropriate to lower the policy rate, and I continue to see a number of upside risks to inflation.\n\n- 3 -\nFirst, much of the progress on inflation last year was due to supply-side improvements,\nincluding easing of supply chain constraints; increases in the number of available workers, due in\npart to immigration; and lower energy prices. It is unlikely that further improvements along this\nmargin will continue to lower inflation going forward, as supply chains have largely normalized,\nthe labor force participation rate has leveled off in recent months below pre-pandemic levels, and\nan open U.S. immigration policy over the past few years, which added millions of new\nimmigrants in the U.S., may become more restrictive.\nGeopolitical developments could also pose upside risks to inflation, including the risk\nthat spillovers from regional conflicts could disrupt global supply chains, putting additional\nupward pressure on food, energy, and commodity prices. There is also the risk that the loosening\nin financial conditions since late last year, reflecting considerable gains in equity valuations, and\nadditional fiscal stimulus could add momentum to demand, stalling any further progress or even\ncausing inflation to reaccelerate.\nFinally, there is a risk that increased immigration and continued labor market tightness\ncould lead to persistently high core services inflation. Given the current low inventory of\naffordable housing, the inflow of new immigrants to some geographic areas could result in\nupward pressure on rents, as additional housing supply may take time to materialize. With labor\nmarkets remaining tight, wage growth has been elevated at around or above 4 percent, still\nhigher than the pace consistent with our 2 percent inflation goal given trend productivity growth.\nIn light of these risks, and the general uncertainty regarding the economic outlook, I will\ncontinue to watch the data closely as I assess the appropriate path of monetary policy. The\nfrequency and extent of data revisions over the past few years make the task of assessing the\ncurrent state of the economy and predicting how the economy will evolve even more\n\n- 4 -\nchallenging. I will remain cautious in my approach to considering future changes in the stance\nof policy.\nIt is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course. In my view, we\nshould consider a range of possible scenarios that could unfold when considering how the\nFOMC’s monetary policy decisions may evolve. My colleagues and I will make our decisions at\neach FOMC meeting based on the incoming data and the implications for and risks to the\noutlook. While the current stance of monetary policy appears to be at a restrictive level, I remain\nwilling to raise the target range for the federal funds rate at a future meeting should the incoming\ndata indicate that progress on inflation has stalled or reversed. Restoring price stability is\nessential for achieving maximum employment over the longer run.\nRegulatory Approvals in the Banking System\nBefore turning directly to regulatory approvals in the banking system and merger and\nacquisition policy, it is important to consider these issues in the broader context. Regulatory\napprovals and bank mergers and acquisitions do not occur in a vacuum. The choices that\nregulators make on regulatory and supervisory policy issues have profound implications for\nmergers and acquisitions and for the appetite of bank management to engage in those\ntransactions. In recent months, the banking agencies have issued or finalized a large number of\nregulatory changes. These changes are shaping the future of the banking system. From bank\ncapital requirements to liquidity reform, significant revisions to the Community Reinvestment\nAct, a regulatory attack on banks charging fees for services (including debit card interchange\nfees), the trend of dialing supervision up to “11” for banks of all sizes, and the ongoing erosion\nof tailoring all shape the contours of the banking system, including bank size, the activities in\n\n- 5 -\nwhich they engage, and where activities occur within the broader financial system.2 These\npolicy decisions also create incentives and impacts that we must acknowledge and understand.\nWhen policymakers flatten and standardize regulations and supervisory expectations, we create\nstrong incentives for banks to achieve greater economies of scale through merger and make it\nharder for new banks to successfully compete with existing banks.\nActually implementing clear merger standards would reduce the number of necessary\napplication denials and withdrawals. Where clear standards exist, those seeking regulatory\napproval will only file for approval of those transactions that will meet the banking agency\nstandards. In my mind, this would be responsible and effective public policy.\nDe Novo Bank Formation\nI continue to be concerned about the decline in the number of banks in the U.S. As I\nhave noted in the past, there are several indications that there is an unmet demand for new bank\ncreation demonstrated by the ongoing preference for “charter strip” acquisitions, the ongoing\nshift of activities out of the banking system, and the rising demand for banking-as-a-service\npartnerships.3\n2 See Michelle W. Bowman (2024), “The Path Forward for Bank Capital Reform,” speech delivered at Protect Main\nStreet, sponsored by the Center for Capital Markets at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Washington, January 17,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20240117a.pdf; Michelle W.

Bowman (2023), “The Consequences of Fewer Banks in the U.S. Banking System,” speech\ndelivered at the Wharton Financial Regulation Conference, Philadelphia, April 14,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20230414a.pdf.\n\n- 6 -\nFor the past decade, de novo bank formation has been largely stagnant, even as the\nbanking industry has rapidly evolved over the same time. Many factors influence the pursuit of\nde novo bank charters, including the interest rate environment, business opportunities, the\nintense competition for qualified bank management and staff, and potentially less onerous\nalternatives for financial services to be provided outside of the regulated banking system.\nThe decision to form a de novo bank is also informed by normal business considerations,\nincluding identifying investors, establishing a viable business plan, and ensuring the ability to\nnavigate the “start-up” phase of a new bank and manage upfront operational costs, all while\nbeing subjected to intense supervisory oversight over the first several years of operation. Yet\nperhaps the most important factor that influences de novo bank formation is the regulatory and\nsupervisory framework. This includes the application process and receipt of regulatory approval.\nThis application process can be a significant obstacle to de novo bank formation.\nApplications often experience significant delays between the initial charter application filing\nwith the chartering authority and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation application for\ndeposit insurance. It often takes well in excess of a year to receive all of the required regulatory\napprovals to open for business. Of course, this uncertainty remains after the initial capital has\nbeen raised, shareholders identified, and a management team is ready to begin work. These\ndelays present unique challenges for de novo founders, including incurrence of more start-up\nexpenses, difficulty recruiting and retaining qualified management to obtain approval, and\nchallenges in raising additional start-up capital investment.\nIn my view, the absence of de novo bank formation over the long run will create a void in\nthe banking system, a void that could contribute to a decline in the availability of reliable and\n\n- 7 -\nfairly priced credit, the absence of financial services in underserved markets, and the continued\nshift of banking activities outside the banking system.\nBank Mergers and Acquisitions\nAnother pressing area of concern is the rapidly shifting approach to bank mergers and\nacquisitions (M&A) by some prudential regulators.4 M&A transactions allow banks to evolve\nand thrive in our dynamic banking system and can promote the long-term health and viability of\nbanks. M&A also ensures that banks have a meaningful path to transitioning bank ownership.\nThe absence of a viable M&A framework increases the potential for additional risks, including\nlimited opportunities for succession planning, especially in smaller or rural communities, and\nzombie banks that continue to exist but have no competitive viability or exit strategy.\nThe impact of a more restrictive M&A framework affects institutions of all sizes,\nincluding larger institutions that are vying to compete with the very largest global systemically\nimportant banks. They may choose to pursue M&A to remain competitive with larger peers who\ncan achieve growth organically through sheer scale.\nM&A is an important part of a healthy banking system. So when considering changes to\nthe framework, I think we need to first identify the problem that needs to be solved and then ask\nwhether any proposed solution is fair, transparent, and consistent with applicable statutes—and,\ncritically, whether the proposed solution has the potential to damage the long-term viability of\nthe banking system.\n4 See Jonathan Kanter (2023), “Merger Enforcement Sixty Years after Philadelphia National Bank,” speech\ndelivered at the Brookings Institution’s Center on Regulation and Markets Event “Promoting Competition in\nBanking,” Washington, June 20, https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/assistant-attorney-general-jonathan-kanter-\ndelivers-keynote-address-brookings-institution; Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (2024), “Business\nCombinations under the Bank Merger Act: Notice of Proposed Rulemaking,” OCC Bulletin 2024-4, January 29,\nhttps://occ.gov/news-issuances/bulletins/2024/bulletin-2024-4.html; and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\n(2024), “FDIC Seeks Public Comment on Proposed Revisions to Its Statement of Policy on Bank Merger\nTransactions,” press release, March 21, https://www.fdic.gov/news/press-releases/2024/pr24017.html.\n\n- 8 -\nAre there identified shortcomings in the current process or standards, and are the\nproposed reforms targeted and effective to address these shortcomings? One argument I have\nheard about the M&A regulatory approval process is that the lack of application denials\ndemonstrates that regulators are failing to meaningfully review and pressure-test proposals and\nhave effectively become a rubber stamp. I think this argument lacks a strong foundation. There\nis ample evidence that undermines this argument, including the resource demands on institutions\npursuing M&A activity and the extended time it takes to complete the regulatory review and\napproval process (and the not insignificant failure rate we see represented in withdrawn\napplications).\nWe also have to acknowledge that choosing the path of a merger or acquisition is not\nundertaken lightly. These transactions require significant upfront and ongoing investment and\ncommitment of resources. At the outset, this includes finding an appropriate acquisition target,\nconducting due diligence, and negotiating the terms of the transaction. Once a target is\nidentified, the banks must prepare appropriate regulatory filings, engage with regulators during\nthe application process, and prepare for post-approval business processes, including scheduling\nnecessary and costly systems conversions and customer transition. This is an expensive and\nreputationally risky process that bankers and their boards of directors take extremely seriously.\nOne would also expect to see different patterns emerging if regulators were truly acting\nas a rubber stamp for banking applications. We know from data published by the Federal\nReserve that filing an application does not guarantee approval, even in the absence of a\nregulatory denial. The Federal Reserve’s most recent report on banking applications activity\n\n- 9 -\nidentifies a significant portion of bank M&A transactions in which applications have been\nwithdrawn.5\nThe processing timelines we see also seem inconsistent with a process that is operating\ntruly as a rubber stamp. To be clear, I think we have room to do better when it comes to timely\nregulatory action, while maintaining a rigorous review of applications. But extended review\nperiods are not uncommon, particularly when you include preliminary discussions and pre-filings\nwith regulators in the published processing timelines.\nSome contemplated regulatory reform efforts will likely make the M&A application\nprocess slower and less efficient. One of the key risks to an effective process is a lack of timely\nregulatory action. The consequences of delays can significantly harm both the acquiring\ninstitution and the target, causing greater operational risk (including the risk of a failed merger),\nincreased expenses, reputational risk, and staff attrition in the face of prolonged uncertainty.\nReducing the efficiency of bank M&A can be a deterrent to healthy bank transactions.\nThis inefficiency limits activity that ensures the value of community banks located in\nunderserved areas, prevents institutions from pursuing prudent growth strategies, and undermines\ncompetition by preventing firms from growing to a larger scale, effectively creating a “protected\nclass” of larger institutions.\nAt the same time some federal regulatory agencies are imposing more onerous\nrequirements, credit unions have increased their acquisitions of banks.6 While this could solve\n5 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2023), Banking Applications Activity Semiannual Report,\nJanuary 1–June 30, 2023 (Washington: Board of Governors, September),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/semiannual-report-on-banking-applications-20230929.pdf. This\nreport notes that in the first half of 2023, 46 M&A applications were approved by the Federal Reserve, while 12\nsuch applications were withdrawn.\n6 See Alex Graf, Zuhaib Gull, and Gaby Villaluz (2024), “Credit Unions Dominate Early-Year Bank M&A in\nWashington State,” S&P Global, April 15; and Arizent (2024), “15 Credit Unions That Have Acquired Banks since\n2023,” American Banker, February 12.\n\n- 10 -\nsome succession planning concerns, it is not clear how these acquisitions will ultimately impact\nthe banking system going forward. Could these acquisitions reduce the availability of certain\nproducts and services? Will these institutions have the same incentives to serve all of the\nconsumers in a particular community? If there are fewer banks and more credit unions, how will\nthis data impact the competitive analysis of traditional banks merging? Historically, credit\nunions have had limited membership requirements and have not engaged in the same wide range\nof activities as banks. But in recent years, their memberships have expanded, and they are\noffering more of the same products and services that banks provide. Yet, unlike banks, credit\nunions are not required to meet the requirements of the Community Reinvestment Act or other\nlaws that apply to banks. As some prudential regulators continue to increase the regulatory\nscrutiny of bank M&A, it may increase the incentives for credit unions to acquire banks if there\nare fewer delays and more regulatory certainty related to those transactions.\nUnfortunately, the past year has shown that regulatory attention is increasingly focused\non other issues, with the timeliness of processing regulatory applications by banking regulators\nappearing to be lower on the list of priorities.\nClosing Thoughts\nThe bank regulatory reform agenda has many implications for banks of all sizes. As\nregulators continue to propose and make changes to the regulatory and supervisory processes, it\nis vital that policymakers understand the tradeoffs between the costs and benefits of what they\nare changing. It is equally important that policymakers also understand the unintended\nconsequences of their decisions. While some of the proposed changes may be designed to\naddress particular issues, they will have broader follow-on consequences. Because of these\npotentially broader consequences, we must address policy from a holistic perspective rather than\n\n- 11 -\nin a piecemeal fashion. One way to better understand the outcomes of our decisions is to hear\ndirectly from you and other stakeholders about the specific impacts—intended and unintended—\nof changes to the bank regulatory framework. Your feedback helps us to understand the real-\nworld impacts of regulatory and supervisory reforms.\nThank you, and I look forward to discussing these and other important issues with you\ntoday.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n12:30 p.m. EDT (11:30 a.m. CDT)\nSeptember 4, 2019\nIntroductory Remarks\nby\nMichelle W. Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nA Fed Listens Event\nsponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\nSt. Louis, Missouri\nSeptember 4, 2019\n\nIn keeping with the purpose of Fed Listens, I would like to spend most of our time\nin conversation, but I do want to offer a few thoughts about why the Fed is reaching out\nto seek a broad range of views, and what we are trying to achieve.\nThis kind of comprehensive outreach on monetary policy is new for the Fed. For\nmany decades, there was a sense at the Board that the public wasn’t interested or willing\nto dive into the complexities of monetary policy. That view has changed in a\nfundamental way, especially in the aftermath of the financial crisis when it was urgently\nimportant that the public understand what we were doing. So we began explaining as\naccessibly and clearly as we could what we were doing and why. Now we are listening\nbroadly as well.\nSince I became a Board member almost a year ago, it’s become clear to me that\npeople not only are willing to engage on complex economic issues, they also want to\nknow that their concerns are being taken into account on issues that affect their financial\nwell-being.\nThe movement toward greater transparency and public engagement is ongoing,\nand advancing that effort is one of my top priorities.\nAt the same time, we recognize that clear communication of our policies actually\nhelps us achieve our goals. When we communicate our views on the economic outlook\nand our expectations for where interest rates may be heading, consumers and businesses\ntake that information into account when making decisions on spending, investment, and\nhiring. For that reason, our policy communications are themselves an important part of\nthe Fed’s toolkit for influencing the direction of the economy.\n\n- 2 -\nFed Listens is a natural outcome of this commitment to public engagement. We\nwant to hear from people, from different parts of the country and different sectors of the\neconomy, about how monetary policy affects them and their communities. It is our\nresponsibility as a public institution to be accountable to the public. And, hearing a broad\nrange of perspectives on these issues will help us make good decisions as we consider\nnew approaches to monetary policy.\nThis afternoon, individual stakeholders representing different economic sectors\nwill meet to discuss their perspectives. Later, President Bullard and I will do what we\ncame here to do, which is listen. I come from a background in farming and ranching, so,\nnaturally, I am interested in hearing the St. Louis Fed’s Agriculture Industry Council’s\npriorities for the monetary policy review. And as a former community banker, I am of\ncourse interested in what your Community Depository Institution Council has to share\nwith us today.\nBut I am also eager for other perspectives, and I look forward to all of the\npresentations. I want to know, for example, how monetary policy affects rural\ncommunities, like the one I come from in Kansas, but I also want to know how it affects\nurban communities. Our monetary policy review will have implications for financial\nmarkets, but we also want to know more about what the effect will be on Main Street—\nwhich, by the way, happens to be the name of the street where my family’s bank is\nlocated, in Council Grove, Kansas. My colleagues and I are keenly aware of our\nresponsibility to focus on how the decisions we make affect the real economy for people\nin communities all across the country.\n\n- 3 -\nAnd we will continue these listening sessions for the rest of this year as we\nconsider possible changes to the Federal Reserve’s approach to monetary policy. The\ntwo goals for monetary policy—maximum employment and stable prices—are\ndetermined by the Congress and are not subject to our review. How we reach those goals\nis what is up for discussion. One question I hope to explore is whether we need new\nstrategies to more effectively achieve our goals. For many years, inflation has run\nmodestly below our 2 percent objective. Given that, it would be helpful to hear from you\nwhether you think the Federal Open Market Committee should consider strategies that\naim to have inflation exceed our target for a time, to make up for the earlier period of\ntime when it fell short. Or would that threaten the decades of success the Fed has had\nkeeping the public’s expectations for inflation low and stable?\nA related question concerns the Fed’s existing toolkit for monetary policy.\nCurrently, our policy levers include setting interest rates, adjusting the size and\ncomposition of our balance sheet, and communicating the expected future path of policy.\nAre there other tools we should consider to help us reach and sustain our objectives more\neffectively? I also want to know how the Federal Open Market Committee’s\ncommunication of its policy framework to the public might be improved. How can we\nhelp you better understand our work so you can hold us accountable?\nYour perspectives on questions like these are a vital part of this monetary policy\nreview, so I want to thank you, again, for your time and your contribution.

    "text": "For release on delivery\n2:20 p.m. EDT (1:20 p.m. CDT)\nAugust 17, 2022\nWorking Women in the Pandemic Era\nRemarks by\nMichelle W. Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nArkansas Women’s Commission Meeting\nRussellville, Arkansas\nAugust 17, 2022\n\nIt’s a pleasure to be with you today to talk about a subject that I experience\ndirectly—women’s labor force participation.1 I come to this issue with a similar\nperspective to this Commission, being from a heavily rural state and a small farming and\nranching community deep in the Flint Hills of Kansas. But I also have roots here in\nArkansas, my husband’s family is from Hardy, and my father’s mother was from Little\nRock. It’s really nice to be back in an area where I spent a lot of time growing up.\nMy husband and I returned home to Kansas with our two children under three in\nlate 2009, just as the impacts of the last financial crisis were making their way to rural\nareas. At the time, I was a community banker, which means I was also a very active\nmember of the community. As I am sure many of you did then, I saw firsthand the\neconomic impacts of the recession and the increased drug and opioid use that devastated\nmany rural communities across the Midwest.\nAt that time, many in the community received benefits from well-intended\nprograms created to provide assistance, which often made it very difficult for small\nemployers to find employees. This was often because, as I learned when trying to hire\nemployees at our local chamber of commerce, the benefit from taking a job was much\nless than the benefit one could receive from the government at that time while not\nworking. This is one major similarity between the current experience and the last\nrecession, except that in this episode, the benefits many received were far in excess of\nwhat they could earn from working. So much so that the benefits provided to a large\nnumber of Americans resulted in a significant increase in savings, which is only recently\n1 These remarks reflect my views and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of Governors\nand the Federal Open Market Committee. I am grateful to Federal Reserve staff members Nick Carollo,\nWendy Dunn, Charles Fleischman and Stacey Tevlin for their assistance in preparing this text.\n\n- 2 -\nbeginning to decline and likely leading many who had not yet decided to re-enter the\nworkforce to find work. These labor supply problems, as I will explain, are a large part\nof women’s experience in the workforce since the pandemic, and the lesson from this and\nother recessions is that policymakers need to carefully weigh all of the consequences of\ntheir decisions.\nIt is fair to say that the majority of the economic conditions we are experiencing\ntoday, like inflation, are different from those of the last financial crisis. But as I just\nnoted, there are some similarities in the impacts on the labor force.\nTurning to the subject of my remarks today, I will discuss the role of women in\nthe U.S. economy, focusing on the period since the onset of COVID-19.2 You may\nalready know that women suffered disproportionately more job losses than men during\nthe pandemic. This was the opposite of what happened in past recessions, when men lost\njobs at a higher rate than women. The difference this time has led some to call the 2020\ndownturn a “she-cession.” Most of the differences between how men and women fared\nin the labor market during that time had reversed by 2021, but their different experiences\nhighlight how participation by men and women can sometimes be driven by different\nforces.\nThe backdrop for recent events is the long history, starting after World War II, of\nwomen gradually entering the labor market. Of course, women have always significantly\ncontributed to and played a large role in the U.S. economy, but initially in ways that don’t\nshow up in most government statistics. The rise of industrialization and the shift away\nfrom an agrarian economy provided opportunities for men to work outside the home and\n2These remarks reflect my own views and not necessarily those of the Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 3 -\nwomen took on more responsibility for cooking, sewing, child-rearing and other domestic\ntasks.3 We heard an echo of that history during the pandemic, because when schools\nclosed and other childcare was disrupted, women assumed the majority of those\ncaregiving responsibilities, which led many to quit their jobs and drop out of the labor\nforce. This magnified the effect by eliminating jobs in childcare resulting in even more\nunemployment. But that wasn’t the only reason why women were impacted during this\nepisode.\nLet me start with the big picture on the differences between men and women in\nthe labor market. Before 1950, few women worked outside the home and the majority of\nthose who did were unmarried. From 1950 to 1970, more women entered the workforce,\nbut many did not plan to work for the long term, and their investment in education and\ntraining was often limited.4 By the mid-1970s, barriers that limited opportunities for\nwomen in many workplaces began to fall, and by 1990 the education gap between men\nand women narrowed significantly. Women’s participation steadily increased from there\nuntil the gains leveled off in the 1990s, but then rose again from 2015 to 2020, just before\nthe pandemic. The narrowing of educational attainment for men and women had a lot to\ndo with the narrowing of participation rates over the decades, and today women are more\nlikely than men to hold a bachelor’s degree. Even so, before the pandemic, overall\nparticipation remained lower for women than men regardless of education level.\n3 See Claudia Golden (2021), Career & Family: Women’s Century-Long Journey Toward Equity\n(Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press).\n4 See Claudia Goldin (2006), “The Quiet Revolution that Transformed Women’s Employment, Education,\nand Family,” American Economic Review, vol. 96 (2), pp. 1–21.\n\n- 4 -\nThe response to the COVID-19 pandemic caused the most abrupt decline in\nemployment in the history of this nation.5 The lockdowns and other government\nrestrictions on businesses severely limited work, education, and travel. In February 2020,\nover 60 percent of working-age people had a job or were looking for work, but by April it\nwas closer to half that amount. The pandemic hit all sectors of the economy, but the toll\nwas especially heavy on in-person, close-contact service industries—restaurants, hotels,\nairline travel, and retail businesses other than big box stores, grocery stores and\npharmacies. These in-person service-industry jobs were considered more conducive to\nspreading COVID-19, they were more affected by government-mandated shutdowns and\nsocial distancing, and teleworking was generally not possible.\nUnlike any previous recession, the downturn in employment fell more heavily on\nwomen than men. The unemployment rates for men and women were essentially the\nsame before the pandemic but ended up much higher for women.6 That was very\ndifferent from past recessions. For example, after the recession following the housing\ncrisis, unemployment for prime working age men rose to 11 percent, compared to only 9\npercent for prime age women.7\nThe women’s labor force participation rate is another way to measure their\npresence in the workforce. Women have made significant progress in closing the gap\nwith men since the 1960s, including in the five years before the pandemic, but that gap\n5 In just two months, the unemployment rate rose from 3.5 percent to 14.7 percent. While unemployment\nwas higher during the Great Depression of the 1930s, it never rose this quickly.\n6 Unemployment rose to 16.1 percent for women but only 13.5 percent for men in April 2020.\n7 The U.S. Department of Labor define prime age workers as those 25-54.\n\n- 5 -\nreopened after the onset of COVID-19.8 The number of both prime working age men and\nwomen in the labor force plunged, but the drop was half a million larger for women.\nFrom what we know now, there appear to be two main reasons why the pandemic\ndownturn affected women more than men. First, even after the dramatic employment\ngains over the past 50 years, women are still most often the primary caregivers to\nchildren and other family members. They shouldered most of the childcare burden from\nthe COVID school closures. Second, a higher proportion of women worked in and\ncontinue to be employed in positions in the high-contact service sectors that were hit\nhardest by the pandemic.\nCaregiving burdens in the United States have always fallen more heavily on\nwomen. In the 20 years before the pandemic, roughly one-fourth of prime-age women\nwith children didn’t participate in the workforce. An even larger share of women with\nchildren under five were primarily engaged in childcare. Many women with children\ntend to cycle in and out of employment based on their family’s childcare demands.\nWomen are significantly affected by the summer childcare burdens of families with\nchildren. Each year between May and July, when schools close for the summer, the\nemployment-to-population ratio for prime age women declines by more than a percentage\npoint and then rebounds when schools reopen in the fall. That difference is one-third of\nthe total drop that prime-age women experienced following a very bad recession, the one\nfollowing the housing crisis.9\n8 Part of the reason women closed the participation gap with prime working age men after 1965 is that\nparticipation by this cohort of men gradually declined. Major reasons for this decline in prime age male\nparticipation likely were increasing trade, globalization, and technological changes that reduced the number\nof manufacturing jobs, which were held primarily by men.\n9 See Brendan Price and Melanie Wasserman (2022), “The Summer Drop in Female Employment,” CESifo\nWorking Paper 9783 (Munich: CESifo, June), https://www.cesifo.org/DocDL/cesifo1_wp9783.pdf.\n\n- 6 -\nToday, working women still carry out most childcare responsibilities. One study\nconducted before the pandemic found that when both parents work, women spend\n50 percent more time on childcare than men.10 And when the pandemic closed many\nschools, it was largely women who stayed home. Women with children saw their labor\nforce participation rate and employment-to-population ratio fall more than for women\nwithout children, while men were much less affected regardless of whether they had\nchildren. According to one Federal Reserve study, increased caregiving burdens for\nmothers with school aged children accounted for about three-fourths of the decline in\nwomen in the labor force from February 2020 to August 2021 but only about one-third of\nthe decline for fathers.11 Even after most children returned to in-person schooling,\ncaregiving continues to weigh on female participation in the labor force, likely because of\nincreased care for elderly or ill family members.12\nThe other major factor affecting women during the pandemic was the larger\nnumber of female employees in high-contact service-sector jobs, where demand dropped\nsharply during the pandemic and the government-imposed restrictions in response to\nCOVID-19.\nDuring past recessions, women experienced fewer job losses because service-\nsector jobs were more stable in downturns. Historically, goods-producing industries were\nharder hit, and men, who tended to hold these roles, were more likely to lose their jobs.13\nBut during the pandemic, it was service jobs that were more likely to be lost. Before the\n10 https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/10/01/women-more-than-men-adjust-their-careers-for-\nfamily-life/\n11 Montes, Joshua, Christopher Smith and Isabel Leigh. 2021. “Caregiving for Children and Parental Labor\nForce Participation during the Pandemic.” FEDS Notes, Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System.\n12 Montes, Smith and Leigh (2021.)\n13 Albanese and Sahin (2018)\n\n- 7 -\npandemic, more than 75 percent of these workers were women. Between February and\nApril 2020, service sector employment fell 40 percent. Job losses in other industries with\ngreater proportions of male workers, like manufacturing, were much smaller. We have\nalso seen recovery in service-sector jobs lag behind other sectors. Employment in\nindustries that tend to have larger shares of female workers, such as leisure and\nhospitality, education, and health services, is still below pre-pandemic levels. The losses\nfor women are even larger when considering how fast these industries were growing\nbefore the pandemic.\nThe shift to remote work may have been a mitigating factor for employment for\nwomen without college degrees. Overall, workers without college degrees were hit\nparticularly hard by the pandemic recession because remote work was much more\ncommon for those with a degree. 14 However, women without degrees were affected less\nthan men, probably because the jobs they held were more likely to be able to be\nperformed remotely than those of men without college degrees.15\nWe have seen a substantial recovery in the labor market for both genders since the\nworst of the pandemic. By the end of 2020, unemployment rates had equalized, and the\ngap between gender participation rates had returned to pre-pandemic levels in 2021.\nHowever, because that gap had been narrowing in the five years prior to the onset of\nCOVID, we can assume that the participation gap would have continued to decrease over\nthat time.\n14 Around 62 percent of college education workers worked remotely in May 2020. See Claudia Goldin\n(2022), “Understanding the Economic Impact of COVID-19 on Women.” Brookings Papers on Economic\nActivity, Spring, https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/SP22_BPEA_Goldin_conf-\ndraft.pdf.\n15 25 percent of non-college women worked remotely at that time, compared with 14 percent of non-college\nmen. Goldin (2022)\n\n- 8 -\nSo, based on what we know about the history and recent experience of women in\nthe labor market, what does the future hold for working women?\nOn the demand side, the labor market continues to be strong and there are\nabundant job opportunities for workers of all education and skill levels. With about four\nmillion fewer people participating in the workforce today, there are still plenty of jobs\navailable even if we see the number of job openings reduced. We are also seeing a larger\nnumber of women graduating from college than men, a development that is likely to help\ninsulate women from job losses in future recessions.\nOne complication is that the future of labor supply is uncertain, and it is difficult\nto predict how labor force participation will evolve. Factors like generational aging were\nalready weighing on labor supply before the pandemic, and we saw millions of workers\naccelerate retirement during the pandemic, effectively retiring early. Even the strong\nlabor market has not yet lured many of these early retirees back, and some believe that as\ntime passes it becomes less likely that they will return. Over time, those who chose to\nleave the workforce early will move into a normal retirement age. We really don’t know\nif gender will be a factor here as this is the first generation to retire that had large\nnumbers of women in the workforce, but workforce aging is an important consideration\nwhen it comes to labor supply. We also don’t know how the influence of inflation will\naffect decision making about returning to the workforce, but some may feel compelled to\nreturn to work.\nAnother consideration is caregiving demands and how those responsibilities will\nbe shared within households. While I hope that we never see a public health emergency\nlike the one we’ve just been through, I hope that if we do, we can avoid the governmental\n\n- 9 -\ndecisions to intentionally disrupt foundational education and the unnecessary forced\nisolation of children. These policies have left a significant impact on this generation of\nchildren, on families and their decision making about many things including participation\nin the labor force.\nOne ongoing labor supply issue relates to the lingering effects of COVID that can\ninterfere with the ability to work or impose additional caregiving needs for family\nmembers. By one account, nearly a fifth of adults who contracted COVID reported\nongoing symptoms of “long COVID,” affecting significantly more women than men. At\nthe same time, the number of working-age people with disabilities has increased\nsignificantly. While the number of Americans reporting a disability had been rising\ngradually over the past decade, the increase picked up in mid-2020, and about 2 million\nmore people reported they had a disability in July 2022 than at the outset of the\npandemic.16\nDisability has been a major drag on the work force in rural areas in the past.\nLiving in rural Kansas following the last recession, as I mentioned earlier, I am very\nfamiliar with the challenges that disability presents for many aspects of the community—\nbeyond just economic conditions. Disability is also a significant challenge in Arkansas.\nWomen’s labor force attachment in Arkansas is below the national average. In the five\nyears before the pandemic, about 72 percent of prime-age women here were either\nworking or looking for work, compared with 75 percent nationally. This difference in\n16 See U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (2022), “Population—With a Disability, 16 Years and Over,”\nretrieved from FRED, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, August 5,\nhttps://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNU00074597.\n\n- 10 -\nlabor force participation is primarily explained by illness or disability and existed long\nbefore the onset of COVID.\nThere is no magic wand that will draw workers back into the labor force,\nespecially when generous government benefits programs are provided for those who are\ncapable of working. But as challenging as these issues are to address, there are some\nlessons to draw from experience and research regarding approaches that encourage\npeople to work. Research suggests that assistance programs including job search\nassistance, training programs, and private-sector employment subsidies increase the\nlikelihood of employment by up to 10 percent for those who utilize the programs.17 The\nbenefits of this assistance are not always immediately realized, but women were more\nlikely to benefit from job training and private-sector employment programs.\nIn conclusion, although we still have about 4 million people out of the pre-\npandemic workforce, we continue to see strong employment gains and low\nunemployment rates—the kind of labor market that historically has pulled in more\nworkers. As the service sector continues to recover and as schools and childcare\nestablishments open more fully, I see potential for greater employment opportunities for\nwomen in the future. Obviously, economic conditions will influence job opportunities\ngoing forward. Today’s high inflation and strong employment will likely create some\npressure on labor and employment.\n17 See David Card, Jochen Kluve, and Andrea Weber (2018), “What Works?

    "text": "For release on delivery\n9:15 a.m. EDT\nNovember 17, 2022\nFinancial Education\nRemarks by\nMichelle W. Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nFinancial Literacy and Education Commission Public Meeting\nFinancial Literacy and Education Commission\nWashington, DC\n(via webcast)\nNovember 17, 2022\n\nGood morning. It is a pleasure to join today’s meeting, I appreciate the invitation\nfrom the Financial Literacy and Education Commission (FLEC) to speak to this\nimportant intergovernmental body on these critical issues. I especially appreciate that I\nam able to participate virtually this morning. The FLEC’s efforts to coordinate and\nelevate the agencies work to advance financial education is critical in furthering progress\ntoward the goal of broad-based financial literacy.\nProviding consumers with the necessary tools and information to help them make\nsound financial decisions enhances economic well-being for everyone. The Federal\nReserve ensures that our work contributes to this overarching goal—bringing together the\nefforts of the Board of Governors and the Reserve Banks to enhance the relationship\nbetween economic well-being, financial education and access to the financial system.\nAccess to financial education provides the foundation for the success of this work\nand helps to further the Fed’s broader goal of promoting a healthy economy.\nConsumers make better informed decisions when they understand the\nconsequences of their financial decisions. Better decisions lead to more opportunity to\nbuild financial capacity that establishes credit, leading to savings and other wealth-\nbuilding activities.\nFinancial education provides consumers with critical skills that enable them to\nevaluate options and make sound decisions. In today’s challenging economic\nenvironment, the Federal Reserve is helping to build a broad understanding of\nfundamental economic principles. We have undertaken a variety of efforts to strengthen\nresources for teachers and communities including our federalreserveeducation.org\nwebsite which provides teachers with online resources about personal finance and\n\n- 2 -\neconomics, for all students from kindergarten to college. Other programs, like the\nPhiladelphia Fed’s Keys to Financial Success curriculum and the St. Louis Fed’s\neconomic education guides and videos, support students through knowledge and skills\ndevelopment to understand how economics impacts their day-to-day lives.1\nWe all know that the financial services marketplace is vast and that it evolves\nvery quickly, offering consumers a wide and growing range of choices among financial\nproducts and providers. As a result, it is important that small businesses and consumers\nare prepared with information and resources to guide their personal financial decisions.\nThe benefits are potentially limitless when consumers understand how their financial\nchoices affect their current and future financial security.\nIn addition to broad-based outreach, I would also like to emphasize the\nopportunity that financial education provides to advance our shared goal of financial\ninclusion. Today, I will discuss three important aspects of the Fed’s inclusion efforts that\nhelps to inform policies and practices designed to advance financial access and\ncapability: Access to a banking account; the availability of responsible small-dollar\nlending products for short term financial needs; and expanded reach of financial\ninitiatives to Indigenous and native communities to more effectively assist in providing\naccess to the broader financial economy.\nWe have made significant progress in providing greater access to bring the\nunbanked into the insured depository space. Our research gives us insight into the\n1 See “Keys to Financial Success—Lessons and Curricula,” Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia,\nhttps://www.philadelphiafed.org/education/keys-to-financial-success-lessons-and-curricula\nand “Resources for Teachers and Students in Economics and Personal Finance,” Federal Reserve Bank of\nSt. Louis, https://www.stlouisfed.org/education.\n\n- 3 -\nsuccess of recent efforts to expand access among unbanked populations. For example,\nthe Federal Reserve’s Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking (SHED)\nshowed in 2021 that 94 percent of adults have a bank or credit union account, and the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s 2021 National Survey of Unbanked and\nUnderbanked Households found that 95.5 percent of all U.S. households were banked,\nwhich is the highest level since the survey began in 2009. 2\nThe Fed’s Survey of Consumer Finances shows similar results. From 1989 to\n2019, the percentage of U.S. adults with bank accounts rose from 85.6 to 94.5 percent.\nThis is also true in the increased number of bank accounts owned by members of\nminority groups over the same time period, especially for Black and Hispanic consumers.\nBlack adults increased bank account ownership from 56.7 to 86.8 percent and Hispanics\nincreased from 63.5 to 89.5 percent.\nThough these surveys show significant improvement over the past decades, there\nis still further progress to make. In fact, our SHED survey data helps to identify\ncharacteristics of those who may choose not to use a deposit account or do not have\naccess to one. The most recent survey results show that income and education may also\nplay a factor—among the respondents, 24 percent of adults who have not earned a high\nschool diploma and 17 percent of adults making less than $25,000 a year did not own a\ndeposit account.\n2 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households in\n2021,” https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/2021-report-economic-well-being-us-households-\n202205.pdf and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, “2021 FDIC National Survey of Unbanked and\nUnderbanked Households,” https://www.fdic.gov/analysis/household-survey/2021report.pdf.\n\n- 4 -\nWe also know that there are many factors that may lead consumers to choose not\nto engage in the banking system, whether from a distrust of the banking system or prior\nmishandling of a banking relationship being an impediment to account ownership.\nThese broader gains in the number of consumers with bank accounts are an\nimportant measure of our collective success, particularly in an environment where\nconsumers can access an ever-growing range of financial services. While there are a\nmultitude of nonbank products and providers, none provide the reliability and protection\nof FDIC insurance for deposits. Bank accounts continue to be the safest and most\nreliable way to deposit and keep money and engage in a variety of transactions. These\naffordable, government insured banking relationships can help consumers and businesses\nmanage their money—to save or spend as desired—and develop financial management\nskills through savings and payments. In addition, having a banking relationship may\nassist consumers borrowing money to invest in education, a home, vehicle or a business.\nThe Federal Reserve continues to support expanding access to bank accounts\nthrough the Bank On program, which provides those without a banking relationship\naccess to low- or no-cost deposit accounts. The St. Louis Fed’s Bank On Data Hub\nreports national data for all banks that offer these Bank On program accounts. In 2022,\nmore than 200 banks offered certified Bank On accounts. These accounts are now\navailable at more than 46,000 U.S. bank and credit union branches.\nLike affordable banking services, responsible small-dollar lending products can\nplay an important role in financial inclusion by helping meet immediate credit needs from\nemergency or unexpected expenses, temporary cash flow disruptions, or unplanned\nincome shortfalls. Small-dollar loans are often a critical source of funding when\n\n- 5 -\neconomic stress occurs. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve and other\nagencies issued updated principles for banks to consider when offering responsible small-\ndollar loans. Successful programs incorporate repayment safeguards and seek to provide\noutcomes that enhance borrowers’ financial capabilities. As loan markets continue to\nevolve, well-designed small-dollar loan products remain an important resource for\nconsumers, helping to encourage positive credit practices and transition into additional\nfinancial products.\nI will conclude with a key element of the Federal Reserve’s community\nengagement to broaden access to financial services so that more Americans can\nparticipate in the broader economy. Financial inclusion for all, including underserved\ncommunities, like Indigenous groups, is important for the economic strength of our\ncountry. Our efforts across multiple Federal Reserve System functions work to advance\nthis goal. The Federal Reserve Board’s Community Advisory Council offers diverse\nperspectives on economic circumstances and financial services needs of a range of\nconsumers and communities, with a particular focus on low- and moderate-income\npopulations. The Community Advisory Council has benefited from having\nrepresentation from the Native American Indian community serving on the council and\nupdating the members on current challenges and opportunities facing these communities.\nIn addition, in 2021, the Federal Reserve joined the Central Bank Network for Indigenous\nInclusion, which fosters ongoing dialogue and research to enhance the participation of\nIndigenous populations in the economy.\nOur efforts in this area emphasize the importance of education. In fact, the St.\nLouis Fed’s Native Economic and Financial Education Empowerment program has\n\n- 6 -\nprovided economic and personal finance education for Native communities and\norganizations throughout the country since 2018.3\nRecent research shows promising trends in access to bank accounts for Native\nAmerican Alaskan and Indian communities, with over 93 percent of these households\nnow holding a bank account, which is nearly a 10-percentage point increase from 2019. I\nam very pleased to see that these efforts and our commitment to bringing access to\nfinancial services to Indigenous communities have been beneficial.\nThank you for the invitation to speak to you today. I appreciate the opportunity to\nhighlight the Federal Reserve’s contributions to FLEC’s mission of financial\nempowerment and I look forward to the insights from today’s meeting.\nNote: A previous version of this speech incorrectly attributed statistics in paragraph 9 to\nthe Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking (SHED). On November 17,\n2022, this paragraph was updated to correctly attribute these numbers to the Survey of\nConsumer Finances.\n3 See “Native Economic and Financial Education Empowerment (NEFEE),” Federal Reserve Bank of St.\nLouis, https://www.stlouisfed.org/education/native-economic-and-financial-education-empowerment.",

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Exploring Conventional Bank Funding Regimes in an Unconventional World”\nA Research Conference Co-Sponsored by the Federal Reserve Banks of Dallas and Atlanta\nDallas, Texas\nJuly 18, 2024\n\nEarlier this year, we passed the one-year anniversary of the failures of Silicon Valley\nBank (SVB) and Signature Bank. The failure of these banks, and the subsequent failure of First\nRepublic Bank, prompted a discussion of the regulatory framework. These failures have also\nfrequently been cited as the basis for a number of matters on the current regulatory reform\nagenda. Over time, this agenda has expanded to include bank capital regulation, the role of\nsupervision, the potential vulnerabilities to the banking system created by bank-fintech\npartnerships, and bank liquidity and funding, among other topics.1\nThis conference covers a number of important issues that touch on many aspects of this\nregulatory reform agenda. Earlier today, panelists discussed the 2023 regional banking stress,\nthe history of financial crises, and deposit insurance reform. Tomorrow we will hear about the\ndiscount window and a discussion on the future of contingent liquidity. A further panel will\nconsider what may be next in terms of regulatory reforms.\nIn considering this last topic, conferences like this serve an important role—encouraging\nus to pause and reflect upon these efforts, and providing an opportunity to share thoughts in full\npublic view about what is working and not working within the bank regulatory framework.\nThese discussions also allow us to consider a range of options to both enhance banking system\nresiliency and to better prepare for future stress in the system. I am especially pleased that we\nhave an opportunity to publicly confront difficult questions, like probing the link between last\nyear’s banking stress and elements of the reform agenda purportedly aimed at addressing\nidentified deficiencies.\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nAs we think about reform of the bank regulatory framework, including changes designed\nto maintain a robust and responsive approach, what are the principles that should guide our\nthinking? What lessons should we take from past financial crises in terms of the causality and\nrelated bank management and supervisory lessons learned? Were those reforms responsive,\nsuccessful, and durable over time? When we consider the Federal Reserve’s operational\ninfrastructure, including Fedwire® and discount window lending, were its tools effective and\ncomplementary to other funding sources (including Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) funding)\nduring times of stress, and if not, how could they be improved?\nMy hope is that in discussing these issues we can develop a better and deeper\nunderstanding about sources of bank funding, financial stability, and the future of the banking\nsystem. This complex set of issues can be open to interpretation, and as a result, can lead\npolicymakers to different policy prescriptions for how to make the banking system more\nresilient, and the regulatory response to financial stress more effective.\nConversations like those that we are having today and tomorrow can help us find\nconsensus both in identifying the risks to the financial system and coming to agreement on\npolicy reforms to address them, if needed. As the discussions continue following this\nconference, it is essential that we include the experience and perspective of state bank\ncommissioners. I look forward to the opportunity to engage with them more fully on these\nissues. As a former bank commissioner, I greatly value this perspective.\nI am hopeful that all of these conversations can help us to understand differing\nperspectives and enable us to examine the full extent of the underlying issues before we\nimplement reforms that do not address identified problems or do not adequately consider the\nunderlying risks and unintended consequences.\n\n- 3 -\nWhen I think about regulatory reform and the future of the banking system, I begin with\nthe foundational elements that promote accountability in banking regulation: a deep\nunderstanding of the banking system; a thorough analysis of the underlying facts; a careful\nidentification of how elements of the banking system interact and perform over time, especially\nduring stress; and a commitment to take ownership of identified problems with targeted reforms\nthat are commensurate with the underlying risks.\nThese same elements should be the foundational elements of any reform agenda. They\nshould apply not just to changes that I will call “responsive” changes—those designed to\nmitigate the risks exposed during the spring 2023 banking stress—but also to any other\ncontemplated reforms of the bank regulatory framework. If we approach this task with humility\nand with full accountability of unintended consequences, I expect that we will find opportunities\nin a number of areas. These involve not only imposing new requirements and expectations on\nindividual banks, but also opportunities to remediate deficiencies and overlapping requirements\nwithin the regulatory framework. Both approaches may be equally effective in enhancing the\nresilience of the banking system and promoting U.S. financial stability.\nIn my remarks this evening, I will reflect on these elements, as I share my views on the\nFed’s lender of last resort function, payments infrastructure, supervision, and regulation.\nLender of Last Resort and Payments Infrastructure\nAs part of the reform agenda, we must consider how to operationally enhance and\noptimize tools like the discount window to meet banking system liquidity needs more effectively.\nThis must include ensuring the payments infrastructure that supports bank funding mechanisms\nis equipped to operate not just during business-as-usual conditions, but especially during stress\nevents. Last year’s banking stress clearly demonstrated the need for reforms and updates, but\n\n- 4 -\nthese issues existed long before the bank failures. Some banks encountered frictions in using the\ndiscount window that made it less effective, and these frictions potentially exacerbated the stress\nthat some institutions experienced. Limits on the availability of payments services, including\nFedwire, may also have interfered with the ability to effectively manage bank liquidity. These\nissues require a careful and impartial review to understand the facts, particularly if we base\nreform efforts on the recent events.\nAddressing operational readiness\nMaintenance of existing infrastructure is an often overlooked and sometimes thankless\njob. When the payments infrastructure works “well enough,” as it seemed to do in the lead-up to\nthe spring banking stress, it is easy to take for granted that it will work during times of stress.\nHowever, this is an area where we must become more vigilant and avoid complacency.\nWe know that SVB experienced difficulties in accessing discount window loans before\nits failure. Certainly, there are ways in which the Fed can enhance the technology, the\noperational readiness, and the services underpinning discount window loans and payment\nservices to ensure that they are available when needed. On this front, I would note that the\nFederal Reserve recently published a proposal to expand the operating hours of the Fedwire\nFunds Service and the National Settlement Service (NSS), to operate 22 hours per day, 7 days\nper week, on a year-round basis.2 The proposal also requested feedback on whether the discount\nwindow should operate during these same expanded hours. The comment period remains open\n2 Federal Reserve System, Request for Comment, “Expansion of Fedwire® Funds Service and National Settlement\nService Operating Hours,” 89 Fed. Reg. 39,613 (May 9, 2024).\n\n- 5 -\non this proposal, but this seems like it would be a critical improvement, and one that would be\nresponsive to identified shortcomings.3\nOther changes are also needed to bring payment services and discount window lending\ninto the 21st century, including modernizing the technology banks use to request loans\nelectronically rather than relying upon a person to answer a telephone call, ensuring that\ncollateral can move freely from the bank or FHLB to the Reserve Bank when needed, and\nidentifying and reducing other areas of friction that banks experience in the use of the discount\nwindow. Operational improvements—including technology enhancements and investments—\nand improving operational readiness within the Federal Reserve System, should underpin any\napproach to improvements.\nBank liquidity sources\nA critical component of the current reform agenda focuses on the ongoing evolution of\nbank funding and liquidity sources and mechanisms. Of course, any discussion about the\ndiscount window would be incomplete without considering these sources and mechanisms. The\ndiscount window is a critical tool, but it does not operate in isolation. It is also intended to be a\nsource of liquidity as a last resort and at a penalty rate, not as a primary funding resource in the\nnormal course of business at a market rate.\nWhile discount window lending can support bank liquidity, it is best thought of as an\nadditional resource in the federal safety net that allows eligible institutions to weather disruptions\nin liquidity markets and access other resources. Banks have a range of options to manage\nliquidity needs during business-as-usual operations and during times of stress, including repo\n3 The comment period on this proposal has been extended until September 6, 2024. Federal Reserve System,\nRequest for comment; extension of comment period, “Expanded Hours for Fedwire® Funds Service and National\nSettlement Service” (June 21, 2024),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/bcreg20240621b1.pdf.\n\n- 6 -\nmarkets and FHLB advances. Within this framework, the discount window operates as a backup\nliquidity authority, a “last resort” for funding needs. In evaluating the bank liquidity framework,\nit is imperative that we consider and understand the interrelationships among these resources,\nliquidity requirements and regulations, and bank liquidity planning.4\nThese resources are complementary, so they must be thought about holistically when\ndiscussing and seriously considering changes to requirements. Yet, discussions about reforms\nare often approached in a piecemeal way.\nSome policymakers have stated that a potential response to the 2023 banking stress\nwould be to require banks to preposition collateral at the Fed’s discount window. The notion is\nthat by forcing banks to preposition collateral in this way, banks will have a ready pool of\nliquidity to draw from during times of stress. This compulsory requirement to preposition\ncollateral, it is argued, could also mitigate some of the stigma associated with using the discount\nwindow, and thereby improve its effectiveness.\nSo, we must also ask if the perceived stigma of taking loans from the discount window\nwill be mitigated by requirements to preposition collateral. If the stigma of receiving a discount\nwindow loan continues to impede the effectiveness of the Fed serving as a lender of last resort,\nwe must consider other ways to address these stigma concerns. There is no reason for a bank to\ntake a loan at a penalty rate or preposition collateral during periods of calm if the discount\nwindow operates effectively and communicates with banks on a regular basis. If the issue is that\nthe window does not operate in an effective manner, requirements to use it will not succeed.\nInvestments must be made to address its operational shortcomings.\n4 Michelle W. Bowman, “Bank Liquidity, Regulation, and the Fed’s Role as Lender of Last Resort” (speech at The\nRoundtable on the Lender of Last Resort: The 2023 Banking Crisis and COVID, sponsored by the Committee on\nCapital Markets Regulation, Washington, D.C., April 3, 2024),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240403a.htm.\n\n- 7 -\nSome reforms, like encouraging bank readiness to borrow from the discount window if\nthat is part of their contingency funding plans, could be explored more thoroughly. If a bank\nincludes the discount window in these plans and intends to use it during stress, the bank should\nbe prepared to do so. But if we are honest, we recognize that our prior efforts to reduce discount\nwindow stigma, as during the COVID period, have not been durable or successful.\nThere are a number of reasons a bank could choose to borrow from the discount window,\nincluding market disruptions in liquidity access or a scarcity in the total amount of reserves in the\nbanking system and a specific borrower’s growing financial stress. To access primary discount\nwindow credit, a borrower must meet financial standards for borrowing. In some ways, these\nfinancial requirements to access primary credit suggest that an important “market signal” of\ndiscount window borrowing is related to a market liquidity disruption and may be less of a signal\nabout any individual institution’s financial condition. But discount window lending is an\nadditional data point for the market and may be read as a sign of financial distress. This possible\ninterpretation alone may be enough to deter usage of the discount window.\nAs we consider the future of the discount window, we should explore ways to validate the\nuse of discount window lending in our regulatory framework. For example, are there ways to\nbetter recognize discount window borrowing capacity in our assessment of a firm’s liquidity\nresources, for example in calculating a firm’s compliance with the Liquidity Coverage Ratio?\nAs the resources available for bank funding continue to evolve, including the Federal\nHousing Finance Administration’s (FHFA) active consideration of reforms to FHLB lending\nstandards, we see direct impacts on access to liquidity. Even though the comment period for\nthese changes just concluded on July 15, these significant shifts are already affecting how FHLB\nmembers will need to plan to use FHLB advances for liquidity funding.\n\n- 8 -\nMaking regulatory changes to liquidity requirements while the FHFA is shifting FHLB\nfunding prioritization for its members leads to several questions that would need to be answered\nbefore engaging in prudent policy-making.5 How would required collateral prepositioning at the\ndiscount window affect the availability or amount of FHLB advances that a bank can rely on for\nfunding purposes? More broadly speaking, how will any requirement to preposition collateral at\nthe discount window affect the availability and use of other funding resources or the day-to-day\nliquidity management practices of banks? A better approach would be to recognize and\nunderstand how the FHLBs support bank liquidity and work together with each FHLB through\nthe Reserve Banks in advance of a bank stress to ensure that mechanisms are in place to facilitate\nthe transfer of collateral to the discount window, and that the Reserve Banks have the appropriate\nseniority over such collateral. A practical and pragmatic approach will work to preserve the\nstability of the banking system much more effectively than disrupting the bank liquidity\noperations of the FHLB system that have been in place since the 1930s.\nWhen it comes to the next steps in liquidity reform, I think it is imperative that we tackle\nknown and identified issues that were exposed during the banking stress in the spring of 2023.\nThis must include updating discount window operations and technology and making sure that\npayment services are available when needed. But for other reforms, a number of important\nquestions remain unanswered, including understanding both where there are frictions and\nweaknesses in the current bank funding landscape, and what the potential impact (including\nintended and unintended consequences) of these reforms on the banking industry could be.\n5 The Federal Housing Finance Administration (FHFA) published a request for input on the core mission activities\nand mission achievement of the FHLBs. As noted in the request, the FHFA had previously found in the FHLBank\nSystem at 100: Focusing on the Future report that FHLBs should increase their support for housing and community\ndevelopment. See FHFA, “Request for Input: Federal Home Loan Bank Core Mission Activities and Mission\nAchievement” (May 16, 2024), https://www.fhfa.gov/sites/default/files/2024-05/FHLBank-Mission-RFI-2024.pdf.\nThe comment period on this request for information closed on July 15, 2024.\n\n- 9 -\nReform of Supervision\nBanking regulators play a vital role in promoting the safe and sound operation of\nindividual banks and the stability of the U.S. financial system. These statutory responsibilities\nrequire banking regulators to ensure that banks are held to high standards: bank regulators\nenforce regulation to promote safety and soundness, engage in periodic examinations of banks\nand their holding companies, and require periodic reporting by regulated institutions. When a\nbank fails to meet these high standards, supervisory action can be taken to force remediation or,\nin some cases, impose an enforcement action that includes a civil money penalty.\nLast year’s banking stress highlighted the need for improvements in bank supervision,\nwith several notable failures to identify and appropriately escalate issues during the examination\nprocess. Supervision that is not focused on core risks erodes the resiliency in the banking\nsystem. Bank failures and losses to the deposit insurance fund certainly demand attention,\nreview, and accountability, but the underlying issues suggest we need to ensure that supervision\nworks appropriately over time.\nMany of the reforms targeted in this conference address broader structural concerns—like\nimposing sweeping new regulatory reforms, or broad changes to laws like those governing\ndeposit insurance. I applaud the engagement on these issues, but often the most effective\nregulatory tool is supervision. Effective supervision requires transparency in expectations and an\napproach that incorporates remediating deficiencies as a part of meeting those expectations.\nMany of the risks identified during last year’s banking stress did not involve novel or\nunique risks. Addressing concentration risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk are all key risks\nthat have long been elements deemed critical for effective supervision in bank examinations.\n\n- 10 -\nThese risks are known to create significant vulnerabilities and can be fatal to individual\ninstitutions if not managed appropriately over time.\nIt is clear in the case of SVB that these risks were not managed appropriately. Bank\nregulators and supervisors also failed to sufficiently identify and prioritize the appropriate risks.\nInstead, the focus was on broader, qualitative, and process- and policy-oriented risks.\nUltimately, both the bank’s management and examiners failed to appropriately emphasize these\nkey issues.\nAn important step in the reform agenda—and one of the most effective reforms to build\nresilience against future banking stress—is to improve the prioritization of safety and soundness\nin the examination process, ensuring a careful focus on core financial risks. In my mind,\nsuccessful prioritization involves increased transparency of expectations and a renewed focus on\ncore financial risks. This includes avoiding issues that are only tangential to statutory mandates\nand critical areas of responsibility. Where necessary, it also includes adopting a more proactive\napproach for bank management and bank supervisors to deal with identified risks. Our goal must\nbe to avoid straying from these core issues to focus on less foundational and less pressing areas.\nThere have been some notable examples of regulatory mission creep, including the\nclimate guidance introduced last year by the banking agencies.6 I have no doubt that this\nguidance is well-intended, and that climate change is an important public policy issue. But the\nquestion should be whether banks should be required to divert limited risk management\nresources away from critical, near-term risk management, with a parallel shift in focus by bank\nexaminers. Looking at this guidance through the lens of prioritization, one could reasonably\n6 Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial Institutions, 88 Fed. Reg. 74,183\n(October 30, 2023).\n\n- 11 -\nconclude that climate change is not currently a financial risk to the banking system and does not\njustify a shift in prioritization.\nWhile some may view this position as provocative, my goal is to demonstrate a more\nfoundational point—mis-prioritizing supervisory objectives will have consequences, making\nbanks riskier and the U.S. financial system less resilient over time.\nRegulatory Reform\nWhen it comes to regulatory reform efforts, we should acknowledge, as a starting point,\nthat the bank regulatory system has undergone significant transformation since the passage of the\nDodd-Frank Act, in response to the 2008 financial crisis. This has resulted in significantly\nincreased liquidity and bank capital, new stress testing and resolution planning requirements, and\nseveral other improvements designed to promote bank resiliency. Not only the quantum, but the\nquality, of bank capital has also improved. Common equity tier 1 capital is now codified as the\nhighest quality form of regulatory capital and is included within a capital framework that already\nincludes gold-plating over international capital standards.\nMeasured against this baseline of resiliency, we need to carefully assess the need for\nregulatory improvements, while maintaining those elements of the bank regulatory framework\nthat have proven durable and successful over time. I have not previously argued nor am I\narguing today that the regulatory framework is perfect and beyond reproach. Or that there is no\nroom for improvement or evolution over time. Where we find opportunities for needed\nimprovements—either to maintain the system’s effectiveness or respond to identified\nweaknesses—we should make those changes. But these changes should be motivated by a clear-\neyed assessment of the facts, if the goal is to achieve changes that are focused, efficient, and\ndurable over the long run.\n\n- 12 -\nBefore proposing regulatory reform measures to remediate or address issues identified\nduring the spring 2023 banking stress, we should first reflect on the causes that contributed to the\nfailures of SVB and Signature Bank. These bank failures were followed by government\nintervention in the form of a guarantee on uninsured deposits at these institutions, and the\ncreation of a broad-based emergency lending facility—the Bank Term Funding Program—\ndesigned to reassure the market about the underlying strength of the U.S. banking system.\nOther characteristics of these bank failures—the rapid pace of depositors withdrawing\nuninsured deposits—appeared to deviate from the patterns seen in prior bank failures (in degree,\nif not in kind). But many of the core problems of these banks stemmed from well-known, core\nbanking risks—interest rate risk, liquidity risk, and poor risk management. Each of these can be\naddressed effectively and efficiently through targeted improvements to the supervisory process.\nSupplementary leverage ratio\nOur current narrow approach to rulemaking—focusing on a specific reform, without\nconsidering the broader framework or context within which these rules exist—has created a\ncorresponding narrowness when we think about the consequences of regulatory reform. An\nefficient regulatory system can build resilience both for bank safety and soundness and financial\nstability. Take for example missed opportunities in capital reform. The current set of capital\nreform proposals does not address or propose changes to leverage requirements, including the 5\npercent leverage ratio that applies to U.S. global systemically important banks, commonly\nreferred to as the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio (or eSLR). Treasury market\nintermediation can be disrupted by constraints imposed by the eSLR, as occurred during the\nearly days of market stress during the pandemic. It seems prudent to address this known\n\n- 13 -\nleverage rule constraint before future stresses emerge that would likely disrupt market\nfunctioning.\nThis narrow focus ignores that many requirements are intended to operate in a\ncomplementary way, and that these requirements in the aggregate may overlap or conflict,\ngenerating unintended consequences. The Federal Reserve has expressly acknowledged the\ncomplementary nature of these requirements, for example in noting that some leverage ratio\nrequirements operate as a backstop to risk-based capital requirements.7 And yet, the discussions\nof costs and benefits of reform tend to disregard the aggregate impact across rules, even when\nrelated reforms are proposed at the same time and the aggregate impacts can be identified and\nassessed.8\nWhen policymakers publicly discuss changes to liquidity and capital, industry\nparticipants will modify their behavior in part to meet anticipated regulatory requirements,\n7 See, e.g., Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Interim Final Rule and Request for Comment,\n“Temporary Exclusion of U.S. Treasury Securities and Deposits at Federal Reserve Banks from the Supplementary\nLeverage Ratio,” 85 Fed. Reg. 20,578, 20,579 (April 14, 2020) (“This interim final rule does not affect the tier 1\nleverage ratio, which will continue to serve as a backstop for all banking organizations subject to the capital rule.”),\nhttps://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2020-04-14/pdf/2020-07345.pdf.\n8 See, e.g., Office of the Comptroller of the Currency(OCC), Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,\nand Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, “Long-Term Debt\nRequirements for Large Bank Holding Companies, Certain Intermediate Holding Companies of Foreign Banking\nOrganizations, and Large Insured Depository Institutions,” 88 Fed. Reg. 64,524, 64,551, n. 97,\nhttps://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2023-09-19/pdf/2023-19265.pdf (“The agencies recognize that their Basel\nIII reforms proposal would, if adopted, increase risk-weighted assets across covered entities. The increased risk-\nweighted assets would lead mechanically to increased requirements for LTD under the LTD proposal. The increased\ncapital that would be required under the Basel III proposal could also reduce the cost of various forms of debt for\nimpacted firms due to the increased resilience that accompanies additional capital (which is sometimes referred to as\nthe Modigliani–Miller offset). The size of the estimated LTD needs and costs presented in this section do not\naccount for either of these potential effects of the Basel III proposal.”). Even when the agencies estimate the effect\nof a proposal on other rules, the impact analysis tends to be narrow, such as focusing on the estimated shortfall that\nwould be created by the interrelated rules and may overlook other pending rules. See, e.g., OCC, Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System, and FDIC, “Regulatory Capital Rule: Large Banking Organizations and\nBanking Organizations with Significant Trading Activity,” 88 Fed. Reg. at 64,171,\nhttps://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2023-09-18/pdf/2023-19200.pdf (Noting that the proposed revisions to the\ncalculation of risk-weighted assets under the Basel III endgame proposal would affect the risk-based total loss-\nabsorbing capacity and long-term debt requirements applicable to Category I bank holding companies but\ndisregarding the pending proposal that would expand long-term debt requirements to a broader set of firms).\n\n- 14 -\ndespite the regulatory uncertainty that accompanies reform efforts. While this response by banks\nis unfortunate, it is also predictable.\nRegulatory process\nMy remarks this evening have primarily focused on the substance of reforms and the\nimportance of demonstrating a case to support the changes. But it is also necessary to pause and\nreflect on the importance of following established process and procedure. This is especially\nimportant as we think about the choice between making policy reforms through supervision or\nregulation. Passing regulations under the Administrative Procedure Act requires agencies to\nfollow specific notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures. I think we should approach this\nprocess through the most stringent and conservative lens, particularly when it comes to some of\nthe most consequential rulemakings of the last decade. Rulemaking entails publishing rationales\nfor agency action and seeking public input. These procedural requirements serve an important\npurpose and ultimately promote better agency decisionmaking. One of the most effective tools\nwe have for doing so is the use of public Board meetings to address matters of significant public\ninterest. My hope is that material items on the reform agenda will continue to be handled\nthrough public meetings that give greater visibility and insight into the thinking and rationales of\ndifferent policymakers.\nClosing Thoughts\nI will conclude today’s remarks by thanking all of our participants for joining us in Dallas\nand contributing to these important discussions. The elements that facilitate accountability\nparallel those elements necessary for effective reform—a deep understanding of facts, a careful\nidentification of how elements of the banking system perform over time and during stress, and a\ncommitment to take ownership of identified problems with targeted reforms that are\n\n- 15 -\ncommensurate with the underlying risks. As we engage in a review of our regulatory framework\nfor liquidity and more broadly, these elements should serve as a guide to understanding the past\nand help us chart a path forward.",

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nEighth Annual Fintech Conference\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania\nOctober 23, 2024\n\nGood morning.1 It is a pleasure to join you for the second day of the Eighth\nAnnual Fintech Conference hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. While I\nam disappointed not to be able to join you in person this morning, I am pleased to be\namong the more than 1,000 participants joining today’s discussion online. The agenda\ntoday promises to be just as informative and thought-provoking as yesterday’s session.\nGiven that this conference provides an opportunity to engage in discussions about\nfintech and its importance in the financial services industry, I’d like to reiterate\nsomething I have highlighted a number of times in the past. Regulators have an\nobligation to understand the functionality of new innovations, including the benefits that\ninnovation can bring and the accompanying risks.2 Conferences like this enable us to\nexpand our knowledge and understanding of these benefits and risks by bringing together\nexperts throughout the financial system to discuss important developments and emerging\nissues related to financial technology. These discussions help to inform our work\nthroughout the Federal Reserve System.\nOften the pace of technological change can be rapid. New or improving\ntechnologies have the potential to make our banking system faster and more efficient.\nThey can result in both lowering the cost of and expanding the availability of products\nand services for consumers. But they can also carry risks.\nTo be effective in the face of this ongoing evolution, regulators must be aware of\nthe potential risks and how existing technology could be leveraged for new services.\n1 These remarks represent my own views and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 Michelle W. Bowman, “Innovation in the Financial System” (speech at the Salzburg Global Seminar on\nFinancial Technology Innovation, Social Impact, and Regulation: Do We Need New Paradigms?, Salzburg,\nAustria, June 17, 2024), https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240617a.htm.\n\n- 2 -\nTherefore, we must remain vigilant but nimble in our approach. This requires us to\nrecognize and follow three innovation related principles: First, we must be willing to\ndevelop an understanding of new technology. Second, we must be open in considering\nhow we approach innovation. And finally, we must prioritize how we integrate\ninnovation as we revise or enhance regulatory frameworks.\nTurning back to why we are here today: This conference was launched back in\n2017. It has grown in standing and relevance every year since. As President Harker\nnoted in his remarks yesterday, the conference has become a System highlight because of\nits ability to focus on and keep pace with the change of technology. This conference also\nembodies the principles I just articulated of working to understand new technologies,\nhaving an openness to innovation, and considering policy choices that enable integration\nof financial technology in the banking and financial system. Year-after-year, this event\nprovides an opportunity for us to come together to engage and learn about fintech issues,\nkeeping an eye toward the future.\nBut we must recognize that the success and growth of this conference is due to the\nleadership and vision of President Harker. For those who may not be aware, at the end of\nJune next year, President Harker will reach the Federal Reserve retirement requirements,\nand unfortunately, this will be his final Fintech Conference as President and CEO of the\nPhiladelphia Fed.\nI want to congratulate Pat on the creation and success of this conference, and to\nlook forward to the ongoing and future legacy he has created for the Philadelphia Reserve\nBank with this event.\n\n- 3 -\nPresident Harker is, by his own admission, an “accidental economist.” He’s an\nengineer first and, in fact, came to the field of economics through an engineering issue\nthat required economics to solve. Well, as someone who has sat at the Federal Open\nMarket Committee conference table with President Harker for the past six years, I can\nattest to this approach—he enlists this engineering perspective to assist in understanding\neconomic issues.\nThat methodical approach to issues, and his willingness to look deep under the\nproverbial hood, is his hallmark at the Philadelphia Fed. Through his leadership, the\nBank has built strong partnerships with communities throughout the Third District who\nknow they can rely on this institution for expert knowledge and data research that are\ncritical to working through local concerns.\nIt was also under his leadership that the Philadelphia Fed’s Consumer Finance\nInstitute took its current shape. Today, the Institute’s multidisciplinary approach to\nissues—bringing together economists, industry and regulatory experts, and community\ndevelopment specialists—is redefining our understanding of consumer credit and\npayments. And, he has positioned the Philadelphia Fed as a true thought leader in\ntechnology and innovation, and in the application of both hard and soft data.\nThis conference is just the most public example of this. His decision, nearly a\ndecade ago, to give the green light to a conference specifically geared to fintech proves\nthat President Harker is clearly standing in the center of the intersection of engineering\nand economics.\nSo, while I do not wish to detract from any of our speakers, panelists, and\npresenters today, I must recognize and thank President Harker for his forward-looking\n\n- 4 -\nleadership. The Third District and the Federal Reserve System are both better for his\nservice. Pat, thank you!\nTo close, thank you again for allowing me these few moments to start the day. I\nlook forward to today’s discussion and to our conversations.",

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe 18th Annual Community Bankers Symposium\nCommunity Banking: Navigating a Changing Landscape\nChicago, Illinois\nOctober 11, 2024\n\nGood afternoon, I’d like to begin by thanking the event organizers, including our staff at\nthe Chicago Federal Reserve Bank, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the\nOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Conference of State Bank Supervisors for\ninviting me to share my thoughts with you at the 18th Annual Community Bankers Symposium.1\nI always enjoy the opportunity to speak to bankers across the country and share perspectives on\nthe issues facing the banking and financial system, especially when it’s related to community\nbanks.\nBanks are a critical component of the U.S. economy.2 Their work often extends well\nbeyond the provision of credit— providing services and volunteer and financial support within\ntheir community. Among many things, banks offer financial education, sponsorships and\nfunding for community programs and events. Without question, community banks are important\nand integral to the local economy.\nBut community banks also face challenges that require proactive risk management,\neffective and efficient prioritization of compliance resources, and the need to innovate. Today, I\nwould like to briefly highlight some of the issues banks are facing and discuss ways that\ncommunity banks and regulators can more effectively work together in the future.\nThe Challenges Facing Community Banks\nAs this audience knows well, community banks face a number of challenges. They often\nrely on third-party service providers to offer products and services to their customers. It may be\nmore difficult for them to hire and retain qualified staff or plan for future leadership with\n1 These remarks represent my own views and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 See Michelle W. Bowman, “Building a Community Banking Framework for the Future” (speech at the Federal\nReserve Bank of St. Louis Community Banking Research Conference, St. Louis, MO, October 2, 2024),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20241002a.pdf.\n\n- 2 -\nmanagement succession planning. Given limited staffing, they may be overwhelmed by the\nrecent onslaught of new regulations and guidance. And in light of all of this, it may be\nchallenging to prioritize resources in order to appropriately focus on the most important risks\nfacing their businesses. While the headwinds may seem overwhelming, community banks are\nalways resilient in the face of change.\nOften, one of the greatest challenges facing a community bank is not about managing any\nparticular risk but rather how to address all of the risks they face—and how to prioritize the\napproach to address each of those risks. Regulators have, at times, exacerbated these challenges\nthrough policy choices. The risk of mis-prioritization is not limited to community banks. In my\nmind, this was most recently evident in the events and supervision leading to the failure of\nSilicon Valley Bank. Management failed to address growing interest rate risk and funding risks,\nand supervisors failed to prioritize and escalate these issues. Our goal should be to identify,\nunderstand, and learn from these past mistakes, and to avoid repeating them.\nBoth regulators and banks should be working toward a common goal—a banking system\nthat supports economic activity throughout the country, in which banks operate in a safe and\nsound manner and in compliance with consumer laws and regulations. In considering the\nchallenges facing community banks, both regulators and banks have an important role to play.\nCompetition\nCommunity banks face competitive pressures from many sources. These pressures may\nresult from local or regional economic conditions, the needs of retail and business customers, and\nthe products and services available in the market. Competitors can take the form of traditional\nbanks, internet banks, and non-banks like fin-techs and mortgage companies. While fin-tech\npartnerships can be beneficial to both the customer and the bank, if the relationship is not\n\n- 3 -\nmanaged according to safe and sound banking principles, serious problems can result. When\ndeposits are accepted through fin-tech relationships but not handled appropriately, deposit\ninsurance can be jeopardized and the ability to access deposited funds may be impacted.3\nCompetition can also come from other local competitors like credit unions, large banks\nwith a broader operational footprint, payday lenders, or other nonbank credit sources. As bank\ncustomers grow increasingly comfortable and familiar with new mechanisms for doing business,\nthe use of online banking has continued to expand. This has tended to increase the footprint of\nnon-local banks or lenders, enabling them to effectively compete for business outside of their\ngeographic area. Even against this backdrop, research shows that community banks have\nmaintained an important role in many banking markets, including in small- and medium-sized\nbusiness lending.4\nThe regulatory framework establishes expectations for how community banks can\ncompete, and often creates an unlevel playing field with many of these competitors. This\nincludes whether they are subject to the same regulation as banks that engage in the same\nactivities and how competition is evaluated.\nA core concept in financial regulation is to impose the same regulation—and I suggest we\nexpand this to include the same regulation, guidance, and supervisory expectations—on entities\nthat are engaged in the same activities. Banks compete against many non-bank providers,\nincluding financial technology firms, credit unions, and other non-bank lenders. In some of\n3 See, e.g., Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Arkansas State Bank Department, “In the Matter of\nEvolve Bancorp, Inc. and Evolve Bank & Trust, Cease and Desist Order,” news release, June 11, 2024,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/enf20240614a1.pdf.\n4 Allen N.

For example, banks are subject\nto taxes and additional regulatory requirements (including the Community Reinvestment Act).\nThey are also subject to a broader range of restrictions imposed by regulatory requirements or\nthe “soft” power of supervision. In all of these cases, the disparity in the legal framework can\nhave a distortive effect on competition. In short, where the financial regulatory framework can\nprovide for parity of treatment, it should do so. The regulatory framework should not knowingly\ndistort competition, or effectively impose a regulatory allocation of credit.\nThe framework also plays an important role in assessing competition among banks. The\nmergers and acquisitions (M&A) approval process can have a disproportionate impact on\ncommunity banks because the “screens” that are used to evaluate the competitive effects of a\nproposed merger often result in a finding that M&A transactions in rural markets can have an\nadverse effect on competition and should therefore be disallowed.5 Even when these transactions\nare eventually approved, the mechanical approach to analyzing competitive effects—which is\ngrounded in the effect of proposed transactions on the control of deposits within individual\nbanking markets—often requires additional review or analysis, and can lead to delays in the\nregulatory approval process.\nCybersecurity\nCommunity banks often note cybersecurity and third-party risk management as areas that\nraise significant concerns. Cyber-related events, including ransomware attacks and business\n5 Michelle W. Bowman, “The Role of Research, Data, and Analysis in Banking Reforms” (speech at the 2023\nCommunity Banking Research Conference, St. Louis, MO, October 4, 2023),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20231004a.pdf; Michelle W. Bowman, “The New\nLandscape for Banking Competition,” (speech at the 2022 Community Banking Research Conference, St. Louis,\nMO, September 28, 2022), https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20220928a.pdf.\n\n- 5 -\nemail compromises, are costly and time-consuming experiences, and they pose unique\nchallenges for community banks. For example, the maintenance of and the technology resources\nrequired to support a successful cybersecurity program are often difficult for smaller banks.\nRegulators can promote cybersecurity, and stronger cyber-incident “resilience” and response\ncapabilities by identifying resources and opportunities for banks to develop “muscle memory” in\ncyber incident response.\nRecent incidents, like the Crowdstrike-related outage, have highlighted the heavy\ndependence many banks have on technology, third-party providers, and the broader supply chain.\nIn the current risk environment, it is important for banks of all sizes to implement sound\noperational resilience, cybersecurity, and third-party risk-management practices. One important\nresource for community banks is the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC)\nwebsite, which includes the FFIEC Cybersecurity Resource Guide and links to other external\ncybersecurity resources.\nThe Federal Reserve plays an important role in supervising banks and supporting risk\nmanagement practices. For example, the Federal Reserve hosts the Midwest Cyber Workshop,\nwith the Federal Reserve Banks of Chicago, Kansas City, and St. Louis.6 Over the past two\nyears, this workshop has provided a forum to further cyber risk discussions among community\nbankers, regulators, law enforcement, and other industry stakeholders. Today’s Symposium also\nincludes an interactive cyber workshop, during which participants will participate in a cyber\n6 See Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, and Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas\nCity, Midwest Cyber Workshop 2024 (June 25-26, 2024), https://www.chicagofed.org/events/2024/midwest-cyber-\nworkshop.\n\n- 6 -\nexercise, working through the various decisions that would be required in responding to a\nhypothetical cyberattack.7\nWe know well that cyber threats pose real risks to the banking system. We also\nrecognize that community banks may have unique needs in preventing, remediating, and\nresponding to cyber threats. Therefore, regulators should ensure that a range of resources are\navailable to support community banks and seek further opportunities to help build community\nbank resilience against these threats.\nThird-Party Risk Management\nThird-party risk management can pose an additional challenge for community banks.\nDue to their size and scale, community banks often leverage centralized resources—technical\nexperts who have greater expertise than the bank could fully maintain on staff—to advise and\nassist on a range of issues. Often these third-party service providers are significantly larger, and\ntheir bank clients—including smaller banks—may lack leverage in conducting due diligence and\nnegotiating the terms of the relationship.\nIn 2023, the federal banking agencies published supervisory guidance addressing third-\nparty risk management, which was expressly applicable to community banks. As I noted at the\ntime it was issued, the guidance included shortcomings that were known and identified but not\naddressed in advance.8\n7 Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Community Bankers Symposium (October 11, 2024),\nhttps://www.chicagofed.org/events/2024/annual-community-bankers-symposium-18th\n8 Michelle W. Bowman, “Defining a Bank” (Speech to the American Bankers Association 2024 Conference for\nCommunity Bankers, San Antonio, TX, February 12, 2024),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20240212a.pdf; Statement by Governor Michelle\nW. Bowman, “Third-Party Risk-Management Guidance,” news release, June 6, 2023,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bowman-statement-20230606.htm (“...Federal Reserve\nregional bank supervisors have indicated that we should provide additional resources for community banks upon\nimplementation to provide appropriate expectations and ensure that small banks understand and can effectively use\n\n- 7 -\nWhat many of you may not know is that after nearly a year from the original publication,\nthe regulators published a guide to assist community banks interpret and apply the guidance to\ntheir third-party risk management activities. The guide was intended to provide additional\ncontext for the guidance—including step-by-step examples of how to address third-party risk\nmanagement—making the guidance more useful. While I am pleased that the community bank\nimplementation guide was eventually published, the delays in its publication suggest a\nshortcoming in our regulatory approach. We must ensure new guidance provides clarity to\nregulated firms on its own, or that we provide additional resources at the time the guidance is\npublished.\nConsumer Compliance\nLike third-party risk management, consumer compliance can be another area that may\npresent challenges to community banks given their size and scale. An effective and well-run\nconsumer compliance program balances consumer protection with the complexity and cost to\nestablish a robust compliance management program. One challenge for community banks is the\ndifficulty in retaining qualified consumer compliance experts. Notwithstanding these challenges,\ncommunity banks devote significant time and resources to their consumer compliance risk\nmanagement programs. Compliance with consumer protection laws and regulations, including\nfair lending laws, is essential to ensuring that the banking system provides fair and broad access\nto credit and financial services.\nCommunity banks take these responsibilities seriously, and the overwhelming majority of\nbanks that we supervise invest in strong compliance management systems to prevent violations\nthe guidance to inform their third-party risk management processes…I am disappointed that the agencies failed to\nmake the upfront investment to reduce unnecessary confusion and burden on community banks”).\n\n- 8 -\nand detect problems before they occur. When consumer compliance concerns arise, banks\naddress them by making their customers whole and adopting the necessary changes to ensure that\nissues do not persist or reoccur. In a very small subset of cases, banks fall short of their\nobligations, and we hold those institutions accountable through enforcement actions or other\nsupervisory actions.\nThe Federal Reserve’s consumer compliance supervision program is risk-focused and\ntailored to a bank’s compliance risk, focused on the activities that present the greatest risk. One\nexample related to third-party risk management is our recent system supervisory focus on\nconsumer compliance risks associated with fin-tech relationships. As a result of this work, our\nsupervisors seek to identify the parties to relationships that pose the greatest risk of consumer\nharm. This effort promotes our understanding of higher risk fin-tech partners across the Federal\nReserve System, and helps supervisors proactively identify relationships that pose greater risk of\nconsumer harm.\nOther Core Risks\nThere are a number of “core” risks that are essential for bank management to address.\nThese “core” risks—including funding, liquidity and credit risk—should already be integrated\ninto management priorities, since they pose the greatest threats to a bank’s operations.\nFocusing on core risks is second nature for community banks. In contrast, supervision\ncan be susceptible to diversion from core to non-core risks leading supervisors to neglect the\nbuild-up of traditional risk. Diverting resources to non-core risks can often leave a bank\nvulnerable, especially when regulators direct banks to allocate resources in other ways, whether\nby regulation, guidance, or through supervisory expectations.\n\n- 9 -\nMitigating Risks to Community Banks\nThe design of regulation, guidance, and supervisory approach regulators rely upon for\ncommunity banks—and the intentional policy choices that underpin this framework—are\nimportant for ensuring their effectiveness in supporting the safety and soundness of the banking\nsystem. These design choices can enable community banks to operate successfully while\nmitigating risks, leveraging tailoring, transparency, and consistency across institutions.9 I have\nspoken at length about these themes in the past, but I would like to reiterate just a few of the\ncritical elements of a regulatory agenda that will allow community banks to thrive in the future:\n• First, we need to revisit size thresholds over time as inflation and economic growth\nslowly erode our regulatory categories. The bank regulatory framework is built largely\nupon asset-based size thresholds, and these thresholds should reflect a deliberate policy\nchoice. But, over time, these fixed thresholds effectively result in more firms being\n“scoped in” to higher compliance tiers over time, even when there has been no change in\na bank’s underlying risk profile.10\n• We need to have a regulatory system in which M&A transactions and de novo bank\nformations are possible for banks, not one in which regulatory approval requirements are\nused to impose additional (and extra-regulatory) requirements on firms.11 Viable\nformation and merger options for banks of all sizes are necessary to avoid creating a\n9 See Michelle W. Bowman, “Building a Community Banking Framework for the Future” (speech at the Federal\nReserve Bank of St. Louis Community Banking Research Conference, St. Louis, Missouri, October 2, 2024),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20241002a.pdf.\n10 See, e.g., Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and Office\nof the Comptroller of the Currency, “Regulatory Capital Rule: Large Banking Organizations and Banking\nOrganizations with Significant Trading Activity,” 88 Fed. Reg. 64,028, 64,095 (September 18, 2023) (“[t]o reflect\ninflation since 1996 and growth in the capital markets, the agencies are proposing to increase the trading activity\ndollar threshold [applicable to the market risk rule] from $1 billion to $5 billion.”).\n11 FDIC, “Final Statement of Policy on Bank Merger Transactions,” (September 17, 2024),\nhttps://www.fdic.gov/system/files/2024-09/final-statement-of-policy-on-bank-merger-transactions.pdf.\n\n- 10 -\n“barbell” of the very largest and very smallest banks in the banking system, with the\nnumber of community banks continuing to erode over time. Left unchecked, an\napplications process that imposes additional costs and delays on healthy and appropriate\nbanking transactions will result in a reduction in available credit and services, an increase\nin the number of unbanked or underbanked communities, and economic harm.\n• We should prioritize direct experience in our regulatory efforts, giving greater voice and\nopportunities for input from policymakers with banking or state supervisory experience\ncurrently at the Federal banking agencies, and by soliciting and accepting feedback from\nour state banking counterparts. Greater coordination and participation by a wider set of\npolicymakers in regulatory reform efforts would bring several benefits. For example,\ndiscussion of competing ideas and compromise in the drafting of regulatory proposals\noften results in a more moderate approach, reducing dramatic swings of the regulatory\npendulum. And in many instances, we can better anticipate the unintended consequences\nof reform proposals if policymakers engage in good faith discussions and coordination of\nthese efforts.\n• While regulatory reform brings many benefits, we should also shift our mindset to focus\non the tradeoffs of regulation, guidance, and supervision. Changes to the regulatory\nframework often yield benefits in terms of greater visibility into the workings of the\nbanking system, additional capital that can absorb losses and promote financial\nresiliency, and more conservative risk-management standards for interest rate risk and\nfunding risk. But we need to evaluate not only the benefits of proposals but also the costs\nand unintended consequences. How will banks adjust their activities in response? Will\nthey raise prices on lending activities or for other banking products or services? Will\n\n- 11 -\nthey exit certain low-margin businesses, resulting in greater concentration and increased\nfinancial stability risk? By considering the cumulative burden, we can better address and\nacknowledge these concerns.\n• And finally, we must incorporate “tailoring”—calibrating the regulatory framework\nbased on the size and complexity of banks’ activities—as a required input for regulatory\nconsideration. Tailoring helps us to better allocate finite resources both in banks and\namong regulators and helps us avoid threatening the long-term viability of community\nbanks by simply adding to the mass of existing regulations, guidance, and other\nsupervisory material. We simply cannot ignore the “cumulative” or “compounding”\neffect of increasing the complexity of the regulatory framework and we must make room\nin our reform agenda for the unglamorous work of “maintenance” in promoting an\nefficient framework.\nBy no means is this proposal for regulatory reform exhaustive, but these critical components\nmust be integrated into our future approach to ensure a diverse banking system for the future.\nClosing Thoughts\nThank you for the opportunity to speak to you today, and for your commitment to\ncommunity banking. You serve a critical role within the banking system, and in support of the\nU.S. economy. Your work to leverage the power of the community banking model enables you\nto serve your customers, promote financial inclusion and expand access to banking services. But\npolicymakers have an important responsibility to make sure that the community banking model\nremains viable into the future. To function effectively, the banking system requires the presence\nof banks of all sizes—larger, regional, and community banks. This diversity of our financial\n\n- 12 -\ninstitutions is the greatest strength of our banking system, and it can easily be imperiled by\ninsufficiently targeted regulation, supervision, and guidance.",

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe American Bankers Association\n2024 Conference for Community Bankers\nSan Antonio, Texas\nFebruary 12, 2024\n\nThank you for the invitation to join you in San Antonio today for the ABA’s Conference\nfor Community Bankers.1 This conference provides an opportunity for bankers, state and federal\nregulators, and other policymakers to share perspectives on banking and other related financial\ntopics. The ability to exchange ideas is critical to ensuring efficient and effective outcomes in\nthe regulation and supervision of financial services activities. Policymakers should seek to fully\nunderstand the direct and indirect consequences of regulation and supervision—and any changes\nthat might be considered to existing expectations. One of the best, and most effective ways to\ngain this understanding is through direct engagement with bankers, bank customers, and other\nstakeholders about potential consequences. Engaging with the public, being transparent about\npolicy goals, and hearing from industry participants—enables us to craft more efficient and\neffective rules and enhance our ability to execute our supervisory responsibilities.\nThis public engagement is particularly important now, when so many factors are in play\nthat will likely reshape the contours of the banking industry. Bank business models are adapting\nto technology changes, including new opportunities for third-party partnerships and new risks\nfrom increasingly sophisticated cyber criminals. We’ve seen some traditional banking activities\ncontinue to migrate into nonbank financial service providers, and regulators have implemented\nor proposed—or are considering proposing—significant changes to the bank regulatory\nframework, some of which could have broad impacts on the future of banking and on our current\nunderstanding of the community banking model. A broad range of policymakers continue to\nconsider the root causes of the banking stress from last spring and whether changes are needed to\nachieve greater resilience and accountability, both among banks and among regulators.\n1 The views expressed in these remarks are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of my colleagues on the\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nWhile many of the most significant changes have occurred in the larger bank space,\ncommunity banks have been and will continue to be affected by these dynamics. Increasingly,\ncommunity banks must devote a greater proportion of their resources to compliance and risk\nmanagement. Even those changes that exclude community banks on their face present the\nprospect of regulatory “trickle down,” either through market forces and expectations, or through\npressure exerted by bank examiners in the course of supervision.\nIn considering this ongoing evolution of the banking system, I think it is useful to go\nback to first principles: What is a community bank, and why does it matter?\nWhat Is a Community Bank?\nThe question “What is a community bank?” has no clearly defined answer. One may\nsimply point to regulatory standards, where the current definition sets a threshold at $10 billion\nin consolidated assets; firms below this threshold are “community banking organizations.” Some\nregulations, like the newly finalized rules implementing the Community Reinvestment Act\n(CRA), depart from this regulatory definition altogether to impose lower thresholds, applying a\n$600 million threshold in defining a “small bank” and a $2 billion threshold in defining an\n“intermediate bank.”2 Notably, the regulatory definition—an asset-sized based approach—is not\nthe only way one could define a community bank.\nIn fact, even in the current regulatory framework, there is variability in how we define\ndifferent categories of institutions; for example, global systemically important banks (G-SIBs)\nare defined using multi-factor tests that take into account a range of factors, including not only\n2 Community Reinvestment Act, 89 Fed. Reg. at 7109 (defining “intermediate bank”), and 7110 (defining “small\nbank”), https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2024-02-01/pdf/2023-25797.pdf.\n\n- 3 -\nsize but also interconnectedness, complexity, cross-jurisdictional activity, substitutability, and\nshort-term wholesale funding.3\nOf course, a test designed to identify G-SIBs is really not suitable to define other\ncategories of institutions, particularly community banks. But it is helpful to consider what\nbroader lessons we can learn from other parts of the regulatory framework, and how these might\nilluminate areas for improvement when it comes to bank definitions. For example, there are a\nnumber of differences that distinguish a “community bank” from larger peers. Let’s consider the\nstructure of a community bank. A community bank tends to have a simple organizational\nstructure, operating either as a standalone bank, or as a bank subsidiary of a shell holding\ncompany. Often, these banks will have few, if any, subsidiaries or affiliates, and their activities\ntend to differ from those of larger and more complex peers, focusing on traditional banking\nactivities.\nThese banks also compete differently—often with a heavy reliance on relationship\nbanking—focusing on business segments where they have unique, competitive advantages, like\nin small business lending and a targeted focus on the banking needs of local communities. Many\nof these factors go to the character of the organization, which may not change even after a bank\ncrosses a particular asset size threshold.\nWhile these many factors distinguish what is considered a community bank from other\nbanking models, the simpler approach—a pure asset-size-based definition—persists as the key\ndistinguishing factor in the regulatory framework.4 To the extent that there are deviations from\n3 12 CFR 217.404 (Method 1 score) and 217.405 (Method 2 score).\n4 While some research has considered additional factors beyond size for purposes of studying community banks,\nrelevant regulatory definitions remain based on asset size. See FDIC, “FDIC Community Banking Study,”\n(December 2020), at https://www.fdic.gov/resources/community-banking/report/2020/2020-cbi-study-full.pdf.\n\n- 4 -\nthis approach, such as in the recent push to treat banks engaged in “novel activities” differently,\nthese deviations move only in one direction, effectively subjecting targeted firms to accelerated\nexamination cycles; imposing additional supervisory screens during examinations, and in\npractice, holding them to stricter supervisory standards including those related to risk\nmanagement, capital, and liquidity. When we try to adjust based on firm-specific characteristics,\nthe result is always the imposition of higher standards. A bank with more than $10 billion in\nassets is never treated as a community bank under the regulatory framework, and indeed, even a\ntraditional community bank must prepare to comply with additional regulatory requirements and\nsupervisory expectations as it approaches the $10-billion asset size threshold.\nFrankly, we should ask ourselves whether this is the best approach. It may very well be\nappropriate to impose heightened standards on a bank even if it has less than $10 billion in\nassets, depending on that bank’s underlying risk profile and its business activities. But by the\nsame token, we should consider whether banks above the $10 billion threshold are more akin to\ntraditional community banks, notwithstanding exceeding this regulatory asset threshold. And if\nthey are, whether different rules and standards would be more appropriate.\nFairness and Community Banks\nAt least as important as the question of “What is a community bank?” is how the\nregulatory system treats this type of bank, and whether this treatment is appropriate. All banks\nare held to high standards, but we must consider the risks and implications of over-calibration of\nsupervisory standards and regulatory requirements. Additional regulation and heightened\nsupervisory expectations are not cost-free, particularly for community banks that may have\nlimited resources, especially when we consider the cumulative impact of existing and proposed\nregulations. Over-calibration occurs when the resulting requirements are disproportionate to the\n\n- 5 -\nunderlying risks, and over-calibration can pose a threat to the viability of the community banking\nmodel. More is not always better, and imposing ever higher standards may actually frustrate\nsafety and soundness goals, pushing activity to the non-bank financial system.5\nWhen considering these two questions—how we define, and how the regulatory\nframework treats, community banks—we must consider an approach that takes into account\nfairness. In my view, a “fair” approach is one that strives to achieve appropriate calibration.\nAnd without question, fairness ensures that we preserve the role of these important banks in the\nbanking system. We know the role that community banks play is important to the financial\nsystem, with an unparalleled focus on local communities and unique expertise in certain lending\nactivities, like lending to small- and medium-sized businesses.\nBut often, “fairness” for community banks often appears to be a non-factor when\nconsidering which proposals make the regulatory agenda, particularly in an environment where\nbank regulation and supervision of larger institutions was shown to have faced significant\nchallenges around the banking stress in March of last year. In the aftermath of supervisory\ninattention, the primary response among regulators appears to be to crank the dial up to 11 on\nregulatory requirements.6 This has involved shifting to a more strict approach for the\nsupervision of all institutions, even for those that had robust risk management, business models\ndesigned to be more resilient to interest rate changes, and less concentrated customer exposures.\nWhile higher regulatory requirements and stricter supervisory standards across the board may\n5 See Michelle W. Bowman, “The Path Forward for Bank Capital Reform” (speech at Protect Main Street event,\nWashington, D.C., January 17, 2024),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20240117a.pdf.\n6 See This Is Spinal Tap, directed by Rob Reiner (1984).\n\n- 6 -\nreduce risk in the banking system on a superficial level, it does so at substantial cost to banks,\ntheir customers, and to the broader economy.\nTo be sure, many factors influence the path of regulatory reform. One of the key issues\nthat has guided bank regulatory reform since the 2008 financial crisis has been how we address\nthe problem of banks that are “too big to fail.” Many of the reforms that stemmed from the\nDodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act were intended to address this\nproblem. By contrast, statutory reforms since that time have largely been focused on “right-\nsizing” the regulatory framework, requiring regulatory tailoring for firms above $100 billion in\nassets, raising the threshold for enhanced prudential standards from its initial $50 billion asset\nthreshold, and increasing the statutory threshold for periodic firm-run stress testing requirements\nfrom a $10 billion threshold to $250 billion.7 The debate about regulatory “right-sizing” has\ngenerally focused on larger firms, and in some ways, both the emergency actions taken last\nspring, and the ensuing regulatory reform requirements, force us to ask whether these reform\nefforts have, perversely, entrenched the too-big-to-fail expectations around larger firms.\nAs community banks consider all of the applicable regulations, guidance, and recent bank\nregulatory reform efforts, I expect they ask themselves, “What is the overarching objective of the\nfederal banking regulators?” And “What is really the goal here?” When asked, policymakers\nwill tell you that a diversity of banks—with a range of sizes, locations, and activities—\ncontributes to the strength of the banking system, and that community banks play a particularly\nvital role for many bank customers and communities. Yet this can be hard to square with policy\nactions, especially those taken in recent times. While reform efforts may be well-intentioned,\nwhen the effect of reforms over time is to erode the ongoing viability of different banking\n7 Public Law 115–174, 132 Stat. 1296 (2018), § 401(a).\n\n- 7 -\nmodels, especially the community banking model, I think we need to do some soul-searching\nabout what sort of banking system we want, and how the bank regulatory framework can best\nsupport a banking system that is not only safe and sound, but efficient.\nCumulative Burden and the Policy Response\nIn my mind, one of the greatest threats to smaller banks’ business models comes not from\nany one regulatory reform initiative or changed expectations in supervision but rather from the\ncumulative impact. The tendency of policymakers can be to add new regulations, guidance, and\nsupervisory expectations, becoming more and more prescriptive and creating an ever-larger body\nof material that a banker must digest and apply over time. At some point, however, this\noverwhelming body of material (more than 5,000 pages just last year) is simply undigestible by\nthe individual or small staff at a community bank primarily responsible for making sure the bank\nmeets all relevant expectations.\nThis begs the questions: How should policymakers approach regulation and supervision\nin a world with so many competing priorities, each one of which may seem important on a\nstandalone basis? And how can we maintain a bank regulatory framework that is “fair” for\ncommunity banks? My recommendations will sound familiar to those who have followed my\npast remarks.\nFirst, I think we need to focus on effective prioritization of risks, particularly for the\nsmaller and community banks. While we should not ignore new and evolving risks, we know\nthat certain core risks are always important in the sound management of a bank—for example,\ncredit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk, succession planning, and information technology.\nParticularly in the wake of some supervisory gaps in the lead up to the failure of Silicon Valley\nBank, one response by bank examiners could be to simply flag as many issues as possible.\n\n- 8 -\nHowever, we must be very careful not to assess the effectiveness of the supervisory process by\nthe quantity of findings documented in examination reports. Quantity alone does not tell us that\nwe have identified the right issues or taken appropriate steps to ensure these issues are addressed\nin a timely way.\nPrioritizing the quantity of findings over quality creates a serious risk of distracting bank\nmanagement from core risks. When it comes to non-core risks, or emerging risks, it is\nincumbent upon bankers to manage risks that may be material based on, among other things,\ntheir business model and activities. The role of regulators is to support banks in these efforts—\nand to help identify any non-core risks or emerging risks that banks may have overlooked—but\nnot to push down a one-size-fits-all set of requirements or expectations that are designed for\nlarger banks or that may be irrelevant under a community banking model.\nSecond, I think it is important to improve transparency and predictability in the bank\nregulatory framework. Uncertainty is a significant contributor to the cumulative burden on\ncommunity banks. One area where this concern is particularly acute is in the bank merger\napplication process. About a year ago when I spoke at this conference, I mentioned the growing\npublic focus on the role of federal banking regulators in reviewing merger applications.8 This\npast year certainly hasn’t improved the outlook for the bank merger process. While the\nidiosyncratic features of each bank merger transaction can make it difficult to predict how long\nthe regulatory approval process may take, I remain concerned about delays in average processing\ntimes and that subsequent regulatory actions could lead to further delays.\n8 See Michelle W. Bowman, “Independence, Predictability, and Tailoring in Banking Regulation and Supervision”\n(speech at the American Bankers Association Community Banking Conference, Orlando, Florida, February 13,\n2023), https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20230213a.pdf.\n\n- 9 -\nBut community bank mergers are often simpler than mergers of larger organizations and\nmay be critical to preserve local banking options. These banks may have fewer options than\ntheir larger peers to raise capital or grow their banking business, so preserving the availability of\nmerger transactions is important for the health and longevity of community banking. In this\ncontext, application processing delays can be quite harmful, resulting in greater operational risk,\nincreased expenses, and staff attrition due to the prolonged uncertainty.\nSupervision can also be an additional source of risk for banks. Of course, supervision is\nan important tool and, when used properly, can often be a very efficient tool to promote safety\nand soundness. But when supervisory standards become volatile and unpredictable, banks may\nhave significant trouble meeting regulatory expectations. As I have previously noted, one of the\nconcerning trends in 2023 were reports, including from state banking regulators, that some\nfederal supervisory actions were excessive, considering the risks posed by some smaller\ninstitutions.9 Regulatory “surprises”—shifting expectations that are not announced or socialized\nprior to an examination and are discovered only through the issuance of supervisory findings—\nleave banks in the unfortunate position of failing to meet regulatory expectations not through\ninattention to risk or management shortcomings, but simply by not having the ability to divine\nwhat those new standards are. While change is inevitable in supervision—change in response to\nbroader economic trends, changes in banking best practices, and changes to a bank’s business\nmodel and activities—opaque and shifting regulatory standards can exacerbate these risks for\nbank management.\n9 See Michelle W. Bowman, “New Year’s Resolutions for Bank Regulatory Policymakers,” (speech at the South\nCarolina Bankers Association 2024 Community Bankers Conference, Columbia, South Carolina, January 8, 2024),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20240108a.pdf.\n\n- 10 -\nFinally, one of the core principles for effective regulation and supervision—to reduce the\nincremental burden, especially for the smaller regional and community banks—is tailoring.\nWhile important for all institutions, tailoring is particularly important for community banks.\nEffective and efficient regulation and supervision must be calibrated to the activities and risks of\nthe community banking model, and the tradeoffs and unintended consequences carefully\nconsidered. In addition to the Basel proposal, one of the most consequential regulatory\ndevelopments over the past year was the finalization of revisions to the regulations implementing\nthe CRA. The new regulatory thresholds under this final rule define a “small bank” and an\n“intermediate bank” to include only the smallest community banks. All banks with more than $2\nbillion are deemed to be large. As I noted at the time the final rule was approved, the lack of\nrecognition that these banks are fundamentally different, with different balance sheets and\nbusiness models, represents a missed opportunity to appropriately tailor CRA expectations to a\nbank’s size, risk, service area, and business model.10 I remain convinced that it is not sensible\nbank regulatory policy to apply the same evaluation standards to a bank with $2 billion in assets\nand to a bank with $2 trillion in assets.\nAnother missed opportunity is with supervisory guidance, which can also be a significant\nsource of risk for banks. For example, the federal banking agencies published third-party risk-\nmanagement guidance that applies to all banks, including community banks. And yet, as I noted\nat the time, this guidance had known shortcomings even at the time it was published,\nshortcomings that were not addressed in advance by the agencies.11 While I expect that the\n10 See dissenting statement, “Statement on the Community Reinvestment Act Final Rule by Governor Michelle W.\nBowman,” news release, October 24, 2023, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bowman-\nstatement-20231024.htm.\n11 See Statement on Third Party Risk Management Guidance by Governor Michelle W.

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Toward an Inclusive Recovery,” a research seminar sponsored by\nthe Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nWashington, D.C.\n(via webcast)\nOctober 20, 2022\n1\n\nWelcome, and thank you for joining us to discuss topics important to the nation's\neconomy. This research seminar is part of the Federal Reserve’s series of events called “Toward\nan Inclusive Recovery.”\nToday’s seminar, hosted by the Board of Governors, will focus on how the COVID-19\npandemic affected educational outcomes and the subsequent impact we anticipate for transitions\nto the labor force. We have invited accomplished researchers to discuss their work—and what\npractical lessons might be drawn from it—that could help inform community development\npractice and public policy considerations.\nAs I am sure you are aware, the pandemic created significant disruptions for our students\nand the education system. At the onset of the pandemic, steps taken to slow the spread of\nCOVID-19 resulted in widespread closures of businesses and schools. Many, myself included,\nwere immediately concerned about the negative effects on education from changes that included\nshifting to virtual instruction, lack of access to technology, and changes to the accessibility and\nprovision of childcare. It is critical to consider that access to education at every step along a\nstudent’s learning path serves as a pipeline into the labor force and enables future generations of\nAmericans to participate and thrive in our dynamic labor market. The disruption of education\nthroughout the pandemic undoubtedly led to an absence of workers in the labor force, creating a\nshortage that held back the early economic recovery.\nEducation outcomes, including learning losses and achievements, take time to measure,\naggregate, and analyze. As we enter the fourth academic year affected by the pandemic, data on\nstudent performance are becoming more available. Much of this early data confirms our initial\nconcerns. For example, early test scores show that throughout the country nine-year-olds\nsuffered a decline in learning outcomes during the pandemic. But other data also indicate that\n2\n\nlearning losses were unequal and disproportionately affected low-performing students and low-\nincome students.\nIt is likely that the sudden shift to online classes contributed to the learning declines.\nAccording to the Board’s 2020 Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking (the\nSHED), only 22 percent of parents with children attending virtual classes agreed that their\nchildren learned as much as they would have attending classes in person at school. I hope that\nthe return to in-person learning and reopening of schools will enable children to resume normal\nlearning and that academic achievement will rebound.\nIt seems that even with this return to in-person attendance, many schools are struggling to\nprovide students with the same quality of education as they did pre-pandemic. With the return to\nonsite education, many schools are confronting challenges that impair their ability to meet the\neducational needs of students. A number of educators appear to have left the profession, as\nindicated by the nearly 100,000 more job openings for teachers in July 2022 than before the\npandemic.1\nComplicating these issues, across the country the return to in-person instruction has been\nmet by an increase in chronic absenteeism, which is defined as a student missing at least 10\npercent of school days in a school year. Compared to a typical school year pre-pandemic, 72\npercent of U.S. public schools reported an increase in chronic absenteeism among their students\nduring the 2021–22 school year, which is a 39 percent increase over the previous year.2\n1 Bureau of Labor Statistics Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey. Accessed via FRED.\n2 National Center for Education Statistics, “More than 80 Percent of U.S. Public Schools Report Pandemic Has\nNegatively Impacted Student Behavior and Socio-Emotional Development,” press release, July 6, 2022,\nhttps://nces.ed.gov/whatsnew/press_releases/07_06_2022.asp.\n3\n\nMissed school typically means missed learning, so chronic absenteeism is a key metric of\nschool performance. It’s likely that these challenges will result in lower graduation rates and\npossibly less stable employment than would have otherwise been the case.\nThese outcomes raise difficult questions about how to best respond to the needs of\nstudents and educators going forward. For example, how can curricula be adjusted to meet\nstudents where they are today, after nearly three years of pandemic-impacted learning? How can\nwe best re-engage the larger proportion of students who may have become disconnected as a\nresult of these pandemic-related disruptions to their education? What does this all mean for the\nfuture of the labor force?\nIn addition to the challenges facing primary and secondary education, higher education\nwas not immune to pandemic disruptions. Like K-12 education, studies show that online\ninstruction reduced the academic performance of college students.3 In addition, we have seen\ndeclines in both college enrollment and the rate of first-year college students who continue their\neducation into a second year.4 These declines are most pronounced at community colleges and\nopen-access programs. Some of this decline was due to a supply-induced shortage resulting\nfrom colleges unable to offer remote learning options for many technical and vocational\nprograms. The reduction in these “hands-on” programs, such as air-conditioning repair and auto\ndetailing, had a greater impact on male enrollment and may lead to labor supply shortages for\nsome of these skills-based professions.5\n3 Michael S. Kofoed, Lucas Gebhart, Dallas Gilmore, and Ryan Moschitto, “Zooming to Class?: Experimental\nEvidence on College Students' Online Learning during COVID-19,” Discussion Paper Series No. 14356 (Bonn,\nGermany: IZA Institute of Labor Economics, May 2021), https://docs.iza.org/dp14356.pdf.\n4 Persistence and Retention, Fall 2020 Beginning Postsecondary Student Cohort, Persistence and Retention Report\nSeries (National Student Clearinghouse Research Center, June 2022), https://nscresearchcenter.org/wp-\ncontent/uploads/PersistenceRetention2022.pdf.\n5 Diane Whitmore Schanzenbach and Sarah Turner, “Limited Supply and Lagging Enrollment: Production\nTechnologies and Enrollment Changes at Community Colleges during the Pandemic,” NBER Working Paper 29639\n(National Bureau of Economic Research, January 2022), https://www.nber.org/papers/w29639.\n4\n\nEducation is the greatest and most effective input into the future of our labor market. In\norder to have the strongest possible labor force in the future, it is critical to understand and act\nimmediately to address the educational losses experienced during the pandemic. I’m sure there’s\nmuch to learn about how these education challenges, both longstanding and more recent, will\nultimately affect the job market. That’s a question of particular interest to policymakers, and it’s\none of the most important reasons that we host events like this seminar. I look forward to\nhearing from the experts we have invited here today to discuss ideas to successfully and quickly\naddress academic declines, expand K-12 education options, improve higher education outcomes,\nand prepare this generation to participate and thrive in the future labor force.\nI hope that the research presented today is useful to you in your work. Community\ndevelopment professionals in our audience may consider how the design and implementation of\ntheir services can be enhanced. And researchers may encounter ideas that spark new work that\ncan shed further light on these important topics. Thank you so much for joining us.\n5",

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Community Banking in the 21st Century”\n2019 Community Banking Research and Policy Conference sponsored by\nthe Federal Reserve System, the Conference of State Bank Supervisors, and\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\nSt. Louis, Missouri\nOctober 1, 2019\n\nIt is a special honor for me to be part of this conference and its tradition of\nadvancing our understanding of how banking shapes our economy and our communities.1\nAs a community banker, I sought out actionable research that I could leverage to better\nserve my customers and my community. As a state bank regulator, I conducted my own\nresearch to answer questions about issues affecting the banks my agency regulated. I also\nappreciated learning what researchers thought would provide better insight into the\nindustry. Today I am honored to be here as the first person to serve on the Federal\nReserve Board in the role that the Congress designated for someone with community\nbanking or state supervisory experience. My work at the Board has given me an even\ngreater appreciation for how creative, insightful research informs and shapes policy\ndecisions that support our economy. But it also tells me there is still much to be learned\nand many additional areas that deserve more exploration.\nMore than 10 years on, as the entire banking industry continues to evolve post-\ncrisis, I would like to share with you some of my thoughts and observations on the forces\ninfluencing the future of banking, and community banking in particular. I will also\nsuggest some areas where policymakers could use the help of researchers, bankers, and\nstate supervisors to better understand how community banking is changing and how we\ncan better provide a path for the continued viability of this sector and its business model.\nI hardly need to tell this audience that community banks play a vital role in the\nfinancial services industry and in the economy. From my perspective, the Federal\nReserve supports community banks as a central component of a strong, resilient, and\nstable financial system. Our system is made more resilient through a broad and varied\n1 I would like to thank Robin Prager, John Kandrac, and Mark Wicks for their research and assistance in\npreparing this speech.\n\n- 2 -\nrange of institutions serving different types of customers, with community banks\nproviding access to credit and other financial services in towns and cities across America.\nWith the support of community bankers, these investments are the building blocks of a\nstrong community and help support a vibrant economy across the country—from here in\nthe Midwest to the coasts on either side.\nResearch on community banking and the accessibility of financial services is\nincredibly important. Community bankers and policymakers want to better understand\nhow technology, competition, regulation, and other factors are driving decision making,\nconsolidation, and the other challenges and opportunities that are shaping community\nbanking. Existing research provides us with some answers to these questions, but there\nare many gaps. The lack of a full understanding of these institutions, their functionality,\nand their needs may limit our ability to identify important areas of focus for research.\nThis is where I would like to ask for your expertise and assistance. We need to\nchallenge ourselves to tackle some questions and issues that have not been fully explored\nby researchers. If you are a community banker, are involved in economic development or\ncity or county management, or live in a community served by a community bank, your\nown experiences likely provide anecdotal evidence regarding the answers to these\nquestions, but research can provide more comprehensive and systematic evidence,\nleading to more definitive answers. So I need your help. To begin, let’s look at the\nquestions.\nCommunity banks provide a variety of benefits to their communities, but these\nbenefits can be difficult to quantify and measure. Therefore, economists and\npolicymakers would like to be able to define and understand the full economic effects of\n\n- 3 -\na community bank in an area that relies on it and identify the different channels by which\na community bank finances spending, investment, economic development, and job\ncreation. In addition, what happens to a community when a bank headquartered or\nchartered in that community is acquired by a financial institution located elsewhere? Can\nwe calculate the cumulative contribution of community banks to U.S. investment,\nemployment, and economic output? I hope that presentations at future community\nbanking research conferences can help answer some of these questions and provide a\nstronger foundation for policy development.\nPerhaps as a baseline for this discussion, we can start by looking at what has\nhappened to the structure of the banking industry since the financial crisis. While\ncommunity banks face considerable challenges, in general they have emerged from the\nlast decade as strong competitors: On average, they have grown somewhat larger and\nhave expanded their geographic footprints. In other words, we have a more resilient,\nstronger community banking sector, but one with fewer locally headquartered banks.\nWith that in mind, let’s look at what leads me to these conclusions. As seen in\nfigure 1, it is true that there are now many fewer small community banks—those with\nless than $250 million in assets—than there were in 2011.2 At the same time, the\nnumbers of both large community banks and banks over $10 billion in assets (non-\ncommunity banks) haven’t changed much.\nWhat do we find when we dig a little deeper? As shown in figure 2, very few\nsmall community banks failed or were liquidated in the past eight years—just over\n100 banks, or 2 percent, of the total number in this size category as of 2011. About\n2 Assets are in constant 2018 dollars.\n\n- 4 -\n2,800 banks, well over half of this original group, had no change in ownership and stayed\nbelow $250 million in assets. About 470 banks, or 10 percent of the initial number, had\ngrown and are now above $250 million in assets.\nAnd over this time, just over one-fourth of the smallest community banks, nearly\n1,200 of them, were acquired by other banks. That is certainly a large number of\nacquisitions. But, again, let’s look a little deeper. A fair share of those acquired banks—\none in five—were acquired by another bank within the same holding company (figure 3).\nYou could consider that more of a reorganization at the holding company level rather\nthan an acquisition by a competitor. The remaining banks—20 percent of the smallest\nbanks operating in 2011—were acquired by another financial institution. Seventeen of\nthe acquisitions, about one and a half percent, were acquisitions of a small community\nbank by a credit union, while 14, just over one percent, involved a non-community bank\nacquirer with over $10 billion in assets. In other words, approximately four out of five of\nthe small banks that were acquired during this period, or about 930 banks, were acquired\nby another community bank.3\nTo better understand what is happening with these institutions, we looked at\nseveral potential differences between small community banks that have been acquired\nand those that were not. Was it the smallest community banks, or those with the smallest\nmarkets, that were most likely to be acquired? It turns out that the key difference\nbetween these banks was not their geographic reach or their size, but rather their\n3 The pattern during the pre-crisis period is similar. The difference from the post-crisis period is that from\nthe fourth quarter of 1998 to the third quarter of 2007, a larger share of the acquisitions involved an internal\nreorganization within a bank holding company. This period begins four years after the signing of the\nRiegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, which removed many restrictions on\ninterstate banking.\n\n- 5 -\nprofitability. We find that small banks that were acquired by another institution were, on\naverage, about the same size and geographic scope as other small banks but they were\nless profitable. This fact challenges the notion held by some that small scale or operating\nin a very limited geographic area is a disadvantage and it shows that many small, locally\nfocused banks are performing well in a changing and challenging marketplace.\nBank regulators should understand how the evolving structure of community\nbanking has affected customers and how regulations can be tailored to limit the extent to\nwhich consolidation is driven by unnecessary, ineffective, or excessive regulatory\nburden. Unfortunately, current research does not provide enough evidence to\nconclusively answer these questions. Earlier research has shown that technological\nchange and the removal of regulatory restrictions on interstate banking in the 1980s and\n1990s have played important roles in driving consolidation.4\nWe can gain more insight into the factors that underlie changes in community\nbanking by asking community bankers. My former colleagues at the Conference of State\nBank Supervisors (CSBS) have done that in their community bank survey and the\ncompanion “Five Questions for Five Bankers” interviews.5\nResults of the 2019 survey will be revealed during the next session, but I don’t\nthink I am giving too much away to share that the factors mentioned as driving\nconsolidation this year remain consistent with previous results. The 2018 survey shows\nthat among banks indicating that they had received and seriously considered accepting an\nacquisition offer from another institution during the previous 12 months, a large majority\n4 See Berger, Demsetz, and Strahan (1999) and Focarelli, Panetta, and Salleo (2002).\n5 A video on the results of the CSBS 2018 Survey of Community Banks is available on this conference’s\nwebsite at https://www.communitybanking.org/news; for more information on the survey, see the CSBS\nwebsite at https://www.csbs.org.\n\n- 6 -\nsay the cost of regulations or the lack of economies of scale at their current size are\n“important” or “very important” in their decision to consider the offer. About half\nmention succession issues. The survey did not ask which factor bankers consider most\nimportant, and there are many possible reasons a bank would consider selling. But it\nshould not be surprising that the cost of regulation is cited as a leading factor by nearly\n75 percent of these respondents.\nWhat about those who made an offer to buy another bank during the past year? A\nmajority, 8 out of 10, cite economies of scale as a factor in making an acquisition offer.\nOther common motivations include the desire to enter a new market, the ability to exploit\nunderutilized potential at the target institution and the desire to expand within an existing\nmarket. I find these results very encouraging, reflecting an industry that believes in the\nfuture of community banking and is taking steps to invest in that future.\nWhile it was not addressed in this part of the survey, it seems to me that the cost\nof regulation could have been a factor in making acquisition offers, possibly based on the\ntheory that there could be efficiency gains by spreading fixed regulatory costs over a\nlarger firm. It is possible these savings may have been a factor for the roughly 80 percent\nwho cited “economies of scale.” More detailed questions in future surveys could provide\nfirmer evidence about the effect of regulatory costs on decisions related to consolidation.\nThe “Five Questions for Five Bankers” initiative provides many additional\ninsights into the forces driving change in community banking. I find this initiative\nparticularly valuable, because it is conducted by state banking commissioners who I\nknow from my experience have deep insights into conditions in their states. Last year,\n28 commissioners conducted structured interviews with a small number of community\n\n- 7 -\nbankers in their states. The results show that bank consolidation is widely viewed as a\ntrend that will continue into the future. Many bankers see that as a concern, but others\nsee consolidation as an opportunity. Bankers from many states cited regulatory burden or\ncompliance costs as major factors driving consolidation. Other frequently mentioned\nmotives for consolidation were the costs of keeping up with technological change and the\nneed to scale up in order to compete in a technology-focused landscape and with non-\nbank fintech firms in some service areas. Succession planning and finding employees\nwere other common concerns, and bankers in a few states mentioned population decline\nin some rural areas as a significant issue driving the consolidation trend.\nThe Five Questions interviews provide a wealth of anecdotes about industry\ntrends, and I would encourage researchers to consider utilizing the detailed interview\napproach in exploring the causes and effects of community bank consolidation.\nIt is important to point out that many of the changes to community banking\nthrough consolidation that I have described, in a general sense, are a natural and often\ndesirable consequence of competition in a vibrant market economy. However,\nconsolidation is less desirable when it limits access and choice for customers without\nother benefits, or when it is an unintended effect of government regulation and the cost of\nthat regulation rather than a result of vigorous competition.\nThis isn’t news to community bankers or to community banking researchers. It is\nnot news to many people who live in small towns or urban areas who have lost access to\ncommunity banks with deep roots in the community. And it is a major challenge for\nthose who live in areas that lack access to service from any bank.\n\n- 8 -\nAcquiring banks need to consider that when you purchase a community bank and\nenter into a new market, along with the new customers and opportunities come a\nresponsibility to be a part of and to support that community. That is why I believe it is\ncritical that we work together to find ways to preserve the benefits provided to\ncommunities by well-managed, strong financial institutions that are deeply grounded in\nthe areas they serve—including the communities that they expand or merge into.\nNow let’s consider how the changes I have described in the banking industry have\naffected the benefits provided to local communities across the United States. One might\nexpect that the decline in the number of banks over the past few decades would mean\ncommunities would see fewer banks operating within the average local banking market.\nIn fact, when viewing the data in a national perspective, the number of banks per local\nmarket has been quite stable over time in both urban and rural areas. There may be two\nfactors that explain this outcome. First, many bank mergers combine firms that do not\noperate in the same local area, so they don’t reduce the number of competitors in any\nmarket. Second, many banks continue to expand their geographic scope by opening\nbranches in new markets, leading to an increase in the number of banks in those local\nareas that offsets the decline from bank mergers in the same market.\nOf course, stability in the average number of banks across a large number of\nmarkets does not imply stability locally within each market. Many local markets have\nseen declines in the number of banks, while others have experienced increases. And even\nif the number of banks in a community does not change, there is a difference for\ncustomers and communities between a branch of a bank with numerous locations and the\n\n- 9 -\nheadquarters of a bank that is strongly rooted in a community. For example, does bank\nconsolidation influence the availability of credit to local small businesses?\nA number of studies have addressed this question and have yielded mixed results.\nThe effect of a merger on small business lending depends on a number of factors,\nincluding the size of the merging banks, whether the acquirer is focused on small\nbusiness lending, and the response of other local banks to the merger.6 Studies have also\nshown that the post-merger bank tends to be healthier than the target institution was\nbefore the merger, which could to lead to an increase in the availability of credit in the\ncommunity.7 The bottom line is that some studies find small business lending goes up\nafter mergers, and others find it goes down. Given the wide range of results, this is\nanother topic where policymakers and the public would benefit from further research and\nanalysis.\nOne very clear trend in the United States is a decline in the number of bank\nheadquarters. Acquisitions have resulted in the conversion of many bank headquarters\ninto new branches of the acquiring institution. Unfortunately, some evidence suggests\nthat these conversions may adversely affect the local communities that are no longer\nhome to a headquarters. The impacts extend well beyond the availability of credit. Bank\nexecutives and staff who serve on the local chamber of commerce or on the boards of\nlocal hospitals or nonprofits may move to the new headquarters location, creating a\nleadership void in their old hometown.\nUnfortunately, community involvement like this is difficult to measure. We\nturned to Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) performance evaluations in the hope that\n6 For example, see Berger and others (1998), Peek and Rosengren (1998), and Avery and Samolyk (2004).\n7 See Jagtiani, Kotliar, and Maingi (2016).\n\n- 10 -\nthey would offer some insights into local involvement by banks. Because certain\ninstitutions are subject to community development tests, their performance evaluations\ninclude information on the bank’s qualifying loans, investments (including donations)\nand services, grants, and certain community service activities.8\nComparing performance evaluations from CRA exam reports before and after an\nacquisition can provide some limited, case-specific evidence on the potential\nconsequences of the loss of a bank headquarters. Several examples from the past decade\nshow that local donations and community service activity decline in communities that\nlost a bank headquarters following a merger. Pre-merger CRA evaluations detailed\ndonations to organizations targeting initiatives such as child care, job training, homeless\nshelters, and scholarship programs for low- and moderate-income (LMI) individuals.\nOther notable activities included in-kind donations of real estate to Habitat for Humanity\nand monetary contributions to food pantries, Meals on Wheels, and Big Brothers Big\nSisters of America. Bank officers and employees also donated significant time to\ncommunity service including through financial education to LMI individuals, mentoring\nprograms, and service on the boards of local housing development agencies. Many of\nthese benefits were lost after a merger. The wealth of information that supervisors\ninclude in the CRA reports offers a unique look into the type of involvement that\ncommunities potentially stand to lose when headquarters move or are eliminated. More\n8 Under CRA, a small institution has assets of less than $321 million as of December 31 in both of the two\nprior calendar years. An intermediate small institution has at least $321 million in assets and less than\n$1.284 billion in assets under the same calendar rules. A large institution has greater than $1.284 billion in\nassets as of December 31 in both prior calendar years. Activities that qualify for community development\ntests must primarily focus on economic development, revitalization of low- and moderate-income (LMI)\nlocales, affordable housing, and services that target to LMI individuals. Large and intermediate small\nbanks are subject to review of their community development activities while some small banks voluntarily\nchoose to have their community development activities reviewed.\n\n- 11 -\nresearch into the effects of losing a bank headquarters could help determine whether\nthese examples are isolated or a predictable result of consolidation.\nIn closing, let me return to the question of what we know and what we would like\nto know. We know that consolidation accelerated after the Congress removed barriers to\ninterstate banking, and that it has proceeded more or less steadily since that time. We do\nnot know if and to what extent other factors—such as achieving a desired level of\neconomies of scale, for example—have been driving consolidation. We have recently\nseen a rising number of acquisitions by credit unions, and we do not fully understand the\nimplications of this trend, which seems likely to continue to accelerate. We know that\nprofitability is a more important factor in predicting acquisitions than bank size or\ngeographic area, but more research on why some smaller banks are more profitable than\nothers could be valuable. We know from the CSBS surveys that regulatory costs are\nmotivating banks that are considering selling or merging, and we could learn more about\nwhat is motivating buyers.\nDeeper and more creative research is certainly needed to understand how\nacquisitions affect many communities, small businesses, and consumers. One factor is\nthe vital leadership and supporting role many small banks play in their communities.\nWhile that benefit may be hard to measure, I think it is essential that researchers try to do\nso. Communities need leaders and institutions that are deeply rooted in their cities,\ntowns, and rural areas. Strong relationships and extensive experience are not easily\nreplaced.\nFinally, it is important that we understand why so few new banks have been\ncreated. Are asset thresholds too high? Are regulations too burdensome? Or have low\n\n- 12 -\ninterest rates meant that net interest rate margins are just too narrow? Understanding the\nlack of new bank formation is as important as understanding the extent of consolidation\nand competition.\nI am sure you have noticed that I have given you more questions than answers\ntoday. That was one of my goals, because I am confident that as researchers you have the\nskills and creativity to focus on the best questions and find the most insightful answers.\nAnd when you do uncover new insights, my colleagues and I will always be eager to\nlearn from and act on what you have found.\n\n- 13 -\nReferences\nAvery, Robert B., and Katherine A.

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n2022 CEO & Senior Management Summit sponsored by\nthe Kansas Bankers Association\nColorado Springs, Colorado\nAugust 6, 2022\n\nThanks to the Kansas Bankers Association for the invitation to share my\nperspective on the economy and bank regulation. It is always a pleasure to be here with\nyou for this annual gathering. I am especially looking forward to hearing what is on your\nminds about supervision and regulation, how you are navigating current economic\nconditions, and your expectations going forward.\nI’ll start with a recap of the decision from July’s Federal Open Market Committee\nmeeting and then move on to my thoughts about the current economic uncertainty and\nchallenges that lie ahead. The number one challenge, of course, is inflation, which\ncontinues to be much too high, and a heavy burden for households and businesses. As\nI’m sure you all already know, the Federal Open Market Committee decided last week to\nraise the federal funds rate by 75 basis points, to a range of 2¼ to 2½ percent. I will\nshare my reasoning for supporting this increase and why I support continued increases\nuntil inflation is on a consistent path to significantly decline. I will then touch on the\ncurrent federal regulatory climate and the Fed’s agenda for supervision.\nInflation continued to climb in June, reaching 9.1 percent as measured by the\nconsumer price index. This is yet another concerningly high reading, and it set another\n40-year record high despite the expectation of many forecasters that inflation had peaked\nearlier in the year. I have seen few, if any, concrete indications that support this\nexpectation, and I will need to see unambiguous evidence of this decline before I\nincorporate an easing of inflation pressures into my outlook.\nMany of the underlying causes of excessive inflation are the same as they have\nbeen over the past year or so—supply chain issues, including those related to China’s\n\n- 2 -\nCOVID containment policies, constrained housing supply, the ongoing conflict in\nUkraine, fiscal stimulus, and limitations on domestic energy production.\nRegardless of the source of the inflationary pressure, the Federal Reserve has a\nduty to bring inflation down to our 2 percent target. This duty is mandated by Congress\nto carry out monetary policy that results in price stability—meaning low and stable\ninflation. We all understand why this is a critically important responsibility, especially in\ntimes of extreme inflation. Rising prices for food, housing, and energy negatively impact\naffordability for all Americans, but especially those with low or moderate incomes. For\nthose workers who drive long distances to get to work, high inflation is especially\nconcerning, requiring some to make tradeoffs between feeding their families and buying\nfuel to fill gas tanks. Some workers have seen their wages grow significantly over the\npast two years, but most have seen any gains in wages far outpaced by higher prices.\nTherefore, in my mind, it is absolutely critical that we continue to use our monetary\npolicy tools until we are successful in returning inflation to our 2 percent goal.\nBusinesses are also suffering from elevated inflation through rising and volatile\nprices for inputs and the need to price their own goods and services to cover costs without\nlosing customers. This dynamic is evident in agriculture and what we are hearing\ndirectly from farmers and ranchers, who are dealing with added weather challenges and\non-going drought. Prices for commodities have declined lately but are still at historically\nhigh levels. In contrast, prices for fertilizer and many crop inputs continue to rise. In\nsome areas, high input costs and drought conditions are contributing to record early\nseason cattle auction sales, as many ranchers choose to sell herds early to limit further\noutlays for input expenses.\n\n- 3 -\nI see a significant risk of high inflation into next year for necessities including\nfood, housing, fuel, and vehicles. Rents have grown dramatically, and while home sales\nhave slowed, the continued increasing price of single-family homes indicates to me that\nrents won’t decline anytime in the near future. Recently, gasoline prices have moderated\nbut are still roughly 80 percent higher than pre-pandemic levels due to constrained\ndomestic supply and the disruption of world markets. And I see continued inflation risk\nfrom motor vehicle prices, as auto manufacturers struggle with supply chain problems\nthat haven’t improved significantly. Demand for cars continues to exceed supply, and\nretail used car prices are still very high, about 50 percent more than before the pandemic.\nThe supply problems pushing up inflation seem likely to persist. Indications are\nthat the conflict in Ukraine will continue, and that the effects of shipping disruptions of\nagriculture products and limits on energy supplies from Russia will continue to be a\nsignificant problem. Even with the recent agreement intended to facilitate Ukrainian\ngrain exports, it is unclear whether supply pressures on global markets will ease as a\nresult. An announced reduction in Russian natural gas supplies to Western Europe has\ndriven European prices even higher, causing ripple effects on world energy markets and\nraising concerns about shortages this winter. China has eased some of its most stringent\nCOVID containment measures but recently revived travel restrictions in some areas, and\nits approach to the pandemic remains an upside risk for inflation. Despite a slowdown in\nsales of new and existing homes, inventories of homes for sale and rental vacancies\nremain low, supporting ongoing increases in housing costs.\nOn the other side of our dual mandate, maximum employment, we continue to see\na tight labor market, though there are some emerging signs that would support\n\n- 4 -\nexpectations of loosening. Yesterday’s job report showed continued significant growth in\nhiring with the unemployment rate finally returning to the pre-pandemic level of 3.5\npercent. As I am sure you all know, the job market in Kansas is even stronger, with an\nunemployment rate of 2.4 percent in June. In our state, finding workers is a bigger\nproblem in most communities than finding a job.\nOne aspect of the job market that has not recovered is labor force participation.\nBased on the pre-pandemic trend, there are nearly four million people who are still sitting\nout of a strong labor market.\nIn contrast to this labor market strength in Kansas and nationwide, output growth\nhas slowed this year. Real gross domestic product, GDP, edged lower in the second\nquarter, following a larger decline in the first quarter.\nMy base case is for a pickup in growth during the second half of this year and for\nmoderate growth in 2023. As we learned during the summer and fall of 2021, both GDP\nand jobs numbers are subject to significant revision, both in subsequent months and then\nagain the next year. From my perspective, had we known at the time about the eventual\nlarge upward revisions in last year’s employment data, we likely would have significantly\naccelerated our monetary policy actions. Going forward, we have to consider the\npossibility of these kinds of revisions when making real-time judgments as policymakers,\nwhich includes looking at other kinds of indicators instead of relying too heavily on the\ndata. Taking all of that on board, while the data on economic activity are indeed lower\nand the view is murky, the evidence on inflation is absolutely clear, which brings me to\nthe implications for monetary policy.\n\n- 5 -\nBased on current economic conditions and the outlook I just described, I\nsupported the FOMC’s decision last week to raise the federal funds rate another 75 basis\npoints. I also support the Committee’s view that “ongoing increases” would be\nappropriate at coming meetings. My view is that similarly-sized increases should be on\nthe table until we see inflation declining in a consistent, meaningful, and lasting way.\nOn the subject of forward guidance, I am pleased to see that following the July\nmeeting, the FOMC ended the practice of providing specific forward guidance in our\npost-meeting communications. I believe that the overly specific forward guidance\nimplemented at the December 2020 FOMC meeting requiring “substantial further\nprogress” unnecessarily limited the Committee’s actions in beginning the removal of\naccommodation later in 2021. In my view, that, combined with data revisions that were\ndirectly relevant to our decision making, led to a delay in taking action to address rising\ninflation.\nIt is helpful that the FOMC provided clear direction earlier this year that it was\nprepared to act quickly to tighten monetary policy. Since we have now taken actions to\nraise rates and finally reduce the Fed’s balance sheet, we are following through on that\ncommitment. Looking ahead, the FOMC will be getting two months of data on inflation\nand another month on employment before our next meeting in September, and while I\nexpect that ongoing rate increases will be appropriate, given the uncertainty in how those\ndata and conditions will evolve, I will allow that information to guide my judgment on\nhow big the increases will need to be.\nI do expect that the labor market will remain strong as we continue to increase\ninterest rates and allow the balance sheet to run off, but there is a risk that our actions will\n\n- 6 -\nslow job gains, or even reduce employment. Growth has softened, and perhaps this is an\nindication that our actions to tighten monetary policy are having the desired effect, with\nthe ultimate goal of bringing demand and supply into greater balance.\nWhen considering the risks to the labor market, these risks must be viewed in the\ncontext of its current strength and with the understanding that our primary challenge is to\nget inflation under control. In fact, the larger threat to the strong labor market is\nexcessive inflation, which if allowed to continue could lead to a further economic\nsoftening, risking a prolonged period of economic weakness coupled with high inflation,\nlike we experienced in the 1970s.\nIn any case, we must fulfill our commitment to lowering inflation, and I will\nremain steadfastly focused on this task.\nWith my outlook out of the way, let me turn to another of my responsibilities at\nthe Fed, which is bank regulation and supervision. I am sure that we will have the\nopportunity to discuss many issues of interest to you during our discussion, but I’d like to\nmention a pending rulemaking that would update the Community Reinvestment Act. I\nunderstand that the draft rule was intended to provide greater clarity to banks regarding\ncommunity development activities and their consideration for CRA. While I am a strong\nsupporter of the fundamentals behind CRA, and I support community development\nactivities, I am concerned that the proposal does not adequately account for the costs and\nbenefits of certain provisions, and that no attempt has even been made to either ensure\nthat or to analyze whether the benefits exceed the costs, which is a fundamental element\nof effective regulation. The comment period for the proposal ended on August 5, and I\nwill repeat what I have said in the past: if this proposal affects you or your business, I\n\n- 7 -\nhope that you made your voice heard by submitting a comment to the more than 600-\npage proposal within the short 90-day comment period. Public comments really do\nmatter when considering the content of proposed rulemakings.\nOf course, my comments about the benefits of public participation in rulemaking\napply beyond the CRA proposal, and there are other regulatory topics on the horizon that\nwould benefit from robust engagement. One that comes to mind is the regulatory\nframework for analyzing bank mergers. Earlier this year, the Justice Department\nrequested comment on whether to revise their 1995 Bank Merger Competitive Review\nguidelines, seeking input on a wide range of issues. The FDIC also issued a request for\ninformation on the Bank Merger Act framework. I expect this review will be a focus\nacross the banking agencies, and I will be very interested to see how the framework for\nsmall and regional banks is affected by any proposed change. I would be concerned\nabout any changes that would result in making mergers among these institutions more\ndifficult or would not address some of the longstanding issues with the existing\nframework. Among those are that the framework doesn’t account for new technologies\nor overwhelming competition posed by credit unions, internet based financial services,\nand non-bank financial companies. Another concern is that overly strict criteria for\nmergers could have the unintended consequence of depriving consumers in some areas of\naccess to any banking services. “Banking deserts” in rural and underserved areas are a\nreal problem and regulators should guard against this outcome when proposing or\nevaluating rules.\nI should also briefly mention three other regulatory topics of interest to all banks,\nincluding those here today.\n\n- 8 -\nFirst, the Fed’s LIBOR proposal is currently out for comment on a short timeline.\nThat proposal implements the recently passed LIBOR Act by providing default rules for\ncertain contracts that use the soon to be discontinued reference rate. Second, comments\nare currently under review for the third-party risk management guidance jointly proposed\nby the Fed with the other banking agencies. Banks and third parties will benefit from\nclear guidance that helps banks navigate the challenging issues and risks raised by third\nparty engagement.\nFinally, another area that could benefit from more regulatory clarity is digital\nassets, including stablecoins and crypto assets. Some banks are considering expanding\ninto a range of crypto activities, including custody, lending backed by crypto collateral,\nand facilitating the purchase and sale of these assets for their customers. In the absence\nof clear guidance, banks should consult with their primary regulator and exercise caution\nwhen engaging with customers in these types of activities.\nI will conclude with a brief comment on supervision. While the trend of returning\nto on-site bank examination is continuing, progress has been somewhat slow. This may\nbe driven in part by the varied pace of employees returning to the office. That said, the\nFed intends to return to some form of on-site supervision. We find substantial value in\nthose in-person interactions during bank examinations.\nIn closing, thank you again for the opportunity to speak to you today. I look\nforward to hearing how high inflation is affecting you and your communities and your\nthoughts on the regulatory agenda.",

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe Wharton Financial\nRegulation Conference\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania\nApril 14, 2023\n\nIt is a pleasure to join you here today to discuss financial regulation. I thought this\nconference would be a good opportunity to share how I think about the evolution of the financial\nservices landscape, in particular my views on de novo bank formation, or really the lack thereof.\nAs a part of this discussion, I’ll identify reasons why policymakers should take a careful look at\nthe lack of de novo activity over the past decade, and the potential impacts on local and regional\neconomies and the broader financial sector should this trend continue, before discussing the\npotential policy response.1\nDe novo bank formation has essentially stagnated for the past decade during a time when\nfinancial services have rapidly evolved. Banks continue to face increasing competition from\ncredit unions and nonbank lenders, and significant consolidation over this time has resulted in a\ndecline in the number of bank charters in the U.S. Many banks have focused more of their\nactivities and services on technology and innovation, with a corresponding increase in risk,\nincluding cybersecurity and operational risk. These trends will likely have significant\nconsequences. Some of these are predictable, like limiting the availability of banking services to\nunderserved communities. Others are indirect, like encouraging acquisitions through charter\nstrip applications and pushing activities outside of the federal and state bank supervisory and\nregulatory perimeter. These trends may signal dysfunction in the de novo formation process that\nneeds to be addressed by policymakers, and highlight the need for consideration of de novo\nformation as we review the U.S. regulatory and supervisory framework.\nBefore turning to the main theme of my remarks, I would like to start by addressing the\nrecent bank failures and subsequent stress in the U.S. banking system. Over the past several\nweeks some financial institutions have faced significant stress. We are still engaged in the\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of Governors of\nthe Federal Reserve System.\n\n- 2 -\nprocess of learning more about the failure of Silicon Valley Bank, including reviewing the\nregulatory framework that applied to the firm, the supervisory oversight by the Federal Reserve\nBoard, the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and California state regulators, and the role of\nthe bank’s management. The Board’s Vice Chair for Supervision is also conducting an internal\nreview of the Federal Reserve’s oversight leading up to the failure of Silicon Valley Bank and\nwill issue a report by May 1 that provides his conclusions. Of course, there are also a number of\nexternal reviews underway, which should contribute to a robust discussion about the root causes\nof the two bank failures.\nI believe that the U.S. financial system and the U.S. banking system remain safe, sound,\nstrong and resilient, and standing on a solid regulatory foundation. The review of the failure of\nSilicon Valley Bank—both the Vice Chair’s review and the independent, third-party reviews—\nshould provide useful insight into the lessons to be learned and help guide discussions among\npolicymakers about the gaps in current bank supervision and regulation and the potential for\neffective improvements to both. We should not rush to judgment with respect to these ongoing\nreviews. We need a full, accurate, and thorough examination and diagnosis before we reach\nconclusions about solutions, to ensure that the prescribed remedy addresses the underlying\nsymptoms. If we identify shortcomings in supervision and regulation, we should and will\naddress those shortcomings. While this episode has demonstrated that some changes may be\nwarranted, I do not believe the failure of these two institutions is an indictment of the broader\nregulatory landscape. The universe of financial institutions in the U.S. includes a wide variety of\nbanks, with very different business models, risk profiles, funding structures, and asset sizes.\nI’ll now turn to the main theme of my speech, and to de novo bank formation.\n\n- 3 -\nDo We Need More Banks?\nShould we be concerned about the decline in the number of banks in the U.S. banking\nsystem? In my view, we should.\nMany factors have contributed to this decline in the number of banks. But a robust and\ndiverse banking system ensures the wider access to and availability of credit, and that this credit\nreaches all levels of the income spectrum and supports a range of large and small businesses.\nAs we have seen over time, the smallest banks often outperform larger banks during\nperiods of stress like the pandemic and during the 2008 financial crisis. Given the continued\ndecline in the number of banks, preserving and enhancing the number of banks should be a\nregulatory and legislative imperative, including by encouraging new bank formation.\nHistorically, during times of economic and financial stress, the smallest institutions have\nperformed extremely well. For example, small banks demonstrated this strength during the\npandemic through their outsized commitment to supporting small businesses through the\nPaycheck Protection Program.\nFrom 2002 to 2022, the number of FDIC-insured banks declined by nearly half.2 This\nreduction in the number of chartered financial institutions seems to have largely been driven by\nthe consolidation and merger of existing financial institutions.3 While there has been a slight\nuptick in de novo formation over the past few years, compared to the years immediately\nfollowing the 2008 financial crisis,4 de novo activity has been significantly outpaced by\nconsolidation.\n2 In 2002, there were 9,354 FDIC-insured banks. By year-end 2022, that number had dropped to 4,706. “FDIC\nStatistics at a Glance–Historical Trends as of December 31, 2022,” Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation,\nhttps://www.fdic.gov/analysis/quarterly-banking-profile/statistics-at-a-glance/2022dec/fdic.pdf.\n3 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, “FDIC Statistics.”\n4 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, “FDIC Statistics.”\n\n- 4 -\nIn my view, there are several features of the current U.S. banking system that suggest\nthere is an unmet demand for de novo bank charters. I will briefly note three in particular:\n(1) the ongoing demand for “charter strip” acquisitions; (2) the shift of traditional banking\nactivities out of the banking sector into non-bank financial entities, or the “shadow banking”\nsector; and (3) the rising demand for banking-as-a-service partnerships.\nCharter Strip Acquisitions\nA charter strip acquisition occurs when a purchaser wants to open a bank with a new\nbusiness model, but instead of applying for a de novo bank charter, the purchaser simply\nacquires an existing bank. Once the acquirer is approved to take over the charter, the bank\neffectively starts over with a new business model, new banking products, and new management.\nThe replacement business model often emphasizes novel technologies and rapid growth, and if\nthe existing, legacy banking business of the target is retained, it is often operated separately from\nthe new business.\nWhat is the appeal of a charter strip? Simply put, it is often easier than chartering a new\nbank by side-stepping the de novo formation process. When evaluating a bank acquisition,\nregulators often rely on the legacy bank’s management performance and the existing supervisory\nand compliance record. The purchase of an existing charter can also bring efficiencies in terms\nof avoiding the restrictions that apply to de novo banks, which include higher capital\nrequirements and business model limitations for the first several years of the new bank’s\noperation. Another benefit to a bank purchase over de novo, is that operating banks have\nexisting core systems and other third-party relationships that can speed up the time to market for\na new bank model. Therefore, a charter strip of a healthy target bank often results in a faster and\ncheaper approval than a de novo application.\n\n- 5 -\nWhile charter strips may provide exit opportunities for the bank’s previous management\nand ownership, these transactions can have an adverse effect on local banking markets. The\ntarget institutions for charter strips are often the smallest banks. Acquired banks may provide\nservices in small towns or rural communities, areas that may lack robust competition. Even\nwhen these legacy bank businesses continue to operate as an add-on to the new charter-strip\nbusiness model, the institution as a whole tends to become riskier, jeopardizing the long-term\nviability of the legacy banking business and its ability to continue providing services to the local\ncommunity.\nPerhaps the fact that these transactions occur could signal dysfunction in the process of\nde novo chartering? A startup with a new business model should be agnostic between a charter\nstrip and de novo and may actually prefer the “clean slate” of a new bank. It would then stand to\nreason that the applications process would be agnostic between these two transactions; both have\nthe same result—the creation of a bank pursuing a new business model. The ongoing demand\nfor charter strip formations, however, reveals a disparity in treatment between de novo\nformations and charter strips, a disparity attributable to the difference in expectations and\nregulatory burden between these two paths.\nOf course, I am not suggesting that the solution is to make bank mergers and acquisitions\nmore restrictive—these, too, are part of a healthy banking system. Instead, I would suggest that\nthe regulatory framework should at least be more accommodative toward the de novo process.\nThe Shift of Traditional Banking Activities to Nonbank Financial Entities\nNonbank financial entities play a significant role in providing credit and other financial\nservices in the U.S. economy. The role of nonbanks has been driven, at least in part, by\nregulatory preferences that have encouraged a shift in lending activities from the regulated\n\n- 6 -\nbanking system to nonbanks. For example, mortgage origination and servicing—both\nlongstanding, traditional banking activities—shifted into nonbank entities following the 2008\nfinancial crisis, with the volume of one-to-four family mortgages originated by nonbanks\nsurpassing the volume originated by banks starting in 2016.5 Nonbank lenders also play a\nsignificant role in leveraged lending and corporate lending, as well as in commercial real estate\nlending, agricultural lending, and consumer credit.6\nThe growth of lending in the shadow banking system can have significant consequences\nfor the availability of credit over economic cycles, with losses eventually being transferred to\nregulated depository institutions, as appears to have occurred after the 2008 financial crisis.7\nWhile the disfavored activities may be pushed out of the regulated banking system, losses may\nbe transmitted back into the banking system through related activities like the extension of credit\nby banks to those same nonbank lenders. Regulation can exacerbate and accelerate the shift of\nactivities from insured depository institutions to nonbank financial entities. For example,\nresearch has shown that an increase in bank capital requirements for certain types of loans results\nin those loans simply being reallocated from banks to nonbanks.8 The impact on bank activity\ncan come about directly, for example, when risk weights are increased for certain asset classes,\nor indirectly, for example, when banks allocate capital internally across their various business\n5 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, “Trends in Mortgage Origination and Servicing: Nonbanks in the Post-\nCrisis Period,” FDIC Quarterly (2019): 51-69, https://www.fdic.gov/analysis/quarterly-banking-profile/fdic-\nquarterly/2019-vol13-4/fdic-v13n4-3q2019.pdf.\n6 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, “Trends in Mortgage Origination.”\n7 See Joshua Gallin, “Shadow Banking and the Funding of the Nonfinancial Sector,” Finance and Economics\nDiscussion Series 2013-50 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, May 16, 2013),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2013/201350/201350pap.pdf.\n8 See Rustom M.

Meisenzahl, and José-Luis Peydró, “The Rise of Shadow Banking:\nEvidence from Capital Regulation,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2018-039 (Washington: Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System, April 24, 2018),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2018039pap.pdf.\n\n- 7 -\nactivities. While banks are subject to significant reporting requirements, nonbanks are subject to\nfewer public reporting requirements, significantly limiting the transparency into the potential\nimpact of these activities on U.S. financial stability.\nWhile there is a broader debate over the appropriate roles for bank and nonbank credit,\nthe tradeoffs are complicated. The rise of nonbank lending has provided two important lessons\nthat can help inform policy around de novo bank formation in the United States.\nFirst, the shift of lending activities outside the regulated banking sector suggests that\nthere is disparate regulation for similar activities. Nonbank financial entities often operate with\nmany fewer constraints, including a lack of capital requirements, activities restrictions, and a\nlesser degree of supervision and oversight. Nonbanks may also conduct less due diligence and\nhave lower lending standards than banks. These regulatory burdens have real-world implications\non where these traditional banking activities occur. The shift of activities to the shadow banking\nsystem can produce an unexpected and opaque buildup of risk, risk that can potentially\ndestabilize the regulated banking system and the economy more broadly. For example,\nnonbanks may be more vulnerable to runs because they lack access to discount window lending.\nSecond, the rise of nonbank lending also implies that investors have weighed in on the\nbusiness case for de novo bank formation. Regulatory burdens affect de novo formation and\nhave contributed to the migration of lending from regulated institutions. Nonbank financial\nentities have a choice about how to operate, whether to seek a bank charter or not, and the\nregulatory burdens of de novo formation—putting aside the obligations of operating within the\nregulated banking system—can themselves contribute to this shift in activities.\n\n- 8 -\nBanking-as-a-Service\nAnother phenomenon that we have seen in the banking industry is the continued rise of\n“banking-as-a-service,” in which banks enter into a partnership with a fintech company. In these\nrelationships, the fintech provides customer-facing technology, while the bank provides some\ncombination of ability to accept deposits, access to payments systems, extensions of credit, and\nissuance of debit and credit cards. These types of relationships can be valuable for community\nbanks; they can help the bank provide new services or access new customers and can give the\nbank new business growth opportunities. This type of jump-start to innovation can make\ncommunity banks more competitive with larger peers that may better be able to develop new\ntechnology and products in-house.\nAt the same time, could the rise of banking-as-a-service also be driven—at least in part—\nby the difficulty of de novo chartering? If a technology company has a new technology interface\nand product design that may better serve customer needs, it can be substantially faster to partner\nwith an existing bank than to seek a standalone charter. This can raise challenging operational\nissues about who should “own” the customer relationship, but more importantly, about who is\nresponsible for compliance obligations. From a policy perspective, there should be no net\ndifference in the compliance expectations for banking-as-a-service and de novo banks that\nengage in the same underlying activity. The policy goals should be consistency in regulatory and\nsupervisory approach.\nThe Consequences of Limited De Novo Formation\nThe continued interest in charter strip acquisitions, the shift of activities out of regulated\nbanks into the shadow banking system, and the continued growth in banking-as-a-service\npartnerships all suggest that there may be some unmet demand for bank charters. As a practical\n\n- 9 -\nmatter, the consolidation of banks coupled with a deficit of new bank formations, if left\nunaddressed over time, could have several significant consequences.\nWhen there is a decline in bank charters, and a reduction in bank branches, the net result\nin local banking markets is an increase in banking concentration—the percentage of deposits and\nloans controlled by a shrinking number of institutions—and a decrease in competition. Our\ntraditional measures of assessing the concentration of markets, and the competitive effect of bank\nmergers, is to look at deposits as a proxy for the “bundle” of banking services. While one could\nreasonably question whether deposits are a reliable indicator of the competition for all banking\nproducts, I think it is safe to assume that a reduction in the number of in-market banks is often\nrelated to a reduction in competition, customer choice, and availability of credit.9\nReduced competition can harm local communities and economies. Banks play a\nsignificant role in providing banking services, including mortgage loans, small business loans,\nand core deposit products like savings and checking accounts. For example, within bank\nlending, community banks play a significant role in providing loans to consumers and small\nbusinesses, construction and land development loans, residential lending, agriculture lending,\nand land financing.\nBanks with strong relationships to local communities also support those communities\nthrough the economic cycle. Banks located geographically close to businesses, like community\nbanks, played an important role in providing credit during the pandemic, especially through the\nPaycheck Protection Program.10 Community banks also tend to have lower loan delinquency\n9 See Michelle W. Bowman, “The New Landscape for Banking Competition,” (remarks at the 2022 Community\nBanking Research Conference, St. Louis, MO, September 28, 2022),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20220928a.pdf.\n10 See David Glancy, “Bank Relationships and the Geography of PPP Lending,” Finance and Economics Discussion\nSeries 2023-014 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, January 19, 2023)\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2023014pap.pdf.\n\n- 10 -\nand charge-off rates relative to larger banks, which may reflect local banks’ willingness to work\nwith borrowers during times of stress to restructure loans, in addition to these banks using their\nknowledge of local communities to improve loan application review and underwriting.11\nIt is likely that a more effective and efficient path to de novo bank formation would help\nsupport the U.S. banking system and the broader economy. Putting aside the broad range of\nlegal, regulatory, and supervisory factors that may influence de novo bank formation, one of the\nkey determinants in approval of a de novo application is the business case for forming a new\nbank in a particular target market. Does the target market have a strong economy and good\ngrowth prospects? Is there a lack of competition, for example, where mergers have reduced the\nnumber of banks in the market? Does existing competition leverage competitive pricing, or have\nin-market banks used their dominance to increase the cost of banking services?\nOf course, we know that a business case for creating a bank would be incomplete if it\nfocused only on market need and opportunity. The process of organizing a new bank, obtaining\na charter, and living within the strict rules applicable to de novo banks is a significant and costly\nprocess.\nImpediments to De Novo Formation and the Policy Response\nBefore policymakers can address the predictable and unintended consequences of a lack\nof de novo formations, it is helpful to consider the barriers to de novo formation. And, of those\nbarriers, can they be addressed in a way that fosters prudent de novo activity?\nRegulatory Barriers\n11 See Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, “FDIC Community Banking Study,” (Washington: Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation, December 2020), https://www.fdic.gov/resources/community-banking/report/2020/2020-\ncbi-study-full.pdf.\n\n- 11 -\nSome of the barriers to entry for de novo banks fall outside the scope of bank regulation.\nFor example, since the 2008 financial crisis, and until relatively recently, we have operated in a\nvery low interest rate environment. Low interest rate environments lead to compression of\ninterest rate spreads for taking deposits and making loans. Compressed margins, and the\ncorresponding limits on bank profitability, present significant headwinds to de novo bank\nformation and returns for initial bank investors. Similarly, the demand for banking services\ntends to track broader economic conditions, independent from bank regulatory policy.\nHowever, policymakers should carefully consider elements of the bank regulatory\nframework that adversely affect de novo formation. To be clear, many of these regulatory\nbarriers are appropriate. Insured depository institutions benefit from the federal safety net of\nFDIC deposit insurance, and the ability to access liquidity from the Federal Reserve’s discount\nwindow. These privileges carry with them substantial responsibilities, to comply with the law, to\nbe responsive to regulators, and to conduct the business of banking in a safe and sound manner\nand in compliance with consumer protection laws. At the same time, barriers to entry into the\nbanking system should not be so strict as to effectively prevent the formation of new banks. We\nshould support regulatory and supervisory policies that encourage prudent and appropriate de\nnovo bank formation.\nOrganizers of a de novo bank face a number of challenges, and the application process\nitself can be a significant impediment. The application process for a new bank charter often\nrequires multiple applications to different regulators. For example, the formation of a national\nbank with a holding company requires the approval of the OCC, FDIC, and Federal Reserve.12\nWhile each regulator may have aspirational deadlines for processing de novo charter\n12 See 12 U.S.C. § 21-27; 12 U.S.C. § 1815(a)(1); and 12 U.S.C. § 1842(a)(1).\n\n- 12 -\napplications, the time actually needed can vary considerably, and is rarely quicker than\nanticipated. The uncertainties surrounding the application timeline may compound the difficulty\nof attracting capable board members, management, and employees. Even the demands of raising\nsufficient capital—a vital step in the de novo process—may pose challenges, as the total amount\nof capital is based on a forward-looking projection of the bank’s expected future size. Investors\ncould reasonably be reluctant to commit capital facing such uncertainty. Even after approval, de\nnovo banks are subject to heightened standards and additional limits for at least three years after\ncommencing operations.13\nPolicymakers have a responsibility to ensure that de novo bank formation continues to be\nviable, to preserve dynamism and competition in the U.S. banking system. The solution should\nnot be to create roadblocks to bank mergers and acquisitions—which would lead to further\nmigration of bank activities to the shadow banking system. Instead, we need to consider how\nregulatory burdens affect private behavior and have created impediments that discourage de novo\nbank formation.\nEfficiency in Regulation and Supervision\nIn the context of de novo banks, efficiency in regulation and supervision can be thought\nof as an exercise in proportionality. In my mind, this is an extension of the risk-based\napproaches we use throughout supervision. It is certainly not a “light-touch” approach, but\nrather seeks to strike an appropriate balance based on the size, activities, business model, and\nrisks of an institution. As with any new business, simply being a de novo can present additional\n13 See “SR 20-16: Supervision of De Novo State Member Banks,” Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem, https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/srletters/SR2016.pdf; Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation, “FDIC Rescinds De Novo Time Period Extension; Releases Supplemental Guidance on Business\nPlanning,” news release, April 6, 2016, https://archive.fdic.gov/view/fdic/5121.\n\n- 13 -\nrisks, which justify heightened requirements and additional supervisory scrutiny as it grows into\na viable banking operation.\nAt the same time, policymakers need to consider whether the tight framework of\nrequirements that govern the operations of de novo banks are necessary and appropriate, and\nwhether alternatives may be more efficient. For example, consider whether requiring an up-front\ncapitalization of a de novo institution in an amount far in excess of standard capital requirements\nis necessary, or whether in some cases a phased approach that takes into account the early\nperformance of the de novo bank may provide similar risk protection with a lower capital\nburden.14, 15\nRegulatory obligations fall most heavily on small banks, including both community\nbanks and de novos. While these burdens may evolve slowly over time for existing community\nbanks—allowing banks time to adjust to heightened supervisory oversight—regulatory\nrequirements can act as an additional barrier to entry for de novo banks.\nTransparency in Expectations and Regulatory Support\nThe lack of de novo banks16 and the trend toward bank consolidation has been a concern\nfor some time, and I continue to see encouraging new bank formation as a priority. However, it\nis necessary to note that even if the regulatory message appears to support de novo activity, the\nregulatory tone in delivering this message matters. Investors and those seeking to organize a\n14 “SR 20-16: Supervision of De Novo State Member Banks” suggests that de novo banks maintain a tier 1 leverage\nratio of at least 8 percent for the first three years of its existence, and that de novo banks should receive at least two\nconsecutive CAMELS composite ratings of “1” or “2” before making capital distributions.\n15 See, e.g., H.R. 758, 118th Congress, which proposes to establish a three-year phase-in period for de novo\nfinancial institutions to comply with capital requirements. Congress, “H.R.758 - Promoting Access to Capital in\nUnderbanked Communities Act of 2023,” https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/758?s=1&r=30.\n16 See Michelle W. Bowman, “The Lack of New Bank Formations is a Significant Issue for the Banking Industry”\n(remarks at 2021 Community Bankers Symposium: Banking on the Future, Chicago, IL, October 22, 2021),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20211022a.htm.\n\n- 14 -\nnew bank notice when regulators encourage de novo formation. But almost more important than\nthe words, the tone of that message must also be accompanied by actions that support, not\ninhibit, de novo bank formation. The banking agencies have made some progress by working to\nclarify regulatory expectations, giving potential applicants greater insight into the application\nprocess and by providing opportunities for feedback earlier in the process.17 But I think we need\nto ask if these steps are sufficient, and whether they can be improved.\nOne model for greater transparency and coordination is the approach adopted by the\nPrudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the United\nKingdom. (U.K.)18 The PRA and FCA both play a role in the review and chartering of\ndepository institutions, and have jointly adopted the New Bank Start-up Unit initiative, which\nprovides transparent, single-stop resources about the life cycle of de novo bank formation,\nincluding planning, applying, early-stage operation, and eventually moving into a mature, steady\nstate as a viable banking operation.\nIn my view, the approach adopted by the New Bank Start-up Unit includes a number of\nfeatures that could help inform process improvements in the United States. While adopting some\nwould require statutory and regulatory changes, and others to some degree may already be a\ncomponent of our existing practices, I see value in looking holistically at the lessons we can\nlearn to improve transparency and encourage the formation of new banks.\n17 “SR 20-16: Supervision of De Novo State Member Banks” sets key expectations for de novo banks during their\nearly years of operation. See Jelena McWilliams, “Statement of FDIC Chairman Jelena McWilliams on the\nOversight of Financial Regulators before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate,”\n(December 5, 2019), https://www.fdic.gov/news/speeches/2019/spdec0519.html; “Licensing Manual: Charters,”\nOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency, https://www.occ.gov/publications-and-\nresources/publications/comptrollers-licensing-manual/files/licensing-booklet-charters.html.\n18 “New Bank Start-up Unit,” Bank of England, last modified March 21, 2023,\nhttps://www.bankofengland.co.uk/prudential-regulation/new-bank-start-up-unit.\n\n- 15 -\nFirst, the New Bank Start-up Unit focuses on the broader timeline of de novo formation,\nrather than addressing only isolated elements like the filing of an application or the requirements\nfor early-stage operation. The process of creating a de novo bank starts before an application is\nfiled, and is a multiyear process, ideally ending after a brief period of early operations with the\nde novo transitioning into a mature, viable banking franchise. Organizers evaluate their business\nneeds, and whether those needs are best served through the creation of a bank charter. They\ndevelop a business plan and raise capital. They develop the infrastructure to support the bank,\nboth in terms of management and personnel, but also technology, policies, and procedures.\nAddressing the long life cycle of de novo formation, and committing to engage with proposed\norganizers, can lead to better de novo applications and ultimately, more de novo banks.\nSecond, the legal framework for de novo formation in the U.K. involves multiple\nregulators, but tasks those regulators with distinct, complementary assessment objectives. The\nPRA focuses on safety and soundness, and promoting competition between firms, while the FCA\nfocuses on protecting consumers, enhancing the integrity of the U.K. financial system, and\npromoting competition in the interest of consumers. A legal framework that reduces overlapping\nand redundant evaluations can help facilitate efficiency in the application process and can\npromote greater consistency.\nThird, the New Bank Start-up Unit provides resources clarifying not only the\nrequirements that apply to de novo banks, but also espouses a philosophy that emphasizes\nproportionality in requirements, and a case-by-case assessment of firms. For the PRA and FCA,\nproportionality extends to the setting of capital requirements, capital management expectations,\nand the calibration of capital buffers.\n\n- 16 -\nFinally, the resources provided by the New Bank Start-up Unit emphasize the need for de\nnovo institutions to contemplate and prepare for recovery, resolvability, and a solvent wind-\ndown of operations. De novo banks often experience rapid growth, poor initial profitability, and\nloan quality issues that take time to emerge as the bank’s portfolio matures. These factors can\nmake de novo banks riskier than established banking franchises. The solution to potential\nweaknesses in de novo banks need not focus exclusively on increasing regulatory and\nsupervisory requirements, particularly if there are lower cost alternatives like improved\ntransparency, and better preparation for resolvability and solvent wind-down. While higher\nexpectations and more capital can improve the resiliency of a de novo bank, those same\nexpectations can contribute to a decline in the overall number of de novo charters.\nClosing Thoughts\nIn my view, right-sizing regulatory requirements, improving transparency, and supporting\nregulatory approaches that support new banks are important tools to promote healthy competition\nand reduce unintended consequences. We need a viable pipeline for the creation of new banks in\nthe United States, and there are troubling indications that we are falling short on this front, with a\ncontinued decline in the number of banks in the United States, the continued interest in charter\nstrip applications, and the ongoing shift of traditional bank activities into shadow banks.\nWhile de novo bank formation may not be a top-of-mind issue for policymakers as we\ncontinue to deal with the recent bank failures, it remains an important issue. As policymakers\nconsider the regulatory and supervisory framework in the U.S. banking system and consider\nspecific adjustments to address identified shortcomings, we should also take into account the\nimpact of incremental additional regulatory changes not only on de novo bank formation, but\nalso on credit availability, competition, and the financial system.",

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n19th BCBS-FSI High-Level Meeting for Africa\nCape Town, South Africa\nFebruary 15, 2024\n\nIntroduction\nThank you to the Financial Stability Institute of the Bank for International Settlements\nand especially to its Chair, Fernando Restoy for the invitation to speak about these important\ntopics.1 I’d also like to thank the South African Reserve Bank for hosting this gathering. It is a\npleasure to join you in Cape Town, and I am delighted to speak with you about advancing cross-\nborder payments and financial inclusion. I find great value in engaging with and learning from\nour international colleagues on these international and domestic issues.\nWe are all participants in a global and interconnected financial ecosystem, and payments\nare a vital component of this system. The payments landscape continues to evolve, through\ninfrastructure upgrades, innovation, changing consumer preferences, and advancements in both\nthe public and private sectors. Faster, cheaper, more transparent, and more inclusive cross-\nborder payment services offer widespread benefits for citizens and economies around the world,\nwith the potential to support economic growth, international trade, global development, and\nfinancial inclusion.\nThis global ecosystem is comprised of individual jurisdictions, each with its own history,\npublic policy objectives, payment infrastructures, and regulatory environments. Within these\nindependent economies exist a wide range of businesses and consumers, all with vastly different\nneeds and requirements. As policymakers, we must consider not only how to foster safe,\nefficient, and accessible payment and settlement infrastructures to support the broader financial\nsystem but also how those same systems and infrastructures can support the needs of consumers,\nbusinesses, and financial service providers. This includes support for responsible innovation and\n1Thank you to Priyanka Slattery and Alex Sproveri of the Federal Reserve Board for their assistance in preparing\nthis text. The views expressed here are my own are and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board.\n\n- 3 -\nenabling providers, such as banks and other nonbank financial service providers, to meet the\nevolving needs of their customers.\nIn many cases, the policy tradeoffs we face domestically are amplified in the cross-border\ncontext. To foster safety and efficiency in the payment system, it is imperative to seek\nimprovements that support an accessible and inclusive system that works for the broad spectrum\nof different participants, while still maintaining rigorous risk, fraud prevention, and compliance\nstandards that are critical for protecting participants and the overall system. It is also important\nto note that these issues are complex and will not be resolved through advances in technology\nalone. Rather, changes in technology must align with the evolution in individual behavior and\nmarket conventions, and when this does occur, it does so only over time.\nToday, I will share my views on the evolving cross-border payments landscape, discuss\nhow financial inclusion is framed within this broader context, highlight the roles that both the\npublic and private sectors play, and identify actions that the Federal Reserve is taking to improve\npayment system infrastructures and support responsible innovation. Throughout, I will highlight\nthe key challenges and public policy tradeoffs that we, as policymakers, should consider.\nComplexity and Challenges of the Cross-Border Payments Landscape\nCross-border payments face a number of challenges, including high costs, low speed,\nbarriers to access, and limited transparency.2 Today, cross-border payments are carried out\nthrough a diverse, multilayered set of networks and are inherently more complex than domestic\npayments as they involve multiple participants, infrastructures, currencies, time zones,\njurisdictions, and legal and regulatory frameworks. These challenges add complexity and create\nfrictions in the cross-border payments process, leading to higher transaction costs and slower\n2 See Financial Stability Board, Enhancing Cross-Border Payments: Stage 1 Report to the G20 (Financial Stability\nBoard, April 2020), https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P090420-1.pdf.\n\n- 4 -\nprocessing times for consumers and businesses. To help address these frictions, the G20\ncountries agreed in 2020 to a multiyear roadmap to identify and develop improvements to cross-\nborder payments.3 The G20 Roadmap for Enhancing Cross-Border Payments is an instructive\nexample of collaboration across jurisdictions, engaging in international dialogs and working with\nthe private sector to identify how best to ease unnecessary frictions.\nAs one who values efficiency, I am generally supportive of opportunities to address\nunnecessary frictions. However, when considering frictions related to cross-border payments,\nsome are necessary while others may not be necessary. Any discussion of these frictions must be\nnuanced and properly contextualized since there are public policy tradeoffs and operational\nrealities that must be considered. Some frictions may be the result of intentional policy choices\nand safeguards implemented to protect the parties involved in a transaction while also protecting\nthe financial system as a whole. Other frictions may result from consumer or business\npreferences. As policymakers, we must consider all of these frictions within this broader\ncontext.\nLet’s take compliance requirements as an example. Banks play a critical role in\nimplementing compliance and reporting requirements that support public policy objectives,\nincluding the deterrence of financial crimes and countering terrorism finance. In the United\nStates and other jurisdictions, banks balance this need for transparency to deter crime with the\nneed to protect the privacy of consumer financial data.4 While regulatory compliance\n3 For more information on the G20 cross-border payments improvement roadmap and its progress, see Financial\nStability Board, Enhancing Cross-border Payments: Stage 3 Roadmap (Financial Stability Board, October 2020),\nhttps://www.fsb.org/2020/10/enhancing-cross-border-payments-stage-3-roadmap/ and Financial Stability Board,\nG20 Roadmap for Enhancing Cross-border Payments: Consolidated Progress Report for 2023 (Financial Stability\nBoard, October 2023), https://www.fsb.org/2023/10/g20-roadmap-for-enhancing-cross-border-payments-\nconsolidated-progress-report-for-2023/\n4 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Money and Payments: The U.S. Dollar in the Age of\nDigital Transformation (Washington: Board of Governors, January 2022),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/money-and-payments-20220120.pdf.\n\n- 5 -\nrequirements add complexity, particularly in cross-border payments, it is a complexity that\nresults from the discretion to apply various compliance frameworks in different jurisdictions.\nWith this in mind, we can consider ways to encourage more consistent implementation of\nrigorous international standards and continue to support the development of new technologies\nand solutions that help automate processes, reduce costs, and promote effective safeguards across\njurisdictions.\nAs I have discussed in previous remarks, while conversations on payments innovation\noften focus on technological capabilities as the solution to realizing certain benefits, technology\non its own is not always the driver of realizing these benefits since many of these issues are\ngrounded in policy choices and operational realities.5 However, it is still important to assess\npotential opportunities for technological innovation and the benefits technology could provide\nwithin the broader context of a robust, well-functioning global banking and payments system. I\nhave long supported responsible innovation that solves specific problems and enables financial\nservice providers to meet the needs of consumers and businesses in a safe and sound manner.\nDespite the difficulty and complexity of overcoming cross-border frictions and\nchallenges, we can work together, through the G20 and in other collaborative settings, to identify\nways to make incremental and tangible progress. There are many tools to consider—such as\ninfrastructure improvements, sharing best practices across jurisdictions, improving data flows,\nand recognizing innovative technologies and business models. This work will likely require a\ncombination of these tools to reduce unnecessary frictions while still achieving significant policy\ngoals.\n5 See Michelle W. Bowman, “Responsible Innovation in Money and Payments” (speech at Roundtable on Central\nBank Digital Currency, Harvard Law School Program on International Financial Systems, Washington, D.C.,\nOctober 17, 2023), https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20231017a.htm.\n\n- 6 -\nPayments and Financial Inclusion\nI will turn now to discuss financial inclusion, which is an important lens through which\npolicymakers should consider these challenges.6 Many features of the payment system—such as\naccess, cost, and speed—have profound implications for financial inclusion. In my view, the\npayment system and the broader economy are most efficient and effective when there is broad\nparticipation, when unnecessary frictions are minimized, and when banks, especially smaller\nfinancial institutions, can provide services to meet consumer demand in a safe and sound\nmanner. An inclusive financial system offers accessible choices that meet consumers’ needs and\nenhance their financial well-being. From a consumer’s perspective, this means the opportunity\nto make payments, to build wealth and gain access to credit and other needed financial services\nto participate in an increasingly digital and interconnected economy.\nAccess to the payments system enables consumers to meet financial obligations by\nreceiving and transferring money safely and in a timely manner. Reliable, cost-efficient payment\nservices promote financial inclusion by providing consumers with options that meet their various\nneeds. This is critical because financial inclusion is not a one-size-fits-all solution. In the U.S.,\nfor example, consumers come from a wide range of economic circumstances; have varied\nperceptions of and experiences with the banking system; and, most importantly, have different\nneeds when it comes to financial products and services.\nIt is also essential to note that gaps in financial inclusion differ across jurisdictions. In\nsome cases, these gaps stem from the limited availability of and individual ability to access the\nvarious types of payment and financial services provided in different countries.

Thus, policymakers and service providers within each jurisdiction are best\nsuited to tailor solutions within their own domestic context.\nAlthough each jurisdiction is unique, we as policymakers should be willing to collaborate\nand assess opportunities for systemic improvements that could provide widespread benefits,\nincluding the work of the G20 in support of cross-border payments. Minimizing unnecessary\nfrictions is a worthy goal whether the intended beneficiary is an international financial\ninstitution, a small business or nonprofit managing cashflow with international customers, or a\nconsumer simply seeking to send and receive payments, needing to do so safely without\nexcessive fees or experiencing extended delays in receiving funds.\nIn the context of cross-border payments, global remittances can also play a significant\nrole in expanding financial inclusion. In some countries, these remittances are an economic\ndriver by serving as a key source of funding for some households, which can provide a path to a\nmore inclusive economy. As a result, it is critical that consumers can send and receive these\ntypes of payments safely, efficiently, and affordably. Research has shown that the ability to\nreceive remittances increases the probability of having a bank account and contributes to\neconomic engagement.7 Yet, high fee structures for remittance services can have a significant\nimpact on households sending money abroad. Recent data show the average cost for sending a\n$200 remittance from the United States was approximately 5.8 percent of the transaction amount,\nor about $12.8 The G20 countries have reaffirmed the United Nations Sustainable Development\n7 Gemechu Ayana Aga and Maria Soledad Martinez Peria, “International Remittances and Financial Inclusion in\nSub-Saharan Africa,” Policy Research Working Paper (Washington: World Bank Group, Development Research\nGroup, July 2014), https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/19e5d9c1-cabd-5c54-a4c2-\nfd2f12964b61/content.

Both public- and private-sector participants have critical and complementary roles in\nadvancing financial inclusion within a given jurisdiction and improving the efficiencies of cross-\nborder payments and remittances.\nThe payments industry has long relied upon innovation to meet the evolving needs and\nexpectations of consumers and businesses. In an increasingly digital economy, these innovations\noffer valuable options for consumers and business to send and receive payments in more\nconvenient and cost-effective ways. Today, the private sector offers opportunities to expand\naccess to digital payments and other financial services. For example, in the U.S., the Bank On\nprogram promotes a national standard for customer bank accounts that are both low cost and low\nrisk.10 Other jurisdictions have incorporated improvements in financial access through mobile\nmoney transaction accounts. Some payment service providers have established partnerships to\nexpand upon the options available to consumers and businesses for sending and receiving funds.\nOther private sector initiatives are exploring technology enhancements to offer more\nconvenient digital options for consumers and businesses to send remittances or make payments\n9 See United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Transforming Our World: the 2030 Agenda for\nSustainable Development (United Nations), https://sdgs.un.org/2030agenda and Financial Stability Board, Targets\nfor Addressing the Four Challenges of Cross-Border Payments: Final Report (Financial Stability Board, October\n2021), https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P131021-2.pdf.\n10 See “Bank On,” Cities for Financial Empowerment Fund, https://cfefund.org/project/bank-on/. In the United\nStates, approximately 95.5 percent of U.S. households were “banked” in 2021, meaning that at least one member of\nthe household held a bank account.

These private sector developments complement ongoing public sector cross-\nborder initiatives, including the G20 work. Continued collaboration like these efforts across the\npublic and private sectors must support responsible innovation, including a well-defined\nregulatory perimeter that protects consumers and the broader financial system.\nI’d like to take a moment to highlight two instances in which the Federal Reserve has\nprovided clarity to support financial inclusion within a framework of responsible innovation.\nFirst, the Fed issued an interagency statement in support of banks engaging in small-dollar\nlending.11 This guidance underscores the importance of financial institutions offering small-\ndollar loan products to consumers and small businesses that support successful repayment\noutcomes and that avoid continuous cycles of debt due to rollover and reborrowing.\nAdditionally, the statement recognizes that these products can help borrowers transition into\nother types of credit-based financial products. Second, the Fed also issued an interagency\nstatement on the use of alternative data in credit underwriting.12 This guidance clarifies that with\na customer’s consent, a bank can use alternative data, like checking account balance activity, to\nhelp evaluate the creditworthiness of a potential borrower who might not otherwise qualify for a\nloan. In both cases, timely guidance has sought to support responsible innovation and leverage\nthe cashflow information on deposit accounts to meet their customers’ needs.\nWhile I have highlighted a few examples that illustrate the connection between payments\nand financial inclusion, the Fed supports and participates in several initiatives to broadly enhance\n11 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, National Credit\nUnion Administration, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, “Interagency Lending Principles for Making\nResponsible Small-Dollar Loans,” SR letter 20-14 / CA letter 20-8 (May 20, 2020).\n12 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation, National Credit Union Administration, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,\n\"Interagency Statement on the Use of Alternative Data in Credit Underwriting,\" CA letter 19-11 (December 12,\n2019).\n\n- 10 -\nthese efforts. These efforts will continue to work toward fostering a U.S. economy that works\nfor everyone.13\nPayment System Improvement and International Collaboration\nFinally, I would like to highlight some recent Federal Reserve activities that support\ndomestic and international payment systems improvement and responsible innovation. The U.S.\nfinancial and payment systems currently support the effective transmission of funds, and our\nwork will continue to evaluate opportunities to improve upon an already safe and efficient\nsystem. The recent introduction of the FedNow® Service, our new interbank system for instant\npayments, and our commitment to adopt the ISO 20022 messaging standard for the Federal\nReserve’s wholesale payment service by March of next year demonstrate this ongoing effort.14\nOver the longer term, the Federal Reserve will continue to conduct research and assess\ninnovative technologies and business models to better understand their potential role in the future\npayments and financial ecosystem. This analysis must include a consideration of potential\nopportunities, risks, and tradeoffs primarily for cross-border payments and secondarily for\nfinancial inclusion.\nThe Federal Reserve also works closely with our international counterparts on payments\ninnovation and related topics. This includes work with multilateral institutions including the\nBank for International Settlements, the G7, and the Financial Stability Board, as well as bilateral\nengagements with other central banks. As I’ve discussed today, continued collaboration among\npublic-sector institutions and across the broader payments community will be essential for\n13 See Michelle W.

Policymakers must continue to consider opportunities to improve domestic\nand cross-border payment and settlement infrastructures and seek to further broader access to the\nfinancial system. At the same time, we must recognize that these challenges present\nopportunities to refine public policy decisions understanding the tradeoffs and the distinct needs\nand circumstances across jurisdictions and among consumers and businesses. Opportunities to\ndiscuss these issues, as we are today, are essential for creating opportunities to learn and\ncollaborate.\nOur progress will likely be incremental and slow, requiring a longer-term view. The\nsafety of our financial system requires that we get this right, and our pursuit of improvements in\nthe payments system must avoid the temptation to rely on new technology alone. This will\nrequire us to thoughtfully consider the many policy choices that lead to these improvements.\nThank you for the opportunity to share my views on these issues, and I look forward to\nexamining them further during the upcoming panel discussion.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n3:20 p.m. EDT\nMay 15, 2024\nInnovation and the Evolving Financial Landscape\nRemarks by\nMichelle W. Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe Digital Chamber DC Blockchain Summit 2024\nWashington, D.C.\nMay 15, 2024\n\nI would like to thank the Digital Chamber for the invitation to share my perspectives on\ninnovation in the financial system.1 I welcome opportunities like this to engage in discussions\nthat include both the public and private sector on this important topic. These conversations help\ninform my understanding of and expectations for how technology can enhance financial services\nin a manner that is consistent with operating in the highly regulated banking industry. Today, I\nwill share my views on evolving financial technology and the importance of ongoing,\nresponsible innovation, including the roles of both the public and private sectors in shaping the\nfuture.\nIn my role at the Federal Reserve, I view financial innovation through the lens of the\ncentral bank’s responsibilities—issuing U.S. currency; conducting monetary policy; fostering a\nsafe and efficient payment system; maintaining financial stability; promoting consumer\nprotection; and supervising and regulating financial institutions. Regulators often espouse the\nbenefits of innovation—innovation can lead to greater efficiency, and it can promote competition\nin the market, which can lower the cost and expand the availability of products and services to\nconsumers and businesses.\nWhile regulators acknowledge these benefits, innovation is inevitably accompanied by\nrisk. Innovation can exacerbate traditional financial risks or introduce new risks that must be\ncarefully understood and managed. And on a basic level, the “newness” of innovation often\nleads regulators to reflexively resist these changes, whether the change takes the form of new\ntechnology, new ways of delivering products and services, new financial infrastructure that\n1 Thank you to Priyanka Slattery and Alex Sproveri of the Federal Reserve Board for their assistance in preparing\nthis text. The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nunderlies how the banking system works, and new relationships within the financial system and\nbeyond.\nSo how do regulators get comfortable with innovation? Some attending today may\nanswer that “they don’t!” And I am sure that some here in the room have experienced this\nfriction in trying to pursue innovation in a heavily regulated environment. In fairness, sometimes\n“no” is the correct regulatory response when innovation either does not solve an actual problem,\nor simply cannot be executed in a safe and sound manner and in compliance with applicable\nlaws. But my goal today is to propose some building blocks that could help regulators get to\n“yes” more often, and potentially smooth the rough path to successful innovation in the banking\nsystem.\nUnderstanding Innovation\nAs a first principle, I would offer “understanding” as a necessary predicate to promoting\ninnovation. Before we craft a useful public policy around innovation in banking, we need to\nunderstand the various dynamics involved with particular innovations. We must consider how\ninnovation can impact different financial sectors, from small banks to wholesale financial\nmarkets, and how those impacts will ultimately effect end users. For example, will “tokenized”\nproducts and platforms duplicate existing bank deposits and payment rails, potentially creating\nparallel systems? If so, will the products and platforms that duplicate these functions provide the\nsame legal protections for customers and the overall financial system?\nThe wide variety of technology and use cases can be a significant obstacle to getting to a\nplace where regulators understand any one innovation. Innovation in the financial system can\ntake many forms including new technology, new business models, and improvements to existing\ninfrastructures. As one form of innovation, distributed ledger technology (DLT), including\n\n- 3 -\nblockchain, has inspired new ways of thinking about the exchange of assets and data, in addition\nto the role of intermediaries and trusted third parties. DLT combines a number of different\ndesign elements—like distributed data storage, cryptography, and consensus mechanisms—that\nsupport the transfer process, information visibility, and transaction recordkeeping.2\nDLT is an interesting example because it highlights the challenges presented to regulators\nin understanding innovation. There are many variations in the application of DLT—and ongoing\nresearch and development creating more variability over time—which ultimately may complicate\nunderstanding how the technology can be used, and how different functionality can be\nincorporated into DLT solutions for different use cases.\nIn short, innovation can take many forms. It often involves new uses for existing\ntechnology that enhance core business lines, but it can also include the introduction of\ntransformational new technology or capabilities. Customer demands for cheaper products or for\nnew and innovative products often motivate banks to explore how technology and innovation can\nmeet these demands and provide products and services for the future.\nWhile understanding technology is an important first step, it is not the only one.\nRegulators also need to understand the players who operate in the fintech space. Banks of all\nsizes have a long history of innovation, from the introduction of checks; to the advent of ATMs\nthat allow easy access to cash and basic banking information; to online banking platforms and\nelectronic payments that have simplified and streamlined the way many consumers and\nbusinesses manage and access their funds, receive credit, and conduct financial transactions.\n2 See, e.g., Mills, David, Kathy Wang, Brendan Malone, Anjana Ravi, Jeff Marquardt, Clinton Chen, Anton Badev,\nTimothy Brezinski, Linda Fahy, Kimberley Liao, Vanessa Kargenian, Max Ellithorpe, Wendy Ng, and Maria Baird\n(2016). “Distributed ledger technology in payments, clearing, and settlement,” Finance and Economics Discussion\nSeries 2016-095. Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,\nhttps://doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2016.095.\n\n- 4 -\nInnovation helps banks upgrade their existing business lines to better meet customer needs, for\nexample, by introducing instant payments or providing credit in innovative ways.\nThere are also many nonbank providers in this space, including core service providers\nthat often hold the “keys” to innovation at small banks when they facilitate the add-on of new\ntechnology to core systems. And fintechs that may focus on even more transformational uses of\ntechnology within all aspects of banking. This presents another layer of complication when it\ncomes to innovation in banking.\nEven with an understanding of technology and of the players involved, regulators still\nneed additional feedback to understand the “why” of innovation. What is the purpose of the\ninnovation? What problem is it designed to solve? Are there tradeoffs policymakers would need\nto consider if the new technology were introduced or integrated in the existing financial system?\nThere are many examples across this spectrum of innovation. For example, take the use\ncases around DLT. Some banks are exploring the possibility of DLT as a way to help facilitate\nservices like cross-border payments and financial market transactions. Other businesses may see\nDLT as a way to improve supply chain management by tying payments to specific activities\nacross the supply chain. Some financial institutions see DLT as a potential solution for existing\nprocesses that require manual interventions and coordination across disparate systems.\nBusinesses may look at a single technology—DLT—and see possible solutions to a wide range\nof problems. When the financial system promotes innovation, we better enable firms to serve\ntheir customers’ unique needs while also advancing the capability of the financial system.\nRegulators and industry both have an important role to play in achieving this goal of\nunderstanding. Regulators cannot hope to craft effective public policy without understanding.\n\n- 5 -\nAnd while industry’s focus is rightly on developing innovative solutions, part of successful\ninnovation in the banking space is promoting education and understanding for the regulators.\nOpenness to Innovation: Getting to “Yes”\nAs a second principle, regulatory openness is a critical ingredient to fostering innovation\nin the financial system. The first reaction of regulators to proposed innovation in the banking\nsystem is often not one of openness and acceptance, but rather suspicion and concern. The use\nof emerging technology and innovation may require a change in policy or supervisory approach.\nIt also very often requires regulatory feedback—sometimes before innovation is introduced, in\nothers after it has been rolled out and is reviewed during the supervisory process.\nAs a financial policymaker and a regulator, I recognize that there are a number of\nquestions we must answer before pursuing a change in policy, whether in the form of regulation,\nor in supervisory approach, to facilitate innovation in the financial system.\nRegulators need to ask whether we have considered the intended and unintended\noutcomes of a new innovation, and do the benefits of the new technology outweigh the risks?\nWould the introduction of a new technology or innovation in the banking system require\nupdating our regulatory framework to incorporate clear oversight? Who should have\nresponsibility for oversight, and what roles do we see for different regulators at both the state and\nfederal level?\nTransformational technology requires clear, consistent, and transparent guardrails and\nexpectations to govern the activities that are allowed into the regulated financial system. Where\ncurrent regulation does not contemplate a new activity, should it be acceptable for financial\nagencies to regulate the activity through supervision and enforcement alone? Or should\ncongressional action address the treatment of these activities in the financial system?\n\n- 6 -\nThese are difficult questions, to be sure, but ones we must confront if we are to allow\ninnovation to flourish in the banking system and the broader financial system. Ensuring an\norderly and observable method for regulators to understand and provide a path for potentially\ndisruptive or transformational technology could ultimately enhance the long-term stability of the\nfinancial system.\nSo, while the obligation to promote understanding may fall more heavily on industry, the\nobligation to be receptive to innovation falls more heavily on regulators. We must fight the\ntemptation to say “no” and resist new technology, and instead focus on solutions—how can we\nmitigate the risk of new technology? What benefits will technology bring to the financial\nsystem? How can we provide clear regulatory expectations?\nThe appeal of resisting innovation—resisting change—is that it preserves the familiar and\nknown. But the cost of resistance to change may be great, in that it promotes stagnation and\ninertia. Ultimately, this could lead to a banking system that may be safer and smaller, but also\nless effective at providing banking products and services and in supporting the U.S. economy.\nInnovation as a Priority in Banking\nUnderstanding and openness can go a long way to promoting innovation, but I think there\nare opportunities to do more. Can we shift from a reactive approach to innovation, to an active\none that facilitates innovation? This leads to my final principle, which is that regulators can do\nmore to promote innovation. Regulators can do more than simply tolerate innovation, they can\npromote it through transparency and open communication. Take, for example, the frictions\nassociated with cross border payments, including the speed and cost and the ability to transfer\nmoney. At first blush, this seems like a prime opportunity for innovation to come in with a new\napproach.\n\n- 7 -\nThe challenge in cross-border payments historically has been achieving the goal of\nserving new types of customers and increasing the speed of payments, without losing or watering\ndown important compliance safeguards that deter criminal activity. Some perceived payment\nfrictions exist for specific policy reasons and do not stem from issues with existing technology.\nTherefore, new technology alone cannot solve the issue unless it also addresses the required\nsafeguards.\nRegulators can serve a valuable role in identifying where a technology solution may have\nan important “gap,” as in the case of cross-border payments, by identifying how a solution can\nmeet the needs of both customers and regulators. Innovation and regulatory and legal\nrequirements can coexist—providing both enhanced capability and regulatory compliance.\nTransparency can promote innovation.\nPolicymakers should strive to define a clear and sensible regulatory framework designed\nto meet policy objectives that also enables the private sector to innovate within the established\nguardrails. A clear regulatory framework supports private sector innovators by providing clarity\nand consistency that encourages long term business investment in pursing innovation, while\ncontinuing to support today’s products and services. A regulatory framework empowers\nsupervisors to focus on safety and soundness and ensuring a safe and efficient payment system.\nIn the past, I have described an approach to innovation that solves specific problems and\nenables banks and other providers to meet the needs of their customers in a safe and sound\nmanner.3 This approach recognizes the role of the private sector and focuses policymakers on\n3 Michelle W. Bowman, “Responsible Innovation in Money and Payments,” (Speech at the Roundtable on Central\nBank Digital Currency, hosted by the Harvard Law School Program on International Financial Systems, October 17,\n2023), https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20231017a.pdf.\n\n- 8 -\npayment and financial system infrastructure while balancing the public policy objectives with the\nbenefits provided. In this construct, the same activities that present the same risks must be\nsubject to the same regulatory expectations—regardless of what the product is called or where it\nis offered.\nThe active promotion of innovation has proven to be successful in the past. One example\nfrom 2019 highlights the benefits of this approach, specifically as it relates to the use of\nalternative data to support small dollar consumer loans.4 Timely guidance and regulatory clarity\nin the interagency statement clarified that, with a customer’s consent, a bank may use alternative\ndata, like checking account balance activity to help evaluate the potential borrower’s\ncreditworthiness who might not have otherwise qualified for a loan. This example did not\nrequire a change in technology, instead it used data in a responsible and innovative way through\nleveraging deposit account cashflow information to show credit worthiness, enabling banks to\nmeet their customers’ credit needs.\nI think there is more we could do on this front. For example, I think there are\nopportunities for regulators to provide clear, actionable, and timely feedback on innovation\nproposals. And the principles I have described are complementary—the more regulators\nunderstand innovation, the more comfortable they will be in accepting it and promoting its\nadoption in the financial system. My hope is that the Federal Reserve’s ongoing research and\nengagement with industry will help us continue to understand and assess the potential benefits\nand risks presented by new innovation.\n4 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation, National Credit Union Administration, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,\n“Interagency Statement on the Use of Alternative Data in Credit Underwriting,” CA letter 19-11, December 12,\n2019, https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/caletters/caltr1911.htm.\n\n- 9 -\nClosing thoughts\nAs I consider the ever-evolving financial landscape, I will continue think about how the\nregulatory framework can accommodate new technology and services, while applying the\nsafeguards in place today that protect households and businesses, and guard against illicit\nactivity, ensuring the safety and soundness and the stability of the financial system. My hope is\nthat as we enhance our understanding, and we recognize the promise of new technology, we can\nachieve a banking system that welcomes innovation, and is stronger and more efficient as a\nresult.\nThank you for the invitation to join you today to discuss these issues. I look forward to\nour discussion.",

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\n2024 BOJ-IMES Conference,\nhosted by the Institute for Monetary and Economic Studies, Bank of Japan\nTokyo, Japan\nMay 28, 2024\n\nI would like to thank the Bank of Japan and Governor Ueda for organizing this\nyear’s conference and for the invitation to participate in this afternoon’s panel.1 The\ntopic of “the effects of conventional and unconventional policy instruments” is an\nimportant one given central banks’ expanded use of unconventional monetary policy\ntools to pursue their mandates over the past decade and a half.\nMy remarks focus on the use of the central bank balance sheet as a monetary\npolicy tool. I will first offer some observations regarding the benefits and costs of large-\nscale asset purchases (LSAPs) by reflecting on the two episodes of the Federal Reserve’s\nactive use of the balance sheet in U.S. monetary policy following the 2008 financial crisis\nand during the COVID-19 pandemic. I will then discuss some considerations regarding\nfuture balance sheet policy as the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) seeks to\nbring inflation back down to its 2 percent target following the post-pandemic inflation\nsurge, and as the FOMC continues to reduce the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance\nsheet.\nLessons Learned from Past Uses of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet as a\nMonetary Policy Tool\nPost-2008 financial crisis balance sheet policy\nA key challenge for the FOMC following the 2008 financial crisis was how to\nprovide additional support to an economy that was experiencing high unemployment and\nsubdued inflation after the FOMC lowered its primary and conventional monetary policy\ntool—the target range for the federal funds rate—to near zero. Given the importance of\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee. I would like to thank Rebecca Zarutskie for\nassistance in preparing these remarks and Neeco Beltran for assistance in preparing the figure.\n\n- 2 -\nlonger-term interest rates for broader asset prices and for investment and consumption\ndecisions, the FOMC used both forward guidance and LSAPs to help lower longer-term\nrates, which had not yet moved to zero. The intent of forward guidance was to lower\nlonger-term interest rates by shifting expectations of “low-for-long” short-term interest\nrates in line with a low-for-long federal funds rate. LSAPs, or quantitative easing (QE),\nwere intended to reduce longer-term interest rates further by lowering the yields of\nspecific longer-dated securities being purchased and by reducing more generally the term\npremia, the compensation that investors must earn to incentivize investment in a longer-\nterm bond relative to a short-term bond. LSAPs could also reinforce the FOMC’s\nforward guidance of low-for-long short-term interest rates. Such reinforcement of low-\nfor-long forward guidance could be especially powerful if the FOMC communicated that\nit would not consider raising the target range for the federal funds rate until it stopped\nactively engaging in asset purchases for the purposes of QE.\nThe Federal Reserve purchased both Treasury securities and agency mortgage-\nbacked securities (MBS) as part of its QE programs from 2009 to 2014. Figure 1 shows\nthe evolution of the Federal Reserve balance sheet assets and liabilities from before the\n2008 financial crisis to the present. The Fed’s Treasury and agency securities holdings\nincreased from around half a trillion dollars to around $4.25 trillion by the end of the\nthird round of QE, which ended in 2014. A range of studies indicate that the Fed’s asset\npurchases were effective in raising the prices of and lowering the yields on the targeted\nclass of securities.2 Research suggests that these asset purchases also helped lower term\n2 See, for example, Mark Carlson, Stefania D’Amico, Cristina Fuentes-Albero, Bernd Schlusche, and Paul\nWood (2020), “Issues in the Use of the Balance Sheet Tool,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series\n2020-071 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, August),\nhttps://doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2020.071; Stefania D’Amico and Thomas B.

Financial institutions holding MBS\non their balance sheets, including banks, were also significantly affected.\nSome studies have documented that the Fed’s agency MBS purchases encouraged\nbanks to continue to lend as the prices of their on-balance-sheet MBS holdings rose in\nresponse to QE.4 Overall, the evidence indicates that the Fed’s LSAPs following the\nfinancial crisis helped support the economic recovery.

In 2017, the Fed began to reduce its securities holdings, which\nis often referred to as quantitative tightening (QT). In January 2019, the FOMC voted to\noperate monetary policy in an “ample reserves” environment.6 This change in the policy\nimplementation framework had the effect of keeping the size of the balance sheet much\nlarger and providing more liquidity to the banking system in normal times than had been\nthe case before the financial crisis. The FOMC ended QT in August 2019, and balance\nsheet growth resumed in October 2019 through the purchase of U.S. Treasury bills and\nsecurities following a brief period of stress in money markets in which the interest rates\non repurchase agreements and other short-term funding instruments jumped, as noted by\nthe line labeled “Repo Spike” in figure 1. This stress was interpreted as an indication that\nthe level of reserves had fallen below ample levels.7\nOverall, one could deem the post–financial crisis use of the Federal Reserve’s\nbalance sheet as a monetary policy tool as a success. Unemployment fell and inflation\nremained near 2 percent through the period over which LSAPs were conducted. The\nFOMC was able to end LSAPs and eventually was able to partially unwind them, though\nthe overall terminal size of the Fed’s securities holdings as a share of GDP following the\nend of QT was much greater than before the financial crisis. This much larger end state\n6 See the Statement Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation and Balance Sheet Normalization, which\nis available on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/policy-\nnormalization.htm.\n7 See the October 2019 FOMC statement, which is available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.\n\n- 5 -\nwas a direct result of the FOMC’s decision to implement monetary policy in an ample-\nreserves operating framework and had the effect of lowering the likelihood of future\nvolatility in short-term funding markets.8\nCOVID-19 pandemic balance sheet policy\nGiven the effectiveness of the balance sheet as a monetary policy tool over the\nprevious decade, the FOMC rapidly deployed LSAPs in March 2020 as part of its\nresponse to the pandemic.9 These purchases followed the onset of the COVID-19\npandemic at that time, and the FOMC returned the federal funds rate to its effective lower\nbound. Following an initial higher level of Treasury and agency MBS purchases\nmotivated both by restoring market functioning following a period of severe stress and by\nproviding monetary policy accommodation, the FOMC began to purchase $80 billion of\nTreasury securities and $40 billion of agency MBS per month. In its December 2020\npost-meeting statement, the FOMC communicated that it intended to continue this pace\nof asset purchases “until substantial further progress has been made toward the\nCommittee’s maximum employment and price stability goals.”10 By the end of the\npandemic period asset purchases, total securities held by the Federal Reserve stood at\naround $8.5 trillion.\n8 At the end of balance sheet runoff, the Fed’s securities holdings totaled around $3.6 trillion. The FOMC\nhad considered other types of operating regimes, including those that would result in a lower level of\nsecurities holdings in the longer run. See, for example, the discussion in the November 2018 FOMC\nminutes, which can be found on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.\n9 The Federal Reserve also implemented 13 emergency lending and liquidity facilities under its emergency\nlending authorities and undertook supervisory and regulatory actions to support the flow of credit to\nhouseholds, businesses, and local governments; see “Funding, Credit, Liquidity, and Loan Facilities” and\n“Supervisory and Regulatory Actions in Response to COVID-19” on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/funding-credit-liquidity-and-loan-facilities.htm and\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisory-regulatory-action-response-covid-19.htm, respectively.\n10 See the December 2020 FOMC statement, which is available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm (quote text in paragraph 4).\n\n- 6 -\nThe pace of asset purchases during the pandemic period was much greater than in\nthe previous QE episodes. Conditions in the economy and financial system were also\ndifferent than those that prevailed following the 2008 financial crisis in significant ways.\nThe stabilizing actions taken by the Federal Reserve to restore market functioning and to\nsupport financial stability in the first half of 2020, in addition to the much higher capital\nlevels in the banking system relative to 2008, enabled the financial system to remain\nresilient. Credit continued to be available to households, businesses, and local\ngovernments following the pandemic’s onset.\nThe U.S. Congress and the Administration also provided extraordinary fiscal\nsupport in response to the pandemic—which included stimulus checks sent to\nhouseholds, expanded unemployment insurance, and the Paycheck Protection Program—\nthat bolstered household and business balance sheets.11 The housing market—recently\nrecovered from the buildup of poorly underwritten mortgage debt in the lead-up to the\n2008 financial crisis and a subsequent steep decline in house prices—remained in sound\ncondition. And as households and families sought larger living spaces and amenities as\nthey worked from home during the pandemic, house prices increased sharply.\nIn hindsight, the sharp contrast between the economic and financial system\nconditions during the pandemic period and those following the 2008 financial crisis raise\nquestions about the similarities in the response of the Federal Reserve and FOMC to\nthese events. Was such a strong balance sheet policy response during the pandemic\nappropriate, and to what extent did such a strong balance sheet policy response contribute\n11 The Paycheck Protection Program offered low-interest loans that would be forgiven to small and\nmedium-sized businesses that met certain criteria; see “Paycheck Protection Program” on the U.S. Small\nBusiness Administration’s website at https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/covid-19-relief-\noptions/paycheck-protection-program.\n\n- 7 -\nto the buildup of inflationary pressures and the post-pandemic inflation surge? Given the\nunderlying strength in the housing market, should the FOMC have conducted such large\npurchases of agency MBS into late 2021? Given the strong fiscal response to support\nspending by households and businesses and large issuance of Treasury debt, should the\nFOMC have conducted such large purchases of Treasury securities into late 2021? I look\nforward to our conversation today and to future studies on these questions, such as those\nconducted regarding the effectiveness of balance sheet policies following the 2008\nfinancial crisis.\nMy own view is that the FOMC would likely have benefited from an earlier\ndiscussion and decision to begin tapering and subsequently end asset purchases in 2021\ngiven the signs of emerging inflationary pressures.12 Doing so would have allowed the\nFOMC the option to have begun to tighten monetary policy earlier by raising the target\nrange for the federal funds rate. While a robust and rapid response by the FOMC was\nappropriate in 2020, I think it is worth asking whether such a robust response for so long\nwas appropriate. The economic and financial system conditions were very different\nduring the pandemic and included a strongly accommodative fiscal backdrop.\nCould the FOMC have reduced its pace of asset purchases earlier once it was\nclear that market turmoil had subsided, just as the 13(3) emergency lending facilities\nestablished in 2020 were allowed to expire and exit plans developed for those programs?\nA thorough discussion of these questions will be a useful reference for the FOMC and\nother central banks as they consider future use of QE as a monetary policy tool. This\n12 The FOMC discussed alternative approaches to slowing asset purchases at the September 2021 meeting;\nsee the September 2021 FOMC minutes, which can be found on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.\n\n- 8 -\nperspective would be helpful for historical reference when formulating appropriate\nbalance sheet policy as a monetary policy response to future episodes when the\nconventional interest rate tool is near zero.\nAnother important difference between the FOMC’s balance sheet policy\nfollowing the pandemic and its balance sheet policy following the 2008 financial crisis\nwas the speed and timing of the subsequent reduction in the size of the Federal Reserve’s\nsecurities holdings during the period of QT.13 This difference reflects the larger amount\nof securities purchases compared to the earlier periods of QE as well as the quite different\neconomic conditions facing the FOMC at the start of QT post-pandemic. These\nconditions included too-high inflation and a desire by the FOMC to tighten monetary\npolicy through both the federal funds rate and the balance sheet tools.\nSo far, the rapid and sustained pace of the Federal Reserve’s securities runoff has\nproceeded relatively smoothly. A useful question for further inquiry is to what extent\nduring the post-pandemic period has QT served to further tighten financial conditions.\nWith the understanding that QT is a tool employed beyond conventional monetary policy\nrestriction, how does one measure the incremental increase above the FOMC’s\nconcurrent increases in the target range for the federal funds rate and related forward\nguidance regarding its policy rate? Evidence to date suggests that QT exerts an\nindependent effect on tightening financial conditions, though in some cases it may be\nasymmetric to the effects of QE.14 Quantifying the effects of QT as well as QE will be\n13 The pace of balance sheet runoff beginning in 2022 has been roughly double the pace of the balance\nsheet runoff that occurred from 2017 to 2019.\n14 Du, Forbes, and Luzzetti (2024) argue that the effects of QT are asymmetric to QE. This result may be\ndue, in part, to investor expectations for QT before the authors look at announcement effects. See Wenxin\nDu, Kristin Forbes, and Matthew N. Luzzetti (2024), “Quantitative Tightening Around the Globe: What\nHave We Learned?” NBER Working Paper Series 32321 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of\nEconomic Research, April), https://www.nber.org/papers/w32321; and Lorie Logan (2024), “Discussion of\n\n- 9 -\nhelpful to policymakers in their future deliberations regarding use of the balance sheet in\nsetting monetary policy.\nFuture Considerations regarding the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet Policy\nLooking ahead, the FOMC continues to reduce the size of its balance sheet as it\nseeks to maintain a sufficiently restrictive stance of monetary policy to bring inflation\nback down to its 2 percent goal. Recently, the FOMC voted to slow the pace of securities\nrunoff by around half beginning in June.15 In its Plans for Reducing the Size of the\nFederal Reserve’s Balance Sheet released in May 2022, the FOMC noted that it would\neventually slow and then stop securities runoff when reserve balances are somewhat\nabove the levels it judges to be consistent with ample reserves to ensure a smooth\ntransition to ample-reserves levels.16 Aggregate reserve levels currently stand at around\nthe levels at the start of balance sheet runoff in June 2022, and there are still sizable\nbalances in the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility. In light of\nthese conditions, I would have supported either waiting to slow the pace of balance sheet\nrunoff to a later point in time or implementing a more tapered slowing in the pace of\nrunoff.17\n‘Quantitative Tightening Around the Globe: What Have We Learned?’ by Wenxin Du, Kristin Forbes and\nMatthew Luzzetti,” speech delivered at the 2024 U.S. Monetary Policy Forum sponsored by the University\nof Chicago Booth School of Business, March 1,\nhttps://www.dallasfed.org/news/speeches/logan/2024/lkl240301.\n15 See the May 2024 FOMC statement, which is available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.\n16 See the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet, which is available on the\nBoard’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/policy-normalization.htm.\n17 Aggregate reserves stood at around $3.3 trillion just before start of balance sheet runoff in June 2022; see\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2022), Statistical Release H.4.1, “Factors Affecting\nReserve Balances of Depository Institutions and Condition Statement of Federal Reserve Banks” (June 2),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h41/20220602.\n\n- 10 -\nWhile it is important to slow the pace of balance sheet runoff as reserves approach\nample levels, in my view we are not yet at that point, especially with still sizable take-up\nat the ON RRP.18 In my view, it is important to continue to reduce the size of the balance\nsheet to reach ample reserves as soon as possible and while the economy is still strong.\nDoing so will allow the Federal Reserve to more effectively and credibly use its balance\nsheet to respond to future economic and financial shocks.\nAs balance sheet runoff proceeds, however, it will eventually be appropriate to\nstop runoff as reserves near an ample level. The FOMC will be monitoring money\nmarket conditions and related interest rates as it assesses the point at which reserve levels\nreach ample.19 It will be important to communicate that any future changes to balance\nsheet runoff do not reflect a change in the FOMC’s monetary policy stance. Not\neffectively communicating this point might cause the public to interpret the endpoint of\nQT as a signal that the FOMC would decrease the target range for the federal funds rate,\nthereby causing financial conditions to inappropriately ease.\nAnother important issue regarding future balance sheet policy is what the\ncomposition of the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings should be in the longer run. As\nnoted in the FOMC’s January 2022 Principles for Reducing the Size of the Federal\nReserve’s Balance Sheet, the FOMC intends to hold primarily Treasury securities in the\nlonger run to minimize the effects of the Federal Reserve’s holdings on the allocation of\n18 Because the ON RRP and reserves are both Federal Reserve balance sheet liabilities, a one-for-one\ndecrease in the ON RRP with securities reductions would leave the level of reserves unchanged. To date,\nsecurities runoff has largely been matched by a similarly sized reduction in the ON RRP rather than a\nreduction in reserves, reflecting the ON RRP’s role as an excess liquidity absorbing tool during periods of\nlarge asset purchases by the central bank.\n19 See Roberto Perli (2024), “Balance Sheet Reduction: Progress to Date and a Look Ahead,” speech\ndelivered at 2024 Annual Primary Dealer Meeting, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, New York, May 8,\nhttps://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2024/per240508.\n\n- 11 -\ncredit across the economy.20 I strongly support this principle. Consistent with this\nstatement, the FOMC will reinvest any principal payments from agency MBS holdings\nabove the current runoff cap into Treasury securities. And once balance sheet runoff\nconcludes, my expectation is that proceeds from agency MBS holdings would continue to\nbe reinvested in Treasury securities in order to facilitate a transition of the Federal\nReserve’s balance sheet holdings to consist of primarily Treasury securities.\nThe longer-run maturity structure of the Federal Reserve’s Treasury securities\nholdings is also an important consideration. A benefit of a balance sheet Treasury\nsecurity maturity structure that mirrors the broader Treasury market is that the Fed’s\nholdings would be “neutral” in the sense that they would not disproportionately affect the\npricing of any given maturity of Treasury security or provide incentives for the issuance\nof any given type of Treasury security. However, a balance sheet tilted slightly toward\nshorter-dated Treasury securities would allow some flexibility in approach. For example,\nthe FOMC could reduce its holdings of shorter-dated Treasury securities in favor of\nlonger-dated Treasury securities in a future scenario in which the FOMC wanted to\nprovide monetary policy accommodation via the balance sheet without expanding the\nsize of its securities holdings. This approach would be similar to the FOMC’s maturity\nextension program in 2011 and 2012, sometimes referred to as “operation twist.”21 It will\nbe important to consider such potential costs and benefits to the Federal Reserve’s\nTreasury securities maturity structure and the best ways to achieve the desired maturity\nstructure over time.\n20 See the Principles for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet, which is available on\nthe Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/policy-normalization.htm.\n21 For more details, see “Maturity Extension Program and Reinvestment Policy” on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/maturityextensionprogram.htm.\n\n- 12 -\nIt is also important for the FOMC to clearly distinguish when the goal of future\nasset purchases is restoring market functioning or supporting financial stability. In my\nview, when the Federal Reserve purchases securities for such purposes, it should\ncommunicate that those purchases will be temporary and subsequently unwound when\nfinancial market conditions have normalized.22\nIn conclusion, the FOMC’s past experiences with using the Federal Reserve’s\nbalance sheet as a monetary policy tool have demonstrated that the central bank balance\nsheet can be an effective way to ease financial conditions and support the economy in\nperiods in which the conventional monetary policy interest rate tool has reached the zero\nlower bound. Importantly, the U.S. experience shows that the effects of QE and QT can\nhave varying effects depending on the economic and financial system environment, an\nimportant consideration for future episodes.\nJust as when using the conventional monetary policy interest rate, monetary\npolicymakers must use the balance sheet judiciously when setting monetary policy.\nPolicymakers must also consider the risks of “doing too little” in balance with the risks of\n“doing too much” as they pursue their monetary policy mandates.\nThank you, and I look forward to our conversation.\n22 See Michelle W.

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nForum Club of the Palm Beaches\nWest Palm Beach, Florida\nNovember 20, 2024\n\nGood afternoon.1 It is a pleasure to join you for today’s meeting of the Forum Club of\nthe Palm Beaches. It is truly humbling for me to be invited to speak to your membership, in the\ncompany of the many influential leaders, authors, and other public figures this organization has\nhosted since its founding in 1976.\nBefore turning to the main topic of my remarks today, I want to briefly share with you a\nbit about my background. I am one of the longest serving members currently on the Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System (Board), having served as a Board member since\nNovember 26, 2018. As a member of the Board, I am a permanent voting member of the Federal\nOpen Market Committee (FOMC) and serve in other capacities—I lead the Board committees on\nsmaller and community banks and on consumer and community affairs and serve as a member\non other committees that broadly address supervision and regulation and payments. I also\nprovide input into the full range of matters that come before the Board.\nI am the first Governor appointed to fill the role created by Congress for someone with\ndemonstrated primary experience working in or supervising community banks, banks with less\nthan $10 billion in assets.2 I have been both a banker, working in the community bank owned\nand operated by my family since 1882, and a bank supervisor—as the Kansas State Bank\nCommissioner. Early in my career, I spent almost a decade working in public service in several\nfederal government roles, including setting up the Department of Homeland Security after\n9/11 and as a Deputy Assistant Secretary and policy advisor to the first Homeland Security\nSecretary, Tom Ridge. I also served as a counsel on several U.S. House Committees, and as a\nstaff member for the former U.S. Senator from Kansas, Bob Dole.\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 See 12 U.S.C. § 241.\n\n- 2 -\nThese experiences have provided me with a uniquely broad perspective about the role of\ngovernment and the functioning of the U.S. economy—from the view of a regulated business, an\nexecutive branch agency, the legislative branch, and state and federal regulatory agencies.\nThroughout my career, but particularly in my current role as a member of the Board of\nGovernors, I have approached my responsibilities in an independent way, relying on facts,\nanalysis, my own experience and judgment, and the pursuit of the congressionally mandated\ngoals that guide the work of the Board.\nIn some cases, this approach has led me to depart from the views of my colleagues. At its\nSeptember meeting, the FOMC voted to lower the target range for the federal funds rate, for the\nfirst time since we began tightening to combat inflation, by 1/2 percentage point to 4-3/4 to\n5 percent. I dissented from that decision, preferring instead to lower the target range by\n1/4 percentage point. In my statement published after the meeting, I agreed with the\nCommittee’s assessment that, given the progress we have seen since the middle of 2023 on both\nlowering inflation and cooling the labor market, it was appropriate to reflect this progress by\nbeginning the process of recalibrating the policy stance toward a more neutral setting. As my\nstatement noted, I preferred a smaller initial cut in the policy rate. With inflation continuing to\nhover well above our 2 percent goal, I saw the risk that the Committee’s large policy action\nmight be interpreted as a premature declaration of victory on our price-stability mandate. In\naddition, with the U.S. economy remaining strong, moving the policy rate down too quickly, in\nmy view, would carry the risk of stoking demand unnecessarily and potentially reigniting\ninflationary pressures.\nMy dissent was notable in that the last dissenting vote from a Fed Board member on an\nFOMC vote occurred nearly 20 years ago. My dissent was guided by my view and interpretation\n\n- 3 -\nof the available data and my understanding of the Fed’s dual mandate of maximum employment\nand stable prices, which I will discuss more in a moment.\nEveryone in this room knows that experience is important. My experiences have shaped\nand reinforced my views on how policymakers can best serve the public—narrowly, including in\nmonetary policy decisionmaking and the regulation of the banking industry, but also more\nbroadly in thinking about policymaking in support of an agency’s mission balanced with its\nextensive impact on the affected industry and the U.S. economy.\nA Pragmatic Approach to Policymaking\nA Goal-Oriented Approach\nIn the past, I have discussed the role of policymaking from the perspective of a Federal\nReserve Board member. But taking a step back, there are some broader themes relevant to\nagency policymaking more generally, themes that are useful beyond the context of the Federal\nReserve. At a basic level, I think of this as a pragmatic approach. It requires tradeoffs to balance\nregulation while also not inhibiting economic growth.\nThe first question I like to ask when confronted with a policy issue is, “Why are we\nhere?” You may recognize this question from Philosophy 101, but this question also applies to\nthe exercise of executive authority by regulatory agencies. The Federal Reserve has extensive\nresponsibilities, and equally extensive powers, but it must exercise these powers only in\nfurtherance of specific goals established by statute. The sheer scope of the Fed’s powers can\npresent a temptation to go beyond the statutory authority. For example, to play a more active\nrole in the allocation of credit, or to displace other sources of bank funding even when market\nsources of liquidity are functioning well. It could also include the temptation to venture into\npolicy matters unrelated to the Fed’s responsibilities that are better addressed by Congress or\nother policymakers (here, a push for banking sector climate change related regulation comes to\n\n- 4 -\nmind). The goals Congress has laid out for the Fed are complicated and important. Congress\nshould not expect the Federal Reserve, or any other agency for that matter, to solve problems\nbeyond that agency’s limited purpose. Doing so would contravene the intent and authority of\nCongress.\nTo begin, I will provide a few concrete examples of how the starting point for policy is\nthe agency’s mission, including in: (1) the execution of monetary policy, and (2) the conduct of\nbanking regulation and supervision.\nIn conducting monetary policy, Congress has given us the dual mandate of maximum\nemployment and price stability. Achieving these goals has often proven challenging, particularly\nover the last several years, as these policy objectives can sometimes be in tension. Policy actions\nto tame inflation, like raising the target range for the federal funds rate, can have an adverse\neffect on employment. A critical input to the FOMC decisionmaking process is an analysis of\neconomic conditions and outlook. The real economy continues to be strong, with solid\nmomentum in economic activity, robust household spending and business investment, and a\nhealthy labor market that remains near full employment. Although economic conditions have\nbeen supportive of our employment mandate, they have been unsatisfying for our price stability\nmandate as inflation continues to be elevated.\nWe have seen considerable progress in lowering inflation since early 2023, but progress\nseems to have stalled in recent months. The 12-month measure of core personal consumption\nexpenditures inflation—which excludes food and energy prices—has moved sideways at around\n2.7 percent since May, and the latest consumer and producer price index reports point to a\nsimilarly elevated or even higher reading for October. The persistently high core inflation\n\n- 5 -\nlargely reflects pressures on housing services prices, perhaps due to an increase in demand for\naffordable housing and an inelastic supply.\nGross domestic product (GDP) increased at a solid pace in the third quarter, maintaining\nthe momentum from the previous four quarters. Growth continued to be driven by private\ndomestic final purchases, as personal consumption, and retail sales in particular, strongly\nincreased last quarter, more than offsetting further weakness in housing activity due to high\nmortgage rates. Retail sales continued to rise in October, even though Hurricanes Helene and\nMilton may have exerted a small drag on sales last month. The annual revision of the national\nincome and product accounts confirmed that GDP has been providing the right signal about the\nongoing strength in economic activity, as gross domestic income and personal income were\nrevised up considerably for 2023 and the first half of this year.\nThe October employment report seems to have been affected by the recent hurricanes and\nthe Boeing strike. It also featured the lowest response rate to the payroll survey in decades.\nAfter accounting for these special factors, it seems that payroll employment continued to\nincrease in October at a pace close to the average monthly gain seen in the second and third\nquarters. The unemployment rate remained low at 4.1 percent in October, down from\n4.3 percent in July. The labor force participation rate remains well below pre-pandemic levels\nand edged down further in October due to lower prime-age participation. While unemployment is\nnotably higher than a year ago, it is still at a historically low level and below my and the\nCongressional Budget Office’s estimates of full employment.\nThe labor market has loosened from the extremely tight conditions of the past few years.\nThe ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers has been close to the historically elevated pre-\npandemic level in recent months. But there are still more available jobs than available workers, a\n\n- 6 -\ncondition that before 2018 has only occurred twice for a prolonged period since World War II,\nfurther signaling ongoing labor market strength. Wage growth has slowed further in recent\nmonths, but it continues to indicate a tight labor market.\nThe rise in the unemployment rate this year largely reflects weaker hiring, as job seekers\nentering or re-entering the labor force are taking longer to find work, while layoffs remain low.\nIn addition to some cooling in labor demand, a mismatch between the skills of the new workers\nand available jobs could further raise unemployment, suggesting that higher unemployment has\nbeen partly driven by the stronger supply of workers.\nMonetary Policy\nIn the monetary policy function, we rely on the best data available, but without question\nthe data are imperfect. We also consider a range of possible future economic conditions to help\ninform our monetary policy decisionmaking, which requires that we make assumptions and\npredictions about the future. Looking back over time, our crystal ball has never been perfect at\npredicting the risks that may emerge, how those risks may influence economic conditions, and\nhow that should be considered in analyzing our monetary policy goals. To illustrate this point in\nterms of recent events, we have not yet met our inflation goal and, as I noted earlier, progress in\nlowering inflation appears to have stalled.\nI see greater risks to the price stability side of our mandate, especially while the labor\nmarket remains near full employment, but it is also possible that we could see a deterioration in\nlabor market conditions. These predictions always come with a dose of humility, however,\nparticularly because they rely on imperfect data. The labor market data have become\nincreasingly difficult to interpret, as surveys and other measurements struggle to incorporate\nlarge numbers of new workers and to account for other influences that we do not yet fully\n\n- 7 -\nunderstand and have not yet been able to accurately measure. As the dynamics of immigration\nand business creation and closures continue to change, it has become increasingly difficult to\nunderstand the payroll employment data. In light of the dissonance created by conflicting\neconomic signals, measurement challenges, and data revisions, I remain cautious about taking\nsignal from only a limited set of real-time data releases.\nWhile the mandate for monetary policy is straightforward, its execution is complex. Our\ndecisions are guided by our dual mandate, but arriving at them entails careful analysis of\nsometimes flawed data, and informed judgments about unknowable future conditions.\nBank Regulation and Supervision\nIn conducting bank regulation and supervision, the Federal Reserve promotes the safe\nand sound operation of individual banks, and the stability of the broader financial system. These\nbank regulatory goals have obvious synergies—individual banks operating in a safe and sound\nmanner tends to create conditions that promote financial stability in the banking sector. The\nFed’s bank regulatory objectives include implicit tradeoffs: we aim to foster a banking system\nthat is safe, sound, and efficient, while serving the U.S. economy, and facilitating economic\ngrowth. The objectives must also support the full breadth of the banking system from the very\nlargest to the very smallest.\nStriking a balance among these competing goals can certainly be a challenge, and policy\nviews on where that balance should be struck may vary. We should approach the task of bank\nregulation with an understanding and appreciation of these tradeoffs, coupled with an affirmative\nacknowledgment that the banking system is an important driver of business formation, economic\nexpansion, and opportunity. A banking system that is safe and sound yet irrelevant would not\nfulfill our regulatory objectives, but would be the inevitable outcome of following a path that\n\n- 8 -\nstrives for elimination of risks rather than promotion of effective risk management. Banks are\nunique individual businesses, not public utilities.\nThe pursuit of these bank regulatory goals requires an approach that considers a range of\nregulatory and supervisory tools, from the quantitative—like the setting of bank capital and\nliquidity requirements—to the more subjective—like evaluating bank management during the\nexamination process. And while the goals themselves seem straightforward, the tools available\nand the complexity and evolution of the financial system over time present real challenges from\na policymaking perspective.\nWhen we consider drafting a new regulation, we should always ask “What problem\nwould this new regulation solve?” Policymakers should exercise restraint in the promulgation of\na new regulation, by articulating the problem it purports to solve and presenting an efficient way\nto address it. Identifying the problem that requires addressing often poses one of the most\nsignificant challenges. Ideally, the process would begin by identifying the problem, then move\nto an analysis of whether proposed solutions are within the agency’s statutory authorities, and\nfinally whether targeted changes to the regulatory framework could result in improvements,\nremediation of gaps, or elimination of redundant and unnecessary requirements.\nBut for a number of reasons, the problem identification process can result in\nmisidentification of issues, and a resulting failure to prioritize the most important ones. Take for\nexample the failure of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), and the regulatory response. At its root, this\nbank’s failure exposed significant flaws in the bank’s management and the regulators’ oversight\nand supervision. The interest rate and funding risks, rapid growth, and the idiosyncratic business\nmodel and concentrated customer base of the bank, were apparent and obvious. These risks were\nmismanaged by SVB and not acted on early enough by bank supervisors.\n\n- 9 -\nThese were not the only factors contributing to the firm’s failure, but these critical\nelements should have been the key priorities for the supervisory function to address after the\nbank’s failure. And yet in the aftermath of SVB’s demise, we have focused on regulatory\nproposals ranging from substantial increases in bank capital requirements, to pushing down\nglobal systemically important bank (G-SIB) and large bank requirements to much smaller firms,\nfinding supervisory deficiencies in the management of well-capitalized and financially sound\nfirms, and considering widespread changes to the funding and liquidity requirements and\nexpectations that apply to all banks.\nA crisis is not a regulatory blank check. In some ways, it presents heightened risks that\nshould prompt us to show our work even more carefully. A deliberate, transparent, and fact-\nbased approach to pursuing statutory objectives also serves the goal of avoiding the impression\nof pursuing unrelated policy goals, particularly those that venture into political concerns outside\nof an agency’s purposes or functions. Promoting safety, soundness, and financial stability should\nnot devolve into an exercise of regulatory allocation of credit—picking winners and losers—or\npromoting an ideological position through more open-ended processes like bank supervision and\nexamination.\nEffective and Efficient Solutions\nOnce we have a clear and thorough understanding of our statutory objectives and have a\nframework to identify issues, gaps, or redundancies, the next task is to focus on finding efficient\nsolutions to those issues. In doing so, we should consider policy alternatives and perspectives\nthat may differ from our past approach. We should also acknowledge that we may not have all\nthe facts or information necessary to immediately identify an effective solution. Successful\npolicymaking requires openness and humility, caution, and a deliberate approach.\n\n- 10 -\nWith respect to monetary policy, uncertainty surrounding available data and the many\nvariables that can affect future economic conditions suggest that we should pursue a cautious\napproach. At the most recent meeting in November, the Committee decided to take an additional\nstep along the path of moving toward a more neutral policy setting. I agreed to support this\naction, since it aligns with my preference to lower the policy rate gradually, especially in light of\nelevated inflation and the uncertainty about the level of the neutral rate.\nMy estimate of the neutral policy rate is much higher than it was before the pandemic,\nand therefore we may be closer to a neutral policy stance than we currently think. I would prefer\nto proceed cautiously in bringing the policy rate down to better assess how far we are from the\nend point, while recognizing that we have not yet achieved our inflation goal and closely\nwatching the evolution of the labor market. We should also not rule out the risk that the policy\nrate may attain or even fall below its neutral level before we achieve our price stability goal.\nIt is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course. At each FOMC\nmeeting, my colleagues and I will make our decisions based on the incoming data and the\nimplications for and risks to the outlook and guided by the Fed’s dual-mandate goals of\nmaximum employment and stable prices. During each intermeeting period, we typically receive\na range of economic data and information. In addition to closely watching the incoming data,\nI meet with a broad range of contacts to discuss economic conditions as I assess the\nappropriateness of our monetary policy stance. Especially in light of the data measurement\nchallenges that I mentioned earlier, engaging with contacts helps me interpret the signals\nprovided by the data and gain a better understanding of how the economy is evolving.\nConsistent with this pragmatic approach, I am pleased that the November post meeting\nstatement included a flexible, data-dependent approach, providing the Committee with\n\n- 11 -\noptionality in deciding future policy adjustments. As I noted earlier, my view is that inflation\nremains a concern, and I continue to see price stability as essential for fostering a strong labor\nmarket and an economy that works for everyone in the longer term.\nIn banking regulation, this pragmatic approach requires us to consider the costs and\nbenefits of any proposed change, as well as incentive effects, impacts on markets, and potential\nunintended consequences. But it also means that we must consider the limits of regulatory\nresponsibility—grounded by our statutory objectives—when taking regulatory action. In my\nview, these considerations apply beyond Federal Reserve policymaking to regulatory actions\ntaken by any agency.\nAs I noted previously, statutory mandates guiding the Fed’s bank regulatory\nresponsibilities provide an important grounding for agency action. But they must be viewed in\nthe broader context of promoting an effective and efficient banking system that supports market\nfunctioning and encourages economic growth, business creation and expansion, and opportunity.\nOur responsibility is not to look only at whether a proposal will promote greater safety and\nsoundness, but to consider the broader context, including whether regulatory incentives will\nskew the allocation of credit, adversely affect capital markets, or push traditional banking\nactivities outside of the banking system into less regulated non-banks.\nIs the bank regulatory framework efficient? Does it allow banks sufficient freedom and\nflexibility to operate and meet customer needs? And importantly, are there areas within the\napproach to regulation and supervision that simply cannot be justified based on a cost-benefit\nanalysis? The answer to the latter is “Yes.” There are a number of areas where right-sizing\nregulation and our supervisory approach would be appropriate and can be done in a way that\ndoes not sacrifice safety and soundness or threaten financial stability.\n\n- 12 -\nRegulation is most effective when it strikes an appropriate balance between competing\ngoals and objectives. In the banking system, this means operating in a safe, sound, and\nfinancially stable way, while also supporting economic growth and efficiency. When we fail to\nconsider this broader context, we risk disincentivizing growth, imposing overly burdensome and\nunnecessary regulations, setting opaque and unreasonable expectations through the supervisory\nprocess, and forcing the inefficient allocation of capital.\nSometimes this debate escapes from the dusty offices of the banking regulators into plain\nview, as during the past year on the Basel III Endgame package of bank capital reforms. While\nthis proposal prompted extensive comment from a wide range of commenters, it also inspired a\nnegative television and radio advertising campaign, which is unprecedented for a relatively\ntechnical bank regulatory issue. But these ads highlighted an uncomfortable truth: the\nregulatory approach we took failed to consider or deliver a reasonable proposal, one aligned with\nthe original Basel agreement yet suited to the particulars of the U.S. banking system. Instead, the\nproposal released last year opted for significant capital increases for some banks, in excess of\n20 percent, departing significantly from the approach adopted by our international counterparts.\nThis public engagement has been useful, and it seems to have softened some of the over-\ncalibrated positions underpinning the original capital reform proposal. But this level of public\nengagement and debate was also a byproduct of the rulemaking process. While regulatory\noverreach can threaten the credibility of agency action in the eyes of the public, a transparent\nprocess allows public commenters to pressure test and pushback on agency action.\nHowever, when agencies overwhelm the process by publishing thousands of pages of\nrulemakings in a short period of time, the public’s ability to provide meaningful feedback on our\nrules is compromised. Last year the federal financial agencies published over 5,000 pages of\n\n- 13 -\nrules and proposals. And yet, even when the public is able to comment on these voluminous\nproposals, regulators often ignore this constructive feedback and move forward to publish final\nrules with minimal or no changes relative to their proposals, as with the Community\nReinvestment Act rule.\nMaintenance of an existing regulatory framework is not glamorous but is perhaps one of\nthe more important agency functions to ensure that the framework is striking the right balance\nbetween promoting a strong banking system and supporting economic growth. This requires\nreviewing and updating regulations to ensure that prior agency actions continue to address\nproblems efficiently as industries and conditions change.3 When agencies prioritize the creation\nof new regulation in the absence of a statutory mandate, harmful and unintended consequences\ncan result. One such example is the adverse effects of regulatory constraints on Treasury market\nfunctioning. Rules like the Supplementary Leverage Ratio, the G-SIB Surcharge, and the\nLiquidity Coverage Ratio pose known and identified constraints on the Treasury market that may\ncontribute to future stress and market disruption if left unaddressed.\nFinally, while transparency—like that intended by the rulemaking process—can lead to\nbetter public engagement and outcomes, it is important that agency actions are transparent even\nwhen not legally mandated. The most obvious opportunity for additional transparency in the\nbanking framework is in supervision. Supervision by its nature involves confidential and\ndetailed inquiries into bank operations, with examiners evaluating quantitative measures like\ncapital and liquidity, while making judgmental assessments of the activities and risks of the\n3 In February, the Board announced the initiation of its review of its regulations to identify those regulations that are\noutdated, unnecessary, or overly burdensome in accordance with the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork\nReduction Act. See Michelle W. Bowman (2024), “Statement by Governor Michelle W. Bowman on the Review of\nthe Board’s Regulations under the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act of 1996\n(EGRPRA)” press release, February 6,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20240206a1.htm.\n\n- 14 -\ninstitution, and its risk-management approach. Supervisory expectations should not surprise\nregulated firms, and yet transparency of these expectations is often challenging to achieve. In\nfact, since the failure of SVB supervisory surprises have become more common in bank\nexaminations.\nIn light of the recent Supreme Court cases regarding agency actions, agencies should\nrespond in a way that furthers the goals of transparency and accountability, and act as a check on\nregulatory overreach. The elimination of Chevron deference has the potential to transform\nagency rulemakings positively—in a way that promotes the pragmatic approach I outlined in this\ndiscussion. The same considerations we follow in the pursuit of our statutory objectives could\nhelp support rulemakings that are built upon a stronger factual and analytical basis, with a\nthorough and more comprehensive explanation of an agency’s policy approach.\nClosing Thoughts\nWhile my remarks today have largely focused on Federal Reserve responsibilities, a\npragmatic approach has broader applicability. Agencies can build public support for their\nactivities by following these simple principles—a rigorous focus on statutory objectives, a\nfoundation based on facts and careful analysis in forming policy, crafting efficient solutions, and\npublic transparency and accountability. Agencies and their regulated businesses will benefit\nfrom a rigorous process that considers different perspectives, the intended and unintended\nconsequences of decisions, and the costs and benefits of actions. The ability of the banking\nsystem to finance the future growth of the U.S. economy hinges upon our ability and willingness\nto shift our approach to regulation and supervisory oversight. A pragmatic approach to\npolicymaking will better enable the U.S. economy to continue to grow now and into the future.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n9:00 a.m. EDT\nSeptember 24, 2024\nRecent Views on Monetary Policy and the Economic Outlook\nRemarks by\nMichelle W. Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\n2024 Kentucky Bankers Association Annual Convention\nHot Springs, Virginia\nSeptember 24, 2024\n\nGood morning. I would like to thank the Kentucky Bankers Association for the\ninvitation to join you today for your annual convention.1 I appreciate the opportunity to share\nmy views on the U.S. economy and monetary policy before we engage on community banking\nissues and other matters affecting the banking industry.\nIn light of last week’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, I will begin\nmy remarks by providing some perspective on my vote and will then share my current views on\nthe economy and monetary policy.\nUpdate on the Most Recent FOMC Meeting\nIn order to address high inflation, for more than two years, the FOMC increased and held\nthe federal funds rate at a restrictive level. At our September meeting, the FOMC voted to lower\nthe target range for the federal funds rate by 1/2 percentage point to 4-3/4 to 5 percent and to\ncontinue reducing the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings.\nAs the post-meeting statement noted, I dissented from the FOMC’s decision, preferring\ninstead to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point to 5 to\n5-1/4 percent. Last Friday, once our FOMC participant communications blackout period\nconcluded, the Board of Governors released my statement explaining the decision to depart from\nthe majority of the voting members. I agreed with the Committee’s assessment that, given the\nprogress we have seen since the middle of 2023 on both lowering inflation and cooling the labor\nmarket, it was appropriate to reflect this progress by recalibrating the level of the federal funds\nrate and begin the process of moving toward a more neutral stance of policy. As my statement\n1 The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee or the Board of Governors.\n\n- 2 -\nnotes, I preferred a smaller initial cut in the policy rate while the U.S. economy remains strong\nand inflation remains a concern, despite recent progress.\nEconomic Conditions and Outlook\nIn recent months, we have seen some further progress on slowing the pace of inflation,\nwith monthly readings lower than the elevated pace seen in the first three months of the year.\nThe 12-month measure of core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation, which\nprovides a broader perspective than the more volatile higher-frequency readings, has moved\ndown since April, although it came in at 2.6 percent in July, again remaining well above our\n2 percent goal. In addition, the latest consumer and producer price index reports suggest that\n12-month core PCE inflation in August was likely a touch above the July reading. The\npersistently high core inflation largely reflects pressures on housing prices, perhaps due in part to\nlow inventories of affordable housing. The progress in lowering inflation since April is a\nwelcome development, but core inflation is still uncomfortably above the Committee’s 2 percent\ngoal.\nPrices remain much higher than before the pandemic, which continues to weigh on\nconsumer sentiment. Higher prices have an outsized effect on lower- and moderate-income\nhouseholds, as these households devote a significantly larger share of income to food, energy,\nand housing. Prices for these spending categories have far outpaced overall inflation over the\npast few years.\nEconomic growth moderated earlier this year after coming in stronger last year. Private\ndomestic final purchases (PDFP) growth has been solid and slowed much less than gross\ndomestic product (GDP), as the slowdown in GDP growth was partly driven by volatile\ncategories including net exports, suggesting that underlying economic growth was stronger than\n\n- 3 -\nGDP indicated. PDFP has continued to increase at a solid pace so far in the third quarter, despite\nsome further weakening in housing activity, as retail sales have shown further robust gains in\nJuly and August.\nAlthough personal consumption has remained resilient, consumers appear to be pulling\nback on discretionary items and expenses, as evidenced in part by a decline in restaurant\nspending since late last year. Low- and moderate-income consumers no longer have extra\nsavings to support this type of spending, and we have seen loan delinquency rates normalize\nfrom historically low levels during the pandemic.\nThe most recent labor market report shows that payroll employment gains have slowed\nappreciably to a pace moderately above 100,000 per month over the three months ending in\nAugust. The unemployment rate edged down to 4.2 percent in August from 4.3 percent in July.\nWhile unemployment is notably higher than a year ago, it is still at a historically low level and\nbelow my and the Congressional Budget Office’s estimates of full employment.\nThe labor market has loosened from the extremely tight conditions of the past few years.\nThe ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers has declined further to a touch below the\nhistorically elevated pre-pandemic level—a sign that the number of available workers and the\nnumber of available jobs have come into better balance. But there are still more available jobs\nthan available workers, a condition that before 2018 has only occurred twice for a prolonged\nperiod since World War II, further signaling ongoing labor market strength despite the reported\ndata.\nAlthough wage growth has slowed further in recent months, it remains indicative of a\ntight labor market. At just under 4 percent, as measured by both the employment cost index and\n\n- 4 -\naverage hourly earnings, wage gains are still above the pace consistent with our inflation goal\ngiven trend productivity growth.\nThe rise in the unemployment rate this year largely reflects weaker hiring, as job seekers\nentering or re-entering the labor force are taking longer to find work, while layoffs remain low.\nIn addition to some cooling in labor demand, there are other factors likely contributing the\nincreased unemployment. A mismatch between the skills of the new workers and available jobs\ncould further raise unemployment, suggesting that higher unemployment has been partly driven\nby the stronger supply of workers. It is also likely that some temporary factors contributed to the\nrecent rise in the unemployment rate, as unemployment among working age teenagers sharply\nincreased in August.\nPreference for a More Measured Recalibration of Policy\nThe U.S. economy remains strong and core inflation remains uncomfortably above our\n2 percent target. In light of these economic conditions, a few further considerations supported\nthe case for a more measured approach in beginning the process to recalibrate our policy stance\nto remove restriction and move toward a more neutral setting.\nFirst, I was concerned that reducing the target range for the federal funds rate by\n1/2 percentage point could be interpreted as a signal that the Committee sees some fragility or\ngreater downside risks to the economy. In the current economic environment, with no clear\nsigns of material weakening or fragility, in my view, beginning the rate-cutting cycle with a\n1/4 percentage point move would have better reinforced the strength in economic conditions,\nwhile also confidently recognizing progress toward our goals. In my mind, a more measured\napproach would have avoided the risk of unintentionally signaling concerns about underlying\neconomic conditions.\n\n- 5 -\nSecond, I was also concerned that reducing the policy rate by 1/2 percentage point could\nhave led market participants to expect that the Committee would lower the target range by that\nsame pace at future meetings until the policy rate approaches a neutral level. If this expectation\nhad materialized, we could have seen an unwarranted decline in longer-term interest rates and\nbroader financial conditions could become overly accommodative. This outcome could work\nagainst the Committee’s goal of returning inflation to our 2 percent target.\nI am pleased that Chair Powell directly addressed both of these concerns during the press\nconference following last week’s FOMC meeting.\nThird, there continues to be a considerable amount of pent-up demand and cash on the\nsidelines ready to be deployed as the path of interest rates moves down. Bringing the policy rate\ndown too quickly carries the risk of unleashing that pent-up demand. A more measured approach\nwould also avoid unnecessarily stoking demand and potentially reigniting inflationary pressures.\nFinally, in dialing back our restrictive stance of policy, we also need to be mindful of\nwhat the end point is likely to be. My estimate of the neutral rate is much higher than it was\nbefore the pandemic. Therefore, I think we are much closer to neutral than would have been the\ncase under pre-pandemic conditions, and I did not see the peak stance of policy as restrictive to\nthe same extent that my colleagues may have. With a higher estimate of neutral, for any given\npace of rate reductions, we would arrive at our destination sooner.\nOngoing Risks to the Outlook\nTurning to the risks to achieving our dual mandate, I continue to see greater risks to price\nstability, especially while the labor market continues to be near estimates of full employment.\nAlthough the labor market data have been showing signs of cooling in recent months, still-\nelevated wage growth, solid consumer spending, and resilient GDP growth are not consistent\n\n- 6 -\nwith a material economic weakening or fragility. My contacts also continue to mention that they\nare not planning layoffs and continue to have difficulty hiring. Therefore, I am taking less signal\nfrom the recent labor market data until there are clear trends indicating that both spending\ngrowth and the labor market have materially weakened. I suspect the recent immigration flows\nhave and will continue to affect labor markets in ways that we do not yet fully understand and\ncannot yet accurately measure. In light of the dissonance created by conflicting economic\nsignals, measurement challenges, and data revisions, I remain cautious about taking signal from\nonly a limited set of real-time data releases.\nIn my view, the upside risks to inflation remain prominent. Global supply chains\ncontinue to be susceptible to labor strikes and increased geopolitical tensions, which could result\nin inflationary effects on food, energy, and other commodity markets. Expansionary fiscal\nspending could also lead to inflationary risks, as could an increased demand for housing given\nthe long-standing limited supply, especially of affordable housing. While it has not been my\nbaseline outlook, I cannot rule out the risk that progress on inflation could continue to stall.\nAlthough it is important to recognize that there has been meaningful progress on\nlowering inflation, while core inflation remains around or above 2.5 percent, I see the risk that\nthe Committee’s larger policy action could be interpreted as a premature declaration of victory\non our price-stability mandate. Accomplishing our mission of returning to low and stable\ninflation at our 2 percent goal is necessary to foster a strong labor market and an economy that\nworks for everyone in the longer term.\nIn light of these considerations, I believe that, by moving at a measured pace toward a\nmore neutral policy stance, we will be better positioned to achieve further progress in bringing\n\n- 7 -\ninflation down to our 2 percent target, while closely watching the evolution of labor market\nconditions.\nThe Path Forward\nDespite my dissent at the recent FOMC meeting, I respect and appreciate that my FOMC\ncolleagues preferred to begin the reduction in the federal funds rate with a larger initial cut in the\ntarget range for the policy rate. I remain committed to working together with my colleagues to\nensure that monetary policy is appropriately positioned to achieve our goals of attaining\nmaximum employment and returning inflation to our 2 percent target.\nI will continue to monitor the incoming data and information as I assess the appropriate\npath of monetary policy, and I will remain cautious in my approach to adjusting the stance of\npolicy going forward. It is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course. My\ncolleagues and I will make our decisions at each FOMC meeting based on the incoming data and\nthe implications for and risks to the outlook guided by the Fed’s dual-mandate goals of\nmaximum employment and stable prices. We need to ensure that the public understands clearly\nhow current and expected deviations of inflation and employment from our mandated goals\ninform our policy decisions.\nBy the time of our next meeting in November, we will have received updated reports on\ninflation, employment, and economic activity. We may also have a better understanding of how\ndevelopments in longer-term interest rates and broader financial conditions might influence the\neconomic outlook.\nDuring the intermeeting period, I will continue to visit with a broad range of contacts to\ndiscuss economic conditions as I assess the appropriateness of our monetary policy stance. As\nI noted earlier, I continue to view inflation as a concern. In light of the upside risks that I just\n\n- 8 -\ndescribed, it remains necessary to pay close attention to the price-stability side of our mandate\nwhile being attentive to the risks of a material weakening in the labor market. My view\ncontinues to be that restoring price stability is essential for achieving maximum employment\nover the longer run. However, should the data evolve in a way that points to a material\nweakening in the labor market, I would support taking action and adjust monetary policy as\nneeded while taking into account our inflation mandate.\nClosing Thoughts\nIn closing, thank you again for welcoming me here today. It is a pleasure to join you and\nto have the opportunity to discuss my views on the economy and monetary policy. And given\nthe recent FOMC meeting decision and my dissent, I appreciate being able to provide a more\ndetailed explanation of the reasoning that led me to dissent in favor of a smaller reduction in the\npolicy rate at last week’s FOMC meeting.\nI look forward to answering your questions and to engaging with your members on bank\nregulatory and supervisory matters.",

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nto the\nAg Lenders Conference, sponsored by\nThe Independent Community Bankers Association of New Mexico\nDeming, New Mexico\nMarch 28, 2019\n\nGood morning. It is a pleasure to be here today to discuss the important role\nagriculture plays in our economy, a role that is supported by many community banks. I\nwould like to thank the Independent Community Bankers Association and their New\nMexico state association for inviting me to participate in the conversation we will have\ntoday. In addition to the bankers and state leaders here, agricultural bankers and other\nleaders in the industry are listening in from around the country, and I look forward to\nhearing their views in a few moments.\nDuring our time together, I would like to offer some observations on the current\nstate of the farm economy. And because I see community bankers as playing a vital role\nin this sector, I’ll explain why I believe the community banking model is well-suited to\nsupporting agricultural businesses. Finally, I will highlight the Federal Reserve’s\napproach to supervising agricultural banks.\nAs many of you know, before joining the Federal Reserve, I worked at a\ncommunity bank that primarily served ranchers and farmers and the businesses that\nsupport them. More recently, as Kansas state bank commissioner, I supervised many\nbanks whose business and customers were closely connected to the land and the people\nwho work it. I now have the honor of being the first governor to fill the role designated\nfor someone with community banking experience on the Federal Reserve Board, a\nposition that was created by statute in 2015.1 I plan to fulfill this unique responsibility by\ntraveling widely and listening closely to community bankers, consumers, farmers,\nranchers, and dairy farmers--all of the stakeholders with an interest in our work. My goal\nis to bring back the knowledge I gain from discussions and visits like the one we are\n1 Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015 (Pub. L. 114-1, 129 Stat. 3),\nhttps://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/26.\n\n- 2 -\nhaving today and use it to improve our work. In doing so, I am confident our work will\nbe more effective and efficient. And in the process, I hope to help you better understand\nthe role of the Federal Reserve and what we are trying to accomplish.\nThe Federal Reserve’s monetary policy mandate is twofold: to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices. To do that, we continuously monitor the health of the\nU.S. economy in general, and because of its sizable share of overall activity, the\nagricultural sector in particular. U.S. agriculture and its related industries support about\n22 million jobs in the United States and produce close to 10 percent of our exports.2 A\nhealthy farm economy also supports many rural and regional economies. We track\ncommodity prices, ag credit, and exports as factors that influence our outlook on inflation\nand economic growth. As bank supervisors, we work to ensure safe and sound banking\npractices. We also monitor trends in asset quality and risk-management practices at\nagricultural banks as part of our ongoing assessment of the level and direction of risk at\nthese financial institutions and within the agricultural economy.\nEarlier this week, I had the privilege of welcoming farm sector leaders to the\nFederal Reserve Board in Washington, where we hosted the 2019 National Agricultural\nCredit Conference. For nearly 80 years, this conference has brought together leaders in\nthis sector to discuss important issues related to farm credit. Attendees at this year’s\nconference recognized that, while the outlook for the farm economy in 2019 may be\nsimilar to a year ago, there are ongoing concerns that increasing stress on producers could\nlead to repayment difficulties.\n2 See U.S Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service at https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-\nproducts/ag-and-food-statistics-charting-the-essentials/ag-and-food-sectors-and-the-economy/.\n\n- 3 -\nFarm incomes are expected to remain relatively low this year after declining\nsharply from the 2013 peak. The price of major agricultural commodities has also\nremained low in early 2019. For example, today, the price of corn is about 40 percent\nlower than it was from 2010 to 2013. Dairy producing states like New Mexico are well\naware that average milk prices were about 15 percent lower in 2018 than from 2010 to\n2013, and well below the highs of 2014. As noted in recent Federal Reserve System\nBeige Books, higher tariffs on soybeans and other U.S. exports and continued uncertainty\nover trade policy represent headwinds for American producers.\nHere in New Mexico, agricultural production rose 5 percent to $3.4 billion in\n2017, with strong gains in milk production and livestock. Coming from a ranching\nfamily, I’m well aware of the challenges facing livestock producers. New Mexico is also\nthe nation’s second largest producer of pecans, producing a record 92 million pounds\nworth $220 million in 2017. I’m also looking forward to touring a farm later today to\nlearn more about a crop we don’t grow a lot of in Kansas--chili peppers. The demand for\nchili peppers and pecans grown in New Mexico is a good example of the kinds of\nregional variations we see in agriculture and many other industries.\nWhile it is important to understand regional trends, I would like to focus this\nmorning on some overarching themes that have emerged in recent years. Recently, a\ngreat deal of attention understandably has been paid to an increase in the number of U.S.\nfarm bankruptcies. While this is, of course, an important indicator to watch, it’s equally\nimportant to note that the rise over the past few years has been fairly modest.\nSpecifically, Chapter 12 filings increased from 360 in 2014 to about 500 in 2018. The\n\n- 4 -\nFederal Reserve tracks these developments closely because of their potential implications\nfor both the economy and banking supervision.\nThe challenging outlook has prompted some to wonder if the industry is about to\nrelive the hard times of the 1980s farm crisis. But here, I think, the historical contrast is\nsomewhat reassuring. In the 1970s, farm income in the United States had advanced\nrapidly as exports surged. The broad increase in farm income led to a significant rise in\ncapital investments in the years that followed. But exports began to soften and fell\nsharply after the suspension of trade with the then-Soviet Union. Farm incomes dropped,\nprofits declined rapidly, and liquidity in the U.S. farm sector dried up.\nOther factors turned the sharp downturn into a crisis. High interest rates in the\nearly 1980s, in response to the Great Inflation, contributed to the stress.3 Despite the\nreductions in profits and liquidity, capital spending remained elevated in the early 1980s,\nand was financed with higher levels of debt made possible by rising land values. With\ndebt burdens rising and incomes falling, many farm operations were forced to sell their\nland, causing the value of farmland to decline rapidly. The result was a sharp increase in\nfarm bankruptcies and a number of bank failures.\nWhat about now? There are some similarities. Farm incomes rose rapidly from\n2000 before reaching their peak in 2013 at $123 billion.4 During that time, spurred by\nrising demand in China and a boom in biofuels, farmers invested heavily in new\n3 Jerome H. Powell, “Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy” (speech at Changing Market Structure and\nImplications for Monetary Policy, a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City,\nJackson Hole, Wyoming, August 24, 2018),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm.\n4 U.S. Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service, “Highlights from the March 2019 Farm\nIncome Forecast,” https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/farm-economy/farm-sector-income-finances/highlights-\nfrom-the-farm-income-forecast/.\n\n- 5 -\nequipment and technology to meet this rising demand. And, in a troubling echo of the\n1980s, farm incomes have now been cut roughly in half.\nThat said, there are some important differences between the 1980s and today.\nWith current inflation low and stable, interest rates are substantially lower than in the\n1980s, and overall leverage has been less pronounced. And in contrast to the 1980s,\nfarmland values have declined only modestly in recent years. The combination of\nrelatively low interest rates and modest debt levels has resulted in more-manageable debt\nservice requirements for many agricultural borrowers.5\nSome farm operations have faced significant financial stress, and it is important to\nrecognize that there are still risks. Farmland prices are quite high, and working capital\ncontinues to decline. However, returns at banks with a concentration in agriculture have\ngenerally remained healthy, as most producers have continued to make loan payments\ndespite weakening revenue streams.\nLet me shift focus now to the role of banks, particularly community banks, in the\nU.S. farm economy. Community banks foster strong long-term relationships with\nfarmers, ranchers, and others involved in the local business of agriculture. Often, these\nrelationships are cultivated through community bankers’ service on local civic and\nbusiness organizations or by participation with local farmers and their families in\nactivities to support the local community and economy. Agricultural community banks\nand agricultural borrowers share a common goal of serving and strengthening their local\ncommunities. They are also responsible for providing jobs that maintain the viability of\n5 Cortney Cowley and Ty Kreitman, “Farmland Values Stable, but Risks to Outlook Remain,” Federal\nReserve Bank of Kansas City, February 14, 2019,\nhttps://www.kansascityfed.org/research/indicatorsdata/agcreditsurvey/articles/2019/2-14-2019/farmland-\nvalues-stable-but-risks-to-outlook-remain.\n\n- 6 -\nthese rural communities. Frequently, community bankers’ ties to local agricultural\nbusinesses include running family farms, ranches, orchards, and dairies. In other\ninstances, members of the boards of directors that help to oversee community banks are\nheavily involved in the business of agriculture. These close connections to local\nagricultural businesses provide community banks with a unique and important\nperspective in helping to meet local agricultural credit needs.\nAdditionally, community banks can be more agile than their larger competitors,\nas they employ lenders with a deep understanding of local products and conditions and\nare able to offer customized funding options in response to changing lending conditions.\nThis agility ultimately allows for better informed lending decisions and provides\nagricultural borrowers with the means to fund their operations and sustain their\ncommunities.\nAs bank supervisors, we pay close attention to the performance of all banks,\nincluding agricultural banks. Before we start our conversation today, I would like to\ndiscuss how the Federal Reserve approaches bank supervision with a focus on agriculture\nlending and the challenges our farmers and the community banks that support these\noperations are facing.\nOverview of Agricultural Banks\nThere are approximately 1,400 “agricultural banks” in the United States, all of\nwhich play a vital role in providing rural producers with access to credit.6 Agricultural\nbanks hold approximately 50 percent of all agricultural loans outstanding at U.S.\n6 Agricultural banks are defined as banks with farm production and farm real estate loans equal to 25\npercent or more of total loans.\n\n- 7 -\ncommercial banks. As I noted earlier, farm income has declined by approximately\n50 percent since 2013, yet agricultural loans have steadily increased. Additionally,\nagricultural banks have more challenging funding structures given the seasonal funding\nneeds of their agricultural customers and the difficulty of attracting deposits at rural\ninstitutions. This combination of a cyclical deposit base, lower inflows of deposits into\nrural community banks, and growing loan demand from agricultural borrowers has\nresulted in a greater dependence on borrowed funds to support the recent growth in\nagricultural lending.\nApproximately one-third of all agricultural banks are highly concentrated\nagricultural banks, and the number of these banks has declined slightly over the past\nseveral years--from 479 in December 2016 to 449 in September 2018. Although there\nare some unique risks and challenges for highly concentrated agricultural banks and their\nsupervisors, these banks also generally remain in sound financial condition. And capital\nlevels and liquidity metrics at most ag banks are generally in line with other banks that do\nnot share these concentrations.\nWhile concentrated agricultural banks are currently operating with adequate\ncapital ratios, regulators continue to closely monitor capital levels and to encourage\nprudent capital planning and concentration risk management, given the potential for\nunforeseen challenges and emerging risks associated with agricultural lending.\nWith respect to liquidity, as previously noted, rapid asset growth can strain a\nbank’s liquidity position if its funding sources turn out to be unstable. As supervisors, we\nwork with bankers to understand their liquidity planning process, their challenges around\nattracting deposits, and the risks associated with potentially relying too heavily on\n\n- 8 -\nnoncore sources of funding. We have observed the increasing pressure on community\nbanks to compete for deposits; however, we still see many community banks overcoming\nthis challenge and effectively competing for deposits in their communities.\nAnother key component of all community bank examinations is a focus on asset\nquality. Financial indicators for agriculture banks remain at manageable levels as\nhighlighted by the nonperforming agricultural loans to total loans ratio of 1.36 percent as\nof September 2018.\nIn addition to the traditional focus on the financial factors related to agricultural\nlending, the Federal Reserve has provided examiners with helpful insights into the\nappropriate treatment of agricultural carryover debt. We understand that bankers need to\nwork constructively with borrowers when problems arise. And this is particularly true for\nhighly concentrated agricultural banks, where maintaining enhanced agricultural credit\nrisk-management practices to facilitate prudent underwriting, early detection of problems,\nand well-thought-out restructuring plans for agricultural borrowers are imperative to\nlimiting losses and maintaining a sound banking institution.\nIn 2011, the Federal Reserve also issued guidance to the industry on key risk\nfactors in agricultural lending and supervisory expectations for a financial institution’s\nrisk-management practices.7 This guidance applies in all economic environments, but it\nis especially important in periods of economic stress, because it reminds bankers that the\nidentification of a troubled borrower does not prohibit a banker from working with the\nborrower.\n7 See Supervision and Regulation SR Letter 11-14, “Supervisory Expectations for Risk Management of\nAgriculture Credit Risk,” https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/srletters/sr1114.htm.\n\n- 9 -\nMany banks engaged in agricultural lending are located in communities where\nfarming is the primary economic driver, and simply pushing every borrower with\nchallenges out of the bank does not benefit the long-term interests of the bank or the\ncommunity it serves. The Federal Reserve recognizes the benefits when lenders work\nprudently with troubled borrowers in a way that serves the long-term interests of all\nstakeholders.\nI would like to conclude by recognizing how fortunate we are to have so many\nhighly skilled and experienced farmers and operators, and agricultural lenders who\nsupport them. Modern agriculture is a sophisticated and complex business that requires\nskilled forecasting of supply and demand, rigorous financial and operational\nmanagement, and sharp technical expertise. Our farmers and operators are pushing\nforward the frontiers of agriculture. The integration of robotics, data analytics,\ngeolocation, and advanced sensors holds the promise of a new, more efficient and\nproductive era of “precision agriculture.”\nA close working relationship between farmers and agricultural lenders is essential\nto the economic growth of agricultural borrowers and the continued success of many\nrural communities. The outlook for U.S. agriculture is challenging, though agricultural\nbanks remain relatively stable. As such, it is important for the Federal Reserve to\ncontinue to tailor effective supervision and regulation to ensure the safety and soundness\nof agricultural banks, while also making sure that undue burden does not constrain the\ncapacity of these institutions to continue supporting the agricultural communities that\nthey serve.",

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nA Workshop on the Future of Banking, Hosted by The Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas\nCity\nKansas City, Missouri\nApril 2, 2024\n\nGood morning. Before I provide some context for today’s discussions, I would\nlike to thank all of our participants who are here with us today in Kansas City at the\nReserve Bank, and those participating remotely. Most importantly, I’d like to thank our\nhost, President Schmid, and his excellent research staff, all of whom helped to organize\ntoday’s event. I especially appreciate the opportunity to highlight a few specific areas\nthat concern me about the currently regulatory trajectory and their effects on the future of\nbanking.1\nToday’s workshop addresses timely and important questions, including the forces\nthat will shape the future of the banking system, entry into the banking system, bank\nmergers and acquisitions, and the state of competition including both the direct and\nindirect competition banks experience and how regulators measure and assess\ncompetition—or at least how we broadly measure it today.\nThe failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank just over a year ago, and\nthe stress to the banking system that ensued, caused many institutions to retrench and\nprompted regulators to renew their focus on bank regulatory and supervisory policy and\napproach. Banks responded by enhancing their focus on fundamental risks like interest\nrate and liquidity risk, adopting a more conservative posture in both risk management and\nlending. This self-reflection by both industry and regulators continues today. In fact, the\nlong shadow of the bank failures continues to be a driving force for regulatory and\nsupervisory reforms, even for reform proposals that have little relationship to the events\nsurrounding the bank failures and ensuing banking system stress.\n1 The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee or the Board of Governors.\n\n- 2 -\nAs I have noted in the past, the regulatory reform agenda, and the less visible but\nno less important changes to the supervisory process, touch on a wide range of topics that\ndirectly and indirectly affect banks of all sizes.2 The sheer volume of changes presents\nchallenges to regulated institutions. Outside of the largest banks, how does bank\nmanagement review and provide meaningful comment on voluminous regulatory\nchanges? When those changes are finalized, how does a bank’s management reallocate\nresources to ensure a capability to comply with revised regulations? Are banks,\nespecially small banks, able to locate and retain qualified staff to understand and\nimplement these increasingly complex and burdensome rules? How does a bank’s\nmanagement and compliance officer adjust to supervisory standards and expectations that\nmay be significantly different from exam to exam or regulator to regulator?\nThe 2023 bank failures and circumstances leading up to those failures continue to\nwarrant review, self-reflection, and appropriately targeted changes to identified issues or\nfailures in regulation and supervision. But we should ask whether the volume of reforms\nthat have been proposed, recently finalized, or that are in the pipeline, reflect appropriate\nprioritization. Or instead, do they suggest that we have lost our focus on furthering the\nprimary goal of prudential bank regulation and supervision—promoting a safe and sound\nbanking system and fostering a thriving banking industry that effectively supports local\nand regional economies. I am concerned that the broad-based and insufficiently focused\nreform agenda has become a growing source of risk to the banking system, particularly\ndue to the rushed nature of these reform efforts and the lack of research and\n2 See Michelle W. Bowman, “Reflections on the Economy and Bank Regulation” (speech at the New\nJersey Bankers Association Annual Economic Leadership Forum, Somerset, New Jersey, March 7, 2024),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20240307a.pdf.\n\n- 3 -\nunderstanding of the intended and unintended consequences of these proposals.3 This\nreform agenda, for both regulation and supervision, is the backdrop for today’s panel\ndiscussions.\nRegulatory Approvals in the Banking System\nI have previously spoken about the regulatory dynamics shaping the future of the\nbanking system, from bank capital requirements to liquidity reform, significant revisions\nto the Community Reinvestment Act, a regulatory attack on banks charging fees for\nservices (including debit card interchange fees), the trend of dialing supervision up to\n“11” for banks of all sizes, increased competition from non-banks, the continued\nmigration of certain activities from regulated banks to non-banks outside of the banking\nsystem, and the ongoing erosion of tailoring.4 These issues continue to shape the\ncontours of the banking system—including bank size, the activities in which they engage,\nand where activities occur within the broader financial system. The policy decisions\n3 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Reserve, and the Office of the Comptroller of the\nCurrency recently passed an interim final rule to extend the applicability date of certain provisions in the\nrecent amendments to the Community Reinvestment Act regulations. The need for these delays to\nimportant and controversial elements of the final rule illustrates the rushed, overly complex, and unwieldy\nnature of the Community Reinvestment Act rulemaking. See dissenting statement of Governor Michelle\nW. Bowman, “Statement on the Interim Final Rule and Final Rule Amending the Community\nReinvestment Act Regulations” March 21, 2024,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20240321a1.htm.\n4 Michelle W.

These policy decisions create incentives and\nimpacts that we must acknowledge and understand. When policymakers flatten and\nstandardize regulations and supervisory expectations, we create strong incentives for\nbanks to achieve greater economies of scale through merger and make it harder for new\nbanks to successfully compete with existing banks.\nWhen we “raise the bar” for banks to engage in certain activities in a way that is\ndisproportionate to the risk of those activities, we create incentives for those activities to\nmigrate to non-banks outside of the regulatory perimeter. We must understand whether\nthe policy decisions embedded in the regulatory and supervisory framework are effective\nand complementary. If they are not, we must acknowledge the consequences of\nknowingly implementing conflicting policy choices.\nDe Novo Bank Formation\nI continue to be concerned about the decline in the number of banks in the U.S.\nAs I have noted in the past, there are several indications that there is an unmet demand\nfor new bank creation indicated by the ongoing preference for “charter strip”\nacquisitions, the ongoing shift of activities out of the banking system, and the rising\ndemand for banking-as-a-service partnerships.5\n5 See Michelle W. Bowman, “The Consequences of Fewer Banks in the U.S. Banking System,” (speech at\nthe Wharton Financial Regulation Conference, Philadelphia, PA, April 14, 2023),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20230414a.pdf.\n\n- 5 -\nFor the past decade, de novo bank formation has been largely stagnant, even as\nthe banking industry has rapidly evolved over the same time period. Many factors\ninfluence the pursuit of de novo bank charters, including the interest rate environment,\nbusiness opportunities, the intense competition for qualified bank management and staff,\nand potentially less onerous alternatives for financial services providers to operate\noutside of the regulated banking system.\nThe decision to form a de novo bank is also informed by normal business\nconsiderations including identifying investors, establishing a viable business plan, and\nensuring the ability to navigate the “start-up” phase of a new bank and manage upfront\noperational costs, all while being subjected to intense supervisory oversight over the first\nseveral years of de novo bank operation. Yet, perhaps the most important factor that\ninfluences de novo bank formation is the regulatory and supervisory framework, which\nincludes the application process and receipt of regulatory approval.\nThe application process can be a significant obstacle to de novo bank formation.\nApplications often experience significant delays between the initial charter application\nfiling with the chartering authority and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\n(FDIC) application for deposit insurance. The timeframe for receiving all of the required\nregulatory approvals to open for business often takes well in excess of a year. Of course,\nthis uncertainty must be endured after initial capital has been raised, shareholders\nidentified, and a management team ready to begin work. As one can imagine, these\ndelays can present unique challenges for de novo founders including incurring more start-\nup expenses than anticipated, having difficulty recruiting and retaining qualified\n\n- 6 -\nmanagement to obtain approval, and experiencing challenges raising additional start-up\ncapital investment.\nSome of the uncertainty surrounding the de novo process flows from supervisory\nperceptions of this proposed business model. For example, a de novo business plan that\nfocuses on providing banking-as-a-service outside of a defined geographic footprint\npresents different risks than a business model that focuses on retail banking in an\nunderserved market. It stands to reason that the regulatory expectations for each business\nmodel, including capital levels, risk management, and compliance, will vary. Even\ncontrolling for the variability in business model, the standards and expectations for a de\nnovo application that will be viewed and treated favorably are opaque and may shift\nsignificantly over time, even between and among the regulators.\nThe absence of de novo bank formation over the long run will create a void in the\nbanking system, a void that may contribute to a decline in the availability of reliable and\nfairly priced credit, the absence of financial services in underserved markets, and the\ncontinued shift of banking activities beyond the regulatory perimeter.\nBank Mergers and Acquisitions\nA more immediate concerning influence is the dramatically evolving approach to\nbank mergers and acquisitions (M&A) by some prudential regulators. It is helpful to\nconsider bank M&A broadly, to include not only bank-to-bank mergers subject to\napproval under the Bank Merger Act, but also the broader set of business combinations\ncontemplated under sections 3 and 4 of the Bank Holding Company Act, and under\nsection 10 of the Home Owners’ Loan Act.6\n6 12 U.S.C. §§ 1467a, 1842, 1843.\n\n- 7 -\nThese M&A transactions allow banks to thrive in our dynamic banking system,\nand help to promote the long-term health and viability of banks. M&A also ensures that\nsome institutions have a meaningful path to transitioning bank ownership. In the absence\nof a viable M&A framework, we increase the potential for additional risks including\nlimited opportunities for succession planning, especially in smaller or rural communities\nand zombie banks that continue to exist but have no competitive viability or exit strategy.\nM&A reform is currently a popular topic on the banking agency regulatory\nagenda with the process and standards regulators employ to review and approve\ntransactions under intense scrutiny. Recently some of the federal banking regulators have\nproposed or described new M&A policy approaches, with the Department of Justice\ncurrently reviewing how it enforces section 7 of the Clayton Act.7\nAs regulators revisit the evaluation standards for bank M&A transactions under\nthe statutory framework, we should consider whether the regulatory review process is\nfair, transparent, and consistent with applicable statutes. This should begin with an\nimportant threshold question—what are the identified shortcomings with the current\nprocess or standards, and are the proposed reforms targeted and effective to address these\nshortcomings?\nOne concern that has been raised about the M&A regulatory approval process\nseems largely based on the misconception that a lack of application denials implies that\n7 Jonathan Kanter, “Merger Enforcement Sixty Years After Philadelphia National Bank” (keynote Address\nat the Brookings Institution’s Center on Regulation and Markets Event, Promoting Competition in Banking,\nWashington, DC, June 20 2023), https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/assistant-attorney-general-jonathan-\nkanter-delivers-keynote-address-brookings-institution; Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,\n“Business Combinations Under the Bank Merger Act: Notice of Proposed Rulemaking,” OCC Bulletin\n2024-4, January 29, 2024, https://occ.gov/news-issuances/bulletins/2024/bulletin-2024-4.html; Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation, “FDIC Seeks Public Comment on Proposed Revisions to its Statement of\nPolicy on Bank Merger Transactions,” news release, March 21, 2024, https://www.fdic.gov/news/press-\nreleases/2024/pr24017.html.\n\n- 8 -\nstandards are simply not rigorous enough, that the regulatory approval process has\nbecome a rubber stamp. This view ignores the reality of the filing process. These\ntransactions require significant upfront and ongoing investment and commitment of\nresources. At the outset, this includes finding an appropriate acquisition target,\nconducting due diligence, and negotiating the terms of the transaction. Once a target is\nidentified, the banks must prepare appropriate regulatory filings, engage with regulators\nduring the application process, and prepare for post-approval business processes\nincluding scheduling necessary and costly systems conversions and customer transition.\nThis is an expensive and reputationally risky process that bankers take extremely\nseriously. They do not make the decision to file an application lightly. Even for those\ninstitutions that decide to proceed with an application, success is not guaranteed, even in\nthe absence of a regulatory denial. The Federal Reserve’s most recent report on banking\napplications activity identifies a significant portion of bank M&A transactions in which\napplications have been withdrawn.8\nIn its recent proposal, one agency suggested that if an applicant withdraws a\nfiling, that agency’s board may release a statement regarding the concerns with the\napplication in the interest of creating transparency for future applicants.9 I have observed\nthat applicants may withdraw a filing for a number of reasons, including prolonged\nuncertainty due to regulatory delays, expiration of contractual deadlines, and issues that\n8 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Banking Applications Activity Semiannual Report,\nJune 1 – June 30, 2023, Vol. 10, No. 2 (Washington: Board of Governors, September 2023),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/semiannual-report-on-banking-applications-\n20230929.pdf. This report notes that in the first half of 2023, 46 M&A applications were approved by the\nFederal Reserve, while 12 such applications were withdrawn.\n9 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Press Release, “FDIC Seeks Public Comment on Proposed\nRevisions to its Statement of Policy on Bank Merger Transactions,” March 21, 2024, at 74,\nhttps://www.fdic.gov/news/press-releases/2024/pr24017.html.\n\n- 9 -\nare uncovered only during the processing of the application (for example, the issuance of\nupdated supervisory ratings from recently completed examinations). As a general matter,\nthis approach could evolve to become the expectation for all withdrawn applications, and,\nif so, could put regulators in the untenable position of needing to disclose confidential\nsupervisory information or nonpublic business information about applicants even in the\ncase of a withdrawn application.\nJust as in the de novo bank formation process, one of the key risks to an effective\nM&A process is a lack of timely regulatory action. The consequences of delays can\nsignificantly harm both the acquiring institution and the target, causing greater\noperational risk (including the risk of a failed merger), increased expenses, reputational\nrisk, and staff attrition in the face of prolonged uncertainty.\nReducing the efficiency of bank M&A can be a deterrent to healthy bank\ntransactions—it can reduce the effectiveness of M&A activity that preserves the presence\nof community banks in underserved areas, prevent institutions from pursuing prudent\ngrowth strategies, and actually undermine competition by preventing firms from growing\nto a larger scale, effectively creating a “protected class” of larger institutions.\nGiven all of these considerations, it seems reasonable to assume that the\nuncertainty of the M&A process itself may act as a deterrent to de novo bank formation,\nas potential bank founders stay on the sidelines knowing that future exit strategies—like\nthe strategic acquisition of a de novo bank by a larger peer—may face long odds of\nsuccess. We must not foreclose bank merger activities that are permitted by law and that\nare necessary to maintain a healthy banking system.\n\n- 10 -\nInstead, we should focus on ensuring that we can improve the speed and\ntimeliness of regulatory decisionmaking, applying review standards that are reasonable\nand consistent with the statutory framework. Too often it seems that regulators discount\nthe fact that these organizations do not simply hit the pause button during the merger\nreview process. We must remember that these organizations are businesses that continue\nto operate and must do so in a way that supports their ongoing business operations and\nfuture growth.\nUnfortunately, the past year has shown that regulatory attention is increasingly\nfocused on other issues, with the timeliness of regulatory action appearing to be lower on\nthe list of priorities. These efforts have not improved the outlook for the bank merger\nprocess. Pending reform efforts may actually exacerbate the existing problems, resulting\nin an increase in the already significant delays in processing times for some applications.\nUncertainty in the standards for an application review can drive delays. A federal\nagency recently indicated that it may deviate from the longstanding approach to\nevaluating competitive effects of a merger using a deposit-based analysis. While this\nanalysis could be retained as an initial screen, that agency would “evaluate the\ncompetitive effects of a proposed merger in a manner that is most relevant to each\ntransaction,” and “may consider concentrations in any specific products or customer\nsegments….”10 I imagine bankers contemplating merger transactions will have little\ncapacity to evaluate whether a merger would raise regulatory issues in advance under this\nopen-ended standard.\n10 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Press Release, “FDIC Seeks Public Comment on Proposed\nRevisions to its Statement of Policy on Bank Merger Transactions,” March 21, 2024, at 75-76,\nhttps://www.fdic.gov/news/press-releases/2024/pr24017.html.\n\n- 11 -\nThat proposal also includes revisions to the convenience and needs analysis that\nmay frustrate banks’ ability not only to receive regulatory approval, but to manage their\nbusinesses going forward. Specifically, the proposal notes that applicants should be\n“prepared to make commitments regarding future retail banking services in the\ncommunity to be served for at least three years following consummation of the\nmerger.”11 The proposal also suggests that the resulting bank would be expected to\n“better” meet the convenience and needs of the community to be served than it would\nabsent the merger.12 As is the current expectation, a bank should expect to provide\ninformation on their plans for activities and branches as part of the application process.\nBut we should acknowledge that those plans may change over time as conditions evolve.\nA bank’s future activities, whether banking or branching, are subject to regulatory\nrequirements, and oversight through ongoing supervision activities. We need not operate\nlike the applications process is the only tool available to address policy concerns. I\nexpect this proposal would greatly benefit from public input.\nEven reported data on current merger processing times may understate the\nbroader application processing timeline. This process often includes preliminary\ndiscussions and pre-filings with regulators, and delays between the time an application is\nfiled and when it is “accepted” by the regulator triggering the regulatory processing\nclock.13\n11 Id., at 42-43.\n12 Id., at 82.\n13 See Michelle W. Bowman, “Reflections on the Economy and Bank Regulation” (speech at the Florida\nBankers Association Leadership Luncheon Events, Miami, FL, February 27, 2024),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20240227a.pdf.\n\n- 12 -\nFinally, the M&A process can be inappropriately influenced when regulators\nmake demands on firms that are not squarely grounded in statutory approval requirements\nor based on safety and soundness considerations. During the application deliberation\nprocess, regulators can impose limitations or restrictions to address specific supervisory\nor policy concerns in the form of “conditions” or “commitments” on the approval. While\nthis can be an important tool, it should not be used to replace rulemaking or existing\nregulations and statutes that guide regulatory action; we should not engage in “regulation\nby application.” Conditions or commitments that impose obligations that are inconsistent\nwith our existing regulatory framework raise issues of significant concern.14 In these\ncircumstances, our existing rules and regulations are the most appropriate and effective\ntools to address concerns.\nClosing Thoughts\nPolicymakers continue to play an important role in shaping the future of the\nbanking system, not only through policy choices on substantive regulations and\nsupervisory approaches, but also through their role in bank formations, mergers, and\nacquisitions. We currently have a dynamic banking system, but these individual pieces\nof the bank regulatory framework do not function independently. The policy choices\nembodied in current regulation and supervision, and in proposed reforms, aggregate to\ninfluence the future of the banking system, often in ways that are unpredictable, and at\ntimes in ways that are in conflict and internally inconsistent.\n14 See Michelle W. Bowman, Statement on Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on Resolution\nRequirements for Large Banks and Application by U.S. Bancorp, October 14, 2022,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bowman-statement-20221014.htm\n\n- 13 -\nI hope that today’s discussions provide an opportunity to have frank conversations\nabout the dynamics shaping the future of the banking system. And throughout, that we\nidentify opportunities to rationalize regulatory approaches, and ensure that the values\nregulators say they support—like the importance of a broad and diverse banking system\nthat includes institutions of all sizes serving all of the different market segments across\nthe country—are consistent with regulatory actions.\nI am concerned that many of these actions may actually undermine the long-term\nviability of banks. I look forward to hearing the insights of all of our participants today,\nand thinking more deeply about how regulation, supervision, and ongoing reform efforts\ncan help to positively influence a banking system that will effectively and efficiently\nserve communities of all sizes, consumers, businesses, and the broader U.S. economy\nlong into the future.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n2:00 p.m. EDT (10:00 a.m. AKDT)\nAugust 20, 2024\nRemarks on the Economic Outlook and Financial Inclusion\nby\nMichelle W. Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nAlaska Bankers Association\nAnchorage, Alaska\nAugust 20, 2024\n\nGood morning. It is really a pleasure to join you here in Alaska.1 Getting outside of\nWashington, D.C. and hearing about the unique issues that affect Alaskans provides valuable\ninsights that inform my work at the Federal Reserve. A part of the mission of the Federal\nReserve is to support an economy that works for everyone. Consumers and communities are\nmore successful when they have access to financial products and services that meet their needs.\nWhile many of these products and services are available online, as Alaskans know better than\nmost Americans, geography and location are also important. This access often looks very\ndifferent in places with many remote and rural communities. Today, I will discuss the Federal\nReserve’s work to promote a more inclusive financial system, including our work on financial\ninclusion for Indigenous communities. Before diving into those topics, I will share my current\nviews on the economy and monetary policy.\nEconomic and Monetary Policy Outlook\nOver the past two years, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has significantly\ntightened the stance of monetary policy to address high inflation. At our July meeting, the\nFOMC voted to continue to hold the federal funds rate target range at 5¼ to 5½ percent and to\ncontinue to reduce the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings.\nAfter seeing considerable progress last year, in recent months we have seen some further\nprogress on lowering inflation. The 12-month measures of total and core personal consumption\nexpenditures (PCE) inflation, which I prefer to the more volatile higher-frequency readings, have\nmoved down since April, although they have remained somewhat elevated at 2.5 percent and 2.6\npercent in June, respectively. In addition, the latest consumer and producer price index reports\n1 The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee or the Board of Governors.\n\n- 2 -\nindicate that 12-month core PCE inflation likely remained a bit above 2.5 percent in July. The\nprogress in lowering inflation since April is a welcome development, but inflation is still\nuncomfortably above the Committee’s 2 percent goal.\nPrices continue to be much higher than before the pandemic, which continues to weigh\non consumer sentiment. Inflation has hit lower-income households hardest, since food, energy,\nand housing services price increases far outpaced overall inflation over the past few years.\nEconomic activity moderated in the first half of this year after increasing at a strong pace\nlast year. Private domestic final purchases (PDFP) growth was solid and slowed much less than\ngross domestic product (GDP), as the slowdown in GDP growth was partly driven by volatile\ncategories such as net exports, suggesting that underlying economic growth was stronger than\nGDP indicated. Unusually strong consumer goods spending last year softened in the first quarter\nof this year, largely accounting for the step-down in PDFP growth. Goods spending rebounded\nin the second quarter and retail sales continued to rise at a solid pace in July.\nConsumers appear to be pulling back on discretionary items and expenses, as evidenced\nin part by a decline in restaurant spending since late last year. Low- and moderate-income\nconsumers no longer have savings to support this type of spending, and we’ve seen a\nnormalization of loan delinquency rates as they have risen from historically low levels during the\npandemic.\nThe labor market continues to loosen, as the number of available workers has increased\nand the number of available jobs has declined—signs that illustrate the labor market is coming\ninto better balance. After slowing in the second quarter, payroll employment gains eased to a\nmore modest pace in July, even as job openings are being filled by the increased immigrant labor\nsupply. The latest labor market report shows that the unemployment rate stood at 4.3 percent in\n\n- 3 -\nJuly. Although notably higher than a year ago, this is still a historically low unemployment rate.\nIn addition, the ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers has declined to its pre-pandemic\nlevel. We are also seeing a slowing in wage growth, which now stands at just under 4 percent as\nmeasured by the employment cost index. However, given trend productivity, wage gains remain\nabove the pace consistent with our inflation goal.\nMy baseline outlook is that inflation will decline further with the current stance of\nmonetary policy. Should the incoming data continue to show that inflation is moving sustainably\ntoward our 2 percent goal, it will become appropriate to gradually lower the federal funds rate to\nprevent monetary policy from becoming overly restrictive on economic activity and\nemployment. But we need to be patient and avoid undermining continued progress on lowering\ninflation by overreacting to any single data point. Instead, we must view the data in their totality\nas the risks to the Committee’s employment and price-stability mandates continue to move into\nbetter balance. That said, I still see some upside risks to inflation as supply conditions have now\nlargely normalized and any further improvements to supply seem less likely to offset price\npressures arising from increasing geopolitical tensions, additional fiscal stimulus, and increased\ndemand for housing due to immigration.\nThere are also risks that the labor market has not been as strong as the payroll data have\nbeen indicating, and it appears that the recent rise in unemployment may be exaggerating the\ndegree of cooling in labor markets. The Q4 Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages\n(QCEW) report suggests that job gains have been consistently overstated in the establishment\nsurvey since March of last year, while the household survey unemployment data have become\n\n- 4 -\nless accurate as response rates have appreciably declined since the pandemic.2 The rise in the\nunemployment rate this year largely reflects weaker hiring, as job searchers entering the labor\nforce are taking longer to find work, and layoffs remain low. It is also likely that some\ntemporary factors contributed to the soft July employment report. The rise in the unemployment\nrate in July was largely accounted for by workers who are experiencing a temporary layoff and\nare more likely to be rehired in coming months. Hurricane Beryl also likely contributed to\nweaker job gains, as the number of workers not working due to bad weather increased\nsignificantly last month.\nIn light of upside risks to inflation and uncertainty regarding labor market conditions and\nthe economic outlook, I will continue to watch the data closely as I assess the appropriate path of\nmonetary policy. Increased measurement challenges and the frequency and extent of data\nrevisions over the past few years make the task of assessing the current state of the economy and\npredicting how it will evolve even more challenging. I will remain cautious in my approach to\nconsidering adjustments to the current stance of policy.\nIt is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course. In my view, we\nshould consider a range of possible scenarios that could unfold when assessing how the FOMC’s\nmonetary policy decisions may evolve. My colleagues and I will make our decisions at each\nFOMC meeting based on the incoming data and the implications for and risks to the outlook and\nguided by the Fed’s dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices. By the time\nof our September meeting, we will have seen additional economic data and information,\n2 The Q4 Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) administrative data show employment gains that\nare about 110,000 per month lower than what the Current Employment Statistics (CES) survey reported from March\n2023 to December 2023. Although the Bureau of Labor Statistics benchmarks CES payroll employment based on\nthe Q1 QCEW, to be released on August 21, the Q4 QCEW data point to a substantial downward revision to CES\nemployment gains last year.\n\n- 5 -\nincluding one employment and one inflation report. We will also monitor how developments in\nbroader financial conditions might influence the economic outlook.\nI will continue to closely watch the data and visit with a broad range of contacts as I\nassess economic conditions and the appropriateness of our monetary policy stance. As I noted\nearlier, I continue to view inflation as somewhat elevated. And with some upside risks to\ninflation, I still see the need to pay close attention to the price-stability side of our mandate while\nwatching for risks of a material weakening in the labor market. My view continues to be that\nrestoring price stability is essential for achieving maximum employment over the longer run.\nFocus on Financial Inclusion\nI will turn now to discuss our work to promote financial inclusion. An inclusive financial\nsystem enables access to financial services that enhance the financial well-being of consumers\nand businesses. Consumers come from a wide range of economic circumstances, with varied\nperceptions of and experiences with the banking system and different financial needs. All\nconsumers should have access to the financial services and products they need.\nThe U.S. economy benefits when more households achieve financial stability. Yet, while\nwe have made significant progress in expanding access to financial services and deposit accounts\nin the United States, the remaining challenges often include geographic location, products that\nmeet specific customer needs, the absence of financial literacy education, lack of access to\ntechnology and reliable internet, and in some cases, language. These challenges are even more\nacute in providing access to financial services to Indigenous populations like those here in\nAlaska. It is impressive to see that many financial services providers, including banks and\nCommunity Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs), are working to address these\nchallenges and making significant inroads.\n\n- 6 -\nImportance of banks in furthering financial inclusion\nThe U.S. financial system is uniquely positioned to bring consumers into the financial\nmainstream by providing innovative solutions to meet the credit needs of their communities.\nBanks and other depository institutions assist consumers and small businesses by providing\nfinancial products and services that are safe, fair, and responsive. In doing so, they serve a\ncritical role in connecting consumers to the financial system and to the economy.\nSmaller banks, including community banks, are indispensable in providing access to\nfinancial products and services, especially in more remote or rural areas. Here, in Alaska, your\nbanks are the front-line providers for your communities. As you know well, community banks\nsupport small businesses through credit and technical assistance and targeted support specific to\ncustomers in their communities. As a former community banker, I know firsthand that smaller\nbanks deeply understand their communities because they live in the local economy and know\ntheir customers well.\nThis was especially apparent during the COVID pandemic. Community banks rose to the\nchallenge and continued to support the needs of their customers and communities. One of the\nprograms first made available in response to the pandemic was the Paycheck Protection Program\n(PPP), which was geared to small businesses and was necessarily dependent on community\nbanks. The PPP was timely and effective in helping millions of businesses weather the initial\n\n- 7 -\nphase of the pandemic, and community banks were absolutely essential to the success of the\nprogram.3\nThis successful outcome is probably not surprising to this audience, because when it\ncomes to lending to small businesses, community banks have always been an outsized source of\ncredit, relative to their size in the banking system. Before the pandemic, community banks\naccounted for over 40 percent of all small business lending, while they only accounted for\nroughly 15 percent of total assets in the banking system.4 This trend has continued. An analysis\nof June 2023 call report data showed that community banks had larger shares of small-business\nloans relative to their total assets than larger institutions.5\nCommunity banks know their customers, and they know their communities. During that\nchallenging time, community bank CEOs told me that early in the pandemic they directly\ncontacted every single one of their business and consumer loan customers. They took the time to\ncheck in with each one to see how they were doing, and what they needed. They encouraged\ncustomers to keep in touch with the bank, and they noted the available opportunities for payment\ndeferrals and other options that customers might not have been aware of. Because of this\n3 Allen N. Berger, Maryann P. Feldman, W. Scott Langford, and Raluca A.

Bowman, “Community Banks Rise to the Challenge” (speech at the Community Banking\nin the 21st Century Research Conference, St. Louis, MO, September 30, 2020),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20200930a.htm\n5 See Eldar Beiseitov, “Small Banks, Big Impact: Community Banks and Their Role in Small Business Lending,”\nOctober 20, 2023, https://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/regional-economist/2023/oct/small-banks-big-impact-\ncommunity-banks-small-business-lending.\n\n- 8 -\nrelationship banking model, small banks were and continue to be able to provide more tailored\nfinancial products and services that are designed to meet the specific needs of their customers.6\nWe all recognize the important role of small banks in the functioning of the U.S.\neconomy by supporting the financial needs of their customers and communities. The Federal\nReserve relies on insights from community banks and created a mechanism to formalize the\nviews and feedback from community banks on a regular basis through our Reserve Bank and\nBoard Community Depository Institutions Advisory Councils (CDIAC). The Board CDIAC\nincludes a representative from each of the local advisory councils at the 12 Reserve Banks.\nCDIAC members are bankers from community banks, thrifts, and credit unions who provide\ninsight and information about the economy, lending conditions, and other issues that they see\nfirsthand in their communities.\nThis perspective helps us gain insights into economic activity and the impact of our\npolicies on rural and underserved communities.\nCentral Bank Network for Indigenous Inclusion\nI will turn now to highlight our efforts in providing broader access to financial services.\nIn 2021, the Federal Reserve became a member of the Central Bank Network for Indigenous\nInclusion (CBNII).7 This group brings together the central banks of the United States, Canada,\nNew Zealand, and Australia. The network enabled us to initiate an ongoing international\ndialogue to raise awareness of economic and financial issues in Indigenous populations. This\n6 Governor Michelle W. Bowman, “The Role of Research, Data, and Analysis in Banking Reforms” (speech at the\n2023 Community Banking Research Conference, St. Louis, MO, October 4, 2023),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20231004a.htm\n7 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Federal Reserve Board Announces It Has Joined the Central\nBank Network for Indigenous Inclusion, Which Will Foster Ongoing Dialogue, Research, and Education to Raise\nAwareness of Economic and Financial Issues and Opportunities around Indigenous Economies,” news release,\nOctober 13, 2021, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20211013a.htm\n\n- 9 -\nallows us to share knowledge and best practices, promote engagement and education, and work\ntogether with Indigenous communities.\nAs the Federal Reserve’s representative to the network, I have prioritized expanding our\noutreach and engagement efforts to include all U.S. Native populations, Native Alaskan, Native\nHawaiian, and Native American. Coming here to Alaska is a key part of this role to ensure that\nthe Federal Reserve continues to expand our firsthand knowledge and understanding of the\nissues and barriers that may prevent full engagement in the economy. I take these\nresponsibilities seriously and have made meeting with and learning from Indigenous groups and\nleaders a priority in my work.\nIn October 2021, I met with Native American leaders in South Dakota and on the Pine\nRidge Reservation. These tribal leaders highlighted the importance of building understanding by\nmeeting with people in their communities to enhance our knowledge of their social and\neconomic circumstances. Earlier this year and last year, I met with members of the Native\nHawaiian community and a range of community organizations to learn about the issues and\nchallenges they face, in addition to the recovery efforts following the devastating wildfire in\nLahaina. And yesterday, I met with Native Alaskan leaders to learn about Alaska Native\ncorporations and other initiatives here in Alaska. These convenings and conversations help to\ninform our work at the Federal Reserve to ensure that the financial system is accessible to\neveryone, including Indigenous communities.\nThe Fed’s work in this area is supported by many of our Reserve Bank teams, including\nthe San Francisco Reserve Bank, the Minneapolis Center for Indian Country Development, and\nthe St. Louis Native Economic and Financial Education Empowerment program. Together, these\nteams and programs support Indigenous organizations and tribal nations by providing actionable\n\n- 10 -\ndata and research, economic and personal finance education, and other resources to advance\nopportunities for prosperity in Indigenous communities.\nWe know that the economic well-being of all Americans is an important aspect of the\nFederal Reserve’s goal to increase economic inclusion, and it is one of the reasons we began\nparticipating in the CBNII. Even with all of its tools, the Federal Reserve cannot fully succeed\nuntil all Americans, including our Native populations and those existing on the margins of the\neconomy, have the opportunity to fully participate. Engagement in these learning opportunities,\nincluding these meetings, will help to advance this goal.\nMission-driven organizations\nFinally, I would like to briefly address the Federal Reserve’s efforts to build the\ninstitutional capacity of another set of key stakeholders: Minority Depository Institutions,\nWomen-Owned Depository Institutions, and CDFIs, whose missions are to reach historically\nunderserved populations. Providing support for these institutions is an important part of the\nFederal Reserve’s responsibility to provide a safe, sound, and accessible banking system that\nprotects consumers.8\nThese mission-driven banks and CDFIs are often vital sources of capital to many\nunderrepresented small businesses. CDFIs generally target specific underserved markets. For\nexample, there are many Native CDFIs, including several here in Alaska, that support Native\ncommunities by providing access to credit, capital, and financial services.9 While there has been\nsome significant growth in Native CDFIs,10 they cannot singlehandedly resolve the credit needs\nof this population. This effort will require partnerships with banks, state and local governments,\n8 See the Federal Reserve’s Partnership for Progress website at https://www.fedpartnership.gov.\n9 See https://www.cdfifund.gov/programs-training/programs/native-initiatives.\n10 See https://www.minneapolisfed.org/article/2024/native-cdfis-connect-indian-country-to-credit-and-capital.\n\n- 11 -\nand community stakeholders. As an example, the Federal Reserve convened a small business\nlending working group that brought together local, state, and federal partners to address\nchallenges with access to capital for Alaskan small businesses, especially those owned by Native\nAlaskans.11 This group has helped connect local Native CDFIs to banks and state and federal\npartners for funding and technical assistance.\nFinally, I will close with a brief note on the revisions to the CDFI Certification\nApplication recently released by the Treasury’s CDFI Fund.12 There are significant benefits to\nbeing a certified CDFI, including access to federal, state, and local governmental funds,\nphilanthropic support, and private sector investment. While the certification process is overseen\nby the CDFI Fund, I encourage CDFI banks to review the new certification application and share\nfeedback on whether the requirements are attainable and remain compatible with the bank’s\nexisting business model.\nClosing Thoughts\nIn closing, thank you again for welcoming me here today. I am very pleased to have the\nopportunity to learn from your experiences and incorporate these lessons into our work. The\nunique challenges that you face here in Alaska will help to inform and expand the Federal\nReserve’s understanding of how we can make the financial system more inclusive. Our meetings\nover the past few days with state government officials, Native Alaskan leaders, small business\nowners, and financial institutions provide many different perspectives to help inform our work to\nachieve an economy that works for everyone.\n11 Governor Michelle W.

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Opportunities and Challenges for Homeownership,” a Virtual Roundtable Discussion\nJake Jabs College of Business & Entrepreneurship, Montana State University\nBozeman, Montana\n(via webcast)\nOctober 1, 2020\n\nGood afternoon, everyone. Thank you to Montana State University (MSU) for\nhosting today’s event and for that very kind introduction. It is wonderful to see the\nsuccess of your Community Banking Program here at MSU and your commitment to\ninvesting in the education of future generations of community bankers.\nThroughout the response to the pandemic, community bankers have continued to\nserve as the primary source of credit to small businesses and have continued to provide\neconomic and financial support to communities across our nation. Young people, like all\nof you engaged in this program, will very likely become the future leaders of these\ninstitutions, which are critical to their communities and to our economy and financial\nsystem.\nOne of the most significant challenges facing community bankers today is\nnavigating the complex regulatory framework. One area that has become more\ncomplicated is a line of business that has traditionally been the foundation for community\nbanking, home mortgage lending. Community bank leaders consistently tell me that\nsignificant regulatory burden related to making home mortgages has been a major reason\nthey have scaled back their mortgage lending activities or exited the market altogether.\nAlong with tightened lending standards, this trend has made it harder for middle- and\nlower-income borrowers to obtain mortgage credit since the global financial crisis.\nFortunately, work is under way to relieve that burden, and I will highlight one\neffort in particular. But before I do, let me provide some context by reviewing the\ncurrent state of the economy and its effect on homeowners and would-be homeowners.\nThe COVID-19 Pandemic and Homeownership in the U.S.\n\n- 2 -\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is having a profound effect on individuals and families\nacross the U.S. and throughout the world. While a strong recovery has begun, it is clear\nthat there is still a way to go before we are back to the robust economy we experienced at\nthe beginning of the year. These challenges are affecting homeowners and the lenders\nthat provide credit to support them. Many homeowners who have lost a job or have had\ntheir income affected by economic conditions have been able to work with their lenders,\nbut such help may not be a long-term solution for many borrowers.\nFortunately, the housing market as a whole is a bright spot for the economy.\nHigher home prices are improving the balance sheets of many households, even those\nthat may face income and employment challenges, and new construction activity is\ngenerating new job opportunities. While affordability remains an important\nconsideration, it is encouraging that housing has performed well in response to low\ninterest rates.\nMortgage Regulations and Access to Mortgage Credit\nHowever, even during this period of strong performance in the housing market,\naccess to affordable mortgage credit remains a barrier to homeownership for some\nborrowers, due in part to regulatory burden. Since the last financial crisis more than a\ndecade ago, there have been a number of new mortgage regulations that added\nrequirements for both borrowers and lenders. While many of these requirements have\ncontributed to a safer and more consumer-friendly mortgage market, they have also\nintroduced significant paperwork and delays that can present roadblocks for many\nborrowers. These new rules have also made it more difficult and costly for small banks\n\n- 3 -\nto originate mortgage loans, leading many community banks to scale back on home\nlending activity or abandon it altogether.\nHomeownership is as important to communities as it is to individuals, and access\nto credit for rural and low-to-moderate income communities often depends on community\nbanks. In many communities, especially rural communities, if the local bank has been\nforced out of mortgage lending due to burdensome regulation, it means little or no access\nto mortgage credit, preventing buyers from financing home purchases and homeowners\nfrom selling their homes.\nMany leaders of small community banks have told me that the compliance costs\nfor originating smaller mortgages are prohibitive, and that the staffing and training\nrequired to meet the strict requirements are extraordinary in relation to the limited\nnumber of mortgages they originate. As one state banking commissioner said to me\nrecently, “It doesn’t make a lot of sense that you can make an $80,000 truck loan on two\nsides of a sheet of paper, but that many, many pages of paperwork are required to make a\n$40,000 loan on a mobile home or trailer.”\nIn fact, I have been told by community bankers that they are sometimes\ncompelled to make loans for lower-priced home purchases that are backed by other\ncollateral, such as a car or equipment, because of the excessive burden of complying with\nthe many residential home mortgage regulations and time frames for such small\ntransactions. As a result, these consumers may not have the benefit of the important\nconsumer protections that having a home mortgage loan provides.\nReducing mortgage compliance burden would allow community banks to better\nmeet the critical need for home lending in their communities. Because of their local\n\n- 4 -\nknowledge and strong customer relationships, community banks are often more willing to\nwork with borrowers to get through difficult times. Taking steps to simplify and lower\nthis regulatory burden for small community banks and their customers would help to\nensure that homeowners can stay in their homes during times of stress, like the one we\nare facing currently due to COVID-19.\nOne Area to Consider in Easing Burden\nThe TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure, or TRID, is one of the real estate\nregulatory requirements that smaller banks cite most frequently as creating a heavy\nburden. Commissioner Melanie Hall and the Montana Independent Bankers have been\nparticularly helpful in highlighting the importance of this issue. Therefore, I am very\npleased that the Independent Community Bankers of America is engaged in ongoing\nconversations and activities to address the more burdensome aspects of this requirement\non community banks while importantly retaining key consumer protections. Efforts like\nthese that aim to reduce the compliance burden for critically important services will\nenable many community banks to return to doing what they do best: meeting the needs of\ntheir communities.\nAgain, thank you for inviting me to join you today, and I look forward to\nengaging on this important topic.",

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nFinancial Inclusion Practices and Innovations\nWashington, D.C.\nJuly 9, 2024\n\nGood afternoon and welcome back to the second half of today’s conference on Financial\nInclusion Practices and Innovations.1 It is really a pleasure to join you to discuss this important\ntopic. This morning, our panelists provided their perspectives on issues related to supervision\nand regulation and payment frictions and innovations both domestically and internationally. The\nresearch and perspectives they discussed can certainly help to broaden our understanding of\nfinancial inclusion and all of the associated challenges. Together, our work to promote\ninitiatives that further this work will enable greater access to financial services. An economy\nthat works for everyone necessarily includes a more inclusive financial system. More expansive\ninclusion opportunities improve the financial well-being of both consumers and small businesses,\nthereby contributing to overall economic growth.\nToday, I would like to highlight the excellent work being done in this area by our\nDivision of Consumer and Community Affairs (DCCA). I will also touch on some ways that the\nbanking system and private sector can support financial inclusion.\nPromoting an Inclusive Financial System Is a Foundational Element of DCCA’s Work\nBefore discussing our work at the Federal Reserve, I would like to first take a step back\nto anchor financial inclusion within the broader objective of fostering an economy that works for\neveryone. A healthy and robust U.S. economy relies upon broad access to financial resources\nand education. Bringing consumers and small businesses into the financial mainstream helps\nthem more fully engage in the financial system and the economy and should help to facilitate the\nmore effective operation of the U.S. economy. Through its responsibility for community affairs,\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nDCCA works to achieve a thorough understanding of current community conditions and best\npractices by conducting research and convening relevant private sector participants.\nToday, we will focus on their important work to enhance financial access. As the chair of\nthe Consumer and Community Affairs Committee, I oversee these efforts. As many of you\nknow well, DCCA’s financial inclusion work is expansive, and I look forward to highlighting\nthese contributions with you today.\nFirst, DCCA informs internal and external stakeholders by leveraging its research and\nanalysis to provide information that can be utilized by external stakeholders to support their\nwork. For example, one of the Fed’s most important contributions to the study of financial well-\nbeing is the annual Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking, or the SHED. We\npublished the 11th annual report in May. The report addresses topics including financial well-\nbeing, savings, retirement, economic fragility, education, and student loans.2\nThe Federal Reserve System also conducts an annual Small Business Credit Survey\n(SBCS), which is a survey of over 6,000 firms with fewer than 500 employees located\nthroughout the country. This year’s survey found that many small businesses were experiencing\ntight financial conditions and often had to rely on personal financial resources, such as personal\nfunds or a loan from family or friends, to support their businesses.3 Because access to credit is\nfundamental to broader financial access and inclusion, this experience of reliance on personal\n2 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “2023 Survey of Household Economics and\nDecisionmaking,” (2024), https://www.federalreserve.gov/consumerscommunities/shed.htm.

For example, the Community Advisory Council (CAC), which\nconsists of members of the non-profit sector and hands-on community development practitioners,\nmeets with the Board of Governors twice each year to share their experiences and observations\nand to engage on challenges facing the consumers and communities they serve. The CAC\nfocuses on the concerns of low- and moderate-income people, and at its most recent meeting in\nMay, the CAC focused on a range of economic matters continuing to affect financially\nvulnerable communities.\nDCCA also prioritizes the work of mission-driven organizations in its efforts to expand\nfinancial inclusion. The Partnership for Progress (PFP) program is the Federal Reserve’s\nMinority Depository Institution (MDI) outreach program created to support the System’s\nmandate to preserve and promote MDIs. DCCA, in collaboration with other areas of the Federal\nReserve, engages MDIs and Women-Owned Depository Institutions (WDIs) through national\noutreach efforts. The PFP provides technical assistance to help MDIs and WDIs address unique\nbusiness model challenges, enabling these institutions to compete more effectively in the\nmarketplace.4\nThird, DCCA ensures that financial institutions under the Fed’s jurisdiction comply with\nlaws and regulations that protect consumers and promote community development, including fair\nlending laws and the prohibition on unfair and deceptive acts and practices. For example, DCCA\nexamines state member banks for compliance with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, which\n4 See the Federal Reserve’s Partnership for Progress website at https://www.fedpartnership.gov.\n\n- 4 -\nprohibits discrimination in any aspect of a credit transaction based on race, gender, marital\nstatus, age, or another prohibited basis. The division’s work to protect consumers from harm\nfurthers our goal to create an economy that works for everyone.\nRegulated Financial Institutions and Financial Inclusion\nI would like to turn now to share some thoughts about how the private sector can engage\nto support financial inclusion. The U.S. banking system is well-positioned to bring consumers\ninto the financial mainstream by providing innovative solutions to meet the credit needs of their\ncommunities. For example, banks help consumers and small businesses by providing financial\nproducts and services that are safe, fair, and responsive, including through small dollar loan\nproducts. These types of loans can help consumers and small businesses access credit for\nunexpected expenses.\nData from the most recent SHED report found that 10 percent of adults with family\nincomes less than $50,000 per year used payday, pawn, auto title, or tax refund anticipation loans\nto obtain needed funds.5 These types of products often carry high or even punitive direct and\nindirect costs and risks to the consumer. For example, non-repayment of an auto title loan can\nlead to vehicle repossession further complicating the consumer’s financial situation. When\nbanks offer small dollar loans, they can often do so on terms that are safer and at lower cost than\nother types of loans.6\n5 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “2023 Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking”\n(2024), https://www.federalreserve.gov/consumerscommunities/shed.htm. Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve, Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households in 2023 (Washinton: Board of Governors, May 2014),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/2023-report-economic-well-being-us-households-202405.pdf.\n6 Banks can look for guidance on small dollar loans through interagency statements related to alternative data and\nsmall dollar loans. See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Interagency Statement on the Use of\nAlternative Data in Credit Underwriting,” CA letter 19-11 (December 12, 2019),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/caletters/caltr1911.htm, and Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve, “Interagency Lending Principles for Making Responsible Small-Dollar Loans,” SR letter 20-14/CA letter\n20-8 (December 12, 2019), https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/srletters/SR2014.htm.\n\n- 5 -\nSome banks that offer small dollar loan products often use automated underwriting based\non alternative information that can include consumer-permissioned cash-flow data. If used\nappropriately, this approach can reduce bank underwriting costs, potentially making affordably\npriced loans available to consumers on a more timely basis. If these loans were more available\nin the banking system, they could serve as an alternative to more costly options from alternative\nfinancial services providers. Small dollar loans targeted to low- and moderate-income\nconsumers have the potential to provide an accessible and more fairly priced alternative when\nconsumers experience a financial emergency.\nRemittances and Financial Inclusion\nAs we heard from our panelists earlier today, payments inclusion can look different in\ndomestic and international contexts, but a reliable, safe, and cost-efficient payment system that\nminimizes unintended frictions is important to consumers around the world. International\nremittances can serve an important role in enhancing financial inclusion, especially in countries\nwhere these funds are a significant source of household financial support. And some research\nindicates that the ability to receive remittances increases the likelihood of bank account\nownership, which furthers economic engagement.7\nHowever, for those who send funds abroad using remittances, the costs can be\nsubstantial. For example, the average cost of sending $200 internationally from the U.S. is\nnearly 6 percent.8 In addition to broader work on cross-border payments, the G20 countries have\n7 Gemechu Ayana Aga and Maria Soledad Martinez Peria, “International Remittances and Financial Inclusion in\nSub-Saharan Africa,” Policy Research Working Paper 6991 (Washington: World Bank Group, Development\nResearch Group, July 2014), https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/19e5d9c1-cabd-5c54-\na4c2-fd2f12964b61/content.

This\ncould result in a greater proportion of funds reaching recipients.9 Continued improvements to\ndomestic and international payment systems and responsible innovation can further support our\nwork on financial inclusion.\nConclusion\nGreater inclusiveness in the financial system is an ongoing priority for the Federal\nReserve. While we have made great progress, there is more to be done for both the public and\nprivate sectors. We should be open to considering how new or innovative products and services\ncould promote financial inclusion. We should also be willing to engage with a wide range of\nstakeholders. Financial access and inclusion are not one-size-fits-all and can look very different\nto each consumer. Therefore, involving consumers and communities in identifying issues and\ncrafting solutions is critical to success. Advancing financial inclusion will clearly take many\nhands and a diverse set of stakeholders, including everyone participating here today.\n9 For more information on the G20 cross-border payments improvement roadmap and its progress, see Financial\nStability Board, Enhancing Cross-Border Payments: Stage 3 Roadmap (Financial Stability Board, October 2020),\nhttps://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P131020-1.pdf, and Financial Stability Board, G20 Roadmap for\nEnhancing Cross-Border Payments: Consolidated Progress Report for 2023 (Financial Stability Board, October\n2023), https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P091023-2.pdf.

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nFlorida Bankers Association Leadership Luncheon Events\nMiami, Florida\nJanuary 10, 2023\n\nThank you, Bill, and I’d also like to thank Alex Sanchez and the Florida Bankers\nAssociation for the invitation to be with you today. It is a pleasure to be here in person to\ndiscuss issues that are top of mind for all of us as we begin the new year. I will start with\nsome thoughts about the Federal Reserve’s ongoing effort to lower inflation, which\ncontinues to be much too high. I will then touch on other issues in the Fed’s purview,\nincluding bank supervision and regulation.1\nWhile the Fed has access to a staff of expert economists and a seemingly infinite\nflow of economic data to inform our decision-making, I often find that the most valuable\ndata comes directly from the experiences and perspectives of those who are engaged in\nand supporting the economy through the financial system. In my more than four years as\na member of the Board of Governors and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC),\nI have learned that there are few who understand the economy more directly than\nbankers, business owners and the customers you serve.\nMonetary Policy\nLet me begin by discussing the Fed’s efforts to lower inflation. Inflation is much\ntoo high, and I am focused on bringing it down toward our 2 percent goal. Inflation\naffects everyone, but it is especially harmful to lower- and middle-income Americans,\nwho spend a greater share of their income on necessities like food and housing. Stable\nprices are the bedrock of a healthy economy and are necessary to support a labor market\nthat works for all Americans.\nOver the past year, I have supported the FOMC’s policy actions to address high\ninflation, and I am committed to taking further actions to bring inflation back down to our\n1 These views are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\ngoal. Since last March, the FOMC has been tightening monetary policy through a\ncombination of increasing the federal funds rate by 4¼ percentage points and reducing\nour balance sheet holdings.\nIn recent months, we’ve seen a decline in some measures of inflation but we have\na lot more work to do, so I expect the FOMC will continue raising interest rates to tighten\nmonetary policy, as we stated after our December meeting.2 My views on the appropriate\nsize of future rate increases and on the ultimate level of the federal funds rate will\ncontinue to be guided by the incoming data and its implications for the outlook for\ninflation and economic activity.\nI will be looking for compelling signs that inflation has peaked and for more\nconsistent indications that inflation is on a downward path, in determining both the\nappropriate size of future rate increases and the level at which the federal funds rate is\nsufficiently restrictive. I expect that once we achieve a sufficiently restrictive federal\nfunds rate, it will need to remain at that level for some time in order to restore price\nstability, which will in turn help to create conditions that support a sustainably strong\nlabor market. Maintaining a steadfast commitment to restoring price stability is essential\nto support a sustainably strong labor market.\nTo this point, unemployment has remained low as we have tightened monetary\npolicy and made progress in lowering inflation. I take this as a hopeful sign that we can\nsucceed in lowering inflation without a significant economic downturn. It is likely that as\na part of this process, labor markets will soften somewhat before we bring inflation back\n2 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2022), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC\nStatement,” press release, December 14,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20221214a.htm.\n\n- 3 -\nto our 2 percent goal. While the effects of monetary policy tightening on the job market\nhave generally been limited so far, slowing the economy will likely mean that job\ncreation also slows. And if there are unforeseen shocks to the economy, growth may\nslow further. It’s important to keep in mind that there are costs and risks to tightening\npolicy to lower inflation, but I see the costs and risks of allowing inflation to persist as far\ngreater. These dynamics make the difficult decisions facing the FOMC even more\nchallenging, but it is absolutely necessary that the Committee achieves our goal of price\nstability.\nFrom the late 1960s through the mid-1980s, the U.S. economy experienced high\ninflation, high unemployment, and declining living standards. During that time,\npolicymakers prematurely eased monetary policy when the economy weakened, and\ninflation remained high. The FOMC was forced to return to tightening monetary policy,\ncausing a deep recession in 1981 and 1982. This is an important lesson that guides my\nthinking about monetary policy and my continued support for policy actions that will\ncontinue to lower inflation.\nIt is also important to remember that today’s inflation is a global concern. This is\nbecause some of the factors driving inflation in the United States are global, including the\ndisruption to goods production and trade during the pandemic, the shutdown and\nreopening of large economies, and the more recent disruption of food and energy supplies\ndue to conflicts abroad. Monetary policy can do very little to improve supply disruptions,\nbut it can help bring supply and demand into better alignment.\nWhile the path ahead looks uncertain, I am encouraged by three specific\ndevelopments. The first is the ongoing strength of the labor market, which was further\n\n- 4 -\nsupported with last Friday’s jobs report. So far, the job market has remained resilient\ndespite higher interest rates and slower growth. The second development is that the\nbalance sheets of households have remained strong, with low debt levels. Low debt and\nstrong balance sheets together with the strong labor market mean that consumers and\nbusinesses can continue to spend even as economic growth slows. The third point is the\nstrength of the U.S. banking system, with high levels of capital and liquidity, due in large\npart to the reforms adopted after the last financial crisis.\nI will turn now to the banking and payments issues on the Fed’s agenda, which\ninclude crypto and digital assets, innovation in payments, climate change and banking\nsupervision, and likely changes to the rules implementing the Community Reinvestment\nAct (CRA).\nCryptocurrency\nThe dysfunction in cryptocurrency markets has been well-documented, with some\ncrypto firms misrepresenting that they have deposit insurance, the collapse of certain\nstablecoins, and, most recently, the bankruptcy of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange.\nThese events have made it clear that cryptocurrency activities can pose significant risks\nto consumers, businesses, and potentially the larger financial system.\nWhile the traditional financial system has limited exposure to cryptocurrencies, I\nexpect that some banks will continue to explore how to engage in crypto-related\nactivities. The Fed and other banking agencies will continue to focus in this area, in light\nof the significant risks these activities may pose. But the bottom line is that we do not\nwant to hinder innovation. As regulators, we should support innovation and recognize\nthat the banking industry must evolve to meet consumer demand. By inhibiting\n\n- 5 -\ninnovation, we could be pushing growth in this space into the non-bank sector, leading to\nmuch less transparency and potential financial stability risk. We are thinking through\nsome of these issues and what a regulatory approach could look like.\nPayments\nThe Fed plays an important role in fostering the safety and efficiency of the U.S.\npayments, clearing, and settlement systems. There have been a number of interesting\ndevelopments on payments that continue to be top of mind for policymakers. One of\nthese is the push for real-time payments. Since 2019, the Fed has been working to launch\nFedNow, a new faster payments system that will be available in the first half of 2023.\nFedNow will help transform the way payments are made through new direct services that\nenable consumers and businesses to make payments conveniently, in real time, on any\nday, and with immediate availability of funds for receivers. FedNow will enable\ndepository institutions of every size, and in every community across America, to provide\nsafe and efficient instant payment services.\nWe have also been studying the concept of a central bank digital currency\n(CBDC). Several foreign governments and central banks are exploring digital currency,\nand there are many competing proposals suggesting a need to create a digital currency.\nThe common theme underlying the need in these proposals is the desire to increase the\nspeed and reduce the cost of financial transactions. Last January, the Fed published a\npaper soliciting comment on possible forms and uses of a CBDC in the United States.\nThe Fed continues to study the idea, although much of what supporters hope to achieve\nwith a central bank digital currency may be provided through FedNow and existing\n\n- 6 -\nprivate payment services. In any case, initiatives to make payments faster and more\nefficient will continue to be an area of focus.\nClimate Supervision\nClimate has also been a recent focus for Fed supervision, but our narrow interest\nin this area it is limited to the largest banks. Last fall, the Fed announced an exploratory\npilot study with six of the GSIBs that is narrowly focused on the goal of enhancing the\nability of supervisors and firms to measure and manage climate-related financial risks,\nnot credit allocation. The Fed has also published a climate guidance proposal for banks\nover $100 billion in assets. These climate efforts do not apply to smaller and community\nbanks. Smaller and community banks already integrate and comply with robust risk\nmanagement expectations. The Fed views its role on climate as a narrow focus on\nsupervisory responsibilities and limited to our role in promoting a safe, sound and stable\nfinancial system. While this climate supervision effort is a new area of focus, it has been\na longstanding supervisory requirement that banks manage their risks related to extreme\nweather events and other natural disasters that could disrupt operations or impact\nbusiness lines.\nCommunity Reinvestment Act\nThe last item on our regulatory agenda that I will note in my remarks today is the\nproposal to update the Community Reinvestment Act. The CRA requires the Fed and\nother banking agencies to encourage banks to help meet the credit needs of their\ncommunities, including low- and moderate-income communities. This rule was last\nupdated 25 years ago, and the banking industry has changed dramatically since the 1990s.\nThe proposal reflects these industry changes, including recognizing internet and mobile\n\n- 7 -\nbanking services, it also attempts to provide clarity and consistency, and it could enhance\naccess to credit for these low- and moderate-income communities. I am fully supportive\nof these efforts, but I also share the concern noted in public comments that have\nsuggested that some of the elements included in this overhaul of the CRA framework\nresult in significant new regulatory burden, particularly for the smallest and community\nbanks. As we continue this important rulemaking process, it will be critical for the Fed to\ncarefully weigh the costs and benefits of any changes before finalizing a proposal.\nI will stop there so we can move on to our conversation. Thank you again, for the\nopportunity to be with you today. I look forward to the discussion.",

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nMidwest Cyber Workshop\norganized by the Federal Reserve Banks of Chicago, Kansas City, and St. Louis\nFebruary 15, 2023\n\nIntroductory Remarks\nGood morning. It is a pleasure to join you, and I appreciate the invitation to speak\nto you virtually for this inaugural Midwest Cyber Workshop hosted by the Federal\nReserve Banks of Chicago, Kansas City, and St. Louis.1\nCyberattacks threaten businesses and consumers everywhere—none of us is\nbeyond the reach of those that initiate these attacks. Community banks have been the\ntarget of cyber and ransomware attacks, and they frequently name cybersecurity as one of\nthe top risks facing the banking industry. In my conversations with bankers, some note\nthe difficulty in attracting and retaining the staff needed to mitigate cyber risks. While\nthere are no easy solutions in the defense against cyberattacks, close coordination among\nall of the groups represented at this conference is a good first step.\nAs I consider the Federal Reserve’s role in supervising cybersecurity, it is\nimportant to identify where our engagement can be most effective to enhance the security\nof our regulated entities. Our efforts must be focused on both banks and their third-party\nservice providers.\nIn my remarks today, I will briefly discuss four topics. First are the implications\nof evolving technologies and their impacts on the cyber risk landscape. Second, I will\ndiscuss how customer demand for innovation and personalized products has increased\nreliance on third parties. Third, I will cover the recently effective computer security\nnotification rule, and how that rule can benefit regulators through notification of cyber\nincidents and banks in monitoring their third-party service providers. And finally, I will\nbriefly address some of the Federal Reserve’s recent actions related to cyber risk.\n1 The views expressed in these remarks are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of my colleagues\non the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n- 2 -\nEvolving Technologies and Their Associated Risks\nI’ll begin with technology and the risks presented by the implementation and\nintegration of new technologies. As the pace of technology innovations continue to\naccelerate, companies are engaging in business in new ways. New products and services\npresent new risks.\nSince the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen greater interest in customer\nadoption of digital banking products and utilization of remote work tools by bank\nemployees, both of which have created new opportunities for cyberattacks. Some of\nthese risks are best addressed directly by the bank with assistance from law enforcement,\nif necessary. Other risks may best be addressed by service providers.\nRansomware\nOne of these risks is from ransomware, which continues to be an prevalent threat\nto financial institutions. Reports of these kinds of attacks have increased significantly\nover the past five years, with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN)\nreporting more than 1,400 ransomware-related Bank Secrecy Act filings in 2021, worth\nnearly $1.2 billion. This represents a nearly 200 percent increase over 2020 and\ncoincides with elevated geopolitical risk. Moreover, the frequency of ransomware\nattacks has escalated due to the emergence of ransomware-as-a-service, enabling easier\ndeployment of these types of attacks. Although ransomware impacts financial\ninstitutions of all sizes, it disproportionately impacts smaller banks that may not have\nsufficient resources to protect against these attacks.2\n2 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Cybersecurity and Financial System Resilience\nReport (Washington: Board of Governors, July 2022),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/cybersecurity-report-202207.pdf.\n\n- 3 -\nRansomware is often delivered through phishing emails or through the\nunauthorized installation of malicious programs onto an organization’s systems, known\nas “drive-by-downloads.” These tactics take advantage of those with access to a bank’s\ninternal systems, whose actions, while perhaps well-intentioned, enable the ransomware\ncyberattack to occur. According to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security\nAgency, eight out of 10 organizations had at least one user fall for a phishing attempt,\nand one out of 10 phishing emails resulted in a user opening a malicious attachment or\naccessing a malicious internet link.3 Banks regularly perform exercises testing employee\nvulnerability to these kinds of targeted attacks. Banks should continue efforts to educate\nthose with systems access about these risks.\nRansomware attacks can be mitigated by bank management. By using a robust,\nformal risk assessment process, bank management can develop a comprehensive action\nplan to prevent a ransomware attack from occurring, or to reduce the impact on the bank\nshould such an attack occur. Banks that have planned ahead for a ransomware attack will\nbe better positioned to respond when an attack occurs.\nUse of Internal and External Applications\nSoftware and public-facing applications are also potential targets for exploitation,\nrequiring effective planning and implementation of patch management to address\nemerging and existing vulnerabilities. Hackers constantly seek opportunities to exploit\nsoftware holes and risks exist even with a bank’s best efforts to install the most up-to-\ndate security patches. For example, often when vulnerabilities are identified, providers\n3 See “Phishing,” Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency,\nhttps://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/phishing-infographic-508c.pdf.\n\n- 4 -\nhave not yet provided patches to address these issues, leaving the bank vulnerable to what\nis referred to as zero-day exploits. Supply chain attacks, like the SolarWinds incident,\noccur when a bad actor compromises software, or software updates, before the vendor\ncan provide it to customers for installation. While there are some mechanisms to mitigate\nthe risk of these attacks, defenses are limited because organizations rarely control their\nentire software supply chain.4\nThis is an example of a threat that a bank on its own may not be best equipped to\naddress. Therefore, regulators should carefully consider the appropriate entity for the\nfocus of regulatory attention.\nThird-Party Risk Management\nCustomer demand for innovative and personalized products and services has\nincreased community banks’ reliance on third-party relationships to enable them to\nprovide new technologies. These relationships position small banks to remain\ncompetitive and demonstrate their commitment to serving the needs of their customers\nand communities. At the same time, greater reliance on third parties could create\nadditional opportunity for cyber criminals. The federal banking agencies recognize the\nincreasing role third parties play in providing banks with a multitude of services\nincluding access to new technologies, human capital, delivery channels, products,\nservices, and markets. In July 2021, in recognition of this trend, together the Federal\nReserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency jointly released proposed interagency guidance for the risk\n4 See Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Risk Review (Washington: Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation, June 2022), https://www.fdic.gov/analysis/risk-review/2022-risk-review/2022-risk-review-\nfull.pdf.\n\n- 5 -\nmanagement of third-party relationships. Although each of these federal banking\nagencies had already published separate third-party risk management guidance, the intent\nof the additional proposed guidance is to create consistency across the regulatory\nagencies and to consider whether further risks should be considered, given the evolving\nnature of the industry.5 The banking agencies are currently in the process of considering\nthe comments received on that proposal.\nA bank’s use of third parties does not diminish its responsibility to oversee those\nactivities in a safe and sound manner and in compliance with applicable laws and\nregulations, including consumer laws. To assist banks in their oversight of third parties\nin implementing risk management programs, in 2021 the Federal Reserve began\nproviding state member banks with reports relevant to their third-party partners. These\nreports contain information that may provide helpful insight in assessing the performance\nof bank service providers, depending on the services used and the risk the services pose.\nAs a former banker, I see this as a valuable resource; having access to these supervisory\nreports helps to ensure that banks are receiving the information necessary to most\neffectively manage exposure to the risks posed by their service providers.\nIn August 2021, the agencies also released a guide for community banks titled\n“Conducting Due Diligence on Financial Technology Firms.” This guide was drawn\nfrom existing guidance, and, while voluntary, it is intended to be a helpful resource for\n5 See Proposed Interagency Guidance on Third-Party Relationships: Risk Management, 86 Fed. Reg. 38182\n(July 19, 2021).\n\n- 6 -\ncommunity banks when performing due diligence on prospective relationships with\nfintech companies.6\nThe third-party service provider landscape has continued to evolve and expand.\nAs a result, we should consider the appropriateness of shifting the regulatory burden from\ncommunity banks to more efficiently focus directly on service providers. The Bank\nService Company Act gives the federal banking agencies significant regulatory authority\nover outsourced banking services. In a world where third parties are providing far more\nof these services, it seems to me that these providers should bear more responsibility to\nensure the outsourced activities are performed in a safe and sound manner. The computer\nsecurity notification rule is one example that makes appropriate use of this authority.\nComputer Security Notification Rule\nGiven the escalating frequency and severity of cyberattacks, the agencies\npublished a final rule in late 2021 establishing computer-security incident notification\nrequirements for banks and, importantly, also for their service providers. The rule\nrequires a bank to notify its primary federal regulator as soon as possible but no later than\n36 hours after the bank determines that an incident requiring notification has occurred.\nAn incident requiring notification is defined as a computer-security incident that disrupts\nor degrades, or is reasonably likely to disrupt or degrade, the viability of the banking\norganization’s operations, resulting in customers being unable to access their deposits and\nother accounts, or impacting the stability of the financial sector.\n6 See “SR 21-15 / CA 21-11: Guide for Community Banking Organizations Conducting Due Diligence on\nFinancial Technology Companies,” Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, last modified\nSeptember 15, 2021, https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/srletters/sr2115.htm.\n\n- 7 -\nIn addition, this rule requires a bank service provider to notify a bank-designated\npoint of contact at each affected customer bank. The notification must occur as soon as\npossible after the service provider determines that a computer-security incident has\noccurred that materially disrupted or degraded, or is reasonably likely to disrupt or\ndegrade, covered services provided to the bank for four or more hours. Since community\nbanks are largely reliant on bank service providers, the notification requirement is meant\nto assist in the process of a bank’s assessment of the severity of the incident, including\nthe breadth and depth of impact and the necessity to implement internal response\nprotocols. This rule is also a good example of efficient regulation, since bank service\nproviders are often best positioned to identify computer-security incidents.\nSince May 2022, banks and bank service providers have been required to comply\nwith the computer-security incident notification rule. The Federal Reserve continues to\nexpect banks to report breaches of sensitive customer information consistent with\napplicable law.7 The new service provider reporting requirement together with the Fed’s\nefforts to improve access to service provider reports should help to streamline small\nbanks’ efforts to monitor their technology service providers.\nThe Federal Reserve System Focus on Cyber Risk\nThe financial system is deeply interconnected. As a result, the Federal Reserve\ncoordinates with industry and a number of domestic and international agencies,\ngovernance bodies, and state and federal regulators to share information and best\npractices to prevent, detect, and recover from cyberattacks. These efforts enable the\n7 See Computer-Security Incident Notification Requirements for Banking Organizations and\nTheir Bank Service Providers, 86 Fed. Reg. 66424 (effective April 1, 2022).\n\n- 8 -\nFederal Reserve to work closely with other regulatory agencies to issue consistent\nguidance and updated examination procedures on critical areas including IT risk\nmanagement and cybersecurity.\nOf course, a critical element of the Fed’s focus on cybersecurity risk is the\nexpectation that a bank will continue to develop internal expertise and build upon that\nexpertise over time. Similarly, the Federal Reserve is committed to ensuring that our\nsupervision is well positioned with appropriate staffing, training, and resources to\nunderstand and effectively examine cyber risk. We recognize that expertise in this area is\ncritical for our success as well, and the Reserve Banks have been actively recruiting\nseasoned cybersecurity and IT specialists, while also working to develop in-house\nexpertise.\nExaminer training is frequently updated to align with current and emerging\nthreats, and the Federal Reserve actively prepares examiners when new cyber risk\nmanagement guidance is released. IT examiners also get industry perspective through\nparticipating in external conferences and training events from cybersecurity experts and\norganizations. In short, the Federal Reserve is committed to ensuring that examiners are\nwell-positioned to supervise the efforts of state member banks and bank holding\ncompanies to address cyber-risks, and to provide more effective outreach and\ncommunication.8 Today’s workshop is just one of the many ways we engage with banks\non cyber-related issues.\nBecause cyber threats evolve quickly, cybersecurity must be equally dynamic in\nits response. Banks must continuously refine their risk management processes. We\n8 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Cybersecurity and Financial System.\n\n- 9 -\nrecognize the importance of regular communication and outreach through events like this\none today. While we expect banks to be in touch with us when an event happens, cyber\nevents should not be the first time a cyber-risk conversation occurs between a bank and\nits regulator. We look forward to working with you to assist in clarifying expectations,\napplying regulatory guidance or seeking feedback on cyber-risk management strategies.\nWe encourage bank management teams to engage with regulatory points of contact\nwhenever questions arise on cyber security matters just as with any other regulatory\nmatter.\nClosing Remarks\nIn closing, the pace of technological change continues to accelerate. We\nrecognize that banks need to adopt new technologies to meet customer demands, to take\nadvantage of efficiencies and cost savings, and to remain competitive in the marketplace.\nAlthough third-party relationships are one avenue for community banks to bring new\ntechnologies online, they must do so with a thorough understanding of the associated\nrisks.\nThe Federal Reserve is committed to working together with the other regulators to\ncontinue providing guidance and resources, like this workshop, to ensure that banks are\nappropriately managing cyber risk.\nThank you again for the invitation be with you today. I hope this workshop\ndemonstrates the value of open communication between bankers, regulators, industry,\nand law enforcement so that we may continue to work together in building resilience in\nthe financial system to ever-evolving cyber risks.",

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe 2019 Interagency Minority Depository Institution and CDFI Bank Conference\nArlington, Virginia\nJune 25, 2019\n\nThank you, Makada. Good morning and let me also welcome everyone to the\nSeidman Center. I am very pleased to join you today for this discussion, which\nhighlights the important role that minority depository institutions (MDIs) and Community\nDevelopment Financial Institutions (CDFIs) play in their communities. It is your\npresence in these communities and the services you offer that support local businesses,\njobs, and economic growth.\nI know this because before joining the Federal Reserve, I was a community\nbanker in a small rural town and more recently served as Kansas’ State Bank\nCommissioner. I understand what it means to try to meet the financial needs of a\ncommunity, whose needs are varied and can present unique challenges to a credit\nunderwriter. I remember working with a customer on a mortgage loan for less than\n$20,000 with a first-time homebuyer’s credit to purchase a mobile home. It was one of\nthe most complicated and time consuming loans that I made during my time as a banker.\nSome larger banks might not be able or even be interested in putting that together, but\ncommunity bankers know how important this kind of service is to their lower-income\ncustomers. I’m proud to bring that perspective to the Federal Reserve Board as the first\ngovernor to fill the role designated for someone with community banking experience.\nOne way to fulfill my responsibilities is by meeting with and listening closely to\nminority and community bankers, consumers, small business owners, and local leaders—\n\n- 2 -\nall of the stakeholders with an interest in their communities. MDIs and their staff play a\nkey role, and I will use the knowledge we gain from these interactions to improve our\nwork at the Federal Reserve.\nWe aim to help MDIs in three ways: by finding ways to ease your regulatory\nburden, by sponsoring valuable and actionable research on your contributions to your\ncommunities, and by seeking to better support you through outreach and hands-on\ntechnical assistance.\nTo achieve these goals, the Fed has developed an extensive outreach program, the\nPartnership for Progress (PFP). The PFP helps MDIs confront business model\nchallenges, cultivate safe banking practices, and compete more effectively in the\nmarketplace—all topics that I expect will be addressed today.\nRegulatory Burden\nOne of the most important ways to help MDIs is by reducing regulatory burden.\nWe are acting to implement provisions of a new law, S-2155, and reviewing comments\non several proposals made in 2018 to ensure they do not unduly burden community\nbanks. Our community bank leverage ratio proposal would allow qualifying banks to opt\nout of a more complicated risk-based capital framework. Other proposals include raising\nto $400,000 the threshold for when an appraisal is required for a residential real estate\ntransaction and narrowing the Volcker rule to banks engaged in riskier activities. We\n\n- 3 -\nraised the threshold from $1 billion to $3 billion in assets for banks that could qualify for\nan 18-month examination cycle. Further, we raised the asset threshold to $3 billion for\nthe Small Bank Holding Company and Savings and Loan Holding Company Policy\nStatement. This change, which exempts small holding companies from consolidated risk-\nbased capital rules, fosters local ownership of small banks by allowing more banking\ncompanies with limited access to capital markets to use debt in bank acquisitions.\nWith respect to supervision, the Federal Reserve continues to tailor and reduce\nburden by conducting portions of examinations offsite for community banks that prefer\nthat option. The Bank Exams Tailored to Risk (BETR) program identifies low-risk or,\nconversely, high-risk activities within state member banks and appropriately streamlines\nor expands examination work programs commensurate with the identified risk. This\nminimizes the burden for banks that are well managed and directs supervisory resources\nto higher-risk activities where they are most needed.\nRelated to regulatory burden is an important initiative, in concert with the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation, to identify healthy minority banking organizations\ncapable of acquiring or merging with MDIs in troubled condition. Our PFP team has\nassisted with the process for establishing new MDIs and worked with MDIs to identify\nadvantageous federally sponsored programs with which to collaborate. I note that\ntoday’s agenda includes a session on this topic.\n\n- 4 -\nResearch\nThe Board and Reserve Banks also conduct valuable research on the impact of\nMDIs on underserved households and communities. Last November, we held a webinar,\nwhich I hope some of you were able to participate in, on recent research on MDIs. All of\nour MDI research is available on the Partnership for Progress website. The PFP\ncontinues to seek to sponsor high-quality research to enhance our understanding of the\nMDI business model and how MDIs serve their communities. We welcome your input\non research topics you find interesting and helpful.\nTech Assistance/Outreach\nThrough this biennial conference and several PFP conferences and outreach\nevents each year, the Federal Reserve facilitates networking among MDI institutions.\nDistrict coordinators from each Federal Reserve Bank will serve on local exam teams\nduring examinations, and collect feedback from MDIs on how the PFP can provide\nadditional assistance. District coordinators meet regularly with MDI management to\ndiscuss emerging issues and provide technical assistance, especially to those in troubled\ncondition, to explain supervisory guidance, discuss challenges, and respond to\nmanagement concerns and inquiries. High-interest items include the Community\nReinvestment Act, IT and cybersecurity, concentrations in commercial real estate,\n\n- 5 -\ninterest-rate risk, capital planning and rules, anti-money-laundering compliance, and\nthird-party vendor management. We want to help MDIs navigate supervisory and\nregulatory requirements. To do that well, we want to continue to develop an open\ndialogue so we can better understand the challenges you face and how we can best help\nyou wherever we have the ability to do so.\nPersonal contact and relationship building are important to community banking\nand, I believe, also to community bank oversight. We want, and need, to hear your\nquestions and concerns. Last April, we invited the leaders of all Fed-supervised MDIs to\na Leaders Forum so we could spend a day and a half building relationships and talking\nabout the needs of MDIs. We also encourage staff to reach out to MDIs and ensure that\nyou are aware of our outreach meetings and research. Let’s keep this communication\ngoing. We engage is these efforts because your institutions are vital to your communities\nand to the American economy. On behalf of the Federal Reserve, I’d like to once again\nthank you for the work you do in your communities and welcome you to this year’s\nconference.",

Bowman\nVice Chair for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nForecasters Club of New York Luncheon\nNew York, New York\nSeptember 26, 2025\n\nGood afternoon. Thank you for the invitation to speak to you. I am delighted to\nhave the opportunity to address this distinguished group of macroeconomic forecasters.\nToday I will discuss how I approach monetary policy decisionmaking, and I will then\ndescribe some of the challenges we will likely face in the years ahead.1\nBefore turning to the main topic of my remarks, I would like to provide some\ncontext about my background and how that shapes my approach to my role as a\npolicymaker. After serving for nearly seven years on the Board of Governors, earlier this\nyear, the President appointed me as the Federal Reserve’s Vice Chair for Supervision.\nMy role as a financial regulator and my previous experience as a state bank regulator and\ncommunity banker in Kansas give me a unique perspective on how to approach my\nresponsibilities as a monetary policymaker. This experience informs how I think about\neconomic conditions and the balance of risks to economic activity, the labor market, and\ninflation in assessing the appropriate stance and direction of policy.\nAs you know, the Federal Reserve conducts monetary policy to support a strong\nand stable economy that works for all Americans. In doing so, the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC) conducts its responsibilities according to the congressionally\nmandated goals of maximum employment and price stability. The Fed pursues these\ngoals by adjusting its monetary policy stance using a variety of tools, including setting\ninterest rates, providing forward guidance about the expected future path of policy, and\nadjusting the size and composition of our balance sheet. Our primary monetary policy\ntool is the federal funds rate, a key interest rate for overnight borrowing by commercial\nbanks that influences other interest rates throughout financial markets. Lower interest\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nrates tend to stimulate demand—for housing, cars and other durable goods, and for\nbusiness investment—which boosts economic activity and has the potential to push up\ninflation. Higher interest rates tend to slow the economy and tend to push inflation down.\nAchieving both of these goals is challenging when they are in tension. Policy\nactions to tame inflation, like raising the target range for the federal funds rate, can have\nan adverse effect on employment. By contrast, policy actions aimed at supporting\nemployment that is below its maximum level can potentially increase risks to price\nstability. These are just a few of the challenges we face as policymakers. With that\nbackground, I will share more on my approach to our monetary policy responsibilities\nand the use of our existing toolkit. I consider my approach in terms of flexibility in\nshifting the focus on policy objectives when needed and a limited footprint in financial\nmarkets.\nA Flexible Approach to Policymaking\nPursuing the objectives of the dual mandate at the same time means that we\ngenerally seek to achieve the maximum level of employment that is consistent with price\nstability. But the monetary policy objectives are not always complementary. Because\nour dual mandate places equal weight on both maximum employment and price stability,\nwhen these objectives are in tension it is important not to favor one side of the mandate\nover the other. In that circumstance, we should be flexible and direct our focus to the\nside of the mandate that deviates the most from its goal or that shows the greater risk of\npersistently departing from it. Hesitating to address existing or emerging departures from\nthe dual-mandate goals, due to self-limitations stemming from an unwillingness to depart\n\n- 3 -\nfrom outdated past policy communication, increases the likelihood that policymakers will\nneed to implement abrupt and large policy corrections.\nAs we all remember in 2021, supply and demand imbalances, amplified by\nextraordinary stimulus from fiscal and monetary policies, led to a sharp rise in inflation\nover just a few months. By the second half of that year, amid growing inflationary\npressures, it became clear that our monetary policy stance was too accommodative and\nthat the FOMC needed to move toward a tighter policy stance. On a 12-month basis,\ntotal consumer price index (CPI) inflation rose from about 1-1/2 percent in early 2021 to\nabout 9 percent in mid-2022. We began increasing the policy rate at the March 2022\nFOMC meeting, when reported CPI inflation was already at about 8 percent and core\npersonal consumption expenditures inflation was above 5 percent.\nIn my view, the accommodative forward guidance the Committee adopted in the\nSeptember and the December 2020 postmeeting statements, which put more weight on\nthe employment side of our mandate, pushed the mandated goals out of balance and\ncontributed to the delay in the removal of monetary policy accommodation in 2021.2\nThat forward guidance made it much more difficult for the FOMC to react to new\ninformation suggesting that risks and uncertainties had evolved in response to pandemic-\nrelated changes in the economy. This ultimately restricted our ability to respond to rising\ninflationary pressures before seeing any progress on the labor market. Ultimately,\n2 See Michelle W. Bowman (2023), “Reflections on the Economy and Monetary Policy,” remarks delivered\nat the Utah Bankers Association and Salt Lake City Chamber Banker and Business Leader Breakfast, Salt\nLake City, Utah, November 28,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20231128a.pdf; and Michelle W.\nBowman (2024), “Risks and Uncertainty in Monetary Policy: Current and Past Considerations,” remarks\ndelivered at “Frameworks for Monetary Policy, Regulation, and Bank Capital,” Spring 2024 Meeting of the\nShadow Open Market Committee, hosted by the Manhattan Institute, New York, April 5,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20240405a.pdf.\n\n- 4 -\ndelaying taking appropriate action while inflation started to increase left us in a position\nin which we needed to course correct and catch up by raising the policy rate in large\nincrements over a number of months.\nRecognizing the substantial risk that unacceptably high inflation could persist,\nand once the conditions in the labor market were moving toward the FOMC’s goal of\nmaximum employment, by the end of 2021 I shifted my focus to the inflation side of our\nmandate and to bringing inflation down toward our 2 percent goal. At the time, I argued\nin favor of taking prompt and forceful policy action to get inflation under control, which I\nsaw as our primary responsibility at that time, as it had begun to impose a heavy burden\non households and businesses. Of course, tightening policy and then maintaining a\nrestrictive stance to lower inflation could have resulted in costs and risks to the labor\nmarket, but I saw far greater costs and risks in allowing inflation to persist. And,\nimportantly, maintaining the commitment to restoring price stability is the best course to\nsustain a strong labor market and an economy that works for everyone.\nAs I noted in recent remarks, we are now facing a very different economic\nenvironment.3 Over the past several months, I have been pointing to a shift in economic\nconditions and in the balance of risks to our employment and inflation goals, calling\nattention to signs of potential labor market fragility. And I have argued that increasing\n3 See Michelle W. Bowman (2025), “Unintended Policy Shifts and Unexpected Consequences,” remarks\ndelivered at “Assessing the Effectiveness of Monetary Policy during and after the COVID-19 Pandemic,” a\nresearch conference sponsored by the International Journal of Central Banking and the Czech National\nBank, Prague, Czech Republic, June 23,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20250623a.pdf; Michelle W. Bowman\n(2025), “Thoughts on the Economy and Community Bank Capital,” remarks delivered at the Kansas\nBankers Association 2025 CEO & Senior Management Summit, Colorado Springs, Colorado, August 9,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20250809a.pdf; and Michelle W.\nBowman (2025), “Views on the Economy and Monetary Policy,” remarks delivered at the Kentucky\nBankers Association Annual Convention, Asheville, North Carolina, September 23,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20250923a.pdf.\n\n- 5 -\nsigns of weakening labor market conditions provide a basis for proactively supporting the\nemployment side of our mandate.\nRecent data show a materially more fragile labor market along with inflation that,\nexcluding tariffs, has continued to hover not far above our target. Given this shift in\nlabor market conditions, at last week’s FOMC meeting I supported beginning the process\nof removing policy restraint and bringing the federal funds rate back to its neutral level.\nUp until the July FOMC meeting, even with inflation within range of our target,\nthe Committee has focused primarily on the inflation side of the dual mandate. Now that\nwe have seen many months of deteriorating labor market conditions, it is time for the\nCommittee to act decisively and proactively to address decreasing labor market\ndynamism and emerging signs of fragility. In my view, the recent data, including the\nestimated payroll employment benchmark revisions, show that we are at serious risk of\nalready being behind the curve in addressing deteriorating labor market conditions.\nShould these conditions continue, I am concerned that we will need to adjust policy at a\nfaster pace and to a larger degree going forward.\nI recognize and appreciate concerns that we have not yet perfectly achieved our\ninflation goal. But under a flexible approach to policymaking, it is appropriate to focus\non the side of the mandate that is showing signs of deterioration or fragility even though\ninflation is above but within range of our target. This shift is appropriate now because\nforecasters widely expect inflation to significantly decline next year, and as further\ndeterioration in labor market conditions would likely lead to more persistent damage to\nthe employment side of the mandate, that would be difficult to address with our tools.\n\n- 6 -\nWith tariff-related price increases likely being a one-time effect, my view is that\ninflation will return to 2 percent after these effects dissipate. Because changes in\nmonetary policy take time to work their way through the economy, it is appropriate to\nlook through temporarily elevated inflation readings and therefore remove some policy\nrestraint to avoid weakening in the labor market, provided that long-run inflation\nexpectations remain well anchored.\nIn addition, putting tariffs aside, the U.S. economy may also be experiencing an\nextended productivity surge, in large part because of recent technological advances. And\nproductivity growth has likely been higher than reported due to the downward benchmark\nrevisions to payroll gains. These developments reinforce the case for removing policy\nrestraint because monetary policy should accommodate productivity shocks that raise\npotential output.\nIn light of all these considerations, in my view, it was appropriate to begin the\nprocess of moving policy toward a more neutral stance at last week’s FOMC meeting,\nand it has been appropriate to do so for several months. Moreover, the rising downside\nrisks to employment and the potential for greater damage to the labor market underscore\nthe need to shift our focus away from overemphasizing the latest data points.\nIn the past, I have supported data dependence as an approach that incorporates\nincoming data into the decisions that lie immediately ahead and further into the future.\nOur experience during and following the pandemic highlights the difficulty in assessing\nthe current state of the economy and predicting how it will evolve in the presence of\nmajor supply- and demand-side shocks, possible structural changes in the economy, and\nreal-time data and measurement uncertainty. With unusually high uncertainty around the\n\n- 7 -\nstate of the economy and the economic outlook, and with significant risks to our\nemployment and price stability goals, judging where the economy is headed in the future\nis much more challenging. Therefore, it made sense in the past to consider and be\ninformed by the incoming data and its implications for the outlook in assessing the\nappropriate path for monetary policy.\nBut today we are facing different conditions. I am concerned that the labor\nmarket could enter into a precarious phase, and there is a risk that a shock could tip it into\na sudden and significant deterioration. An inflexible and dogmatic view of data\ndependence gives an inherently backward-looking view of the economy and would\nguarantee that we remain behind the curve, requiring us to catch up in the future.\nI think we should consider shifting our focus from overweighting the latest data\npoints to a proactive forward-looking approach and making a forecast that reflects how\nthe economy is likely to evolve going forward. Because policy actions take time to flow\nthrough to, or have their full effect on, the economy, labor markets, and inflation, it is\nimportant that we are making predictions about where the economy is headed and to act\non those forecasts in real time. A forward-looking approach ensures that monetary policy\ncan help support the economy. It also better positions us to avoid falling behind the\ncurve and then having to implement abrupt and dramatic policy actions. In my view, it is\nmore effective to act promptly and decisively in the face of fragility than to be forced to\ndramatically adjust policy after damage has occurred.\nA Limited Footprint – the Fed’s Balance Sheet\nI will turn now to discuss my views about how we use our balance sheet. As the\nrunoff in our securities portfolio proceeds following extensive asset purchases during the\n\n- 8 -\npandemic, there are several issues with important implications regarding the size and the\ncomposition of the Fed’s balance sheet in the longer run.\nOver the longer run, my preference is to maintain the smallest balance sheet\npossible with reserve balances at a level closer to scarce than ample. First, a smaller\nbalance sheet would minimize the Fed’s footprint in money markets and in Treasury\nmarkets. Of course, in order to efficiently implement monetary policy, it is necessary to\nhave some footprint in these markets. Second, holding less-than-ample reserves would\nreturn us to a place where we are actively managing our balance sheet, identifying instead\nof masking signals of market stress. In my view, actively managing our balance sheet\nwould give a more timely indication of stress and market functioning issues, as allowing\na modest amount of volatility in money markets can enhance our understanding of market\nclearing points.\nLower levels of reserves may also incentivize banks to engage in more active\nmanagement of their liquidity positions and liquidity risks. Finally, a lower terminal\nlevel of reserves and a smaller balance sheet as a percentage of gross domestic product\n(GDP) would provide the FOMC with the optionality to respond to future shocks or\neconomic downturns without worrying whether there is enough room to expand the\nbalance sheet as a potential tool.\nIn terms of the composition of the Fed’s securities holdings in the longer run, I\nstrongly support having a System Open Market Account portfolio that consists only of\nTreasury securities to minimize the effects of the Federal Reserve’s holdings on the\nallocation of credit across the economy. Holding agency mortgage-backed securities\n(MBS), or other non-Treasury securities, could be seen as selective credit allocation.\n\n- 9 -\nI also look forward to revisiting the Committee’s consideration of potential sales\nof our agency MBS holdings. Simply relying on MBS runoff will not allow returning to\na Treasury-only portfolio within a credible time frame.\nThe longer-run maturity structure of the Federal Reserve’s Treasury securities\nholdings is also an important consideration. One benefit of a Treasury portfolio maturity\nstructure that mirrors the broader Treasury market is that the Fed’s holdings would be\n“neutral.” This means that these holdings would not disproportionately affect the pricing\nof any given maturity of Treasury security or provide incentives for the issuance of any\ngiven type of Treasury security. A balance sheet tilted slightly toward shorter-dated\nTreasury securities would allow a more flexible approach.\nFor example, the FOMC could reduce its shorter-dated Treasury securities\nholdings in favor of longer-dated Treasury securities if the Committee wanted to use the\nbalance sheet to provide monetary policy accommodation without expanding the size of\nits securities holdings. This approach would be similar to the FOMC’s maturity\nextension program in 2011 and 2012, sometimes referred to as “Operation Twist.” It will\nbe important to consider the potential costs and benefits to the Federal Reserve’s\nTreasury securities maturity structure and the best ways to achieve the desired maturity\nstructure over time.\nThe Nature and Use of Emergency Tools\nI will turn now to the role for and the availability of policy tools like lending\nprograms and facilities. During periods of extreme financial system stress, the Federal\nReserve has the authority, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, to use tools,\nincluding lending facilities, to directly support the effective functioning of key financial\n\n- 10 -\nmarkets and the flow of credit throughout the economy. During the pandemic, the Board\nextensively relied on the creation of lending programs that were designed to serve as\nbackstops to support market functioning and the flow of credit during times of stress.\nThe temporary nature of these types of lending facilities that are activated only during\ntimes of severe financial market stress makes them an attractive alternative to other tools.\nLending programs are most effective as backstops when loans are offered at a penalty\nrate and are of short duration. When appropriately calibrated, they can help promote\nmarket functioning and the effective transmission of monetary policy but also limit the\nFederal Reserve’s overall footprint in financial markets in the longer term.\nDespite their demonstrated effectiveness during times of financial market\ndysfunction, my view is that emergency lending facilities should be reserved for the\nsingle-purpose use in emergency circumstances and should not be institutionalized. In\nother words, they should not be converted to permanent standing facilities. Instead, they\nshould be activated for only the most exceptionally stressed circumstances.\nInstitutionalizing an activity that was created to temporarily respond to emergency\nconditions essentially normalizes an extreme emergency response to market illiquidity.\nI am concerned that converting emergency facilities created in the depths of a\ncrisis into permanent standing facilities would potentially increase the Fed’s footprint in\nfinancial markets and have adverse implications, such as distorting private-sector market\ndynamics and market pricing during normal, noncrisis times. My preference is to rely on\nthese types of facilities only on an emergency basis to address exceptional circumstances.\nThis approach ensures that potential counterparties transact in the private market during\ntimes of normal or even mildly stressed market conditions.\n\n- 11 -\nA better option would be to announce the short duration of a facility at the time it\nis created and be clear that it will only exist while the conditions prevail. During the\npandemic, we demonstrated the ability to bring these facilities online quickly, so\ncommunication reiterating that we stand ready to do it again, even if only on a “just in\ntime” basis, may, on its own, have a beneficial effect on market dynamics.\nI will conclude this part of my discussion by highlighting a current regulatory\nproposal that would return the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio (eSLR) to a\nbackstop rather than a binding constraint for bank-affiliated broker-dealers.\nTreasury Market Intermediation\nEven though the U.S. financial system is strong and resilient, over time there have\nbeen periods of market stress and volatility in Treasury market intermediation. And there\nare strong indications that leverage capital requirements may be contributing to\nvulnerabilities in the Treasury market, particularly in the face of unusually high trading\nvolumes.\nIn late June, the Board, along with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and\nthe Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, approved a proposal to modify the eSLR,\nwhich applies to the U.S. global systemically important banks (G-SIBs). Although\nleverage ratios are intended to serve as a capital “backstop” to risk-based measures, the\neSLR has become increasingly binding over time. This bindingness has been\nsubstantially driven by economic growth, inflation, and the level of reserves in the\nsystem. When leverage requirements become a firm’s binding capital constraint, they\ncan disincentivize low-risk, low-margin activities. Broker-dealer affiliates of the G-SIBs\nare significant participants in Treasury market intermediation, and the effect of a more\n\n- 12 -\nbinding eSLR has been to diminish the market intermediation capacity of these\nintermediaries. This was never the intent of the eSLR. The eSLR proposal would help\nreturn this leverage requirement to a more appropriate role as a capital backstop. This\nimportant, proactive step would also preserve the role of the eSLR in promoting safety,\nsoundness, and financial stability, and that, as proposed, is also fully consistent with our\ninternational agreements.\nIn addition, once the GENIUS Act is implemented, stablecoin issuers are required\nto hold reserves equivalent to the value of stablecoin issuance, which can include U.S.\nTreasuries.4 This additional demand could compound future episodes of Treasury market\nliquidity stress, increasing the importance of eSLR reform to ensure Treasury market\nfunctioning. Once finalized, the eSLR proposal would provide additional balance sheet\ncapacity for G-SIBs to intermediate U.S. Treasury market activities. This change will\nhelp build market resilience and reduce the likelihood both of market dysfunction and of\nthe need for the Fed to intervene, by implementing temporary modifications to the eSLR.\nReforming the eSLR would also directly address some of the problems that a\npermanent Federal Reserve facility like the standing repo facility (SRF) is intended to\nalleviate—for example, mitigating temporary repurchase agreement (repo) rate spikes at\nmonth-, quarter-, and year-ends caused by large banks being unwilling to provide a\nsufficient supply of Treasury market liquidity. In my view, adjusting leverage capital\nrequirements could help refocus the role of the SRF as a liquidity backstop for Treasury\nmarket intermediation, rather than normalizing its use and enabling rate arbitrage to drive\nusage in periods of calm.\n4 The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act was enacted on July 18, 2025.\n\n- 13 -\nAlthough at the July 2021 FOMC meeting I voted to convert ongoing open\nmarket operations into a permanent facility, I did so with significant reservations because,\nas I noted earlier, my preference would be to not institutionalize operations that addressed\ntemporary market emergencies. At that time, I stated that we should have remained\nattentive to the unintended consequences of an SRF and be prepared to adjust its\nparameters as needed to address those effects.\nIn its current form, the SRF has a minimum bid rate set equal to the discount\nwindow primary credit rate, which is also equal to the top of the target range for the\nfederal funds rate. As a result, the SRF, by design, is not fully positioned to serve only as\na backstop during times of market dysfunction and stress. My preference would be for a\nminimum bid rate higher than the top of the federal funds rate target range in order to\nemphasize that the SRF’s purpose is to serve only as a backstop. A rate above the top of\nthe target range would be more likely to discourage use of the facility outside of\nexceptional market-wide episodes of acute stress. It seems likely that a rate that’s not set\nat a sufficiently high level might still be considered an option for primary dealers\nexperiencing idiosyncratic pressures outside of market-wide disruption. In my view,\nproviding an outlet for dealers that experience these kinds of pressures should not be the\nintended purpose of this facility.\nWhile creating a “release valve” to provide greater market liquidity has been a\ngoal of the SRF, I remain concerned that one of its unintended consequences is to distort\nmarket signals by artificially affecting repo rate dynamics. It is not the Fed’s role to\nreplace or arbitrage private-market activities.\n\n- 14 -\nHaving a minimum bid rate on the SRF that is not sufficiently elevated relative to\nmarket rates risks suppressing or distorting valuable signals stemming from overnight\nmoney markets. While balance sheet runoff is entering a new phase, it is especially\nimportant to be able to observe underlying reserve and money market conditions.\nChallenges for Monetary Policy Ahead\nThroughout my tenure at the Federal Reserve Board, the U.S. economy has\nexperienced many challenging times, including below-target inflation and low\nunemployment; the effects of the COVID-19 experience, with high unemployment,\nstrong demand enabled by fiscal support, supply chain disruptions, and high inflation;\nseveral bank failures; extraordinary immigration; and last year’s recalibration of our\nmonetary policy stance. The problems we face are often different and require agility in\nour understanding of how the economy works and is likely to evolve.\nI will turn now to briefly discuss some challenges for monetary policy in the years\nahead, including the potential for supply shocks, the transmission of monetary policy to\nlong-term interest rates, the housing market, the artificial intelligence (AI) investment\nboom, and the ways that I see some of these factors affecting the neutral rate of interest.\nSupply Shocks\nSupply shocks, which move economic activity and inflation in opposite\ndirections, can be challenging for monetary policy to address because they can put the\npursuit of the dual-mandate goals in conflict.5 The development of new technologies that\nraise productivity is an example of a positive supply shock that increases potential output,\n5 See Hess Chung, Callum Jones, Antoine Lepetit, and Fernando M. Martin (2025), “Implications of\nInflation Dynamics for Monetary Policy Strategies,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2025-072\n(Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, August),\nhttps://doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2025.072.\n\n- 15 -\nwhile supply chain disruptions are an example of a negative supply shock. To properly\naddress these shocks, for situations in which the policy objectives are in tension, as\nimplied by the FOMC’s revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy\nStrategy, we need to consider how large and persistent the deviations implied by the\nshock to the price-stability and maximum-employment mandates will likely be.6\nImportantly, supply shocks can also affect demand, and so we need to assess how the\nrelative effects on supply and demand are likely to evolve.\nTariffs can be seen as a negative shock to the supply of imported goods but can\nalso be viewed as a surcharge on demand for imported goods. Like any surcharge on\nsales, the effects on inflation are likely short lived, as reduced demand increases slack in\nthe economy and restrains any follow-on price increases, assuming that inflation\nexpectations remain anchored. Therefore, it makes sense for monetary policy to mostly\nlook through the one-off effect on prices and put more weight on the likely more\npersistent effects on demand and employment.\nA step-down in population growth is also a negative supply shock, as it slows the\nincrease in the labor force and output. This development would also represent a negative\nshock to demand, with the two effects roughly balancing out over time. However, the\nsource of the shock, whether due to lower immigration or the aging of the population,\nseems relevant. While aging of the population is a gradual process that is less likely to\ngenerate sudden deviations in either of our mandates, a shock to immigration can have\nsharper effects on demand in the near term, as supply is likely to adjust more slowly—for\nexample, housing.\n6 The FOMC’s revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy is available on the\nBoard’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals.pdf.\n\n- 16 -\nTerm Premiums\nA second challenge for monetary policy would be a significant rise in longer-term\ninterest rates driven by higher term premiums, which could offset a reduction in the\nexpectations component stemming from monetary policy easing. This scenario would\nweaken the transmission of changes in the policy rate to economic activity, as investment\ndecisions of households and businesses are dependent on longer-term rates, such as\nmortgage rates and corporate bond yields. Although term premiums increased when the\nFOMC recalibrated the policy stance toward the end of last year, they have come down\nsignificantly so far this year, allowing for a reduction in longer-term interest rates.\nA further rise in the term premium could reflect higher compensation for expected\ninflation and increased risks that monetary policy may need to address future shocks to\nreal activity or inflation. Some of the factors that could lead to higher term premiums\nwould be concerns about fiscal sustainability and the FOMC’s credibility to achieve its\ninflation goal.\nHousing Market\nA third challenge for monetary policy would be a sharp housing market\ncorrection. Although supply factors have been weighing down on housing activity for a\nwhile, demand factors appear to have recently become the dominant force. Elevated\nmortgage rates may be exerting a more persistent drag, as income growth expectations\nhave declined while house prices remain high relative to rents. Given very low housing\naffordability, existing home sales have remained depressed despite higher inventories of\nhomes for sale. I am concerned that declines in house prices could accelerate, posing\ndownside risks to housing wealth and inflation in the years ahead.\n\n- 17 -\nArtificial Intelligence\nFinally, the surge in AI investment could also be challenging for monetary policy.\nInvestment in new technologies is likely to raise productivity and lower inflation in the\nmedium term. Although the additional investment also boosts demand, the effects on\nproductivity and supply are likely to occur relatively quickly, and the economy is less\nlikely to tighten appreciably in the near term. In this case, monetary policy should refrain\nfrom restraining aggregate demand, as any deviation from maximum employment is\nlikely to be temporary.\nThere is a risk that expectations of returns on these high-tech investments may be\ntoo optimistic and raise financial stability concerns. Although tech companies can\nlargely self finance these investments, or easily access bond and equity markets, if\nexpectations of future revenues do not materialize, we may see a large correction in\nequity markets and a slump in investment spending due to over-capacity. Such a\ncorrection would lead to a contraction in aggregate demand through lower household\nwealth and lower expected profits.\nNeutral Rate of Interest\nSome of the factors discussed here may be key influences on the neutral interest\nrate, or r*. The two factors that I am more attentive to are slower population growth and\nfiscal sustainability risks. Although these factors have opposite effects on the balance\nbetween savings and investment and r*, I see slower population growth and the aging of\nthe population as more prominent factors in pulling down the neutral interest rate. If\nfiscal sustainability concerns are not addressed in the years ahead, by stabilizing or\n\n- 18 -\nreversing the upward trajectory of the federal debt-to-GDP ratio, I am afraid that r* and\ninterest rates could rise and crowd out private investment.\nClosing Thoughts\nBefore we move on to the discussion, I’d like to touch on the supervision and\nregulatory work under way. We have made a lot of progress in the past few months since\nI became the Vice Chair for Supervision. And Congress has been hard at work\nconsidering important banking and digital assets legislation and the passage of the\nGENIUS Act.\nIn addition to working to implement the Fed’s responsibilities under this law, we\nare making significant progress on a number of priorities in supervision and regulation.\nEarly in my tenure, I described my approach to take a fresh look at our supervision and\nregulatory framework.7\nWe have made progress on a wide range of priorities in these past few months,\nincluding\n• proposed changes to rationalize the large financial institution ratings framework\nthat applies to the largest banking institutions to emphasize material financial risk\n• proposed revisions to the eSLR to return it to its traditional role as a capital\nbackstop and limit the risk of further disruptions to Treasury market activities\n• removed reputational risk from the examination toolkit, instead prioritizing\nmaterial financial risk\n7 See Michelle W. Bowman (2025), “Taking a Fresh Look at Supervision and Regulation,” remarks\ndelivered at the Georgetown University McDonough School of Business, Psaros Center for Financial\nMarkets and Policy, Washington, D.C., June 6,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20250606a.pdf.\n\n- 19 -\n• published a request for information on payments fraud activities to develop a plan\nfor a better and more coordinated response (and, here, I would note that the\ncomment period just closed on September 18)\n• proposed improvements to reduce the volatility of supervisory stress tests by\nimposing reasonable and transparent parameters on the tests\n• reviewing regulatory reporting requirements to improve the validation of\ninformation collected every time a form is renewed, rather than rubber-stamping\nthe renewal of collections that may no longer be effective or useful\nWhile we are making progress in a number of areas, there is much left to do.\nSome of this work will include improving the mergers and acquisitions process;\nreviewing the appropriateness of capital requirements for all banks, including revising the\ncommunity bank leverage ratio and approaches for mutual banks; and addressing\npayments and check fraud. We are continuing to enhance examiner training and\ndevelopment, and we will continue to prioritize economic growth and safety and\nsoundness in the bank regulatory framework.\nThank you again for the invitation to join you today. It’s a pleasure to be here,\nand I look forward to our discussion.",

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Community Banking in the 21st Century,” Research Conference\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\nSt. Louis, Missouri\n(via webcast)\nSeptember 30, 2020\n\nThank you, it is a pleasure to join you virtually today and share a few thoughts on\nwhat I am hearing from community banks in the wake of the pandemic, and what the\nFederal Reserve is doing to assist in the recovery.\nWhen I addressed this conference exactly a year ago, the world was a very\ndifferent place. COVID-19 has brought hardship and disruption to nearly every aspect of\nour lives, and even as economic conditions improve, the pandemic continues to weigh on\nhouseholds, businesses, and the economy. Today, I would like to offer some of my\nobservations on current conditions and share with you what I have learned in discussions\nwith community bankers across the nation. This input has shaped my views of how\nsupervision and regulation are affecting community banks in these challenging times—\nwhat is working, and what needs to improve. In addition to the Fed’s usual consultation\nwith community banks, I have separately embarked on an effort to meet directly with the\nCEOs of all 685 community banks supervised by the Fed, an undertaking that has already\nprovided valuable insights that I will relate in these remarks.\nWhat Community Banks Have Achieved\nAmerica has never experienced a health and economic crisis like the one we are\nfacing. The measures taken to contain the virus and the ensuing sudden stop to the\neconomy beginning in March were unprecedented, just as some aspects of the downturn.\nOne of these is the extent to which small businesses have been affected. Small\nbusinesses tend to be service-oriented and clustered in retail and food services, with many\nless able than larger companies to maintain operations via remote work. Because\ncommunity banks are a major source of credit and financial services for small businesses,\nthis crisis has had a heavy impact on their customers, and in their communities.\n\n- 2 -\nAnother unusual aspect of this event, which I have noted before, is the geographic\nvariation in the timing and severity of the pandemic’s effect.1 Given the widely varying\nrates of infection, and the distinct approaches of states and localities in dealing with the\nvirus, we are seeing divergent experiences in economic performance in different areas of\nthe country.\nAs a result, and to a greater extent than in the past, this slowdown is being felt\ndifferently from community to community, and is being responded to differently from\ncommunity to community. So it is no surprise that community banks are standing\nshoulder to shoulder with their customers, on the front lines. You have done this before,\nof course, during past recessions, but for the reasons I’ve outlined, your role this time has\nnever been more critical. That is why one of the government’s first responses to the\npandemic was the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), geared to small business, and\nnecessarily dependent on community banks. So let me start there, and review what has\nbeen accomplished through PPP and discuss the role of community banks in that\nprogram.\nBased on preliminary results, it appears PPP was timely and effective in helping\nmillions of businesses weather the lockdown period. It was also designed in a way that\nmade community banks integral to its success. The first funds reached businesses\nroughly three weeks after the need for that relief was recognized. To provide perspective,\n$525 billion, or roughly 19 times the value of all Small Business Administration lending\n1Michelle W. Bowman, “The Pandemic’s Effect on the Economy and Banking” (speech at Kansas Bankers\nAssociation CEO and Senior Management Forum/Annual Meeting, Topeka, Kansas (via webcast), August\n26, 2020), https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20200826a.htm.\n\n- 3 -\nin fiscal year 2019, was distributed in the four months from April through August 8.2,3\nCommunity banks with $10 billion or less in assets made about 40 percent of the overall\nnumber and value of PPP loans.4 Community banks were absolutely essential to the\nsuccess of this program.\nThis outcome is probably not surprising to this audience, because when it comes\nto lending to small businesses, community banks have always been an outsized source of\ncredit, relative to their size in the banking system. Before the pandemic, community\nbanks accounted for over 40 percent of all small business lending, while they only\naccounted for roughly 15 percent of total assets in the banking system.\nCommunity banks know their individual and small business customers, and they\nknow their communities. In my conversations with community bank CEOs, several\nreported to me that early in the pandemic they directly contacted every single one of their\nbusiness and consumer loan customers, taking the time to check in with each one to see\nhow they were doing, and what they needed. They encouraged customers to keep in\ntouch with the bank, and they noted the available opportunities for payment deferrals that\ncustomers might not have been aware of. They asked, “Do you need us and how can we\nhelp?” In this pandemic, it means going further, than other banks could or would.\nAccording to the 2020 national survey conducted by the Conference of State Bank\nSupervisors, more than one-third of community banks reduced or eliminated penalties or\n2 Small Business Administration, Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) Report (Washington: Small\nBusiness Administration, August 8, 2020), https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/2020-\n08/PPP_Report%20-%202020-08-10.pdf.\n3 Small Business Administration, Agency Financial Report: Fiscal Year 2019 (Washington: Small Business\nAdministration, November 15, 2019), https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/2019-\n12/SBA_FY_2019_AFR-508.pdf.\n4 Call Report for commercial banks, state savings banks, and thrifts as of June 2020.\n\n- 4 -\nfees on credit cards, loans, or deposits.5 One banker in Colorado told me that his bank\ncalled 3,700 individual borrowers offering deferrals—and that 2,000 of them accepted.\nLet me highlight the role of smaller community banks in the PPP, because they\ndemonstrate the agility and close relationships with customers that was so important in\nconnecting with the businesses most threatened by the lockdowns. Banks with less than\n$1 billion in assets have made a million loans under the PPP, about one-fifth the total,\ndelivering $85 billion in relief to their customers.6 Additionally, as shown in figure 1, the\nsmallest banks made the smallest PPP loans on average, illustrating that these banks play\na key role in serving businesses that may be outside the focus of larger banks. The\naverage PPP loan size at banks with total assets under $500 million was just $72,000,\nabout half the size of the average loan at banks with total assets between $10 billion and\n$100 billion.\nAdditionally, preliminary data based on an Independent Community Bankers of\nAmerica report indicates that community banks have been the main source of lending for\nminority-owned small businesses during the pandemic, accounting for 73 percent of all\nPPP loans made to small businesses owned by non-whites. Early estimates also suggest\nthat community banks provided 64 percent of PPP loans to majority veteran-owned\nbusinesses.7 Within the broader community banking sector, there are banks that have the\nmission to serve low-income and minority communities. Specifically, I am referring to\nminority depository institutions (MDIs) and community development financial\n5 Conference of State Bank Supervisors, “National Survey of Community Banks”\n6 Small Business Administration, Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) Report.\n7 Independent Community Bankers of America, “Data Show Community Banks Lead Economic\nRecovery,” news release, August 19, 2020, https://www.icba.org/newsroom/news-and-\narticles/2020/08/19/data-show-community-banks-lead-economic-recovery.\n\n- 5 -\ninstitutions (CDFIs). These institutions had previously established relationships with\nminority and low-income small business owners and were quickly able to provide them\naccess to PPP loans. Additionally, as trusted institutions in their communities, new\nbusinesses sought them out as lenders who understood their unique, and sometimes\nchallenging, business needs. The Cleveland Fed recently published an article entitled “I\ncan’t believe I got a real person,” which describes one minority-owned small business’s\nexperience successfully getting a PPP loan from an MDI in Los Angeles.8 The title alone\ncaptures why community banks were so important for small businesses seeking PPP\nloans—small banks offer a personalized level of customer service that big banks do not.\nIt is also striking that smaller community banks were the predominant lenders despite\nhaving a smaller staff and while facing lobby closures and other workforce challenges\ndue to COVID-19. Several of the bankers I spoke with worked from home, when they\ncouldn’t open their banks. They worked overtime in drive-through facilities. They\nworked, in one case, inside a makeshift “disaster recovery site.” Through all the ups and\ndowns and closures and reopenings, they persevered. “We closed lobbies,” a banker\nfrom Nebraska told me, “but we never closed the bank.”\nActions like these highlight the importance and value of relationship banking,\nwhich is so central to the mission of community banks. According to the Call Report\ndata, community banks held roughly $400 billion in small business loans in June 2020, as\nshown in figure 2. Loans made under the PPP totaled $197 billion—an amount\nrepresenting about 40 percent of all funding provided under this program. A banker from\n8 Michelle Park Lazette, “’I Can’t Believe I Got a Real Person’: Small Bank Answers Businesses’ Cries for\nHelp,” Medium, September 3, 2020, https://medium.com/new-york-fed/i-cant-believe-i-got-a-real-person-\nsmall-bank-answers-businesses-cries-for-help-844b482ab5ba.\n\n- 6 -\nVirginia told me, “It was a great opportunity for the community banks to show their\nstrength.”\nThe Federal Reserve’s Small Business Credit Survey shows that over one-third of\nsmall businesses turn to small banks for their lending needs.9 The survey data indicate\nthat these borrowers are far more satisfied with their banks than the businesses who\nborrowed from other sources, and three out of five small businesses cite an existing\nrelationship as a key reason they continue to do business with their bank. The PPP\nprogram strengthened many preexisting relationships between community banks and\ntheir borrowers, but community banks also met the needs of new customers facing stress\nfrom COVID-19. One bank reported 3,000 new customers from a total of 15,000 PPP\nloan originations. Over time, the establishment of these new relationships is likely to\nbenefit both the community bank and the small businesses they serve.\nCommunity Bank Supervision during the Pandemic\nNow let me turn to the question of how the Federal Reserve is approaching\ncommunity bank supervision during the pandemic, and how that aligns with my\nphilosophy about how the Fed should always conduct supervision.\nAs you well know, community banks form a critical part of a strong and stable\nfinancial system, and they are vital to their surrounding communities. Supervising\ncommunity banks requires us to strike a delicate balance between ensuring their safety\nand soundness and ensuring that they are able to continue serving those vital functions.\nThis is especially true now, when community banks are supporting the businesses bearing\n9 Federal Reserve, “Small Business Credit Survey,” (2020),\nhttps://www.fedsmallbusiness.org/medialibrary/FedSmallBusiness/files/2020/2020-sbcs-employer-firms-\nreport.pdf.\n\n- 7 -\nthe brunt of the economic effects of the pandemic. This situation strongly argues for\nflexibility in supervision.\nIn each of my conversations with community bank CEOs, I ask what they are\nexperiencing and what they need, while sharing a very clear message about the Fed’s\nflexibility: Given the challenging environment, the Fed will take into account good faith\nefforts by banks affected by COVID-19. In this pandemic, our common goal is to\nsupport individuals, businesses, and communities. This approach is reflected in an April\n2020 statement issued by the Fed and other bank supervisors.10 In that statement, we\ninstructed bank examiners not to criticize bank management for taking prudent steps to\nsupport their communities, and we underscored that we would not expect to take a\nconsumer compliance public enforcement action against an institution that has made\ngood faith efforts to comply.\nThis message has been getting through to examiners. One community banker in\nTexas that I spoke to recently said he had been feeling the justifiable concern that\ngranting the kind of forbearances that everyone recognizes are essential to keep\nbusinesses open will eventually come back to haunt him in an examination. When he\naired this concern to the Fed, he said he felt “incredible support” when the message he\nreceived back was, “Bank your customers.” This assistance is helping homeowners. A\n10 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, National\nCredit Union Administration, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and Consumer Financial\nProtection Bureau, “Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions\nWorking with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus (Revised),” news release, April 7, 2020,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/bcreg20200407a1.pdf.\n\n- 8 -\nrecent Federal Reserve survey found that 5 percent of homeowners with a mortgage had\nreceived a payment deferral from their lender.11\nSo let me extend the same message to others who might be worried: “Bank your\ncustomers.”\nNow let me tell you how these actions fit into my overall view of how to conduct\neffective bank supervision. Our goal as regulators is to ensure that each institution under\nour supervision is successful in managing the risks present within its operations and\nproduct offerings. Effective supervisory practices are not static. They evolve over time\nas lessons are learned.\nThat includes learning by supervisors. As one example, the volume of PPP\nlending has driven meaningful asset growth, especially for smaller banks. We recognize\nthat for some institutions, this asset growth has caused many banks to exceed or nearly\nexceed certain asset-based thresholds contained in statutes, regulations, and reporting\nrequirements. We are currently exploring how to address regulatory and supervisory\nchallenges caused by this temporary asset growth.\nSupervisors encourage banks to adopt best practices, and I believe that we should\nalso seek to achieve the highest supervisory standards. First, we should clearly\ncommunicate our expectations. It is wasteful, costly, and unnecessary when compliance\nactivity occurs because expectations have not been clearly articulated or understood.\nExaminers should always be able and available to explain written guidance. A second\nconsideration is that communication must also be timely. Supervisors should promptly\n11 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Update on the Economic Well-Being of U.S.\nHouseholds: July 2020 Appendixes,” (September 2020),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/2019-supplement-economic-well-being-us-households-\nupdate-202009.pdf.\n\n- 9 -\ncommunicate the findings of off- and on-site analyses, which will further improve the\nprocess of answering questions and addressing issues thereby improving compliance. A\nthird principle is transparency. The key goal here is to promote a clear and transparent\nsupervisory process so bankers know and understand how we form our expectations and\njudgments, and that they will receive this information in a timely manner.\nOverall, I think it is entirely appropriate to regularly ask whether our approaches\nto supervision are consistent with the stated policy objectives of efficiency, safety and\nsoundness, and financial stability. One of those objectives is a healthy community\nbanking sector that can continue to serve its customers. The pandemic has emphasized\njust how important that is.\nThe Leading Challenge for Community Banks\nAnother theme I have heard repeatedly from CEOs is the strong message that they\nare struggling with the cost and burdens of regulatory compliance. Many bankers have\nsaid they consider this the most significant threat to their existence. According to the\nCSBS National Survey, relative compliance costs actually decreased modestly in 2019,\nwhich may be a sign that some of the steps we are taking are helping. This is consistent\nwith what I heard from one Oklahoma banker, who said the biggest threat to his long-\nterm survival was regulatory burden—but “not so much in the last few years.”\nWe know examinations are top of mind for every community banker, and we are\naware some bankers are also concerned with the length of time associated with the\nexamination process. Community bank exams generally consist of phases—pre-exam\ncontact, scoping, conducting the exam, and, finally, the drafting and delivery of the\nreport. From a banker’s perspective, the exam begins with the first day letter or perhaps\n\n- 10 -\nthe first contact of an examiner with the bank, and ends with receipt of the report of\nexam. From a banker’s perspective, exams can seem as though they last for many\nmonths, which can strain resources for community banks that are unable to dedicate staff\nexclusively to managing the examination process. This is a valid concern, and achieving\nan appropriate timeframe for the length of exams, whether that be safety and soundness\nor consumer compliance, is very important to me. We are committed to evaluating our\npolicies, practices, and implementation processes to understand and identify opportunities\nto address these concerns.\nThere are other significant concerns for community bankers, but these only\ncompound the challenge posed by regulatory burden. Bankers worry about competition\nfrom larger banks with economies of scale that are sufficient to drive consolidation. One\nof the biggest advantages from scale comes in regulatory compliance. As one banker in\nWyoming told me: “Consolidation is a huge threat as larger banks can deliver at a far\nlower cost.” One of the biggest costs, of course, is regulatory compliance. Researchers\nfrom the St. Louis Fed found that compliance expenses averaged nearly 10 percent of\ntotal non-interest expenses for banks with less than $100 million in total assets. For\nbanks with between $1 billion and $10 billion in total assets, compliance expenses\naveraged 5.3 percent of total non-interest expense. This suggests that the regulatory cost\nburden for the smallest community banks is nearly double that of the largest community\nbanks.\nIn a speech about community banking regulation, it is entirely appropriate to point\nout our work on tailoring efforts. However, on its own, tailoring does not ensure that\nexisting regulations are not unduly burdensome for smaller banks. These banks may\n\n- 11 -\nbenefit from further regulatory relief, without undermining the goals of safety and\nsoundness, consumer protection, and financial stability. Regulatory burden can be\nmanifested in multiple ways, including the attitude that examiners have in their\ninteractions with banks. That is why the supervision principles I outlined earlier are so\nimportant. Supervisors need to communicate intentions clearly, in a timely manner, and\nin a transparent way. Doing so consistently can significantly lighten the regulatory\nburden that is such a challenge for banks.\nCurrent Economic and Financial Conditions for Banks\nI will conclude with a few comments about economic and financial conditions as\nthey affect community banks. Our nation has suffered the sharpest drop in economic\nactivity in U.S. history, and while unemployment remains quite high, the recent economic\ndata have been encouraging and suggest that our national economy has been recovering\nat a rapid pace. The substantial and timely fiscal stimulus provided by Congress and the\nAdministration has made a meaningful contribution to this recovery. Looking ahead,\ncontinued monetary and targeted fiscal policy support will likely be needed. Even with\nthis support, however, I anticipate that the path toward full recovery will be bumpy, and\nthat our progress will likely be uneven. Asset prices in particular, remain vulnerable to\nsignificant price declines should the pandemic seriously worsen. Some hotels and other\nbusinesses are in arrears on rent and debt service payments, and we are watching the\ncommercial real estate market closely for signs of further stress. I also expect the pace of\nthe recovery will continue to vary from area to area, and will be heavily influenced by not\nonly the course of the virus, but also the public policy decisions made across all levels of\ngovernment.\n\n- 12 -\nBefore the COVID-19 pandemic began, all of the data told us that community\nbanks began this year in excellent shape—by some measures the strongest in decades.\nNinety-six percent of community banks were profitable; nonperforming assets neared\nhistorical lows, and capital ratios were strong. More than 95 percent of small banks were\nrated as 1 or 2 under the CAMELS rating system. These banks built strong capital\npositions and substantially improved asset quality metrics in the years following the last\ncrisis. They also entered the pandemic with high levels of liquidity that have been\naugmented by deposit inflows associated with the pandemic-related stimulus programs.\nFinally, credit concentrations were generally much lower, especially in construction and\ncommercial real estate, and broadly speaking, concentration risk management practices\nsignificantly improved since the financial crisis.\nFollowing a weak first quarter that included higher credit loss provisions, second-\nquarter earnings showed improvement. Aggregate return on assets recovered more than\ntwo-thirds of the decline reported during the first quarter, driven by higher noninterest\nincome and lower operating expenses. Origination fees and interest income from PPP\nlending fueled some of this improvement, with many community banks reporting\nsubstantial loan growth as a result of the program, and a few actually doubling their\nbalance sheets. As seen in figure 3, the quarter-over-quarter loan growth would have\nbeen negative, absent the PPP loans. As origination fees and interest income are\ngenerally recognized over the life of these loans or when they are forgiven, PPP loans\nwill continue to push up bank earnings in the next several quarters. The origination fees\nearned by community banks this year will mitigate the impact of provisions for credit\nlosses, and in turn, may support further lending by these banks.\n\n- 13 -\nDespite improvement in these areas, the operating environment remains\nchallenging. The average net interest margin at community banks tightened during the\nsecond quarter, and it is likely that margins will remain under pressure given the low\ninterest rate environment. But community banks have historically performed well even\nwhen interest margins were under pressure, and they entered into the pandemic in sound\nfinancial condition.\nSo what do we take away from this review of bank numbers and performance? In\nall, I expect community banks will face challenges during what could be a slow return to\na full economic recovery, but I also expect that this sector is well prepared to deal with\nthese challenges and will continue to perform the vital role it has played during the\nresponse to the pandemic. My hope is that at next year’s conference we will have\nadditional data and research that paint a fuller picture of the role community banks played\nin our nation’s response to and recovery from COVID-19, and that we have gained\nfurther insights into the role of all community banks, including MDIs and CDFIs, in\nensuring access by all to credit and financial services.\n\nCommunity Banks Rise to the Challenge\nMichelle W.

    "text": "For release on delivery\n12:30 p.m. EDT\nMarch 25, 2019\nWelcoming Remarks\nby\nMichelle W. Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nto the\nNational Agricultural Credit Conference\nWashington, D.C.\nMarch 25, 2019\n\nGood afternoon. It is a great pleasure for me to join the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas\nCity in welcoming you to the Federal Reserve Board for the 2019 National Agricultural Credit\nConference. For nearly 80 years, these meetings have been at the forefront of important\ndiscussions for those with a stake in agricultural lending, with the first National Agricultural\nCredit meeting held in 1941. At that time and with war looming, there was a clear need to ensure\nthat our nation’s farmers had the resources and capability to support the nation in the wake of the\ngreat depression, deflation, and the dust bowl. This meeting provided a vital forum for candid\nconversation, to exchange information, and to forge relationships that would enable lenders to\ntake steps to ensure a sound future for agriculture--a future supported by the efficient and\neffective provision of credit.\nIn the decades since that first meeting, this conference has seen a number of boom and\nbust cycles in agriculture, most often the result of volatile swings in commodity prices, land price\nvaluations, and borrowing costs for agricultural business owners. Through all of these\nchallenges, this conference has provided an important opportunity to promote a greater\nunderstanding of emerging issues in agricultural finance. Further, the success of these meetings\nlargely depends on the interactions of everyone here today, so I want to thank you for attending\nand for participating. I am honored to welcome you to the first conference meeting to be held at\nthe Federal Reserve Board. And I’m pleased to support this group’s mission to foster discussion\non issues pertaining to ag finance, and I look forward to meeting with you and learning from the\ndiscussion.\nToday and tomorrow, we will discuss recent developments in agricultural credit markets.\nWe will also hear from presenters on topics that connect in various ways to the agricultural\nsector. I am especially pleased to see there is a special focus on rural communities at this year’s\nmeeting. As many of you know, this topic holds a special place in my heart. My family has deep\nroots in rural Kansas and a long history in farming, ranching, and ag banking. I have spent much\nof my life and career living, working, and raising a family in a rural area.\n\n- 2 -\nRural communities are critical for our nation for many reasons including food production\nand processing, manufacturing, and leading innovation in these industries. According to the U.S.\nCensus Bureau, 97 percent of the country’s land mass is rural, and about 60 million Americans\ncall a rural community their home.1 To put that number in perspective, the rural population of the\nUnited States is larger than the combined populations of the New York, Los Angeles, and\nChicago metro areas. If we were talking about the economies of those great cities, we’d stress\ntheir regional differences, the complexities of demographic change, and the distinct challenges\neach city faces to remain vibrant and innovative. When the focus shifts to the rural economy,\nhowever, the discussion tends to be overly broad and simplistic. The diversity and complexity of\nour vast rural communities too often gets lost--and I think that needs to change.\nThere are challenges in rural communities. We know them all too well. There is a\nnotable gap in access to broadband. As of 2016, 31 percent of Americans in rural areas were not\nable to access broadband compared to just 2 percent of Americans in urban areas.2 This can have\na significant business impact on ag producers--for example, limiting access to internet-based\ncattle auctions or inhibiting the ability of dairies to leverage technology to remotely access animal\nnutritionists to formulate feed to maximize milk production.\nMany rural schools struggle to attract and keep qualified teachers who can teach STEM\nand advanced math classes. These subjects are vital to preparing our children for the\nopportunities and challenges of a more competitive and technological workplace.3\n1 U.S. Census Bureau, America Counts: Stories Behind the Numbers, “What Is Rural America?” August 9,\n2017, https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2017/08/rural-america.html.\n2 Federal Communications Commission (FCC), 2018 Broadband Deployment Report (Washington: FCC,\nFebruary 2, 2018), https://www.fcc.gov/reports-research/reports/broadband-progress-reports/2018-\nbroadband-deployment-report.\n3 Megan Lavalley, Out of the Loop (Alexandria, VA: Center for Public Education, January 2018),\nhttp://www.centerforpubliceducation.org/system/files/Rural%20School%20Full%20Report.pdf.\n\n- 3 -\nOne in five people in rural areas have a bachelor’s degree, compared to one in three in\nurban areas.4 This educational disparity helps explain why the employment-to-population and\nlabor force participation rates in rural areas are lower than in many urban areas.5 Another\ncontributing factor to low rural labor force participation is the opioid crisis, which the entire\nnation is struggling to overcome.\nPolicymakers need to be aware of and be willing to confront these issues. But let me be\nclear: I am optimistic about the future of rural America. The narrative of rural decline is too\nsweeping and brushes aside the diversity of the rural experience. Just as many cities thrive while\nothers struggle, there are deteriorating rural communities and rural communities that are thriving\nand growing.\nSo let’s build on these successes and highlight a few of the positives.\nFollowing six years of steady population losses, up through 2016, the rural population\nappears to have stabilized. And while employment is growing more slowly in rural areas than in\nurban areas, rural unemployment has recovered and is now 1 percentage point below pre-\nrecession levels.6 The rate of poverty in rural areas is also falling. From a peak in 2013, the rural\npoverty rate has fallen 2 percentage points to 16.4 percent in 2017.\nThere are also many creative and innovative rural communities. In manufacturing,\ninnovation rates are similar for urban and rural manufacturers, although the services sector in\nrural areas lags its urban counterparts.7 And, I am greatly encouraged to see younger generations\nchoosing to live in and return to their roots in rural communities, just as my family and I chose to\n4 U.S. Census Bureau, “New Census Data Show Differences between Urban and Rural Populations,” news\nrelease, December 8, 2016, https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2016/cb16-210.html.\n5 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Monetary Policy Report (Washington: Board of\nGovernors, February 22, 2019), 10–12,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/20190222_mprfullreport.pdf.\n6 Board of Governors, Monetary Policy Report, 10–12.\n7 Tim Wojan and Timothy Parker, Innovation in the Rural Nonfarm Economy: Its Effect on Job and\nEarnings Growth, 2010–14 (Washington: USDA, September 2017),\nhttps://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/85191/err-238_summary.pdf?v=0.\n\n- 4 -\ndo. These younger generations are often seeking a rural lifestyle and a deeper connection to a\nsmaller community--a community where they can have a lasting impact. They are bringing with\nthem the same innovative spirit they bring to so many industries. For example, some of these\nyoung entrepreneurs and farmers are capitalizing on the recent trend for broader access to locally\nproduced and sourced food.\nWhich brings us back to our focus today: agriculture is the foundation for many rural\neconomies and it is the central topic for this conference. Current conditions in agriculture appear\nto be stable, though at a low level of income, following sharp declines for several years from the\npeak in 2013. The prices of major agricultural commodities have also remained low in early\n2019. For example, today, the price of corn is about 40 percent less than it was from 2010 to\n2013.\nAs noted in the Federal Reserve’s latest Financial Stability Report, farmland values are at\nexceptionally high levels, though down from their 2016 peak. And price-to-rent ratios are at\nhistoric highs. At the same time, equity levels at many farms are higher than in the past. We also\nsee above-trend yields are helping to support many operators, though working capital at many\nfarms has fallen along with incomes. Although the increase in problem loans associated with\nlower incomes has been modest, the Federal Reserve is monitoring the risk that has emerged in\nrecent years.\nOne risk that we are actively monitoring is the recent and devastating flooding in the\nMidwest and its effect on both agriculture and rural communities across the region. Our thoughts\nand prayers are with all those who live in the areas affected by this disaster. I would be especially\ninterested to hear your thoughts on how the flooding may affect agricultural operations and how\nlenders are currently responding.\nThe topics you are discussing today are integral to my role as governor. On Thursday, I\nwill be visiting with and speaking to farmers and community bankers in Deming, New Mexico.\nAn important part of my job is to hear directly from leaders like you and others across this\n\n- 5 -\ncountry to better understand current challenges facing your communities, your companies, and\nyour industry. My goal is to bring back the knowledge I gain from these discussions to inform\nand improve our work to support both the financial sector engaged in agricultural lending and our\nmission as the central bank of the United States.\nI hope that conferences like this will help generate a richer discussion about the\nchallenges and unique advantages in rural America so we can develop more creative, effective\nand direct policy responses. A deeper debate that, for example, distinguishes between low-\ndensity and higher-density rural areas, between rural communities that are relatively isolated and\nthose that are connected and close to thriving cities, will help us develop more durable solutions.\nBefore I close, I want to thank you again, as well as the many people at the Federal\nReserve Bank of Kansas City and from the Federal Reserve Board who helped organize this\nyear’s conference. Thanks to all of you for your work to ensure continued success for American\nagriculture.",

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat a\nFed Listens Event on Transitioning to the Post-Pandemic Economy, hosted by\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nRichmond, Virginia\nOctober 18, 2023\n\nThank you, Tom. It is a pleasure to join you to take part in today’s\nconversations.1 When we started Fed Listens back in 2019, the initiative was part of a\nbroad, comprehensive review of the decisionmaking framework we use to pursue our\nmonetary policy goals of maximum employment and price stability. We met with people\nacross the country from a wide range of backgrounds and perspectives, and we learned a\nlot about how our monetary policy actions affect them, their businesses, and their\ncommunities. In light of the valuable insights we gained in those original listening\nsessions, we decided to expand the scope of Fed Listens to become an ongoing process of\nconsultation with the public.\nI look forward to learning from the perspectives of today’s participants, our\npanelists, as well as those of you in the audience. Through Fed Listens and other Board\nand System convenings, we are able to gain important insights about economic\nconditions by engaging directly with those experiencing the economy. Your views and\nexperiences supplement the economic data that we monitor, providing important color\nand context. These discussions help us gain a deeper understanding of the ongoing\nburden from high inflation—from the considerations for families in making spending\ndecisions to the factors weighed by business owners in applying for loans to make capital\ninvestments like new buildings or equipment to expand operations.\nThese conversations help us look beneath the national level to see how Americans\nin different areas of the country are faring. I am sure that some of the issues and\nchallenges that we will hear about today are unique to the Federal Reserve’s Fifth\nDistrict, while other themes will be broadly similar to those experienced in different areas\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nof the country. This local perspective is one of the great advantages of the Federal\nReserve System’s regional structure and of the Fed Listens initiative.\nThe conversations here today also help inform our thinking as we head into the\nnext meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. Inflation has come down, but we\nknow that it is still too high, and it can be especially difficult for those least able to\nmanage the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. My\ncolleagues and I are highly focused on returning inflation to 2 percent. Our ability to\ndeliver on that goal depends importantly on being able to separate the short-term effects\nof temporary events from longer-term structural shifts in the economy. The pandemic\nexperience abruptly changed the lives of most Americans and their families, and it has\naltered many long-standing economic patterns that policymakers have relied on to\ninterpret economic developments.\nOne example of this change is the major shift in the composition of spending by\nAmerican consumers that we’ve seen in the past few years. In the decades before the\npandemic, we observed a slow but steady decline in the share of aggregate consumer\nspending that was composed of goods and a corresponding increase in the share of\nservices in total spending. In the first two years after the onset of the pandemic, the\nbalance of spending moved back substantially toward goods and away from services,\nthough this movement wasn’t particularly surprising given the lockdowns and the fact\nthat so many businesses in the services sector were shut down.\nWhat has been somewhat surprising, however, is that the relative strength in\ngoods spending has persisted, rather than reverting to its pre-pandemic trends. This\npattern we see in the U.S. is also unusual relative to other advanced economies, where the\n\n- 3 -\ncomposition of goods versus services spending appears to have returned to historical\nnorms. There are a number of potential explanations for these newly emerging spending\npatterns—some that would likely be temporary, and others more lasting. For example,\nthe strong sales of computers, televisions, and video game consoles this year might\nreflect some ongoing pent-up demand following earlier supply shortages, or they might\nreflect a more permanent change in preferences for these goods due to the greater amount\nof time many of us are spending at home.\nGiven their varied experiences and leadership roles in sectors including retail,\nhospitality, and health care, I am sure that our panelists—and, indeed, all of you in the\naudience as well—have observed these and other changes in your own lives, your\nbusinesses, and your communities since the pandemic. Sharing those observations during\ntoday’s discussions will help us do our best as policymakers to promote a strong and\nvibrant economy.\nSo with that, I would like to say thank you again, Tom, for hosting this Fed\nListens event and for the opportunity to be part of this discussion.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n12:30 p.m. EDT (11:30 a.m. CDT)\nAugust 26, 2020\nThe Pandemic’s Effect on the Economy and Banking\nRemarks by\nMichelle W. Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nKansas Bankers Association\nCEO and Senior Management Forum/Annual Meeting\nTopeka, Kansas\n(via webcast)\nAugust 26, 2020\n\n- 2 -\nGood afternoon. It’s great to be with you, and I look forward to our discussion.\nAs you all know, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant disruption and hardship\nin nearly every aspect of our lives, and it continues to weigh heavily on our national\neconomy, which is why it will be the central focus of my remarks here today. Let me set\nthe stage for our discussion by outlining the economic effects of the pandemic most\nrelevant to the banking sector, describing the Federal Reserve’s response to the crisis, and\nthen making some observations about conditions for smaller banks.\nThe Pandemic’s Effects on the Economy and Banking\nWe began this year with the economy in excellent shape—by some measures the\nstrongest in decades. From my seat as a monetary policymaker, we appeared to be in a\ngood position regarding both legs of our dual mandate, which are maximum\nemployment and stable prices.\nBut that picture was dramatically altered with the onset of the COVID-19\npandemic. Efforts to contain the spread of the virus caused a sudden stop in economic\nactivity during March and April. While the extent of the closures and shutdowns varied\nwidely throughout the country, the sudden loss of employment and the contraction in\noutput were like nothing our nation has experienced before.\nThe decline in activity was mostly due to temporary business closures, and the\neconomy has bounced back noticeably in recent months as businesses reopen and fiscal\nsupport was distributed to many Americans. Even so, the economy is still far from back\nto normal. The future course and timing of the recovery is still highly uncertain, and its\npace and intensity are likely to vary across areas of the country—heavily influenced by\nthe decisions of state and local governments. That speaks to another aspect of this\nepisode that is unusual—how the timing and severity of the pandemic’s impact seem to\ndiffer greatly from one area to the next.\nAmong Kansas’s major industries, oil and gas production and equipment\n\n- 3 -\nmanufacturing have been hurt by the worldwide slump in energy demand. Aviation\nmanufacturing has been hit hard by the downturn and by the uncertainty over the\nrecovery in air travel. Agriculture continues to face challenges but is faring somewhat\nbetter than many sectors of the economy. Ag producers are still facing tough financial\nconditions, including the low commodity price environment. While most indications are\nthat agriculture land prices continue to hold fairly steady, I have seen some reports that\nless-productive land has been showing some hints of cracks in valuations.\nTurning to employment, nationwide, we know that the initial job losses were\nheavily concentrated among the most financially vulnerable, including lower-wage\nworkers, young people, women, and minority groups. According to the Fed’s latest\nReport on The Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households, 20 percent of people surveyed\nin April reported a recent job loss. Among those surveyed who live in households with\nannual incomes below $40,000, the reported job loss was nearly double that, at around\n40 percent.1 That said, both of those figures are likely to include a number of layoffs\ndue to pandemic-related shutdowns of businesses that were hopefully only temporary.\nHouseholds were in a generally strong financial position at the beginning of this\nyear, but the restrictions implemented to fight COVID-19 resulted in an unprecedented\nspike in unemployment, which likely led to a number of families finding it difficult to\nkeep up with their payment obligations. That is especially true for lower-income\nhouseholds, which may have had much less of a financial cushion before the onset of the\ncrisis. Along with our monetary policy actions, stimulus checks and enhanced\nunemployment benefits provided in the CARES Act have been a substantial and timely\nsource of financial support to households during this difficult time.\n1Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Report on the Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households\nin 2019 - May 2020 (Washington: Board of Governors, May 2020),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/2020-economic-well-being-of-us-households-in-2019-\npreface.htm.\n\n- 4 -\nUnderstanding the financial stress this could place on many borrowers, the Fed\nand other federal regulators implemented guidance to encourage banks to work with their\nborrowers. By mid-July, only around 8 percent of outstanding residential mortgage loans\nwere in forbearance, well below what many industry observers had feared. It remains\npossible that the economic challenges will persist beyond the forbearance time period\nprovided in the CARES Act, and if so, we would almost certainly see some of these loans\ntransition into longer-term delinquency status or enter into renewed deferment periods.\nThus far, however, the data have been encouraging.\nTurning to the impact on businesses, we know the effects have been most severe\nin the services sector, especially travel, leisure, and hospitality. To give some sense of\nthe losses, employment in the leisure and hospitality sectors nationwide was down\nnearly 40 percent in the 12 months through May and still down about 25 percent\nthrough July. Retail employment fell 15 percent over March and April, though it has\nrecovered substantially since then, and in July it was 6 percent below the pre-COVID\nlevel.\nIt is encouraging to see that even those sectors most heavily affected by the\ncrisis are finding ways to innovate. Stores are adjusting hours and ramping up delivery,\nrestaurants are changing menus and creating outdoor space, distilleries shifted from\nmaking bourbon to hand sanitizers, and independent businesses that hadn’t previously\nrelied heavily on technology are now using it to stay connected to customers and\nregulate workflow.\nTimely and supportive fiscal and monetary policy measures also have helped, but\nwith the progress of the recovery still tentative, I expect that many businesses will\ncontinue to fight for survival in the months ahead, with the support of their lenders and\ncommunities.\nLooking ahead, the economic outlook will continue to evolve quickly. We\n\n- 5 -\nexperienced a pronounced and very welcome bounceback in national retail spending and\nhousing activity over the early summer months. We also saw positive news on progress\ntoward a vaccine and in the effective treatment of patients. Even so, positive cases and\nhospitalizations have risen in some areas and continue to weigh on some regions and the\noverall economy. As Chair Powell has noted, the timeline for the recovery is highly\nuncertain and will depend heavily on the course of the pandemic. We must therefore\nrecognize that progress toward a full recovery in economic activity may well be slow\nand uneven\nThe Fed’s Response to the Pandemic\nNow let me turn to the Federal Reserve’s role in the government’s response to the\npandemic. During the initial phase of the crisis, we took a number of actions to stabilize\nfinancial markets that came under intense stress, including purchasing sizable amounts of\nTreasury and mortgage-backed securities. To support households and businesses, the\nFed quickly lowered our target for the federal funds rate, which has helped to lower\nborrowing costs but created a different challenge for financial institutions—depressed\nnet interest margins. The Fed has also supported actions by Congress and the\nadministration by creating a number of new emergency lending programs. These\nprograms were designed to restore and sustain proper functioning in certain financial\nmarkets that had seized up in March and to facilitate the continued flow of credit from\nbanks to households and businesses.\nOne federal stimulus program that relied heavily on the participation and\nexpertise of community bankers is the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). Working\nthrough banks, the PPP program has delivered more than $500 billion to small businesses\nto help them weather the storm. Community bankers played a crucial role in getting\nthese funds to businesses that needed it, showing once again how essential community\nbanks are to the customers they serve. And in response to feedback we received from a\n\n- 6 -\nnumber of community bankers, the Fed created the PPP lending facility to alleviate\nbalance-sheet capacity issues for banks that otherwise would not have been able to\nprovide PPP loans to their small-business customers.\nThe PPP was created to help small businesses keep their employees on staff, and\nthe Main Street Lending program is designed to support lending to mid-sized businesses\nthrough the recovery. The Federal Reserve has not engaged in lending directly to\nbusinesses before, but it was a step that seemed appropriate considering the breadth and\ndepth of the challenges we face. We continue to solicit feedback and make adjustments\nto the program based on the suggestions received from bankers and other stakeholders,\nand we continue to welcome your thoughts and ideas on how we can make Main Street\nmore effective. I would be interested to visit with those who may already have\nexperience with this new loan program, and I would also be interested to hear about how\nyou plan to use it to meet the needs of your business customers.\nTogether, these policy actions have helped stabilize financial markets, boost\nconsumer and business sentiment, and assist millions of households and thousands of\nbusinesses harmed by the response to the pandemic. Credit markets, which had seized up\nearlier this year, have resumed functioning.\nIn our other role as a prudential regulator and bank supervisor, the Federal\nReserve took several steps intended to reduce burden on banks and help them focus on\nthe needs of their customers and communities.\nTogether, with our fellow federal regulators, we delayed the impact of the CECL\naccounting standard in our capital rules and temporarily eased the leverage ratio\nrequirement for community banks. We also delayed reporting dates for Call Reports and\nother data collections. In addition, to address concerns about real estate appraisal delays,\nwe provided temporary relief from certain appraisal requirements.\nFrom a supervisory perspective, beginning in late March the Fed paused\n\n- 7 -\nexaminations for most small banks and took steps to lengthen remediation timeframes for\noutstanding issues. We considered the exam pause an important step to provide bankers\ntime to adjust operations to protect the health of customers and employees, to prioritize\nthe financial needs of their customers and communities, and to play an essential and vital\nrole in implementing critical relief programs like the PPP.\nAs we continue to support the recovery and work to ensure that supervision and\nexamination is as effective and efficient as possible, I think it’s important to hear directly\nfrom you, who are actually working in the economy, about the conditions facing your\ncommunities and any challenges impeding your ability to meet the needs of your\ncustomers. In addition to my regular outreach to community banks, I am currently\nengaged in an effort to speak with every CEO of the more than 650 community banks\nsupervised by the Fed. I want to hear directly from bankers about what you are seeing\nand your thoughts and ideas about the recovery. These conversations are incredibly\nvaluable to me as a bank regulator and policymaker. They give context to the mountains\nof data we analyze and a unique perspective with real-world local examples to a complex\nand dynamic economic picture. For those of you from Fed member banks who I have\nnot yet had the opportunity to meet or speak with by phone in these times of COVID, I\nlook forward to our conversation. Your local Reserve Bank will be in contact to find a\nconvenient time for us to meet.\nConditions for Smaller Banks\nThis audience knows better than most that smaller banks entered the pandemic in\nstrong condition. At the end of 2019, over 95 percent of community and regional banks\nsupervised by the Fed were rated a 1 or 2 under the CAMELS rating system. After\ncoming through the last financial crisis in generally stronger condition than larger banks,\nsmaller institutions had strengthened their capital positions and substantially improved\nasset quality in the years since, leaving them better positioned to deal with the current\n\n- 8 -\nstress related to the pandemic. Likewise, credit concentrations, especially in\nconstruction and commercial real estate, were lower for smaller banks than at the outset\nof the last financial crisis, and risk management of concentrations improved over the last\ndecade. Smaller banks also entered the pandemic with high levels of liquidity, and this\nliquidity has further improved with deposit inflows associated with pandemic-related\nstimulus programs.\nOverall, community and regional banks remain well positioned to continue to\nextend credit and play an essential role in supporting our nation’s recovery from the\neffects of COVID-19.\nWith this in mind, on June 15 the Federal Reserve announced our plan to resume\nbank examinations. We recognize the unique and challenging conditions under which the\nindustry has been operating, and we will certainly consider that as we resume\nexaminations. Our initial focus will be to assess higher risk banks, particularly those with\ncredit concentrations in higher risk or stressed industries. Finally, we will continue to be\nsensitive to the capacity of each bank to participate in examinations and strive to prevent\nundue burden on banks struggling with crisis-related operational challenges.\nThe Road Ahead\nLike many native Kansans, I am an eternal optimist, so let me end my formal\nremarks on a hopeful note. While the road ahead is highly uncertain, and we don’t yet\nknow when the economy will return to its previous strength, America will recover from\nthis crisis, as it has from all of our past challenges. Our economic fundamentals are\nstrong, and we have the solid foundation of the entrepreneurial spirit and resiliency of\nthe American people. For its part, the Federal Reserve will continue to monitor progress\nand respond promptly and flexibly to support the recovery. We will closely watch\neconomic and financial conditions, and we will use our monetary policy tools to respond\nas appropriate to pursue our dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability.\n\n- 9 -\nWe will also remain open to further adjustments to supervisory schedules and\nexpectations, as needed.\nThank you for the opportunity to speak with you today. I look forward to our\ndiscussion.",

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nKansas Bankers Association\nGovernment Relations Conference\nTopeka, Kansas\nFebruary 5, 2025\n\nThank you for the invitation to speak to you today.1 It is a pleasure to be with you. I\nalways enjoy the opportunity to meet bankers from across the country to learn about the issues\nthat are important to you. Recently, I have observed a shift in tone when I talk to bankers about\nthe bank regulatory environment. Bankers are cautiously optimistic that we will see meaningful\nreform that right-sizes regulation and supervisory approach, reforms that—if executed\nappropriately—should help the banking system promote economic growth in a safe and sound\nmanner. Today, I will share my views on a number of issues related to banking regulation and\nsupervision, including the importance of tailoring, having a problem-focused approach to bank\nregulation and supervision, and the imperative of innovation in the banking system.\nOne of the unique characteristics of the U.S. banking system is the broad scope of\ninstitutions it includes and the wide range of customers and communities it serves. Given this\nwide variety of institutions, regulators must strive to foster a financial system that enables each\nand every bank, no matter its size, to thrive, supporting a vibrant economy and financial system.\nWe must also be sensitive to emerging issues and trends that require attention, whether that be\nunintended consequences from capital requirements, the incentives created by our approach to\nregulatory applications, and to ensure legal compliance.\nTailoring\nThe approach to regulation and supervision should promote a healthy and vibrant banking\nsystem. One key element of a regulatory approach that does so, and one that I often highlight, is\nthe use of “tailoring” in the regulatory framework. For those familiar with my philosophy on\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nbank regulation and supervision, my interest and focus on tailoring will come as no surprise.2 In\nits most basic form, it is difficult to disagree with the virtue of regulatory and supervisory\ntailoring—calibrating the requirements and expectations imposed on a firm based on its size,\nbusiness model, risk profile, and complexity—as a reasonable, appropriate, and responsible\napproach for bank regulation and supervision. In fact, tailoring is embedded in the statutory\nfabric of the Federal Reserve’s bank regulatory responsibilities.3\nThe bank regulatory framework inherently includes significant costs—both the cost of\noperating the banking agencies and the cost to the banking industry of complying with\nregulations, the examination process, and supplying information to regulators both through\nformal information collections and through one-off requests. In the aggregate, these costs can\nultimately affect the price and availability of credit, geographic access to banking services, and\nthe broader economy. The cost of this framework—both to regulators and to the industry—\nreflects layers of policy decisions over many years. But this framework could be more effective\nin balancing the mandate to promote safety and soundness with the need to have a banking\nsystem that promotes economic growth.\nLet’s consider costs. As regulatory and supervisory demands grow, there is often parallel\ngrowth in the staff and budgets of the banking agencies. We should not only be cognizant of\nthese costs, but we should act in a way that requires efficiency while ensuring safety and\nsoundness. Some degree of elasticity in regulator capacity is necessary to respond to evolving\neconomic and banking conditions, as well as emerging risks, but there must be reasonable\n2 See, e.g., Michelle W. Bowman, “Tailoring, Fidelity to the Rule of Law, and Unintended Consequences” (speech\nat the Harvard Law School Faculty Club, Cambridge, MA, March 5, 2024),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20240305a.pdf.\n3 See, Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, Pub. L. No. 115-174, § 401(a)(1)\n(amending 12 U.S.C. § 5365), 132 Stat. 1296 (2018).\n\n- 3 -\nconstraints on banking agency growth. Expansion of the regulatory framework is not a cost-free\nendeavor. These costs are shouldered by taxpayers, banks, and, ultimately, bank customers.\nThe bank regulatory framework has great potential to provide significant benefits,\nincluding supporting an innovative banking system that enhances trust and confidence in our\ninstitutions and promotes safety and soundness. When we consider the benefits and the costs, we\ncan institute greater efficiencies in both banking regulation and in the banking industry itself.\nThe framework is complex, and the various elements of this framework are intended to work in a\ncomplementary way. As banks evolve—by growing larger or by engaging in new activities—\ntailoring can help us to quickly recalibrate requirements in light of the new risks posed by the\nfirm.\nBut the regulatory framework, especially how supervisors prioritize its application to the\nbanking industry, can pose a serious threat to a bank’s viability. For example, imposing the\nsame regulatory requirements on banks with assets of $2 billion to $2 trillion under the new rules\nimplementing the Community Reinvestment Act demonstrated a missed opportunity to promote\ngreater effectiveness and efficiency.4 I question the wisdom of applying the same evaluation\nstandards to banks within such a broad range.\nLikewise, supervisory guidance can provide fertile ground to differentiate supervisory\nexpectations under a more tailored approach. While supervisory guidance is not binding on\nbanks as a legal matter, it can signal how regulators think about particular risks and activities,\nand often drives community banks to reallocate resources in a way that may not be necessary or\nappropriate. The Fed’s guidance on third-party risk management is an example of this.\n4 See dissenting statement, “Statement on the Community Reinvestment Act Final Rule by Governor Michelle W.\nBowman,” news release, October 24, 2023, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bowman-\nstatement-20231024.htm.\n\n- 4 -\nOriginally, this guidance was published in a way that applied to all banks, including community\nbanks. Yet it was acknowledged even at the time of publication that it had known shortcomings,\nparticularly in terms of its administration and lack of clarity for community banks.5\nTailoring is important for all banks, but it is particularly important for community banks.\nThere are real costs not only to banks, but to communities, when the framework is insufficiently\ntailored, as community banks faced with excessive regulatory burdens may be forced to raise\nprices or seek to merge or be acquired. These banks often reach unbanked or underbanked\ncorners of the U.S. economy, not only in terms of the customers they serve but also in terms of\ntheir geographic footprint. We are all familiar with banking deserts and the challenges many\nlegitimate and law-abiding businesses and consumers have in accessing basic banking services\nand credit. It is difficult to imagine that a system with far fewer banks would as effectively serve\nU.S. banking and credit needs and sufficiently support economic growth.\nIt is imperative that we keep the benefits of tailoring in focus as the bank regulatory\nframework evolves. A tailored regulatory and supervisory approach can help inform our policies\non a wide range of industry issues that are likely to emerge in the coming years.\nProblem-Based Solutions\nOne of the most difficult challenges on the regulatory front is prioritization, both for\nbanks managing their businesses and for regulators deciding how to fulfill their responsibilities.\nAt a basic level, the role of regulators is dictated by statute. Congress granted the Federal\nReserve and other banking agencies broad statutory powers but has constrained how those\npowers may be directed through the use of statutory mandates, including to promote a safe and\n5 See “Statement on Third Party Risk Management Guidance by Governor Michelle W. Bowman,” news release,\nJune 6, 2023, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bowman-statement-20230606.htm.\n\n- 5 -\nsound banking system, and broader U.S. financial stability. In the execution of these\nresponsibilities, the Federal Reserve must also balance the need to act in a way that enables the\nbanking system to serve the U.S. economy and promote economic growth. While these\nobjectives are not incompatible, they do require us to consider tradeoffs when establishing\npolicy.\nHow can regulators best meet these responsibilities? As many of you may already know,\nI strongly believe in a pragmatic approach to policymaking.6 This requires us to identify the\nproblem we are trying to solve, determine whether we are the appropriate regulator to address the\nproblem based on our statutory mandates and authorities, and explore options for addressing the\nidentified issue.\nThis approach of pragmatic problem-solving also applies to supervision, where process\nimprovements could improve functioning. The Federal Reserve exercises its supervisory\nresponsibilities by supervisory portfolio, with each portfolio relying on a combination of Board\nand Reserve Bank staff.7 It is important that responsibility for supervisory decisions be paired\nwith accountability for such decisions, which can be complicated depending on the different\nroles played by Board and Reserve Bank staffs, and as institutions change supervisory portfolios.\nThe misalignment of responsibility and accountability detracts from effective supervision.\n6 Michelle W. Bowman, “Approaching Policymaking Pragmatically” (remarks to the Forum Club of the Palm\nBeaches, West Palm Beach, FL, November 20, 2024),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20241120a.pdf.\n7 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Understanding Federal Reserve Supervision” (“What is the\ndifference between what examiners do at Reserve Banks and staff do at the Board? Supervision is a function of the\nBoard, with Reserve Banks conducting supervision under the Board's delegated authority. The Board and Reserve\nBank staff both play a critical role in carrying out the function of supervision, but the role varies by the supervisory\ngroup in which a bank is designated. LISCC supervision is run by the Board, with examiners employed by the Board\nand the Reserve Banks. For all other programs, examinations are conducted by Reserve Bank staff, with\ninvolvement of Board staff on horizontal exercises and key decisions. For banks in supervisory groups other than\nLISCC, Board staff set expectations for how Reserve Bank staff conduct examinations and, in turn, conduct\noversight of Reserve Bank supervision to determine how well supervision is executed.”),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/approaches-to-bank-supervision.htm.\n\n- 6 -\nOur supervisory program should require strong examiner training, rely on examiner\nexpertise in the conduct of examinations, and work in partnership with state bank supervisors.\nDoing so will allow us to leverage the practical experience and judgment of examination staff—\ncharacteristics that are necessary for effective supervision—while preserving the role of the\nBoard to delegate and provide Reserve Bank oversight. Examinations cannot be just a box-\nchecking exercise. We must rely on well-trained and experienced examiners empowered to\nexercise independent judgment and ask questions, which leads to stronger and more effective\nsupervision.\nAs we look at the banking system, including the regulatory framework, we must focus on\nthose issues that are most important to advancing statutory priorities. There is always the risk of\nmisidentification and mis-prioritization, and that we fail to take appropriately robust action on\nkey issues or focus on issues that are less material to a bank’s safety and soundness. Our goal\nshould be to develop a better filter to promote appropriate and effective prioritization.\nTreasury market functioning\nWhere regulation may create or exacerbate financial stability risks, we need to take a\nclose look at whether those risks are justified by the safety and soundness benefits of the\nregulation. The erosion of liquidity in U.S. Treasury markets provides a good example of\nunintended consequences and the need to evaluate tradeoffs in regulation. This issue is a\nbyproduct of several important dynamics: (1) the role of large banks in the intermediation of\nU.S. Treasury markets, (2) the growth of “safe” assets in the banking system, and (3) the increase\nin leverage-based capital requirements becoming the binding capital constraint on some large\nbanks. While regulators may not have tools to address all of these dynamics, clearly the adverse\n\n- 7 -\nimpact of leverage-based capital requirements falls within the banking regulators’ scope of\nresponsibility.\nIssues with Treasury market functioning have been known for quite some time. We have\nseen a persistent trend of low liquidity in U.S. Treasury markets for several years, which has\nbeen noted in the Board’s semiannual Financial Stability Report.8 Low liquidity can create more\nvolatility in prices, exacerbate the effects of market shocks, and can threaten market functioning.\nTreasury market functioning and liquidity will likely be affected by the Securities and Exchange\nCommission’s central clearing requirement for U.S. Treasuries, which may improve market\nfunctioning. In addition, the Federal Reserve’s Standing Repo Facility may also help to promote\nsmooth functioning in the Treasury market. But there is uncertainty regarding how the volume\nof Treasury securities issued and outstanding, and changes to the Fed’s balance sheet over time,\nmay affect this.\nWe have seen Treasury markets experience stress events as recently as the September\n2019 repo market stress, and the so-called “dash for cash” in March of 2020. Both of these\nevents raised concerns about the resiliency of U.S. Treasury markets. Therefore, we should\ncontinue to actively monitor indicators of market function, particularly whether Treasury market\nfunctioning improves over time, thereby enabling it to withstand future shocks.\nThe banking regulators are uniquely positioned to not only analyze but also remediate\ncomponents of the bank regulatory framework that may exacerbate Treasury market illiquidity.\nLarge bank-affiliated primary dealers play an important role in the intermediation of U.S.\nTreasury markets. These dealers are not immune or insulated from the effect of banking\n8 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Financial Stability Report (Washington, DC, November\n2024), 10-11, https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/financial-stability-report-20241122.pdf.\n\n- 8 -\nregulation. While many factors can affect market liquidity, including interest rate volatility and\nTreasury market saturation, we must consider whether some of the pressure is a byproduct of\nbank regulation.\nThe Federal Reserve has previously intervened to address market stress and support\nTreasury market functioning, for example, by temporarily excluding Fed reserves and Treasuries\nfrom the denominator of the supplemental leverage ratio (SLR).9 Treasury markets play a\ncritical role in the U.S. and global financial systems, and we should take action to address the\nunintended consequences of bank regulation, while ensuring the framework continues to promote\nsafety, soundness, and financial stability.10\nLeverage ratios do not differentiate between the risk of certain asset classes or exposures,\nand therefore appropriately operate as a backstop to risk-based capital requirements. However,\nin periods of banks’ balance sheet expansion—as during COVID-19 when we saw significant\ndeposit inflows—leverage ratios can become the binding constraint on banks and their affiliates,\nincreasing the amount of required capital based on increased balance sheet size regardless of\nrisk. When constrained in this way, bank-affiliated primary dealers may pull back on market\nintermediation activities.\nWhere we can take proactive regulatory measures to ensure that primary dealers have\nadequate balance sheet capacity to intermediate Treasury markets, we should do so. This could\n9 See, e.g., Temporary Exclusion of U.S. Treasury Securities and Deposits at Federal Reserve Banks from the\nSupplementary Leverage Ratio, 85 Fed. Reg. 20,578, 20,579 (April 14, 2020),\nhttps://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2020-04-14/pdf/2020-07345.pdf.\n10 See Financial Stability Report, 10–11. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Federal Reserve\nBoard Announces that the Temporary Change to Its Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) for Bank Holding\nCompanies Will Expire as Scheduled on March 31,” news release, March 19, 2021,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20210319a.htm (noting that the Board would seek\ncomment on changes to the SLR).\n\n- 9 -\ninclude amending the leverage ratio and G-SIB surcharge regulations for the largest U.S. banks.\nAdopting regulatory changes to mitigate these concerns may not be sufficient to ensure market\nliquidity, but it would be an important step toward building resiliency in advance of future stress\nevents. In my view, it would be better to fix the roof now, while the sun is shining, by\naddressing over-calibrated leverage ratio requirements, and considering the unintended\nconsequences of any future capital reforms.\nStress testing\nI will now turn to another area that the Board has already identified as a priority for\nreview—stress testing. Stress testing can be an important supervisory tool, but its\nimplementation, outcomes and process have raised significant questions and concerns about\nwhether it is useful in identifying systemic weaknesses. In its current structure, it is an opaque\ntest hidden from public scrutiny that is used to establish variable binding capital requirements on\nlarge banks. Our review should consider whether it is transparent and fair, and whether there are\ntechnical improvements that could enhance the reliability and credibility of the test and its\nresults.11\nIn its current form, stress testing is likely deficient on each of these fronts. Transparency\npromotes fairness, as regulated entities and the public can better understand why and how our\nactions further our goals. When we identify areas that suffer from a lack of transparency, we\nshould act promptly to address those concerns. On December 23 of last year, the Fed announced\nthat it would soon seek public comment on “significant changes” to the stress testing process\ndesigned to improve transparency of the tests and reduce volatility of the resulting stress capital\n11 Michelle W. Bowman, “The Future of Stress Testing and the Stress Capital Buffer Framework” (speech at the\nExecutive Council of the Banking Law Section of the Federal Bar Association, Washington, DC, September 10,\n2024), https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20240910a.pdf.\n\n- 10 -\nbuffers that apply to large financial institutions.12 Given my longstanding support for revisiting\nthe stress testing framework to promote transparency and reduce volatility, I am pleased with this\ndevelopment.13\nFraud\nFinally, I would like to address the problem of fraud, particularly check fraud, which has\ngrown in frequency and impact over the past several years. Fraud continues to harm banks,\ndamaging the perceived safety of the banking system, and importantly hurting consumers who\nare the victims of fraudulent activity. Sometimes fraudsters target vulnerable populations, like\nthe elderly, who are particularly susceptible to certain forms of fraud.\nAs I have noted in the past, efforts by regulators have been frustratingly slow to advance,\nand seem to have done little to address the underlying root causes of this increase in fraud. Why\nhas this important issue failed to garner greater attention from all of the appropriate regulatory\nand law enforcement bodies? Different governmental agencies may share an important role in\naddressing this problem, but the need for a joint and coordinated solution does not excuse\ncollective inaction.\nFraud is perhaps the most consistent issue raised when I speak with bankers. Often the\nconcerns note frustrations with the tools available to fight fraud and frictions dealing with\ncounterparties in investigating and addressing fraud. The costs of prevention, detection, and\nremediation can also be substantial, but so can the costs of navigating these issues dealing with\n12 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Due to Evolving Legal Landscape & Changes in the\nFramework of Administrative Law, Federal Reserve Board Will Soon Seek Public Comment on Significant Changes\nto Improve Transparency of Bank Stress Tests & Reduce Volatility of Resulting Capital Requirements,” news\nrelease, December 23, 2024, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20241223a.htm.\n13 Bowman, “The Future of Stress Testing.”\n\n- 11 -\naffected bank customers. We are overdue for more assertive action to protect bank customers\nand the financial system.\nThe Innovation Imperative\nInnovation has always been a priority for banks of all sizes and business models. Banks\nin the U.S. have a long history of developing and implementing new technologies, and\ninnovation has the potential to make the banking and payment systems faster and more efficient,\nto bring new products and services to customers, and even to enhance safety and soundness.\nRegulators must be open to innovation in the banking system. Our goal should be to\nbuild and support a clear and sensible regulatory framework that anticipates ongoing and\nevolving innovation—one that allows the private sector to innovate while also maintaining\nappropriate safeguards. We must promote innovation through transparency and open\ncommunication, including demonstrating a willingness to engage during the development\nprocess. Financial institutions should know what activities are permitted, and the supervisory\nand regulatory expectations that will accompany their activities. By providing clarity and\nconsistency, we can encourage long-term business investment, while also continuing to support\ntoday’s products and services. A clear regulatory framework would also empower supervisors to\nfocus on safety and soundness, ensuring a safe and efficient banking and payment system.\nAbsent clearer rules of the road, we run the risk of reducing the availability of banking\nservices. Bank regulatory policy should address the needs of the unbanked and expand the\navailability of banking services. It should not be used to limit or exclude access to banking\nservices for legitimate customers and businesses in a way that is meant to further unrelated\npolicy goals, sometimes referred to as “de-banking” or bank “de-risking.” Credit decisions\n\n- 12 -\nshould not be dictated by banking regulations or supervisory messages. Ultimately, bankers are\nand should be responsible for their own credit allocation decisions.\nRegulators must change approaches that have resulted in credit allocation decisions,\nresearch how banks are making decisions related to which customers they serve, and promote an\nenvironment that allows legitimate bank customers to obtain banking services.\nNew technologies and services often require novel regulatory and supervisory\napproaches, and we recognize that past approaches will likely not be effective. Often regulators\ntake a “more is better” approach to regulation and guidance. Over the past several years, the\nbanking industry has faced an onslaught of proposed and final regulations and guidance,\nmaterials that require a significant time commitment to review, to comment on, and to\nimplement. Many times, these require changes to policies and procedures or risk-management\npractices.\nFundamentally though, this “more is better” approach fails to address the core criticisms,\nincluding both an overall lack of transparency, and the perception (and perhaps reality?) that\nregulators have been overly hostile to innovation, including banks’ involvement in any capacity\nwith digital assets, the use of artificial intelligence, and the availability of new technologies and\nproviders to access the payment system.\nAs a banker, state bank commissioner, and as a Board member, I have made the case for\na more open-minded approach to innovation, including by co-hosting an informational event for\nbankers together with three other bank commissioners on distributed ledger technology and\nbanking innovation just prior to joining the Board.14 We must prioritize understanding the risks\n14 See, e.g., Michelle W. Bowman, “Innovation and the Evolving Financial Landscape” (remarks at the Digital\nChamber DC Blockchain Summit 2024, Washington, DC, May 15, 2024),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20240515a.pdf.\n\n- 13 -\nand benefits of new technologies before developing a supervisory posture, especially when\napplying rules and using the “soft” power of supervision to discourage its use. Instead, we must\ncreate a supervisory and regulatory environment that facilitates reasonable and supportive\napproaches. The natural posture of a regulator may be to emphasize safety and soundness above\nall other objectives, but doing so will ultimately stifle innovation and threaten the long-term\nhealth and utility of the banking system.\nClosing Thoughts\nThank you for the opportunity to speak with you today. The financial system is\nconstantly evolving, and our regulatory approach must anticipate this evolution. We must return\nto a regulatory approach that emphasizes appropriate tailoring of regulatory requirements and\nsupervisory expectations and take a pragmatic approach in identifying and remediating the most\npressing issues. And we must encourage ongoing innovation in the banking and financial\nsystems.",

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nFed Listens Event hosted by\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas\nOdessa, Texas\nApril 20, 2023\n\nThank you, Lorie, it is great to be here, and to hear the broad range of\nperspectives that are represented here today. In 2019, during a very different time in our\nhistory, the Federal Reserve began a year of listening sessions with the public, tied to\nchanges being considered in our approach to monetary policy, which was: how the\nFederal Open Market Committee uses interest rates and other tools to promote a healthy\neconomy. While data can tell us a lot, hearing the stories behind that data helps to paint a\npicture that brings it to life for me and for my colleagues. We have heard a lot about how\nAmericans are faring in the economy, and about how they are affected by our policy\ndecisions. And so, our effort to create opportunities to enhance our ability to listen has\ncontinued, and has become what I expect will be, and certainly should be, a permanent\nfeature of the Federal Reserve’s decision-making.\nIt is a simple fact that what the Fed does in Washington has a significant impact\non how families and businesses spend, borrow and plan for the future. That is exactly\nwhy we need to learn about the experiences of people in Odessa, Midland and other\ncommunities in the Permian Basin. Lately, as you know, the Fed has been focused on\nlowering inflation, which is essential if we want to support a growing economy and rising\nincomes. We want to hear how inflation, along with the higher interest rates needed to\nbring inflation down, is affecting you and your communities. These conversations\nprovide important context to the economic data that we consider, and they help guide our\nthinking about how we can best achieve stability and support for the economic well-being\nof all Americans.\nOne of the important issues we will talk about today is workforce development,\nwhich in every community depends on effective partnerships with the private sector. For\n\n- 2 -\nmany years, this region has been challenged to find qualified workers in certain\nindustries. But now, the challenge of finding willing and qualified workers stretches far\nbeyond just those requiring specific skills training. Our strong labor market has made it\nextremely difficult for growing businesses to find workers, which, if not addressed, could\neventually undermine a strong economy. I am very interested to learn about the different\nstrategies and approaches being used in this region to provide workers with the skills they\nneed to fill these jobs, and what additional considerations might be helpful in your efforts\nto improve workforce development.\nAnother issue we will focus on today is education. As a mother of two middle\nschool students during the depths of the pandemic, I am particularly interested in\nunderstanding how your communities have managed and continue to manage\nKindergarten through 12th grade education after the disruptions many places experienced\nas a result of the pandemic school closures.\nStudent performance suffers during even brief periods of instruction disruption.\nSo even in places where school closures may have been limited, there may continue to be\nlasting effects on attendance and student performance. Where schools were permitted to\nremain open, we know that teacher and support staff shortages were, and continue to be, a\nsignificant challenge for many school districts. I look forward to hearing your views and\nexperiences during our time together.\nThank you, again, for the invitation to be here today, and I look forward to our\ndiscussions.\n\n- 3 -",

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe 2023 Ohio Bankers League “Main Event”\nColumbus, Ohio\nNovember 7, 2023\n\nIt is a pleasure to be with you in Columbus this afternoon.1 I always find it\nhelpful and informative to travel outside of Washington, D.C., to learn about views on the\neconomy, the financial system, and, more recently, regulatory reforms. This month\nmarks five years of my service as a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System. Over the years, I have drawn heavily upon my experience as a former\nstate bank commissioner and a banker in my responsibilities, especially as they relate to\nbank supervision, payments, and consumer and community affairs. This perspective\ninforms my views about evolving bank regulations and the real-world impact that\nchanges can have on financial institutions, their local communities, and the broader U.S.\neconomy.\nAs you know, the federal regulatory agenda has been very active lately, with a\nsignificant volume of rules, guidance, and supervisory reforms either recently published\nor in the pipeline. Today, I will offer my thoughts on some of these developments. As\nthe agencies move forward with an active and potentially disruptive reform agenda, we\nshould pause, reflect upon these changes, and ask some questions: Are these reforms\nefficient? In totality, do they work together to enhance the regulatory framework,\nresulting in a rational and efficient framework? Are the reforms within the scope of our\nstatutory authority? And have we met the appropriate standards of due process and\npublic engagement?\nBefore I dig a bit deeper into these questions and we turn to our conversation, I’d\nlike to offer a few thoughts on the economy and monetary policy. After sharply\n1 The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee or the Board of Governors.\n\n- 2 -\ntightening monetary policy over the past year and a half to reduce inflation, at our\nNovember meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) voted to maintain the\ntarget range for the federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent and continued the run off of the\nFed’s securities holdings.\nWe have seen considerable progress on lowering inflation, but inflation remains\nhigh and recent readings have been uneven. The latest personal consumption expenditure\n(PCE) inflation index data showed 12-month changes in total and core inflation of 3.4\npercent and 3.7 percent, roughly similar to the previous month’s reading. However, some\ncomponents of core services inflation have picked up, and I see a continued risk that core\nservices inflation remains stubbornly persistent. In my view, there is also a risk that\nhigher energy prices could reverse some of the progress made to bring overall inflation\ndown.\nThe economy has remained strong as the FOMC raised the federal funds rate, and\nrecent data indicate that economic activity has accelerated with real gross domestic\nproduct (GDP) growing at a 4.9 percent annual rate in the third quarter. Consumer\nspending has also accelerated, and the housing sector appears to be continuing to\nrebound. The latest employment report showed a labor market with healthy job gains.\nOver the past year, labor force participation has improved with the average pace of job\ngains slowing somewhat, a sign that labor market supply and demand may be coming\ninto better balance.\nHowever, throughout the past few years, we have seen continued data revisions,\nwith the most recent of these revisions reflecting significant changes to employment data.\nJob gains in prior months were revised lower, but average hourly earnings for the past 12\n\n- 3 -\nmonths were revised higher. The frequency and extent of data revisions make the task of\npredicting how the economy will evolve even more challenging, and I will continue to\nmonitor these data carefully.\nWhile I continue to expect that we will need to increase the federal funds rate\nfurther to bring inflation down to our 2 percent target in a timely way, I supported the\nFOMC’s decision last week to hold the target range for the federal funds rate at the\ncurrent level as we continue to assess incoming information and its implications for the\noutlook. Currently, the federal funds rate appears to be restrictive, and financial\nconditions have tightened since September. Some of this tightening has occurred through\nlonger term bond yields, which can be volatile over time as conditions change. We don’t\nyet know the effects of tightened financial conditions on economic activity and inflation.\nMoreover, there is an unusually high level of uncertainty regarding the economy and my\nown economic outlook, especially considering recent surprises in the data, data revisions,\nand ongoing geopolitical risks. But I will be closely watching the incoming data as I\nassess the implications for the economic outlook and the appropriate setting of monetary\npolicy.\nIt is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course. My\ncolleagues and I will make our decisions at each meeting based on the incoming data.\nHowever, I remain willing to support raising the federal funds rate at a future meeting\nshould the incoming data indicate that progress on inflation has stalled or is insufficient\nto bring inflation to 2 percent in a timely way. Returning inflation to the FOMC’s goal is\nnecessary to achieve a sustainably strong labor market and an economy that works for\neveryone.\n\n- 4 -\nI will turn now to developments in the ongoing bank regulatory framework reform\nagenda and share some of my observations and takeaways. While this is by no means a\ncomprehensive list of all of the current reforms—or reforms that may still be to come—I\nwill focus my remarks on capital requirements reform, the Community Reinvestment\nAct, the cap on debit interchange fees, and climate guidance.\nCapital Requirements Reform\nIn July of this year, the agencies proposed significant reforms to capital\nrequirements for banks with more than $100 billion in assets. Given this threshold, many\nbanks would not be directly impacted based on their asset size, but the proposal does\nprovide important insights about how regulators are considering reforms more broadly.\nThe proposal would increase total risk-weighted assets across bank holding\ncompanies subject to the rule by an estimated 20 percent. These impacts would vary\nbased on firm-specific attributes—but not by asset size. The contemplated capital\nincreases do not appear to be supported by facts and analysis and will likely result in\nsignificant unintended consequences.\nOne could reasonably ask whether there is cause for such material change. Is this\nproposal designed to address identified regulatory deficiencies and shortcomings?\nThe U.S. banking system remains strong and resilient. The system is much better\ncapitalized than after the 2008 financial crisis, with substantially more liquidity. And\nU.S. banks are subject to a range of new supervisory tools that did not exist prior to 2008.\nThe current framework represents a risk-based, tailored approach, which strives to align\nregulation with risk and fulfill the congressional mandate to tailor the prudential\n\n- 5 -\nregulatory framework.2 The current level of capital in the U.S. banking system is a\nstrength, not a weakness, and is complemented by liquidity regulations and other\nprudential requirements that have contributed to the resilience of U.S. banks.\nI am skeptical of assertions that the costs of the proposal are justified by the\nbenefits. The proposed capital increases, if implemented, would have a tangible effect on\nbanking activities and unintended—but predictable—consequences. For example,\nincreases of this magnitude are likely to have a detrimental impact on U.S. market\nliquidity and lending, and firms without sufficient scale are likely to exit certain markets.\nIncreased capital requirements for certain types of loans may also lead to reduced credit\navailability or increased cost of credit, which could disproportionately harm underserved\nmarkets, businesses, and communities. Ultimately, bank customers will bear the cost of\nthese increases.\nI do want to briefly address the role of international coordination in establishing\ncapital standards both in the United States and around the world. International bodies\nand agreements can help foster the creation of similar regulatory frameworks across\njurisdictions. Significant banking activities occur in the international and cross-border\ncontext, and we know that financial stability risks can spread throughout global financial\nmarkets. By engaging in international coordination, U.S. regulators can promote\nminimum standards across jurisdictions, and these minimum standards can improve\ncompetitive equity in banking markets and make the financial system safer.\n2 Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, Pub. L. No. 115-174, 132 Stat.\n1296 (2018).\n\n- 6 -\nWhile the capital proposal reflects elements of the agreed upon Basel standards, it\nis not a mere implementation of the Basel standards. In this proposal, the calibration—\nwith a large increase in capital requirements for U.S. firms—far exceeds the Basel\nstandards mandate. Instead, the scale of the increase is driven by deliberate policy\nchoices to significantly increase capital requirements for U.S. banks over $100 billion,\neven for those that are not internationally active. As we have seen since the proposal was\npublished, there has been growing support for improving the proposal’s quantitative,\nanalytical foundations, including the need for and impact of capital increases of this\nscale.\nSo, what is the path forward? In response to the considerable early public\nfeedback, the comment period has now been extended into mid-January 2024, with a\nparallel effort to gather more information about the potential impact. The public and\nstakeholder comment process will guide a discussion of the changes needed to strike the\nright balance between costs and benefits. Public feedback during the rulemaking process\nwill help to ensure that a final rule would address the proposal’s deficiencies.\nAlthough I did not support the initial proposal, I will reserve judgment for my\nsupport of a draft final rule. I look forward to engaging with my colleagues to improve\nthe initial proposal, and then consider whether a final rule sufficiently addresses my\nconcerns.\nPolicymakers may disagree about the best policy choices to further supervisory\ngoals, but we must honestly assess the costs of reform, going beyond the direct costs to\nbanks and their customers to include the potential harm to U.S. bank competitiveness in\nthe global economy. Of course, this cost analysis would not be complete unless it\n\n- 7 -\nincorporates the impact of other concurrent and complementary proposals. The analysis\nmust include the new long-term debt proposal for all firms with more than $100 billion in\nassets, and the other existing rules that affect capital and firm incentives, like the stress\ncapital buffer and the supplementary leverage ratio.\nMeaningful, accurate input can only be provided if regulators are clear about the\ndesired end state of reforms and how they would work together to complement the\nframework, avoiding conflicting or contradictory requirements. Approaching reform in a\npiecemeal manner increases the risk of arriving at a capital end state that is inefficient,\nredundant, and unfair to those subject to the regulation and harmful to banks, their\ncustomers, and the broader economy.\nCommunity Reinvestment Act\nLate last month, the federal bank regulators adopted a new final rule to implement\nthe Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). The purpose of the Community Reinvestment\nAct is to improve access to credit in all communities where banks are located, especially\nlow- and moderate-income (LMI) communities. The CRA was enacted in 1977 shortly\nafter the civil rights movement and against the backdrop of other significant federal laws\ndesigned to address financial inclusion and equal access to credit. At the time Congress\npassed the CRA, it found that banks had a “continuing and affirmative obligation to help\nmeet the credit needs” of their local communities.3 Congress reinforced this obligation\nby instructing the federal financial supervisory agencies to encourage banks to help meet\nthe credit needs of those same communities.4\n3 12 U.S.C. § 2901(a)(3).\n4 12 U.S.C. § 2901(b).\n\n- 8 -\nAs you know, my support for the important goals of the CRA did not translate\ninto support for the final regulations, and I would like to highlight a few specific\ndeficiencies in the final rule that led to this result. In my view, it was absolutely essential\nthat the final rule be straightforward and clear, encouraging banks to meet the credit\nneeds of their communities without unintentionally disincentivizing or limiting banks\nfrom supporting their communities.\nWhile the rule includes many positive changes, those changes ultimately did not\noutweigh its shortcomings, including that the agencies arguably exceeded the authority\ngranted by the CRA statute. The rule is unnecessarily complex, overly prescriptive, and\ndirects outcomes that result in disproportionately greater costs than benefits, adding\nsignificantly greater regulatory burden for all banks, but especially for community banks.\nEven the foundational question—are banks doing enough to support their\ncommunities?—is left unanswered in the final rule, perhaps because there is no evidence\nto support the agencies’ assumption that broadly speaking, banks are falling short.\nScope and Impact on Community Banks\nFirst and foremost, the final rule applies the same regulatory expectations for\nsmall banks as it does for the largest banks. For example, a wide range of community\nbanks—those with more than $2 billion in assets—are treated as “large banks” under the\nfinal rule, forcing these banks to comply with the same CRA evaluation standards as a\nbank with $2 trillion in assets. The lack of recognition that these banks are\nfundamentally different, with different balance sheets and business models, misses an\nimportant opportunity to appropriately tailor CRA expectations to a bank’s size, risk,\nservice area, and business model. This approach is a radical departure within the\n\n- 9 -\nregulatory framework where no other provision considers a bank with $2 billion in assets\n“large.”\nAs a result of this decision, many community banks will be subject to new and\nmaterially enhanced requirements, including a new retail lending test, significantly\nexpanded assessment areas, and increased data and reporting obligations. As I made\nclear throughout the development of the original proposal and final rule, instead of\nrequiring these changes, community banks should have had the option, at their discretion,\nto opt into the new retail lending test and assessment areas or to continue with the\nexisting framework. The significant increases in burden and cost associated with these\nchanges are simply disproportional when applied to community banks, in a way that may\nconstrain the resources community banks can devote to supporting their communities.\nLack of Congressional Authorization\nThe final rule also arguably exceeds the authority granted by Congress. While the\nfinal rule aspires to modernize the CRA to account for changes in the way banks\noperate—for example, aligning the rule with current practices of extending credit in\ncommunities, including through mobile and online banking—there are limits to what the\nbanking agencies can do. Congress alone has the power to modernize the CRA statute,\nincluding reflecting the variety of financial institutions that provide credit and financial\nservices in their communities. In my view, some of the changes being made by the\nagencies in this rule, including those that evaluate banks outside of their deposit-taking\nfootprint, are likely beyond the scope of our authority under the statute.\n\n- 10 -\nClarity and Transparency\nIf these new standards were in place today, based on data from 2018 through\n2020, there would be a nearly tenfold increase in banks with a “Needs to Improve” CRA\nrating. In some ways, this highlights a fallacy underlying these rule changes: that the\nlow number of banks with a “Needs to Improve” rating itself demonstrates that the\nstandards of the CRA regulations have been too lax historically, ignoring the more\nplausible explanation that banks work hard to support their communities. It is not\nappropriate for the banking agencies to materially increase the requirements on banks,\nresulting in a downgrade of currently satisfactory performance to “Needs to Improve,”\nwithout a thorough, data-supported analysis that justifies a recalibration evidenced by\nactual shortcomings in bank activities.\nTaken as a whole—all 1,494 pages of the final rule—it will be a challenge for\nbanks, particularly smaller banks, to understand what they must do to continue to receive\nsatisfactory ratings under the CRA.\nUnintended Consequences and Other Problematic Provisions\nPerhaps most concerning about the final rule is that it may incentivize banks to\nreduce their support for certain communities, forcing them to pare back lending in areas\nwhere there is a need for credit accessibility. The addition of retail lending assessment\nareas and outside retail lending areas, coupled with a new requirement for large banks to\ninclude an entire county instead of a partial county as an assessment area, may ultimately\nincentivize firms to pull back their lending.\nThere are many other areas of concern I have with the rule—including the odd\nnew publication of already available HMDA data, expanded reliance on summary of\n\n- 11 -\ndeposit data, and an implementation period of two years, which is far too brief in light of\nthe rule’s extraordinary complexity. While I have confidence that banks will make the\nbest of this new rule, and continue to support their communities, I regret that the new\nfinal rule may complicate, and in some instances frustrate, the important goals of the\nCRA.\nInterchange Fee Cap Proposal\nAlso late last month, the Federal Reserve proposed amending the regulatory cap\non debit card interchange fees, citing the Dodd-Frank Act requirement that the Federal\nReserve establish a cap that is reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the\nissuer with respect to debit transactions. For many years, bankers have expressed\nsignificant concern about external factors, like fraud, increasing the costs of supporting\nbank debit card programs—concerns that could be exacerbated by a lower regulatory cap\non interchange fees. While the Board’s proposed rule suggests that it could result in\nbenefits to consumers, I am concerned that the costs of this fee cap revision for\nconsumers—through the form of increased costs for banking products and services—will\nbe real, while the benefits to consumers—such as lower prices at merchants—may not be\nrealized.5\nAt its heart, the proposal is unfair to many issuers and in some ways regressive in\nits impacts. The proposed rule acknowledges the varied size, business models, and\nproduct offerings of banks subject to the interchange fee cap and yet aims to achieve\n5 The Board memo discussing the proposed revisions to the interchange fee cap suggests that “[m]erchants,\n… may pass on some portion of their savings from lower interchange fees to consumers.” See “Proposed\nRevisions to Regulation II’s Interchange Fee Cap,” memorandum, Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System, Reserve Bank Operations and Payment Systems and Legal Divisions, October 18, 2023, p.\n9, https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/boardmeetings/reg-ii-memo-20231025.pdf.\n\n- 12 -\n“rough justice” by establishing a single cap that applies to all covered issuers. Larger\nissuers—those with the highest transaction volumes, greater negotiating power, and the\nmost efficiencies that come from scale—would continue to have a significant competitive\nadvantage under this rule. Even the lower interchange fee may allow them to continue\nprofitably operating their debit card programs. By contrast, smaller issuers subject to the\ncap—those with smaller transaction volumes, less negotiating power, and fewer\nefficiencies in scale—would likely be at a significant competitive disadvantage.\nRetail banking is an essential, core function for many smaller issuers, so this\npricing dynamic may not ultimately lead them to abandon their debit card programs. But\nit is certainly possible that banks will be forced to either pass costs through to customers\nor operate their debit card programs at a loss, which many banks do today. Under the\nproposed rule, a staggering one-third of bank issuers would not be able to recover even\nthe partial costs that factor into the interchange fee cap. For banks that operate debit card\nprograms at a loss, presumably those costs will need to be recovered elsewhere, such as\nthrough higher borrowing costs for bank customers or through other fees for services\nprovided, which are also targeted by the banking agencies for elimination. Higher\nborrowing costs or fees could be particularly harmful for low-income customers who may\nnot qualify for credit card products or other alternatives.\nThe fees banks charge for provided services have been criticized by some\nregulators, but in many instances these fees—including interchange fees—support a\nbank’s ability to offer low-cost or no-cost banking products or services to customers. If\nfinalized as proposed, this revision may force banks to discontinue their lowest-margin\nproducts, including options designed to increase financial inclusion and access for LMI\n\n- 13 -\nindividuals and families. I sincerely hope that this is not the case, but it is a real and\nimportant risk.\nWhile I am concerned by both the timing and basis for this proposed downward\nrevision to the interchange fee cap, I want to note two other elements of the proposal.\nFirst, the proposal includes a formula for periodic updates, under which the cap would\nautomatically be updated based on reported data every two years. Once this type of\nformulaic approach is adopted, I expect it will be very difficult to overcome inertia to\nrevisit and reopen it, even if there are compelling reasons to do so.\nSecond, the proposal applies only to a subset of issuers—those with more than\n$10 billion in assets—but I expect the fee cap will continue to affect a broader range of\nissuers, including community banks and small credit unions. Issuers of all sizes use the\nsame payment rails, and smaller issuers will inevitably face some pricing pressure, at\nleast indirectly, from the interchange fee cap. And while the interchange fees many\nsmaller issuers have collected since the introduction of the interchange fee cap may have\nremained stable, it is difficult to determine how this compares to the aggregate costs of\nprocessing, fraud and fraud prevention, and the many other inputs for running a debit\ncard program. It is not clear that interchange fees have kept up with the increasing\nexpenses for many smaller issuers, including repeated reissuing of debit cards due to\nretail industry data breaches.\nUltimately, the net result of this proposal may be to simply shift costs from\nmerchants to bank customers, and to make those costs far less transparent (for example, if\nthose costs are recovered through higher loan interest rates). Of course, this proposal has\nbeen published for public comment, and my colleagues and I welcome public feedback\n\n- 14 -\non the proposal, particularly on the impacts it may have on financial institutions,\nincluding those not directly subject to the rule. This broader context and understanding is\nnecessary when we revise a critical piece of the U.S. payments infrastructure.\nClimate Guidance\nFinally, on October 24, the Federal Reserve—in conjunction with the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency—\npublished guidance directing banks’ approach to climate-related financial risks. The final\nguidance will create confusion about supervisory expectations and will result in increased\ncompliance cost and burden, without a commensurate improvement to the safety and\nsoundness of financial institutions or to the financial stability of the United States. This\nis another regulatory action that raises questions about need and legal basis, but also\nabout whether the focus of reforms is appropriate in the current economic and\nsupervisory environment. This guidance represents a departure from sound banking\npolicy and potentially a distraction from more important risk-management objectives.\nAs a foundational matter, it is good to recognize that institutions of all sizes have\nlong been expected to manage the risks associated with their activities, including these\nclimate-related financial risks. While the guidance adopts a specialized regime for\nclimate risks, it does not explain why this unique treatment for climate risks is warranted.\nThe guidance simply suggests that banks are “likely to be affected” by the physical and\ntransition risks associated with climate change. Without taking stock of risk-management\npractices today and evaluating whether it is appropriate as it comes to climate-related\nfinancial risks—essentially without identifying a problem statement—the guidance goes\n\n- 15 -\ndirectly to solutions that are at once unclear and expensive, without clearly promoting\nsafety and soundness or U.S. financial stability.\nUnder the guidance, banks must monitor and measure climate-related risks over\nindefinite time horizons and “develop strategies, deploy resources, and build capacity to\nidentify, measure, monitor, and control for climate-related financial risks.” The guidance\nincludes few specifics about this data collection expectation—which surely will expand\nover time—nor does it clarify how banks are intended to integrate this new information\ninto risk-management programs and policies, and even into lending decisions. Indeed,\nthe guidance adopts an intentionally vague standard, with an expectation that data\ncollection and the planning horizon for “scenario analysis” to probe on such risks may\nextend “beyond the financial institution’s typical strategic planning horizon.” And yet,\nthe benefit of requiring banks to plan for events that occur far into the future seems\nlimited, as long-dated predictions about the future are likely to be highly speculative and\nheavily influenced by the underlying assumptions, and therefore of limited or no utility to\nthe bank in managing risk. This approach is a significant departure from existing\nsupervisory standards and includes no explanation for the deviation from normal\nsupervisory time horizons.\nIn addition to being unclear, the guidance will surely be expensive to implement.\nThe costs to implement new data collections will be substantial not only to institutions\nattempting to comply with uncertain elements of the guidance, but also to bank customers\nthat will be asked to provide more information when seeking credit or other banking\nproducts. One likely potential consequence could be to discourage banks from lending\nand providing financial services to certain industries, forcing them to seek credit outside\n\n- 16 -\nof the banking system from nonbank lenders. This will undoubtedly result in decreasing\nor eliminating access to financial services and increasing the cost of credit to these\nindustries.\nHistory tells us that these increased costs will ultimately be borne by consumers.\nThe lessons learned from supervisory failures during the bank stress in the spring clearly\nillustrate that bank examiners and bank management should focus on core issues, like\ncredit risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk. Today’s guidance could ultimately distract\nattention and resources from these core risks.\nI have every confidence that banks will work diligently to try to understand the\nexpectations created under the agencies’ climate guidance and will craft an approach that\nworks—despite the uncertainty the guidance itself creates. However, looking to the\nfuture, I am concerned that the scope of this guidance—which is limited to banks with\nover $100 billion in assets—will trickle down to far smaller institutions by treating\napproaches adopted by large banks as “best practices” for banks of all sizes, resulting in a\nmuch higher regulatory burden for these firms.\nI am also concerned that the actions taken by banks to manage climate risk could\nhave unintended consequences for LMI communities, including increasing the cost of\ncredit or reducing credit availability in those communities. Consumers and businesses in\nLMI communities often have fewer options for obtaining credit and banking services, and\nI am concerned that today’s guidance could exacerbate this problem. Oddly, while the\nguidance acknowledges this concern, it does not emphasize the obligations banks have\nunder the CRA to help meet the credit needs of the communities in which they do\nbusiness, especially in LMI communities.\n\n- 17 -\nWhile climate change is an important public policy issue in the United States and\nglobally, the Federal Reserve has limited, narrowly focused mandates and responsibilities\nthat are established by statute. These mandates and responsibilities do not extend to\nclimate policymaking.6 Although the climate guidance nominally focuses on climate-\nrelated “financial risks,” I am concerned that the guidance could be used by the Federal\nReserve and other federal banking agencies to pursue climate policies leveraging the\nopacity of the supervisory process, even though such actions would clearly exceed the\nstatutory authorities given to the Board by Congress.\nConclusion\nThe recent volume and materiality of new reforms implemented and under\nconsideration by the federal banking agencies is significant, with nearly 5,000 pages of\nrules and proposals published since July. While the unintended consequences of these\nreforms may not be clear at the outset, our ability to predict these consequences is even\nmore limited when the reforms overlap or conflict. The sheer volume of change presents\nsignificant challenges for banks, who will be required to prioritize the implementation of\nnew and revised requirements, with the risk of being distracted from more material\nconcerns or supervisory issues.\nMy voting record on these proposals is a reflection of my concern about the path\nof regulatory reform, particularly in the wake of the bank failures and banking system\nstress earlier this year, which highlighted that some reforms may be warranted, where\n6 While the climate guidance was released shortly after the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s\npronouncements about net-zero financing and investment, the climate guidance is silent about “net-zero”\ncommitments. See U.S. Department of the Treasury, Principles for Net-Zero Financing & Investment\n(Washington: U.S. Treasury Department, September 2023),\nhttps://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/NetZeroPrinciples.pdf.\n\n- 18 -\nthey address specific problems or clearly identified shortcomings. Regulators, like banks,\nshould never shy away from improving and evolving as the underlying conditions evolve.\nBut taking our focus away from potentially more pressing matters, like interest rate and\nliquidity risk management, could result in supervisors and banks that are less prepared\nand able to deal with emerging stresses.\nIn my view, our regulatory agenda should focus on evolving conditions and data-\ndriven, identified risks. At a time when confidence in public institutions is waning, the\nFederal Reserve should strive to demonstrate beyond doubt that it executes its duties in\nan independent manner, focusing on its statutory obligations. As I’ve discussed today, I\nfear that many of these actions may fall short of this objective.",

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nFed Listens: Exploring Challenges Facing the Childcare Industry,\nWorking Parents, and Employers\nChicago, Illinois\nJuly 10, 2024\n\nThank you, Austan, for the warm welcome. It is really a pleasure to join you in Chicago\nfor this year’s Fed Listens event.1 When we started Fed Listens back in 2019, the initiative was\npart of a broad, comprehensive review of the decisionmaking framework we use to pursue our\nmonetary policy goals of maximum employment and price stability. In the years that followed,\nwe have met with people from across the country and from a wide variety of backgrounds and\nexperiences to learn about how the economy has been recovering from the COVID experience.\nEach Fed Listens event created a wonderful opportunity to take a step back, to ask\nquestions of those who are directly impacted by our policies and the prevailing economic\nconditions, and then really listen to their feedback. I am extremely proud that Fed Listens has\ngrown and developed into an ongoing venue for the Federal Reserve Board and the Reserve\nBanks to foster an ongoing conversation and discussion with those who are directly experiencing\ncurrent economic conditions.\nAs many of you may recall, at last year’s Fed Listens event here in Chicago, we\ndiscussed youth employment and joining the labor force following the pandemic, which were\nespecially inspiring. So, in that spirit, today is not only a wonderful opportunity to continue this\nimportant conversation in the Seventh District, but also an opportunity to dig deeper into issues\nthat affect local families through the childcare industry, working parents, and employers.\nAustan and I enjoyed getting to know our panelists better earlier today, and I am looking\nforward to learning more about their experiences through the upcoming panels and discussions.\nI am also very pleased to welcome our audience—both in person and those tuning in online. I\nview Fed Listens as an excellent example of Board and System convenings that enable us to gain\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nimportant insights about economic conditions by engaging directly with those experiencing the\neconomy.\nAs you all know, Fed officials and economists review a vast amount of economic data on\na regular basis. Discussions like those we will engage in today provide color and context to\nsupplement the other economic data we monitor. Your perspectives help us gain deeper insights\ninto how we are meeting our dual mandate of maintaining maximum employment and stable\nprices.\nA better understanding of a wide variety of this type of data, from the considerations\nfamilies face in making spending decisions (including the costs of childcare) to factors weighed\nby business owners in applying for loans and offering benefits to help attract top talent, all\nprovide better insight into our data collection. These conversations help us to gain perspective\non how Americans in different areas of the country are faring. Some of the issues discussed\ntoday may be unique to the Seventh District, but certainly many of these themes and dynamics\nare present throughout the country and across all 12 Federal Reserve Districts. Seeking out local\nperspectives is one of the great advantages of the Federal Reserve System’s regional structure\nand of the Fed Listens structure in particular.\nEarlier, I had the pleasure to meet each of the panelists you’ll hear from today. Their\nvaried experiences and backgrounds across sectors lay an important foundation for today’s\ndiscussion. We hope that our attendees will also join in to share your own observations as you\nexperience these issues in your own lives, businesses, and communities. Your perspective will\nhelp to inform our work as policymakers with the responsibility to promote a strong and vibrant\neconomy for all Americans.\n\n- 3 -\nSo with that, I would like to say, thank you again, Austan, and especially to recognize\nyour entire Chicago Fed team for hosting this Fed Listens event today and for the opportunity to\nbe part of this discussion.\nWithout further ado, I am delighted to get our conversation started by turning things over\nto Robin Newberger, who is a policy advisor here at the Chicago Fed.",

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n2021 Community Bankers Symposium: Banking on the Future\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\nChicago, Illinois\nOctober 22, 2021\n\nGood morning. I appreciate the opportunity to be part of this symposium on “Banking on\nthe Future,” especially since the future of banking is one of the highest priorities in my work at\nthe Board. Today, I will focus my remarks on the importance of community banks to our\nfinancial system and the challenges they face. In particular, I will focus on the formation of new\nbanks and pose two key questions concerning the recent scarcity of these “de novo” banks.1\nThe first question: Why have there been so few de novo bank formations over the last\ndecade? And second, what can be done to encourage more de novo banks? I will begin with\nsome background on community banks and bank formations.\nThe Importance of Community Banks\nBy serving communities, households, and businesses that may be underserved by larger\ninstitutions, community banks play a key role in advancing diversification in the U.S. banking\nsystem. First and foremost, community banks provide critical financial services to their\ncommunities and to many customers who might have limited geographic access to banking\nservices. Because community bankers are active participants and leaders in their communities,\nthey typically know their customers and their needs better than a banker at a branch of a larger\ninstitution. Community banks draw upon this knowledge and conduct “relationship” lending\nversus relying on automated underwriting models that are typical in larger institutions.\nTherefore, community banks are more willing to underwrite loans to creditworthy customers\nbased on an assessment of qualitative factors that automated models do not consider. Since\ncommunity bankers are part of the fabric of their communities, they better understand the local\nmarket and economic conditions in the area compared to larger institutions that are not resident\nwithin the community.\n1 In general, an insured depository institution is in the de novo phase if it has been operating for three years or less.\n\nCollectively, community banks are critical in advancing the health and stability of the\nU.S. economy as evidenced by their participation in the Small Business Administration’s\nPaycheck Protection Program (PPP). Community banks made 4.7 million PPP loans, totaling\n$429 billion, which accounted for nearly 60 percent of the program’s total loan amount.2 In\ncomparison with the banking industry as a whole, these banks provided more loans to\ntraditionally underserved communities and population segments: community banks provided\n87 percent of total PPP loans to minority-owned businesses, 81 percent to women-owned\nbusinesses, and 69 percent to veteran-owned businesses.3\nTrends in Community Banking\nDespite the local and national significance of community banks, their numbers, as well as\nthe number of insured banks in general, have been declining for several years.4 This erosion of\ncommunity bank charters is not just an issue in our rural communities. In urban areas, these\nbanks, including minority-owned banks, serve businesses and households that may also be\noverlooked by larger institutions. I am concerned that the contraction of community banks could\nlead to an unhealthy level of similarity in the banking system. As a result, this could limit the\nability of households and small businesses to access credit and other types of financial products\nand services. The beauty of community banks is in their differences—whether in their\npersonality or business model. Each is unique in its mission, service delivery, and profile.\nWhile I am troubled by the declining community bank footprint, I am not surprised that\nbanks are choosing to merge or to be acquired. I am well aware of the significant challenges that\n2 See the Independent Community Bankers of America (ICBA), “Community Banks Made 60 Percent of PPP Loans\nto Small Businesses,” news release, September 1, 2021, https://www.icba.org/newsroom/news-and-\narticles/2021/09/01/icba-to-congress-ppp-forgiveness-should-be-straightforward.\n3 ICBA, “Community Banks.”\n4 From 2011 to 2019, there has been a 30 percent decline in the number of community banks, whereas the number of\nlarger banks has declined by more than 36 percent. See the FDIC Community Banking Study (December 2020) at\nhttps://www.fdic.gov/resources/community-banking/report/2020/2020-cbi-study-full.pdf.\n\nsmaller banks face. Since joining the Board, and increasingly over the past year, I have met with\nmany state member bank CEOs who share these challenges with me. These CEOs have\nexpressed frustrations with ever-increasing compliance burden, which distracts their attention\nfrom prudent revenue generating activities.\nAs I discussed in recent remarks at the community bank research conference in late\nSeptember, public policymakers must avoid adding regulatory burden on the smallest banks,\nparticularly on those that maintain a more traditional business model.5 Therefore, policymakers\nneed to achieve a meaningful balance in our supervisory approach for community banks.\nOtherwise, community banks will continue to face a regulatory and supervisory framework that\nis ill-suited for a lower-risk profile and activities that are less complex than those of larger\ninstitutions.\nWhy Have There Been So Few De Novo Bank Formations over the Last Decade?\nThe underlying question remains: why have there been so few de novo bank formations\nover the last decade?\nThere have been only a handful of new bank charter applications over the past decade. In\nfact, only 44 de novo banks have been established, which include both state and national\ncharters. A 2014 study by Federal Reserve Board economists noted that from 1990 to 2008, over\n2,000 new banks were formed, which on average is more than 100 per year.6 In contrast, the\nstudy noted that only seven new banks were formed from 2009 to 2013. The 2014 Board study\n5 Michelle W. Bowman, “Creating a New Model for the Future of Supervision” (speech at the Community Banking\nin the 21st Century Research and Policy Conference, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, September 28, 2021),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20210928a.htm.\n6 Robert M. Adams and Jacob P. Gramlich, “Where Are All the New Banks? The Role of Regulatory Burden in\nNew Charter Creation,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2014-113 (Washington: Board of Governors of\nthe Federal Reserve System, December 2014 (revised July 2016)),\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/feds/2014/files/2014113pap.pdf.\n\nsuggests that “low interest rates and depressed demand for banking services—both of which\ndepress profit for banks, and particularly new banks—may also have discouraged entry.”7\nThe conclusions from a Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City study completed this year\nalign with observations from the 2014 Board study. In this more recent study, the authors noted\nthat new bank formations tend to be cyclical, accelerating during periods of economic expansion\nand slowing during recessions.8 While regulatory burden has also contributed to depressed de\nnovo formations, the authors pointed to the weak economy following the 2007-2009 financial\ncrisis and low profitability for banking as overriding factors.\nA recurring theme that has surfaced through my discussions with bankers and other\nindustry stakeholders is the regulatory burden imposed upon de novo banks. In particular,\ncommunity bankers noted the challenges in raising the capital required to establish a new bank.\nThe 2014 Board study noted that the states’ statutory capital requirements for a new state-\nchartered bank could be as low as $10 million, but in practice could be as high as $30 million.9\nGiven the high initial capital requirement, a de novo bank has a small margin of error in\nimplementing its business strategy and meeting profit projections.\nIn establishing a new bank, bank executives explained the challenges in developing a\nbusiness plan and risk-management framework that addresses how the bank can generate a\nsufficient profit to provide an adequate return to shareholders. For a de novo bank, the cost and\nburden of starting from ground zero in establishing their risk-management and internal controls\nare high. De novo banks make strategic decisions in establishing risk-management processes\n7 Adams and Gramlich, “Where Are All the New Banks?”\n8 Matt Hanauer, Brent Lytle, Chris Summers, and Stephanie Ziadeh. “Community Banks’ Ongoing Role in the U.S.\nEconomy,” Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Economic Review 106, no. 2 (June 24, 2021),\nhttps://www.kansascityfed.org/research/economic-review/community-banks-ongoing-role-in-the-us-economy/.\n9 Adams and Gramlich, “Where Are All the New Banks?”\n\nand controls that may delay the launch of revenue-generating products and services. Further, a\nde novo bank faces the pressure to grow quickly, which in turn, may lead to riskier lending and\nother activities. Indeed, experience has shown that pronounced problems often surface in the\nearly years of a de novo bank’s operations, which explains the elevated capital and supervisory\nexpectations for these banks. The Federal Reserve and the other banking agencies generally\nexpect a de novo bank to maintain a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 8 percent for the first three\nyears of its existence and they examine the bank on a more frequent schedule.10\nFor a de novo bank, there is a heightened need to hire experienced staff who are quickly\nable to establish the bank and show progress in meeting the operating goals and profit\nprojections in the business plan. As we all know, difficulty in finding skilled workers is an issue\nmore broadly in the economy, but community bankers frequently tell me of their ongoing\nchallenges in attracting and retaining experienced staff. These challenges are even more acute\nfor de novo banks who require staff with experience in regulatory compliance and internal\ncontrols.\nA Kansas City Reserve Banks study echoes these anecdotes, which indicate that the\nvolume and complexity of regulations require specialized expertise that can be costly and\ndifficult to find.11\nThe competitive landscape for financial services and products is also a key consideration\nin developing and executing a de novo bank’s business plan. I often hear the perspective from\nbankers that non-regulated financial entities have a competitive advantage over regulated\n10 See Supervision and Regulation (SR) letter 20-16, “Supervision of De Novo State Member Banks,” at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/srletters/SR2016.htm. This guidance on the supervision of de novo\nbanks aimed to promote transparency and timeliness in the supervision of these banks. Further, SR-20-16 aligned\nthe Federal Reserve’s definition of a de novo bank with that of the other agencies. All agencies now consider a bank\nto be in the de novo phase if it has been operating for three years or less.\n11 Hanauer, Lytle, Summers, and Ziadeh. “Community Banks’ Ongoing Role in the U.S. Economy.”\n\nfinancial institutions in providing financial services and products. It would be helpful to\nappropriately acknowledge this competitive disadvantage for banks and tailor the regulatory\nframework based on the risks and complexity of their activities.\nAs a result, the economic, regulatory, and market realities discourage the formation of de\nnovo banks, as investors have many other options for entry into the financial services market.\nFor example, they may choose to acquire an existing bank charter and subsequently establish\nbranches in new markets. Further, they can acquire a branch office from an existing bank. And\nfinally, they may choose to establish or acquire a nonbank financial firm that is subject to less\nregulation than a chartered and insured financial institution.\nWhat Can Be Done to Encourage More De Novo Banks?\nSo, let’s address the second question: what can be done to encourage more de novo\nbanks?\nSimply the fact that I am speaking about this topic today should give you the sense that I\nam concerned about the impact of the declining number of community banks. While the loss of\na single community bank may be inconsequential to U.S. financial stability, that loss may have\nprofound consequences to households and businesses in that community. This is particularly\ntrue in rural communities and remote areas and in certain urban areas when the loss of the local\nbank may leave customers in a banking desert, void of tangible, relationship-based financial\nservices.\nBut we should also be concerned about how a continued decline in the number of\ncommunity banks, in part due to the lack of de novo formations, will affect the banking and\nfinancial services system more broadly. When banking services are limited, it is much more\ndifficult for people to fully participate in the economy, or to manage their finances when times\n\nare tough. A shrinking community bank sector may lead to a weaker banking system and weaker\neconomy.\nIt is crucial to provide a balanced, transparent, and effective regulatory framework that\npromotes a vibrant community bank sector. Public policymakers need to ensure that the\nregulatory and supervisory framework promotes safety and soundness, while recognizing the\nreduced risk of these banks’ noncomplex services and activities. As large institutions and\nnonregulated financial companies expand their reach into markets traditionally served by\ncommunity banks, policymakers need to ensure that the regulatory and supervisory framework\ndoes not exacerbate this competitive disadvantage.\nIf we are not able to achieve an appropriate balance, I am concerned that there will\ncontinue to be fewer de novo banks as well as a decline in the overall population of community\nbanks. These banks are a key segment of the industry in that they provide financial services and\nproducts to a wide range of consumers and businesses. Looking to the future, policymakers need\nto appropriately refine the regulatory and supervisory framework to minimize unnecessary\ncompliance costs for smaller banks and address impediments to bank formations.\nClosing\nIn conclusion, I have raised two important questions about why there so few de novo\nbanks and what can be done to encourage new bank formations. It is important for us to fully\nunderstand why we have seen the steady decline in bank formations, and to continue to explore\nways to encourage community banks in such a competitive environment. Identifying answers to\nthese questions should enable the federal banking agencies to identify potential regulatory and\npolicy constraints on the formation of new banks. To further this effort, I have asked Federal\nReserve staff to continue to study trends in community banking so that we can fully understand\n\nthe economic and regulatory factors that constrain the ability of community banks to form,\ncompete, and thrive.\nI appreciate the opportunity to raise these questions with you. And I look forward to\nfurther discussions about tailoring our regulatory and supervisory framework to ensure that\ncommunity banks remain an essential part of the future of the U.S. financial system.",

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe Chicago Booth Initiative on Global Markets\nWorkshop on Market Dysfunction\nChicago, Illinois\nMarch 3, 2023\n\nThanks, Anil. It’s a pleasure to be with you today and to be part of this discussion\non how central banks can support the effective functioning of financial markets.1\nFinancial stability is essential for a well-functioning economy. A financial system\nis considered stable when its markets and institutions are resilient and able to function\neven following a severe shock. The Federal Reserve monitors risks to financial stability\nand uses its supervisory and regulatory tools to mitigate the risks and consequences of\nfinancial instability. During periods of financial system stress, the Federal Reserve can\nuse additional tools, such as lending facilities and open market operations, to directly\nsupport the effective functioning of key financial markets and the flow of credit\nthroughout the economy.\nThe onset of the global pandemic in the spring of 2020 was a severe shock both to\nfinancial markets and to the U.S. economy, and the Federal Reserve responded forcefully\nto support market functioning and the flow of credit. To address the liquidity strains in\nTreasury and repo markets, the Fed directly purchased large amounts of Treasury\nsecurities and conducted term and overnight repo operations using the FOMC’s open\nmarket operations authority. To address strains in other markets, with the backing of the\nU.S. Treasury, the Fed used its 13(3) emergency lending authority to establish a number\nof facilities to support the flow of credit to households, businesses, and communities.2\n1 These remarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 The Fed also used its open market operations authority to purchase agency residential and commercial\nmortgage-backed securities and conducted repo operations with an expanded set of global counterparties.\nSome of the 13(3) facilities were versions of those that had been used during the 2008 financial crisis and\nothers were new, such as corporate credit facilities, which directly purchased corporate bonds to support the\nflow of credit to the economy. All 13(3) lending facilities require the approval of the Secretary of the\nTreasury. For further details, see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2021), “Funding,\nCredit, Liquidity, and Loan Facilities,” webpage, https://www.federalreserve.gov/funding-credit-liquidity-\nand-loan-facilities.htm.\n\n- 2 -\nThe Federal Reserve also took a number of other actions, including easing terms on\ndiscount window lending and supervisory and regulatory actions, to encourage banks to\nlend and act as market intermediaries.3\nThe Fed’s actions were effective in restoring financial market functioning, but the\nchannels through which they operated varied. Significant asset purchases and take-up of\nthe Fed’s repo operations were required to restore smooth functioning in Treasury\nmarkets because of the liquidity needs of a wide swath of investors. By comparison,\nmany of the 13(3) lending facilities saw relatively limited take-up, but they helped\nsupport market functioning and the supply of credit in the targeted markets by offering a\nbackstop and bolstering investor confidence.4\nThe pandemic lending programs that experienced more usage saw a decline in use\nas market functioning was restored, which is a key benefit of lending programs compared\nwith asset purchases. Moreover, shorter-term loans under these programs were relatively\nquick to roll off the Fed’s balance sheet. In fact, most of the lending programs expired by\nlate 2020. And some of the emergency securities purchase programs, such as the\nSecondary Market Corporate Credit Facility, sold the securities they had purchased\nduring their wind-down phases.\nThe pandemic experience demonstrated the effectiveness of lending programs\ndesigned to serve as backstops to support market functioning and the flow of credit in\ntimes of stress. The temporary nature of loans from lending facilities activated only\n3 For a further description of these actions, see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2021),\n“Supervisory and Regulatory Actions in Response to COVID-19,” webpage,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisory-regulatory-action-response-covid-19.htm.\n4 For a discussion of the 13(3) lending facilities and their usage, see Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System (2020), Financial Stability Report (Washington: Board of Governors, November),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/financial-stability-report-20201109.pdf.\n\n- 3 -\nunder financial market stress adds to the attractiveness of these tools. Lending programs\nare most effective as backstops when loans are offered at a penalty rate and are of short\nduration. When appropriately calibrated, lending programs can help promote market\nfunctioning but limit the Federal Reserve’s overall footprint in financial markets in the\nlonger term.\nThe pandemic experience illustrated that liquidity strains can sometimes be so\nsevere that targeted purchases of the affected assets may be the most effective tool to\nquickly support market functioning, as was the case in Treasury markets in the spring of\n2020. In taking this step, a key issue for central banks to consider is how to clearly\ndistinguish asset purchases from the central bank’s monetary policy actions.5 This would\nbe especially important during a period of monetary policy tightening, as we are currently\nexperiencing. A related issue is how to minimize the Fed’s footprint and amount of asset\npurchases needed to restore market functioning. A further consideration is how to\nconstruct and communicate an exit strategy to reduce the enlarged balance sheet over\ntime.\nFinally, while it is important to consider the design of central bank tools to\naddress future episodes of severe financial market dysfunction, it is also important for\ncentral banks and other agencies to ensure that regulations and market oversight foster\nprudent financial institution behavior and resiliency in core financial markets. Doing so\ncan increase the ability of private markets and institutions to function during times of\nstress and reduce the likelihood of future market interventions by the central bank. In this\n5 This issue is most relevant when the assets purchases are those that the Fed can purchase using its open\nmarket operations authority, including Treasury and agency debt and agency-backed mortgage-backed\nsecurities. Programs to purchase other types of debt would need the approval of the Secretary of the\nTreasury under section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act.\n\n- 4 -\nregard, it is important for the Federal Reserve to engage along with the other agencies in\na thoughtful consideration of possible regulatory adjustments and structural reforms to\nincrease the resiliency of the Treasury markets and reduce the likelihood of future market\ndysfunction.6\nThank you, again, for the opportunity to chair this panel. I look forward to our\ndiscussion.\n6 For a discussion of potential reforms, see Inter-Agency Working Group on Treasury Market Surveillance\n(2021), Recent Disruptions and Potential Reforms in the U.S. Treasury Market: A Staff Progress Report\n(Washington: U.S. Department of the Treasury, November),\nhttps://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/IAWG-Treasury-Report.pdf; and Inter-Agency Working Group\non Treasury Market Surveillance (2022), Enhancing the Resilience of the U.S. Treasury Market: 2022 Staff\nProgress Report (Washington: U.S. Department of the Treasury, November),\nhttps://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/2022-IAWG-Treasury-Report.pdf.",

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nMid-Size Bank Coalition of America Board of Directors Workshop\nDallas, Texas\nSeptember 26, 2024\n\nGood morning. I would like to thank the Mid-Size Bank Coalition of America for the\ninvitation to join you today for the Board of Directors Workshop.1 I appreciate the opportunity\nto share my views on the U.S. economy and monetary policy before we engage on bank\nsupervisory and regulatory issues and other matters affecting the banking industry.\nIn light of last week’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, I will begin\nmy remarks by providing some perspective on my vote and will then share my current views on\nthe economy and monetary policy.\nUpdate on the Most Recent FOMC Meeting\nIn order to address high inflation, for more than two years, the FOMC increased and held\nthe federal funds rate at a restrictive level. At our September meeting, the FOMC voted to lower\nthe target range for the federal funds rate by 1/2 percentage point to 4-3/4 to 5 percent and to\ncontinue reducing the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings.\nAs the post-meeting statement noted, I dissented from the FOMC’s decision, preferring\ninstead to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point to 5 to\n5-1/4 percent. Last Friday, once our FOMC participant communications blackout period\nconcluded, the Board of Governors released my statement explaining the decision to depart from\nthe majority of the voting members. I agreed with the Committee’s assessment that, given the\nprogress we have seen since the middle of 2023 on both lowering inflation and cooling the labor\nmarket, it was appropriate to reflect this progress by recalibrating the level of the federal funds\nrate and begin the process of moving toward a more neutral stance of policy. As my statement\n1 The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee or the Board of Governors.\n\n- 2 -\nnotes, I preferred a smaller initial cut in the policy rate while the U.S. economy remains strong\nand inflation remains a concern, despite recent progress.\nEconomic Conditions and Outlook\nIn recent months, we have seen some further progress on slowing the pace of inflation,\nwith monthly readings lower than the elevated pace seen in the first three months of the year.\nThe 12-month measure of core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation, which\nprovides a broader perspective than the more volatile higher-frequency readings, has moved\ndown since April, although it came in at 2.6 percent in July, again remaining well above our\n2 percent goal. In addition, the latest consumer and producer price index reports suggest that\n12-month core PCE inflation in August was likely a touch above the July reading. The\npersistently high core inflation largely reflects pressures on housing prices, perhaps due in part to\nlow inventories of affordable housing. The progress in lowering inflation since April is a\nwelcome development, but core inflation is still uncomfortably above the Committee’s 2 percent\ngoal.\nPrices remain much higher than before the pandemic, which continues to weigh on\nconsumer sentiment. Higher prices have an outsized effect on lower- and moderate-income\nhouseholds, as these households devote a significantly larger share of income to food, energy,\nand housing. Prices for these spending categories have far outpaced overall inflation over the\npast few years.\nEconomic growth moderated earlier this year after coming in stronger last year. Private\ndomestic final purchases (PDFP) growth has been solid and slowed much less than gross\ndomestic product (GDP), as the slowdown in GDP growth was partly driven by volatile\ncategories including net exports, suggesting that underlying economic growth was stronger than\n\n- 3 -\nGDP indicated. PDFP has continued to increase at a solid pace so far in the third quarter, despite\nsome further weakening in housing activity, as retail sales have shown further robust gains in\nJuly and August.\nAlthough personal consumption has remained resilient, consumers appear to be pulling\nback on discretionary items and expenses, as evidenced in part by a decline in restaurant\nspending since late last year. Low- and moderate-income consumers no longer have extra\nsavings to support this type of spending, and we have seen loan delinquency rates normalize\nfrom historically low levels during the pandemic.\nThe most recent labor market report shows that payroll employment gains have slowed\nappreciably to a pace moderately above 100,000 per month over the three months ending in\nAugust. The unemployment rate edged down to 4.2 percent in August from 4.3 percent in July.\nWhile unemployment is notably higher than a year ago, it is still at a historically low level and\nbelow my and the Congressional Budget Office’s estimates of full employment.\nThe labor market has loosened from the extremely tight conditions of the past few years.\nThe ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers has declined further to a touch below the\nhistorically elevated pre-pandemic level—a sign that the number of available workers and the\nnumber of available jobs have come into better balance. But there are still more available jobs\nthan available workers, a condition that before 2018 has only occurred twice for a prolonged\nperiod since World War II, further signaling ongoing labor market strength despite the reported\ndata.\nAlthough wage growth has slowed further in recent months, it remains indicative of a\ntight labor market. At just under 4 percent, as measured by both the employment cost index and\n\n- 4 -\naverage hourly earnings, wage gains are still above the pace consistent with our inflation goal\ngiven trend productivity growth.\nThe rise in the unemployment rate this year largely reflects weaker hiring, as job seekers\nentering or re-entering the labor force are taking longer to find work, while layoffs remain low.\nIn addition to some cooling in labor demand, there are other factors likely contributing the\nincreased unemployment. A mismatch between the skills of the new workers and available jobs\ncould further raise unemployment, suggesting that higher unemployment has been partly driven\nby the stronger supply of workers. It is also likely that some temporary factors contributed to the\nrecent rise in the unemployment rate, as unemployment among working age teenagers sharply\nincreased in August.\nPreference for a More Measured Recalibration of Policy\nThe U.S. economy remains strong and core inflation remains uncomfortably above our\n2 percent target. In light of these economic conditions, a few further considerations supported\nthe case for a more measured approach in beginning the process to recalibrate our policy stance\nto remove restriction and move toward a more neutral setting.\nFirst, I was concerned that reducing the target range for the federal funds rate by\n1/2 percentage point could be interpreted as a signal that the Committee sees some fragility or\ngreater downside risks to the economy. In the current economic environment, with no clear\nsigns of material weakening or fragility, in my view, beginning the rate-cutting cycle with a\n1/4 percentage point move would have better reinforced the strength in economic conditions,\nwhile also confidently recognizing progress toward our goals. In my mind, a more measured\napproach would have avoided the risk of unintentionally signaling concerns about underlying\neconomic conditions.\n\n- 5 -\nSecond, I was also concerned that reducing the policy rate by 1/2 percentage point could\nhave led market participants to expect that the Committee would lower the target range by that\nsame pace at future meetings until the policy rate approaches a neutral level. If this expectation\nhad materialized, we could have seen an unwarranted decline in longer-term interest rates and\nbroader financial conditions could become overly accommodative. This outcome could work\nagainst the Committee’s goal of returning inflation to our 2 percent target.\nI am pleased that Chair Powell directly addressed both of these concerns during the press\nconference following last week’s FOMC meeting.\nThird, there continues to be a considerable amount of pent-up demand and cash on the\nsidelines ready to be deployed as the path of interest rates moves down. Bringing the policy rate\ndown too quickly carries the risk of unleashing that pent-up demand. A more measured approach\nwould also avoid unnecessarily stoking demand and potentially reigniting inflationary pressures.\nFinally, in dialing back our restrictive stance of policy, we also need to be mindful of\nwhat the end point is likely to be. My estimate of the neutral rate is much higher than it was\nbefore the pandemic. Therefore, I think we are much closer to neutral than would have been the\ncase under pre-pandemic conditions, and I did not see the peak stance of policy as restrictive to\nthe same extent that my colleagues may have. With a higher estimate of neutral, for any given\npace of rate reductions, we would arrive at our destination sooner.\nOngoing Risks to the Outlook\nTurning to the risks to achieving our dual mandate, I continue to see greater risks to price\nstability, especially while the labor market continues to be near estimates of full employment.\nAlthough the labor market data have been showing signs of cooling in recent months, still-\nelevated wage growth, solid consumer spending, and resilient GDP growth are not consistent\n\n- 6 -\nwith a material economic weakening or fragility. My contacts also continue to mention that they\nare not planning layoffs and continue to have difficulty hiring. Therefore, I am taking less signal\nfrom the recent labor market data until there are clear trends indicating that both spending\ngrowth and the labor market have materially weakened. I suspect the recent immigration flows\nhave and will continue to affect labor markets in ways that we do not yet fully understand and\ncannot yet accurately measure. In light of the dissonance created by conflicting economic\nsignals, measurement challenges, and data revisions, I remain cautious about taking signal from\nonly a limited set of real-time data releases.\nIn my view, the upside risks to inflation remain prominent. Global supply chains\ncontinue to be susceptible to labor strikes and increased geopolitical tensions, which could result\nin inflationary effects on food, energy, and other commodity markets. Expansionary fiscal\nspending could also lead to inflationary risks, as could an increased demand for housing given\nthe long-standing limited supply, especially of affordable housing. While it has not been my\nbaseline outlook, I cannot rule out the risk that progress on inflation could continue to stall.\nAlthough it is important to recognize that there has been meaningful progress on\nlowering inflation, while core inflation remains around or above 2.5 percent, I see the risk that\nthe Committee’s larger policy action could be interpreted as a premature declaration of victory\non our price-stability mandate. Accomplishing our mission of returning to low and stable\ninflation at our 2 percent goal is necessary to foster a strong labor market and an economy that\nworks for everyone in the longer term.\nIn light of these considerations, I believe that, by moving at a measured pace toward a\nmore neutral policy stance, we will be better positioned to achieve further progress in bringing\n\n- 7 -\ninflation down to our 2 percent target, while closely watching the evolution of labor market\nconditions.\nThe Path Forward\nDespite my dissent at the recent FOMC meeting, I respect and appreciate that my FOMC\ncolleagues preferred to begin the reduction in the federal funds rate with a larger initial cut in the\ntarget range for the policy rate. I remain committed to working together with my colleagues to\nensure that monetary policy is appropriately positioned to achieve our goals of attaining\nmaximum employment and returning inflation to our 2 percent target.\nI will continue to monitor the incoming data and information as I assess the appropriate\npath of monetary policy, and I will remain cautious in my approach to adjusting the stance of\npolicy going forward. It is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course. My\ncolleagues and I will make our decisions at each FOMC meeting based on the incoming data and\nthe implications for and risks to the outlook guided by the Fed’s dual-mandate goals of\nmaximum employment and stable prices. We need to ensure that the public understands clearly\nhow current and expected deviations of inflation and employment from our mandated goals\ninform our policy decisions.\nBy the time of our next meeting in November, we will have received updated reports on\ninflation, employment, and economic activity. We may also have a better understanding of how\ndevelopments in longer-term interest rates and broader financial conditions might influence the\neconomic outlook.\nDuring the intermeeting period, I will continue to visit with a broad range of contacts to\ndiscuss economic conditions as I assess the appropriateness of our monetary policy stance. As\nI noted earlier, I continue to view inflation as a concern. In light of the upside risks that I just\n\n- 8 -\ndescribed, it remains necessary to pay close attention to the price-stability side of our mandate\nwhile being attentive to the risks of a material weakening in the labor market. My view\ncontinues to be that restoring price stability is essential for achieving maximum employment\nover the longer run. However, should the data evolve in a way that points to a material\nweakening in the labor market, I would support taking action and adjust monetary policy as\nneeded while taking into account our inflation mandate.\nClosing Thoughts\nIn closing, thank you again for welcoming me here today. It is a pleasure to join you and\nto have the opportunity to discuss my views on the economy and monetary policy. And given\nthe recent FOMC meeting decision and my dissent, I appreciate being able to provide a more\ndetailed explanation of the reasoning that led me to dissent in favor of a smaller reduction in the\npolicy rate at last week’s FOMC meeting.\nI look forward to answering your questions and to engaging with your members on bank\nregulatory and supervisory matters.",

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nTexas Bankers Association 2024 Annual Meeting\nArlington, Texas\nMay 10, 2024\n\nI would like to thank the Texas Bankers Association for the invitation to share my\nthoughts with you at this year’s Annual Meeting.1 My remarks today focus on financial stability\nand the role of banking regulators in promoting financial stability and resiliency in the financial\nsystem.2 I will also describe principles that are complementary to promoting safety and\nsoundness—to help inform the regulatory and supervisory agenda.\nOf course, it would be difficult to provide an exhaustive list of the financial stability risks\nfacing the financial system in the time we are together today. So, while I will highlight a few\nkey risks, one must approach this topic with humility, acknowledging that there are limits to a\nregulator’s ability to anticipate every possible financial stability risk in a dynamic and\nincreasingly interconnected world.\nFinancial stability is an important function of the Federal Reserve. Our financial stability\nfunction is supported through appropriate monetary policy, bank supervision and regulation, and\nby monitoring risks in the U.S. and abroad. A stable financial system provides a solid\nfoundation for a healthy banking system and a growing economy that facilitates maximum\nemployment and stable prices. The Fed’s recently published Financial Stability Report discusses\nfinancial stability risks in terms of interactions between shocks and vulnerabilities. A financial\nstability shock is an adverse event or series of events that often occur without warning and\nseverely affect the financial system. A financial stability vulnerability includes a specific\ncharacteristic of, or activity conducted in, the financial system that can increase the severity of a\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 See Michelle W. Bowman, “Financial Stability in Uncertain Times,” (speech at The Reinventing Bretton Woods\nCommittee and Policy Center for the New South Marrakech Economic Festival, Marrakech, Morocco, October 11,\n2023), https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20231011a.pdf.\n\n- 2 -\nstress event when a shock occurs.3 Since shocks are difficult to predict, the Federal Reserve’s\nmonitoring efforts primarily focus on vulnerabilities and the buildup of risks that can accrue over\ntime potentially affecting the resiliency of the financial system.\nThe Financial Stability Report is worth a read. And while I will not recite the many\nfindings of that report today, I will highlight a few of the risks discussed in the report. It is\nimportant to keep in mind that the report provides only a snapshot of the current financial\nstability vulnerabilities and risks. Because the report treats cyberattacks and geopolitical events\nas shocks, it touches on them only in a cursory way, even though these are important financial\nstability risks. Instead, the report focuses on key vulnerabilities that are more easily monitored\nand provides insights into the financial stability outlook as it relates to these factors.\nWhile the framing of the Financial Stability Report—in terms of shocks and\nvulnerabilities—can be a useful, structured approach to consider this topic, there are many ways\nto think about financial stability. Often the boundary between shocks and vulnerabilities is a\npermeable one, and the buildup of risk can become so severe that it becomes a shock. The\nFederal Reserve plays an important—but limited and non-exclusive—role in proactively\naddressing financial stability risks and responding to them once they manifest as stress across the\nsystem.\nAs I think about the tools we use to address financial stability concerns—and the\ntradeoffs we are often forced to make when exercising these powers—it is helpful to consider the\nlessons regulators have learned over time. While the end goal is the same—ensuring resiliency\n3 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Financial Stability Report (Washington: Board of\nGovernors, April, 2024), https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/financial-stability-report-20240419.pdf.\n\n- 3 -\nin the financial system to promote financial stability—there are a number of tools that can be\nused to address the unique characteristics of vulnerabilities and shocks.\nThe Federal Reserve’s financial stability monitoring does not operate in a vacuum. To\nthe contrary, our other statutory authorities—including monetary policy or promoting safety and\nsoundness in the banking system—can complement or conflict with the goal of promoting\nfinancial stability. Many of these authorities interact with banking activities and institutions that\nare subject to our supervisory or regulatory authority.\nIn light of this, I will begin by discussing how the use of traditional tools to support\nsafety and soundness—both regulation and supervision—can help promote financial stability. I\nwill then describe the limits of these tools, and then conclude with a brief discussion of some\nother key financial stability risks.\nFinancial Stability and the Role of Regulators\nThe Federal Reserve plays an important but limited role in promoting the stability of the\nfinancial system through resiliency to shocks, and by proactively addressing vulnerabilities. This\nresponsibility can be complemented and supported, or in some cases weakened through the\nexecution of the Federal Reserve’s other responsibilities, including monetary policy or the\nexercise of our emergency authorities. At times, these objectives may appear to present tension\nor be in conflict.\nFor example, the banking stress last year resulted from a number of underlying causes.\nBut it is clear that trends in the interest rate environment when the Federal Open Market\nCommittee’s (FOMC) was rapidly tightening policy to combat inflation were an important factor\nthat contributed to Silicon Valley Bank’s (SVB’s) failure. The Federal Reserve’s documented\n\n- 4 -\nsupervisory shortcomings and the lack of SVB management attention to these risks were also key\ncontributors to the firm’s failure.\nTo be sure, the role of monetary policy in the demise of SVB does not excuse SVB’s\nmanagement from its inability to manage the firm’s interest rate risk exposures or excuse the\nineffective supervisory response that enabled the buildup of the firm’s excessive risk. And I am\nnot calling into question the FOMC’s monetary policy decisions from that time, which were\nappropriately focused on our congressionally established mandates of maximum employment\nand stable prices. Instead, these issues highlight the challenging interrelationships of the various\nroles and functions of the Federal Reserve.\nThis becomes more complicated when we consider the Federal Reserve’s financial\nstability objectives in the context of its prudential mandates to promote the safe and sound\noperation of regulated financial institutions. The tools of bank regulation and supervision can\npromote the safety and soundness of individual financial institutions, but they can also be a\npositive force when it comes to financial stability. When regulators are successful in their task\nof ensuring the safe and sound operation of the banking system—one of the core mandates for\nbanking regulators—often there is a corresponding benefit to financial stability. Put another\nway, if the individual parts of the banking system are healthy, this often promotes the health and\nstability of the broader financial system.\nBut the goal of promoting bank safety and soundness is narrowly focused within the\nregulatory perimeter—and the institutions and activities within our regulatory and supervisory\nauthority. By contrast, financial stability must be concerned with the broader financial system,\nincluding the multitude of nonbank institutions that play an important role not only in delivering\nfinancial products and services, but also in the broader U.S. economy.\n\n- 5 -\nSo today, I’d like to share three principles that can help frame a discussion of the role of\nbanking regulators in promoting financial stability:\n1. Bank supervision can be an effective and efficient tool to promote financial\nstability. It is important that supervisors focus on core banking risks.\n2. Where bank regulation may create or exacerbate financial stability risks, we need\nto take a hard look at whether those risks are justified by the safety-and-soundness\nbenefits of the regulation.\n3. As we evaluate the merits of bank regulation and supervision, we must consider\nhow the Federal Reserve’s regulatory proposals affect markets and institutions\nbeyond the bank regulatory perimeter. This will enable us to better understand\nthe potential unintended consequences.\nThere is value in our current approach to addressing financial stability risks. We monitor\nrisks and how they build up or manifest as stress in the financial system. And we react in a way\nthat is informed by that monitoring, either to proactively address the buildup of risk, or to\naddress the consequences of events that could threaten financial stability. A review of past\nevents that presented stability concerns can help us evaluate our existing work and inform the\ndirection of future investments.\nEffective Bank Supervision to Promote Financial Stability\nFirst, bank supervision can be an effective and efficient tool to promote financial\nstability. I think it is helpful to consider commercial real estate (CRE) as an example. 4\nCommercial real estate continues to be an area of focus for both banks and regulators. Some\nbanks have experienced an increase in CRE loan delinquencies, although delinquency rates\n4 See Financial Stability Report, 11–12.\n\n- 6 -\ngenerally remain low. As we know, one of the factors that has led to CRE stress in certain\nproperty types, like office, is the post-pandemic changes in the demand for, and use of, these\nCRE properties. Should this trend continue, we could see declines in property values, reduced\nrental income cash flows, or other conditions that could lead to impairment of some banks’ CRE\nloans or portfolios, especially if those loans mature and are refinanced at higher interest rates. I\nexpect we will continue to see material differences in the performance of CRE across the various\ntypes of commercial property and in specific geographic regions. This will be due, in part, to\nvariations in regional return-to-office patterns, and the shifting demand for different types of\nCRE properties.\nSo, what can we learn from this CRE experience? First, supervision can be an effective\ntool to mitigate vulnerabilities, like the increasing credit risk associated with certain kinds of\nlending. Underwriting standards and loan-to-value ratios have improved significantly since the\n2008–09 financial crisis, and more recently we have seen credit conditions for CRE lending\ntighten, even as loan demand weakened. I see this as reflecting both better management of these\nloans and portfolios, and more proactive supervision of material risk.5 Banks are also well-\nequipped to work with their CRE borrowers to mitigate stress, including through loan\naccommodations and workouts.6 Supervision can be particularly effective at addressing well-\nknown, core banking risks, especially when this supervisory work is conducted effectively and\nwithout being distracted by non-core risks.\n5 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, April 2024 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank\nLending Practices, Questions on commercial real estate lending section (May 6, 2024),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/data/documents/sloos-202404.pdf.\n6 See Supervision and Regulation Letter 23-5, “Prudent Commercial Real Estate Loan Accommodations and\nWorkouts,” June 30, 2023, https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/srletters/SR2305.pdf.\n\n- 7 -\nDespite the promise of supervision as a tool to promote financial stability, supervision\ncan sometimes fail to address the significant buildup of traditional risk. And supervision can be\nsusceptible to being diverted from core risks to issues of less material concern. For example,\ntake the dynamics that led to the failure of SVB. The buildup of interest rate risk in the banking\nsystem was a known vulnerability and material risk, not just for SVB, but for all financial\ninstitutions. The responsibility for managing this risk fell on the management team at SVB, just\nas it falls on every bank that has material exposure to interest rate risk. And yet, the failure of\nSVB created something of a “shock” event within the banking system, one that led to a vigorous\nresponse with the creation of the Bank Term Funding Program and invoking the systemic risk\nexemption to guarantee all depositors of SVB and Signature Bank.\nI think it is an oversimplification to point to any one factor as the root cause of the failure\nof SVB. There were a number of issues that contributed to the firm’s ultimate failure. These\nevents included rapid growth, poor risk management, poor public communication, a lack of\nsupervisory attention to core risks, and an insufficiently robust supervisory response to the\nbuildup of interest rate and funding risk. These issues were exacerbated by operational and\ntechnological problems with FedWire and discount window lending. The cumulative effect of\nthese issues likely accelerated the firm’s failure and increased the scope of the resulting financial\nharm. But certainly, this is a clear example of where the Federal Reserve’s proactive tools—\nsupervision of risk management, and the operation of liquidity support and payment tools—\ncould have been much more effective.\nTherefore, the virtue of supervision as a proactive measure to support financial stability\ncomes with a cautionary note. Ineffective supervision itself can compound financial stability\nrisks by allowing the buildup of risk without commensurate risk-management measures or\n\n- 8 -\nsupervisory attention. One protective measure that we can take to support effective supervision\nis to ensure that focus on traditional risks is not lost or diluted. One example of a supervisory\nand regulatory distraction is from the Fed’s recent focus on climate risk. Recently, the Federal\nReserve conducted a pilot climate scenario exercise with a subset of the largest U.S. global\nsystemically important banks (G-SIBs) and issued guidance to large institutions on managing\nclimate-related financial risk. This regulatory attention and focus on one specific, non-core risk\ncould reasonably call into question whether regulatory priorities are focused sufficiently on key\nrisks. Firms are already required to manage all material risks, and prioritizing climate risk in this\nway could lead to the misallocation of risk-management resources.\nRegulatory Approaches to Promote Financial Stability\nSecond, where regulation may create or exacerbate financial stability risks, we need to\ntake a close look at whether those risks are justified by the safety and soundness benefits of the\nregulation.\nFor example, consider the threat to financial stability resulting from market illiquidity.\nLiquidity is essential to effective market functioning, and liquidity in the U.S. Treasury market is\nparticularly important due to its critical role in the U.S. and global financial systems.7 This is an\narea that, in relative terms, has recently experienced stress events as in the September 2019 repo\nmarket stress, and the so-called “dash for cash” in March of 2020. These events raised concerns\nabout the resiliency of U.S. Treasury markets. Even today, some indicators signal low market\nliquidity through market depth in U.S. Treasury cash markets, which have been at levels below\nhistorical norms.8\n7 See Financial Stability Report, 9–10.\n8 Figure 1.11 in Financial Stability Report, 10.\n\n- 9 -\nBanks play an important role in providing liquidity, and there are clear signs that liquidity\nin Treasury markets is low.9 While there may be a number of reasons for reduced Treasury\nmarket liquidity, I would note two specific factors and ongoing risks: (1) concerns by banks\nabout balance sheet capacity to engage in low-margin market activities, and (2) the cumulative\nregulatory burden on banks when they engage in market-making activities, which includes most\nrecently the proposed increase in capital costs for market making activity proposed by the Basel\nIII endgame rulemaking, and an apparent lack of interest in addressing the constraints on bank\nactivities caused by bank leverage ratios. Ultimately, liquidity in the U.S. Treasury market has\nthe potential to amplify or dampen shocks to the financial system.\nWhere we can take proactive regulatory measures to ensure that primary dealers have\nadequate balance sheet capacity to intermediate Treasury markets in times of stress, we should\ndo so. This could include amending the leverage ratio and G-SIB surcharge for the largest U.S.\nbanks. And where we can take into consideration the impact of regulatory reforms on financial\nstability, we must at least acknowledge the tradeoffs and the potential downside risks that\nregulatory changes could create. This is particularly important when considering significant\nincreases to capital requirements, especially those of the scale contemplated by the Basel III\nproposal, including the market risk capital increases.\nAdopting regulatory changes to mitigate these concerns may not be sufficient to promote\nmarket liquidity, but it would be an important step toward building resiliency in advance of\nfuture stress events. In my view, it would be better to fix the roof now, while the sun is shining,\nby addressing over-calibrated leverage ratio requirements and moderating capital increases for\nthe Basel III proposal.\n9 See Financial Stability Report, 9–10.\n\n- 10 -\nUnintended Consequences of Overregulation and Disproportionate Supervision\nFinally, as we evaluate the merit of regulations and supervisory approaches, we must\nunderstand the broader implications beyond the regulatory perimeter. We have seen a migration\nof activity out of the regulated banking sector to a variety of alternative service providers and\nnonbank financial institutions and intermediaries. As the Financial Stability Report notes, hedge\nfund leverage reached 18 to 1 in the third quarter of 2023 for “average on-balance sheet leverage\nof the top 15 hedge funds by gross asset value.”10 Throughout 2023, bank lending to nonbank\nfinancial institutions—a category that includes hedge funds—also increased.11 While this\nincrease was accompanied by continued declines in delinquency rates for bank lending to\nnonbank financial institutions, I think it is worth considering how this activity could ultimately\nbleed back into the regulated banking system.12\nWe should also consider structural shifts that have potential implications for financial\nstability. In shaping the bank regulatory framework, we must acknowledge that regulation and\nsupervision already influence the location of activity and will continue to do so.\nWe also know that the cost of bank regulation, including bank capital requirements,\ninfluences where activities occur, either within the banking system or in nonbank entities outside\nof the regulatory perimeter. Absent other factors, over time the cost difference of providing a\nservice between a bank and nonbank provider will lead activity to migrate to the lowest cost\nprovider. Just as with the residential mortgage market, these shifts have real consequences for\nwhere activity occurs.\n10 Financial Stability Report, 31.\n11 Financial Stability Report, 33.\n12 Financial Stability Report, 34.\n\n- 11 -\nTherefore, the threshold question we need to ask is whether regulation and supervision\nare appropriately calibrated to risk over time. Ultimately, even if regulation and supervision are\nrigorous—imposing higher standards on banks than on nonbanks—this does not necessarily\nmean that the standards applied to banks are not appropriate. It may be that activity conducted\nby nonbanks lacks appropriate supervision and regulation.\nImposing the same level and type of regulation and oversight on activity that occurs\noutside of the banking system is beyond the scope of bank regulatory authority. However, we\nmust be careful not to facilitate the transfer of activity and risk out of the banking system simply\nby imposing standards that are disproportionate to risk for the same activities that are conducted\nby banks. The same activity presenting the same risk should receive the same regulation. Same\nactivity, same risk, same regulation.\nStriking the right balance and calibration for the regulation of specific activities is not\nalways a simple task, nor is the establishment of expectations that accompanies regulation and\nsupervision always subject to scientific precision. That being said, one does not need to look any\nfurther than the proposed Basel III endgame capital rules to find reforms that are excessively\ncalibrated and disproportionate to risk. This proposal contemplated a 20 percent increase in risk-\nweighted assets across bank holding companies subject to the rule. Public commenters raised\nsignificant concerns that the limited analysis included with the Basel III proposal may have\nsignificantly understated the scope of the capital increase. In response to this concern, the Board\nlaunched a data collection to gather more information from banks to better understand the\nimpacts of the proposal, the results of which will hopefully be released soon.\nAs I have discussed in the past, if implemented as proposed, the effects are predictable:\nhigher costs of capital for banks, higher costs of services for customers, less availability and\n\n- 12 -\nnarrower selection of services, and increased concentration in the providers of financial products\nand services.13 Driving risk out of the regulated banking system could lead to marginal\nimprovements in bank safety and soundness, but the consequences for financial stability could be\nseverely adverse. As I noted above, we have already seen reduced market activity driven by the\nleverage ratio and other regulatory constraints on bank balance sheets. We have also seen banks\ntighten credit standards and reduce lending activity, which often leads to a credit “gap” left to be\nfilled by nonbank lenders. As activity and risk migrates from the banking system to nonbanks,\nwe should ask how these shifts will impact financial stability over the long run, even though we\nhave less visibility and insight once they leave the banking system.\nThe Basel III capital rules are only a subset of regulatory proposals for change that\ninvolve the challenging task of achieving the right calibration to risk over time. A glut of new\nbank regulatory reforms and supervisory guidance raise this concern, including revisions to the\nG-SIB surcharge, new long-term debt requirements, amended resolution plan guidance,\ncontemplated changes to the regulatory approval of merger and acquisition activity, and\nrevisions to the interchange fee cap. The cumulative effects of these regulatory proposals are\nsignificant.\nThis cautionary note does not mean that I am opposed to appropriate reforms to bank\nregulation and supervision—both tools must adapt to changing conditions and risks. Last year\nwe saw significant stress in the banking system due to a few bank failures and the persistence of\nhigher inflation and interest rates in the U.S. and in many other countries around the world. But\nwe should not assume that “more” is always better. More regulation and more supervision are\n13 See Michelle W. Bowman, “The Path Forward for Bank Capital Reform” (remarks at Protect Main Street,\nsponsored by the Center for Capital Markets at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Washington, D.C., January 17,\n2024), https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20240117a.pdf.\n\n- 13 -\nonly effective if the changes are targeted to address an existing problem and are appropriately\nfocused and efficient.14 When they are targeted and efficient, they may result in a net positive\nboth in bank safety and soundness, and in financial stability. The function of bank regulators is\nnot to create a bank regulatory framework that eliminates risk. Banking is inherently about\nmanaging, not eliminating, risk.\nClosing\nMy remarks today are not meant to be an exhaustive list of all the financial stability\nthreats facing the U.S. banking system, but I would be remiss in concluding without briefly\nmentioning a few other key financial stability risks, all of which I expect are familiar to you.\nFirst, monetary policy and the fight against inflation. This is a key risk identified in the\nFinancial Stability Report, and in surveys of bankers. When effectively implemented, monetary\npolicy promotes price stability and maximum employment. In the long run, achieving both of\nthese objectives promotes the stability of the broader financial system. It is of utmost importance\nthat we maintain credibility in pursuing our fight against inflation by proceeding carefully and\ndeliberately to achieve our 2 percent goal.\nBut we cannot ignore the fact that monetary policy can present risks to the banking\nsystem and the broader financial system. Changes in interest rates can make it more difficult for\nbanks to manage interest rate risk, particularly in the face of rapid rate increases like those from\n2022 and 2023. We know that many banks have seen a significant increase in unrealized losses\non their balance sheets, a trend that has led to pressure on liquidity, funding, and capital for some\ninstitutions.\n14 See Bowman, “The Path Forward for Bank Capital Reform.”\n\n- 14 -\nWhile monetary policy mandates may support long-term financial stability, monetary\npolicy is an independent function that may heighten short-term stresses in the banking system.\nOur supervisory activities should reflect an awareness of these effects on bank management\ndecisionmaking as we rely on regulation and supervision to promote resilience in the regulated\nbanking system, with the goal of helping banks as they navigate an evolving macroeconomic\nenvironment and adjust to major shifts in the stance of monetary policy.\nToday’s banking system has also been heavily shaped by the effects of COVID-related\nstimulus on deposit activity. Many banks saw a significant inflow of deposits as a direct result of\nCOVID-related stimulus with excess savings accumulating due to lockdowns. This trend created\nchallenges for banks, who may have lacked sufficient opportunities to invest or extend credit in a\nworld affected by COVID lockdowns. The rapid increase in deposits in the banking system, and\ntheir subsequent drawdown, have pressure tested banks’ abilities to manage funding and interest\nrate risks, and posed significant challenges for banks faced with few opportunities to put funding\nto productive use.\nWhile there are important pockets of financial stability risk where the Federal Reserve\nlacks authority, there are meaningful improvements that can be made to our regulatory and\nsupervisory approach that could enhance financial stability. Bank regulation and supervision can\nbest accomplish their goals when guided by transparency, fairness, and efficiency. We must\nremember that there are always consequences to financial stability from miscalibrated regulatory\nand supervisory actions and the cumulative effects of regulatory proposals.\nI hope my discussion today has helped to highlight the role of financial regulators in\npromoting financial stability, through (1) applying supervision to mitigate and promote resilience\nto financial system vulnerabilities, (2) adopting bank regulatory approaches that further financial\n\n- 15 -\nstability goals, and (3) taking into account the unintended consequences and tradeoffs of\noverregulation and disproportionate supervision—particularly as they may result in negative\nconsequences.\nOf course, while these principles are helpful guides to how regulators can best promote\nfinancial stability, they are also insufficient. We must be thoughtful about the limits of\nregulatory authorities—and abide by those limits, even in the face of significant stress. The\nFederal Reserve and the bank regulatory framework do not hold the solution to every financial\nstability problem, and we must have confidence that other regulators, and other branches of\ngovernment, will take appropriate steps to preserve financial stability when needed.\nThank you for your time today, and I look forward to our discussion.",

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\n2024 CEO and Senior Management Summit and Annual Meeting, sponsored by\nthe Kansas Bankers Association\nColorado Springs, Colorado\nAugust 10, 2024\n\nThank you for the invitation to join you again this year.1 Just as banking and economic\nconditions continue to evolve, so too do bank regulatory and supervisory standards. I look\nforward to learning your perspectives on the evolving banking and economic conditions, and the\nbanking agencies’ approaches to regulation and supervision.\nEconomic and Monetary Policy Outlook\nBefore discussing my thoughts on bank regulatory matters, and in light of our recent\nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, I will begin by sharing my current views on\nthe economy and monetary policy.\nOver the past two years, the FOMC has significantly tightened the stance of monetary\npolicy to address high inflation. At our July meeting, the FOMC voted to continue to hold the\nfederal funds rate target range at 5-1/4 to 5‑1/2 percent and to continue to reduce the Federal\nReserve’s securities holdings.\nAfter seeing considerable progress last year, we have seen some further progress on\nlowering inflation in recent months. The 12-month measures of total and core personal\nconsumption expenditures (PCE) inflation, which I prefer relative to more volatile higher-\nfrequency readings, have moved down since April, although they have remained somewhat\nelevated and stood at 2.5 percent and 2.6 percent in June, respectively. The progress in lowering\ninflation during May and June is a welcome development, but inflation is still uncomfortably\nabove the Committee’s 2 percent goal.\nDespite the recent good data reports, core PCE inflation averaged an annualized\n3.4 percent over the first half of the year. And given that supply constraints have now largely\n1 The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee or the Board of Governors.\n\n- 2 -\nnormalized, I am not confident that inflation will decline in the same way as in the second half of\nlast year. More importantly, prices continue to be much higher than before the pandemic, which\ncontinues to weigh on consumer sentiment. Inflation has hit lower-income households hardest,\nsince food, energy, and housing services price increases far outpaced overall inflation over the\npast few years.\nEconomic activity moderated in the first half of this year after increasing at a strong pace\nlast year. Gross domestic product (GDP) growth moved up in the second quarter, following a\nsoft reading in the first quarter, while private domestic final purchases (PDFP) increased at a\nsolid pace in both quarters. During the first half of 2024, PDFP slowed much less than GDP, as\nthe slowdown in GDP growth was partly driven by volatile categories such as net exports,\nsuggesting that underlying economic growth was stronger than GDP indicated. Unusually strong\nconsumer goods spending last year softened in the first quarter of this year, largely accounting\nfor the step-down in PDFP growth.\nAlthough consumer spending strengthened in the second quarter, consumers appear to be\npulling back on discretionary items and expenses, as evidenced in part by a decline in restaurant\nspending since late last year. Low- and moderate-income consumers no longer have savings to\nsupport this type of spending, and we’ve seen a normalization of loan delinquency rates as they\nhave risen from historically low levels during the pandemic.\nThe labor market continues to loosen, as the number of available workers has increased\nand the number of available jobs has declined—showing signs that the labor market is coming\ninto better balance. After slowing in the second quarter, payroll employment gains eased to a\nmore modest pace in July, even as job openings are being filled by the increased immigrant labor\nsupply. The latest labor market report shows that the unemployment rate stood at 4.3 percent in\n\n- 3 -\nJuly. Although notably higher than a year ago, this is still a historically low unemployment rate.\nIn addition, the ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers has declined to its pre-pandemic\nlevel. We are also seeing a slowing in wage growth, which now stands at just under 4 percent as\nmeasured by the employment cost index. However, given trend productivity, wage gains are still\nabove the pace consistent with our inflation goal.\nMy baseline outlook is that inflation will decline further with the current stance of\nmonetary policy. Should the incoming data continue to show that inflation is moving sustainably\ntoward our 2 percent goal, it will become appropriate to gradually lower the federal funds rate to\nprevent monetary policy from becoming overly restrictive on economic activity and\nemployment. But we need to be patient and avoid undermining continued progress on lowering\ninflation by overreacting to any single data point. Instead, we must view the data in their totality\nas the risks to the Committee’s employment and price-stability mandates continue to move into\nbetter balance. That said, I still see some upside risks to inflation.\nFirst, as I noted earlier, much of the progress on inflation last year was due to supply-side\nimprovements, including easing of supply chain constraints; increases in the number of available\nworkers, due both to increased labor force participation and strong immigration; and lower\nenergy prices. It is unlikely that further improvements along this margin will continue to lower\ninflation going forward, as supply chains have largely normalized, the labor force participation\nrate has leveled off in recent months below pre-pandemic levels, and significantly higher U.S.\nimmigration over the past few years may decrease going forward.\nGeopolitical developments could also pose upside risks to inflation, as the recent surge in\ncontainer shipping costs originating in Asia suggest that global supply chains remain susceptible\nto disruptions, which could put upward pressure on food, energy, and commodity prices. There\n\n- 4 -\nis also the risk that additional fiscal stimulus could add momentum to demand, impeding further\nprogress on reducing inflation.\nFinally, there continues to be a risk that the increased immigration could lead to\npersistently high housing services inflation. Given the current low inventory of affordable\nhousing, the inflow of new immigrants to some geographic areas could result in upward pressure\non rents, as additional housing supply may take time to materialize.\nThere are also risks that the labor market has not been as strong as the payroll data have\nbeen indicating, but it also appears that the recent rise in unemployment may be exaggerating the\ndegree of cooling in labor markets. The Q4 Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages\n(QCEW) report implies that job gains have been consistently overstated in the establishment\nsurvey since March of last year, while the household survey unemployment data have become\nless accurate as response rates have appreciably declined since the pandemic.2 Moreover, the\nrise in the unemployment rate this year largely reflects weaker hiring, as job searchers entering\nthe labor force are taking longer to find a job, while layoffs remain low. It is also likely that\nsome temporary factors contributed to the soft July employment report. The rise in the\nunemployment rate in July was centered in workers experiencing a temporary layoff, who are\nmore likely to be rehired in coming months, and Hurricane Beryl likely contributed to weaker\njob gains, as the number of workers not working due to bad weather increased significantly last\nmonth.\n2 The Q4 Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) administrative data show employment gains that\nare about 110,000 per month lower than what the Current Employment Statistics (CES) survey reported from March\n2023 to December 2023. Although the Bureau of Labor Statistics benchmarks CES payroll employment based on\nthe Q1 QCEW, to be released on August 21, the Q4 QCEW data point to a substantial downward revision to CES\nemployment gains last year.\n\n- 5 -\nIn light of upside risks to inflation and uncertainty regarding labor market conditions and\nthe economic outlook, I will continue to watch the data closely as I assess the appropriate path of\nmonetary policy. Increased measurement challenges and the frequency and extent of data\nrevisions over the past few years make the task of assessing the current state of the economy and\npredicting how it will evolve even more challenging. I will remain cautious in my approach to\nconsidering adjustments to the current stance of policy.\nIt is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course. In my view, we\nshould consider a range of possible scenarios that could unfold when assessing how the FOMC’s\nmonetary policy decisions may evolve. My colleagues and I will make our decisions at each\nFOMC meeting based on the incoming data and the implications for and risks to the outlook,\nwith a focus on the dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices. By the time\nof our September meeting, we will have seen a range of additional economic data and\ninformation, including one employment and two inflation reports. We will also have a wider\nview of how developments in broader financial conditions might influence the economic\noutlook. In particular, equity prices have been volatile recently but are still higher than at the\nend of last year.\nI will continue to closely monitor the data and visit with a broad range of contacts as I\nassess economic conditions and the appropriateness of our monetary policy stance. As I noted\nearlier, I continue to view inflation as somewhat elevated. And with some upside risks to\ninflation, I still see the need to pay close attention to the price-stability side of our mandate while\nwatching for risks of a material weakening in the labor market. My view continues to be that\nrestoring price stability is essential for achieving maximum employment over the longer run.\n\n- 6 -\nBanking Regulation and Supervision\nI will turn now to bank regulation and supervision. Today I would like to address a few\ntopics that I expect will be of interest to those in this room, starting with the issue of culture both\nwithin banks and at bank and other financial regulatory agencies. I will then briefly discuss\nmergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity in the banking industry, and the current and expected\noutlook for bank transactions. I will close with a discussion on bank liquidity regulation.\nThe Role of Culture at Banks and at Regulators\nIn recent years, regulatory approaches have included regulators seeking to influence the\nculture within banks, specifically large banks, focusing on matters like building a culture that\npromotes compliance or effective risk management, including operational risk. A bank’s culture\ndrives its sense of ownership and a collective purpose that is common among many successful\norganizations, where a bank’s board, management, and employees all work together in support of\nthe bank’s business purpose and mission. Bank culture can have a strong influence on both\nbusiness outcomes and on compliance and risk-management outcomes.\nBank culture starts with bank leadership, the so-called tone from the top. Strong bank\nculture demands accountability for bank leadership teams and for the entire workforce. A bank’s\nmanagement is responsible for setting the strategic direction of the company, including which\nbusiness lines to pursue, expand, or eliminate. But bank leaders also have a responsibility to\nempower employees to raise issues and concerns, allowing them to identify and escalate\nemerging business, risk-management, or compliance matters that may require management’s\nattention or intervention. While regulators have sought to influence bank culture over time,\nultimately culture is most heavily influenced and shaped by the example set by bank leaders and\nby the actions of each bank employee.\n\n- 7 -\nRegulatory agency culture can be similarly impactful in shaping bank regulation and\nsupervision to promote safety and soundness and consumer compliance in an effective and\nefficient manner. In contrast to regulators, bank management may choose to modify or reshape\ntheir mission and objectives over time—evolving their business goals, risk-management policies\nand processes, and compliance standards as conditions change. For regulators, the overarching\nregulatory and supervisory mission and related institutional goals are prescribed by statute.\nWhile bank regulators lack the flexibility to change the mission, they have significant flexibility\nin the execution of that mission. This often involves broad policy goals—for example,\npromoting the safety and soundness of the banking system, and the stability of the financial\nsystem.\nSimilar to bank culture, regulatory agency culture begins with its leadership and is then\ncarried out by the individual members of the organization’s workforce. Culture plays a\nsignificant role in how well bank regulators pursue their statutory objectives and the manner in\nwhich they perform the related mission. Have regulators created a culture that allows the staff to\nidentify and escalate issues of concern? Have regulators oriented the mission of the institution\naround core statutory goals and avoided the temptation to stray from this mission into other\nmatters of public policy? Have regulators created a culture of accountability for leaders and\nemployees, where shortcomings can be fairly identified and actions can be taken to remediate\nproblems?\nWhile the value of culture is widely acknowledged, both among banks and among bank\nregulators, we have seen some recent high-profile examples of culture falling short, and with\n\n- 8 -\nserious consequences.3 Responsible banking involves not only finding and pursuing\nopportunities to serve customers and grow the business, but also balancing these business\npriorities with a firm commitment to risk management and compliance, including consumer\ncompliance. While banks are free to pursue growth, in some instances this growth has come\nwithout accompanying development of and investment in risk management and legal\ncompliance, to the detriment of the bank and its customers.\nIn the case of Silicon Valley Bank’s (SVB) failure in 2023, rapid growth was certainly a\nfactor that contributed to the firm’s fragility. The bank’s management failed to properly manage\nits development of contingent liquidity planning, funding, and risk-management capabilities in\nlight of its rapid growth. While this failure revealed problems with bank leadership in promoting\na compliance and risk-management culture commensurate with growth, supervisors directly\noverseeing the bank’s expansion were also late to act in the face of emerging firm risks.\nI think we should question whether we have learned all of the right lessons from SVB’s\nfailure. We know that rapid growth is a known risk factor that should result in additional\nsupervisory scrutiny. But some of the post-failure SVB reviews conducted internally by Federal\nReserve staff cited rapid growth as a contributing factor for the inadequacy of the supervisory\napproach.4 Among other things, these internal reports suggested that the shift of SVB from one\nsupervisory portfolio to another somehow frustrated appropriate supervision. We need to ask\n3 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Consent Order with Green Dot Bank and Green Dot\nCorporation (July 19, 2024), https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/enf20240719b1.pdf;\nConsent Order with Silvergate Capital Corporation and Silvergate Bank, (June 4, 2024),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/enf20240701a1.pdf; Consent Order with Evolve\nBancorp, Inc. and Evolve Bank & Trust (June 11, 2024),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/enf20240614a1.pdf.\n4 See Vice Chair for Supervision Barr, “Review of the Federal Reserve’s Supervision and Regulation of Silicon\nValley Bank” at 35 (April 28, 2023), https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/svb-review-20230428.pdf;\nMaterial Loss Review of Silicon Valley Bank at 38 (September 25, 2023),\nhttps://oig.federalreserve.gov/reports/board-material-loss-review-silicon-valley-bank-sep2023.pdf.\n\n- 9 -\nwhether supervisors are empowered to appropriately supervise firms that experience rapid\ngrowth and other emerging risks.\nEach regulatory agency has an obligation to facilitate an environment that can help the\nagency best fulfill its mission. It must take care to maintain a positive and productive culture\nover time by listening intently to concerns that are raised, ensuring that employees are\nempowered to raise issues of concern (including reporting of personnel issues), and taking\nappropriate actions to remediate those concerns. Regulators are certainly not immune from\nproblems arising with institutional culture.\nRecently, we have seen a high-profile example of problems with the culture at the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). I commend the FDIC for engaging an\nindependent third party to assist them in their investigation; this is an important first step toward\naccountability and addressing these issues.\nWe must not lose sight of the lesson that cultural problems at both banks and regulators\ncan compound cyclical downturns in the banking environment and pose more serious risks to the\nbanking system. Cultivating a positive culture, one that values accountability and the\ncontributions of both management and staff to an organization’s mission, can serve as a buffer\nagainst future stresses.\nBank Mergers and Acquisitions\nAnother area of ongoing interest among regulators is the approach to banking industry\nM&A transactions.5 The significant shift in regulatory approaches is concerning. As a threshold\n5 See Jonathan Kanter (2023), “Merger Enforcement Sixty Years after Philadelphia National Bank,” speech\ndelivered at the Brookings Institution’s Center on Regulation and Markets Event “Promoting Competition in\nBanking,” Washington, June 20, https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/assistant-attorney-general-jonathan-kanter-\ndelivers-keynote-address-brookings-institution; Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (2024), “Business\nCombinations under the Bank Merger Act: Notice of Proposed Rulemaking,” OCC Bulletin 2024-4, January 29,\nhttps://occ.gov/news-issuances/bulletins/2024/bulletin-2024-4.html; and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\n\n- 10 -\nmatter, any discussion of regulatory approval standards should begin with an understanding of\nthe critical role bank M&A transactions play in a healthy banking system.\nM&A transactions allow banks to evolve and thrive in our dynamic banking system and\ncan promote their long-term health and viability. M&A also ensures that banks have a\nmeaningful path to transitioning bank ownership. The absence of a viable M&A framework\nincreases the potential for additional risks, including limited opportunities for succession\nplanning, especially in smaller or rural communities, and leaving zombie banks that have no\ncompetitive viability or exit strategy to continue operations.\nThe impact of a more restrictive M&A framework affects institutions of all sizes,\nincluding larger institutions that are vying to compete with the very largest global systemically\nimportant banks (G-SIBs). Banks of all sizes may choose to pursue M&A to pursue strategic\ngrowth opportunities and to remain competitive with larger peers that can achieve growth\norganically through sheer scale. The consequence of limiting the growth options for any bank\nhoping to compete with the largest G-SIBs has the perverse, and unintended, consequence of\nactually further insulating the very largest institutions from competition.\nAgainst this backdrop, and while recognizing the value of M&A to the banking system,\nregulators must be pragmatic and thoughtful about reforms. As first steps, we must define the\ndesired end state we are seeking to achieve with any changes. We must then identify the\nproblem that needs to be solved and proffer a solution that is fair, transparent, consistent with\napplicable statutes, tailored for each bank category, and efficient. We should not propose a cure\nwithout first identifying an ailment and a reasoned basis for the prescribed outcome.\n(2024), “FDIC Seeks Public Comment on Proposed Revisions to Its Statement of Policy on Bank Merger\nTransactions,” press release, March 21, https://www.fdic.gov/news/press-releases/2024/pr24017.html.\n\n- 11 -\nThe primary argument raised by proponents of reform is that the regulatory approval\nprocess has become a rubber stamp, one in which regulators do not conduct a meaningful review\nagainst the statutory factors laid out by Congress. Bankers who have been through the M&A\napproval process would almost certainly disagree with the notion that regulators take a light-\ntouch approach in reviewing banking transactions.\nThere is ample evidence to undermine this argument. Let’s consider just the process of\nfiling an application. It begins with identifying an M&A target, conducting due diligence, and\nnegotiating the terms of the transaction. The next steps are preparing and filing the application,\nand engaging with regulators throughout the review process and beyond approval, in anticipation\nof post-approval business processes, including systems conversions and customer transitions.\nThe costs of M&A can be substantial, and banks do not enter into transactions without\nsignificant preparation and planning, including an informed analysis that any proposal would be\nlikely to result in regulatory approval. The demands of the process act as a self-selection\nmechanism, with only institutions that see both value in the transaction and a strong likelihood of\nregulatory approval going through the process. This is an expensive and reputationally risky\nprocess that bankers and their boards of directors take extremely seriously.\nFederal Reserve data support the view that even for the self-selected population who files\nan application, the process does not always lead to approval. To the contrary, based on the most\nrecent data reported for 2023, a significant portion of M&A applications were withdrawn before\napproval, and the average processing time in the second half of 2023 was 87 days.6 The number\n6 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2023), Banking Applications Activity Semiannual\nReport, July 1–December 31, 2023 (Washington: Board of Governors, April 2024) Table 2 (“Semiannual\nApplications Report”). While average processing times in 2023 showed a decrease as compared to 2022, the report\nnotes that this was primarily due to fewer proposals receiving adverse public comments. Semiannual Applications\nReport, at 3.\n\n- 12 -\nof approved M&A transactions was also significantly lower in 2023 than it was in 2020, 2021, or\n2022.7\nWhen we talk about M&A process reform, it can feel like bankers and regulators are\nliving in different worlds. Bankers seek to conclude the process in a timely way, enabling them\nto move forward from the uncertainty of the application process to the important work of\nintegrating the banks’ operations as quickly as possible. One of the key risks to an effective\nprocess is a lack of timely regulatory action. The consequences of delays can significantly harm\nboth the acquiring institution and the target, causing greater operational risk (including the risk\nof a failed merger), increased expenses, reputational risk, and staff attrition in the face of\nprolonged uncertainty. In contrast, some regulators feel pressure to revisit well-established\nregulatory approval standards relating to statutory factors, such as the effect of a transaction on\ncompetition, or to even expand the use of M&A review to accomplish other objectives, like\nforcing banks to adopt regulatory standards that would not otherwise apply by regulation as a\ncondition of approval.8\nRegulatory reforms should promote a healthy banking system and must acknowledge the\nimportant role M&A activity plays in keeping the system healthy. Unfortunately, reform efforts,\nand the existing record of performance on banking M&A transactions, show a concerning trend\nthat the barriers to bank M&A activity remain substantial.\n7 Id.\n8 See, e.g., FRB Order No. 2022-22 (October 14, 2022), U.S. Bancorp, Minneapolis, Minnesota, Order Approving\nthe Acquisition of a Bank, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/bcreg20221014a3.pdf;\nStatement by Governor Michelle W. Bowman on advance notice of proposed rulemaking on resolution requirements\nfor large Banks and application by U.S. Bancorp (October 14, 2022),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bowman-statement-20221014.htm (expressing concern\nabout the potential accelerated imposition of regulatory standards on a firm that would not otherwise apply by\noperation of existing applicability thresholds).\n\n- 13 -\nLiquidity\nSince last spring, regulators have also focused on revisiting bank liquidity requirements.\nLast month, the Federal Reserve Banks of Dallas and Atlanta hosted a research conference to\ndiscuss the Federal Reserve’s traditional role as a “lender of last resort,” the payments\ninfrastructure, deposit insurance reform, and the sources of bank liquidity.9 The discussions\nincluded a broad range of views on all of these topics, highlighting the need for a thorough\nunderstanding of all of the issues before moving forward with any proposals for solutions.\nThe failures of SVB, Signature Bank, and First Republic Bank have prompted discussion\namong policymakers about the need for even more regulation. It’s important to emphasize here\nthat the conditions for failure, and the subsequent banking stress, could not have occurred\nwithout bank management and supervisory failures. Therefore, identifying and remediating\nthese known and identifiable issues to the greatest extent possible should continue to be a\npriority as we engage in serious discussions about regulatory reforms.\nThose events also highlighted the need to revisit bank liquidity and funding as part of our\nreview of the regulatory framework. When we consider the Federal Reserve’s operational\ninfrastructure, including Fedwire® and discount window lending, we must ask if the Federal\nReserve’s tools were effective and complementary to other funding sources (including Federal\nHome Loan Bank funding) during times of stress, and if not, we must ask how they could be\nimproved. Reform discussions should include not only thinking about new and revised\nrequirements and expectations that would apply to individual banks, but also identifying\n9 See Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, “Exploring Conventional Bank Funding Regimes in an Unconventional\nWorld” (July 18-19, 2024, Dallas, Texas), https://www.dallasfed.org/research/events/2024/24deposit.\n\n- 14 -\nopportunities to remediate deficiencies and overlapping requirements within the regulatory\nframework.\nLender of Last Resort and Payments Infrastructure\nOne area in need of attention is considering how to operationally enhance and optimize\ntools like the discount window to meet banking system liquidity needs more effectively. The\npayments infrastructure that supports bank funding mechanisms must be prepared to operate\neffectively both during business-as-usual conditions and during stress events. Yet during the\nbanking stress in 2023 and the unprecedented speed of the bank runs that occurred, some banks\nexperienced frictions in using the discount window and limits on the availability of payment\nservices. These issues may have interfered with liquidity management activity and exacerbated\nthe banking stress.\nThe Fed must continue to enhance the technology, operational readiness, and services\nunderpinning discount window loans and payment services to ensure that they are available\nwhen needed. On this front, I would note that the Federal Reserve recently published a proposal\nto expand the operating hours of the Fedwire Funds Service and the National Settlement Service,\nto operate 22 hours per day, 7 days per week, on a year-round basis.10 The proposal also\nrequested feedback on whether the discount window should operate during these same expanded\nhours. Expanded service hours are a concrete example of a change that is responsive to the\nissues experienced last spring, but my hope is that these changes are accompanied by other\nimportant operational improvements, including improved technology and operational readiness\nwithin the Federal Reserve System.\n10 Federal Reserve System, Request for Comment, \"Expansion of Fedwire® Funds Service and National Settlement\nService Operating Hours,\" 89 Fed. Reg. 39,613 (May 9, 2024)\n\n- 15 -\nBank Liquidity\nBank liquidity has also been a prominent feature in reform discussions, focusing on\nwhether the calibration and scope of the regulatory framework is appropriate. This includes the\ndiscussion of possible revisions to liquidity-related regulatory requirements, including liquidity\nstress testing and the liquidity coverage ratio, as well as shifting supervisory expectations for\ncontingent funding plans and the availability of alternative liquidity sources.\nAs we consider the requirements and expectations for banks, we should also consider the\navailability of funding and liquidity sources and mechanisms—for example, the role of repo\n(repurchase agreement) markets and the standing repo facility, extension of credit from the\nFederal Home Loan Banks, and, of course, the role of the Fed’s discount window. While the\nFederal Reserve considers reforms specifically to the discount window, it is important to frame\nthese discussions within a broader context of other sources, and in light of the unique position of\nthe discount window in this framework. The discount window is a critical tool, but it does not\noperate in isolation. It is intended to be a source of liquidity as a last resort and at a penalty rate,\nnot as a primary funding resource in the normal course of business at a market rate. In\nevaluating the bank liquidity framework, it is imperative that we consider and understand the\ninterrelationships among these resources, liquidity requirements and regulations, and bank\nliquidity planning.11\nSome policymakers have stated that a potential response to the 2023 banking stress\nwould be to require banks to preposition collateral at the Fed’s discount window, and while\npolicymakers have discussed potential regulatory reforms to implement this change, supervisory\n11 Michelle W. Bowman, “Bank Liquidity, Regulation, and the Fed’s Role as Lender of Last Resort” (speech at The\nRoundtable on the Lender of Last Resort: The 2023 Banking Crisis and COVID, sponsored by the Committee on\nCapital Markets Regulation, Washington, D.C., April 3, 2024),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240403a.htm.\n\n- 16 -\ncommunications have already begun directing collateral prepositioning as a supervisory best\npractice. As a policy reform, the notion is that forcing banks to preposition collateral in this way\nwill create a ready pool of liquidity those banks can draw from during times of stress. This\ncompulsory requirement to preposition collateral, it is argued, could also mitigate some of the\nstigma associated with using the discount window and thereby improve its effectiveness.\nThe effectiveness of a prepositioning requirement as a solution to perceived stigma\nconcerns remains to be seen, but one can reasonably question if compulsory prepositioning or\ncompulsory use of the discount window would materially change market perceptions and resolve\nbank concerns about stigma. There is no reason for a bank to take a loan at a penalty rate or to\npreposition collateral during periods of calm if the discount window operates effectively and\ncommunicates with banks on a regular basis. If the issue is that the window does not operate in\nan effective manner, requirements to use it more frequently will not address these underlying\noperational issues. To the contrary, investments must be made to address its operational\nshortcomings.\nSome reforms, like encouraging bank readiness to borrow from the discount window if\nthat is part of banks’ contingency funding plans, could be explored more thoroughly. If a bank\nincludes the discount window in these plans and intends to use it during stress, the bank should\nbe prepared to do so. But if we are honest, we must recognize that our prior efforts to reduce\ndiscount window stigma, as during the COVID period, have not been durable or successful, and\nthat perhaps resources would be better devoted to making sure the discount window is prepared\nto act in a timely way, rather than adding even more regulatory requirements or supervisory\nexpectations to banks that may complicate day-to-day liquidity management, with uncertain\nliquidity benefits during stress.\n\n- 17 -\nWhen it comes to the next steps in liquidity reform, it is imperative that we tackle known\nand identified issues that were exposed during the banking stress last year. This must include\nupdating discount window operations and technology and making sure that payment services are\navailable when needed. But for other reforms, a number of important questions remain\nunanswered, including understanding both where there are frictions and weaknesses in the\ncurrent bank funding landscape, and what the potential impact (including intended and\nunintended consequences) of these reforms on the banking industry could be. In my view,\nremediation of known issues must remain a key priority.\nClosing Thoughts\nThe federal banking agencies’ reform agenda has recently been directed toward rapid and\ntransformational change, rather than deliberate and incremental change. Just as a bank’s rapid\ngrowth may increase the risks of outgrowing risk-management and compliance frameworks,\nrapid regulatory reforms increase the risk of regulation resulting in harmful unintended\nconsequences to the banking and financial system. Banks are already experiencing the effects of\nthis “rapid change” approach through the supervisory process. And it will become increasingly\nclear as the reform agenda continues on its current path.\nBankers should be concerned about significant swings of the regulatory pendulum,\nswings that increase financial system uncertainty and instability and that complicate day-to-day\noperations and long-term planning. Deliberate, thoughtful change allows the Federal Reserve to\ndemonstrate that it executes its duties in an independent manner, focusing on its statutory\nobligations, and helps build public support and trust.\nI look forward to our conversation.",

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe Chicago Booth Initiative on Global Markets\nWorkshop on Market Dysfunction\nChicago, Illinois\nMarch 3, 2023\n\nThanks, Anil. It’s a pleasure to be with you today and to be part of this discussion\non how central banks can support the effective functioning of financial markets.1\nFinancial stability is essential for a well-functioning economy. A financial system\nis considered stable when its markets and institutions are resilient and able to function\neven following a severe shock. The Federal Reserve monitors risks to financial stability\nand uses its supervisory and regulatory tools to mitigate the risks and consequences of\nfinancial instability. During periods of financial system stress, the Federal Reserve can\nuse additional tools, such as lending facilities and open market operations, to directly\nsupport the effective functioning of key financial markets and the flow of credit\nthroughout the economy.\nThe onset of the global pandemic in the spring of 2020 was a severe shock both to\nfinancial markets and to the U.S. economy, and the Federal Reserve responded forcefully\nto support market functioning and the flow of credit. To address the liquidity strains in\nTreasury and repo markets, the Fed directly purchased large amounts of Treasury\nsecurities and conducted term and overnight repo operations using the FOMC’s open\nmarket operations authority. To address strains in other markets, with the backing of the\nU.S. Treasury, the Fed used its 13(3) emergency lending authority to establish a number\nof facilities to support the flow of credit to households, businesses, and communities.2\n1 These remarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 The Fed also used its open market operations authority to purchase agency residential and commercial\nmortgage-backed securities and conducted repo operations with an expanded set of global counterparties.\nSome of the 13(3) facilities were versions of those that had been used during the 2008 financial crisis and\nothers were new, such as corporate credit facilities, which directly purchased corporate bonds to support the\nflow of credit to the economy. All 13(3) lending facilities require the approval of the Secretary of the\nTreasury. For further details, see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2021), “Funding,\nCredit, Liquidity, and Loan Facilities,” webpage, https://www.federalreserve.gov/funding-credit-liquidity-\nand-loan-facilities.htm.\n\n- 2 -\nThe Federal Reserve also took a number of other actions, including easing terms on\ndiscount window lending and supervisory and regulatory actions, to encourage banks to\nlend and act as market intermediaries.3\nThe Fed’s actions were effective in restoring financial market functioning, but the\nchannels through which they operated varied. Significant asset purchases and take-up of\nthe Fed’s repo operations were required to restore smooth functioning in Treasury\nmarkets because of the liquidity needs of a wide swath of investors. By comparison,\nmany of the 13(3) lending facilities saw relatively limited take-up, but they helped\nsupport market functioning and the supply of credit in the targeted markets by offering a\nbackstop and bolstering investor confidence.4\nThe pandemic lending programs that experienced more usage saw a decline in use\nas market functioning was restored, which is a key benefit of lending programs compared\nwith asset purchases. Moreover, shorter-term loans under these programs were relatively\nquick to roll off the Fed’s balance sheet. In fact, most of the lending programs expired by\nlate 2020. And some of the emergency securities purchase programs, such as the\nSecondary Market Corporate Credit Facility, sold the securities they had purchased\nduring their wind-down phases.\nThe pandemic experience demonstrated the effectiveness of lending programs\ndesigned to serve as backstops to support market functioning and the flow of credit in\ntimes of stress. The temporary nature of loans from lending facilities activated only\n3 For a further description of these actions, see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2021),\n“Supervisory and Regulatory Actions in Response to COVID-19,” webpage,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisory-regulatory-action-response-covid-19.htm.\n4 For a discussion of the 13(3) lending facilities and their usage, see Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System (2020), Financial Stability Report (Washington: Board of Governors, November),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/financial-stability-report-20201109.pdf.\n\n- 3 -\nunder financial market stress adds to the attractiveness of these tools. Lending programs\nare most effective as backstops when loans are offered at a penalty rate and are of short\nduration. When appropriately calibrated, lending programs can help promote market\nfunctioning but limit the Federal Reserve’s overall footprint in financial markets in the\nlonger term.\nThe pandemic experience illustrated that liquidity strains can sometimes be so\nsevere that targeted purchases of the affected assets may be the most effective tool to\nquickly support market functioning, as was the case in Treasury markets in the spring of\n2020. In taking this step, a key issue for central banks to consider is how to clearly\ndistinguish asset purchases from the central bank’s monetary policy actions.5 This would\nbe especially important during a period of monetary policy tightening, as we are currently\nexperiencing. A related issue is how to minimize the Fed’s footprint and amount of asset\npurchases needed to restore market functioning. A further consideration is how to\nconstruct and communicate an exit strategy to reduce the enlarged balance sheet over\ntime.\nFinally, while it is important to consider the design of central bank tools to\naddress future episodes of severe financial market dysfunction, it is also important for\ncentral banks and other agencies to ensure that regulations and market oversight foster\nprudent financial institution behavior and resiliency in core financial markets. Doing so\ncan increase the ability of private markets and institutions to function during times of\nstress and reduce the likelihood of future market interventions by the central bank. In this\n5 This issue is most relevant when the assets purchases are those that the Fed can purchase using its open\nmarket operations authority, including Treasury and agency debt and agency-backed mortgage-backed\nsecurities. Programs to purchase other types of debt would need the approval of the Secretary of the\nTreasury under section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act.\n\n- 4 -\nregard, it is important for the Federal Reserve to engage along with the other agencies in\na thoughtful consideration of possible regulatory adjustments and structural reforms to\nincrease the resiliency of the Treasury markets and reduce the likelihood of future market\ndysfunction.6\nThank you, again, for the opportunity to chair this panel. I look forward to our\ndiscussion.\n6 For a discussion of potential reforms, see Inter-Agency Working Group on Treasury Market Surveillance\n(2021), Recent Disruptions and Potential Reforms in the U.S. Treasury Market: A Staff Progress Report\n(Washington: U.S. Department of the Treasury, November),\nhttps://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/IAWG-Treasury-Report.pdf; and Inter-Agency Working Group\non Treasury Market Surveillance (2022), Enhancing the Resilience of the U.S. Treasury Market: 2022 Staff\nProgress Report (Washington: U.S. Department of the Treasury, November),\nhttps://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/2022-IAWG-Treasury-Report.pdf.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n9:00 a.m. EDT\nSeptember 23, 2025\nViews on the Economy and Monetary Policy\nRemarks by\nMichelle W. Bowman\nVice Chair for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe 2025 Kentucky Bankers Association Annual Convention\nAsheville, North Carolina\nSeptember 23, 2025\n\nGood morning.1 I would like to thank the Kentucky Bankers Association for the\nopportunity to join you again for your annual convention, this time with an important difference.\nEarlier this year, the President nominated, and the Senate confirmed, me as the Fed’s Vice Chair\nfor Supervision. It’s the first time someone with community banking experience has served in\nthis role, and I am working to make sure that the Federal Reserve is addressing the issues I have\ndiscussed with you and other community bankers over the past nearly seven years that I’ve been\na member of the Board of Governors.\nIt is really a pleasure to be with you again, and especially in Asheville, North Carolina,\nafter the terrible flooding this area experienced last year.\nSince the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) met for our September meeting last\nweek, I thought I would share my views on the U.S. economy and monetary policy, including on\nmy policy vote.\nUpdate on the Most Recent FOMC Meeting\nAt last week’s FOMC meeting, the Committee voted to lower the target range for the\nfederal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point, bringing it to 4 to 4-1/4 percent, and to continue to\nreduce the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings. In my view, the Committee should have begun\nlowering the policy rate at the July meeting, so, of course, I supported reducing the policy rate at\nthis meeting.\nFor several months, I have been pointing out signs of potential labor market fragility.\nSince the June FOMC meeting and in public remarks following that meeting, I have argued that\nincreasing signs of weakening labor market conditions provide a basis for beginning to move the\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\npolicy rate closer to neutral to proactively support the employment side of our mandate. Recent\ndata have revealed a materially more fragile labor market along with inflation that, excluding\ntariffs, has continued to hover not far above our target. Given this shift in labor market\nconditions, I am pleased that we have finally begun the process of removing policy restraint,\nreflecting the economic conditions and the balance of risks to our employment and inflation\ngoals. Assuming the economy evolves as I expect, last week’s action should be the first step to\nbring the federal funds rate back to its neutral level.\nEconomic Conditions and Outlook\nThe U.S. economy has been resilient, but I am concerned about the weakening in labor\nmarket conditions and softer economic growth. I am also more confident that, as trade policy\nhas become more certain, tariffs will have only a small and short-lived effect on inflation going\nforward.\nGDP growth slowed to a modest pace in the first half of the year, as consumer spending\nsoftened and both investment in residential and commercial real estate and federal government\npurchases declined. A surge in high-tech investment, likely related to interest-rate-insensitive\nAI and data-center projects, accounted for at least half of the increased demand in the first six\nmonths of the year, while there was weakness in other categories. The incoming data for July\nand August point to an improvement in third-quarter consumer expenditures.\nDeclines in housing activity, including single-family home construction and sales, have\nbeen accompanied by higher inventories of homes for sale and falling house prices, suggesting\nthat housing demand has also weakened. Elevated mortgage rates may be exerting a more\npersistent drag as income growth expectations have declined while house prices remain high\nrelative to rents. Given very low housing affordability, existing home sales have remained\n\n- 3 -\ndepressed since 2023 and at levels only comparable with the early 2010s following the financial\ncrisis. I am concerned that, in the current environment, declines in house prices could accelerate,\nposing downside risks to housing valuations, construction, and inflation.\nTurning to the labor market, conditions have weakened this year as shown by the rise in\nthe unemployment rate and essentially flat payroll employment, which rose only about\n25,000 per month since April. This is down sharply from the moderate pace of job gains seen\nearlier in the year and well below estimates of breakeven rates, due to softening in labor demand.\nThe unemployment rate moved up to 4.3 percent in August, largely reflecting reduced hiring as\nbusinesses continue to retain existing workers instead of increasing layoffs. Wage growth has\nslowed closer to a pace consistent with 2 percent inflation, indicating that the labor market is no\nlonger a source of inflation pressures.\nAlthough still near full employment, the labor market has become more fragile and could\ndeteriorate more significantly in the coming months. The unemployment rate has increased\nnotably among groups that tend to be more affected by the business cycle, including teenagers.\nAnd the employment-to-population ratio has dropped significantly this year, showing more\nsoftening than the unemployment rate implies. Layoffs have edged up from low levels and could\nrise quickly if the economy weakens further since hiring rates have remained low. One\nconsequence of a less dynamic labor market this year is the significant increase in the number of\nlong-term unemployed workers.\nPayroll employment growth has been concentrated in just a few services industries that\ntend to be less affected by the business cycle, with healthcare, social services, and leisure and\nhospitality more than accounting for all job gains since April. The share of industries with\n\n- 4 -\npositive job growth over the last six months dropped below 50 percent in August to a historically\nlow level.\nActual payroll employment may have started to fall in recent months given the sizable\nupward bias in the published data implied by the Q1 Quarterly Census of Employment and\nWages report. Although less immigration likely explains some of the slower payroll gains and\neconomic growth this year, immigration does not fully explain the slowing. The surge in\nimmigration likely boosted the rise in unemployment through mid-2024, and lower immigration\nmay now be masking a steeper rise in unemployment this year. In addition, these immigrants\nlikely make a smaller contribution to economic activity than the average U.S. worker, as they\ntend to work in jobs and industries with lower wages and lower productivity.2\nOn price stability, we have seen some progress in lowering inflation, excluding one-off\ntariff effects on goods prices. Based on the latest consumer and producer price reports,\n12-month core PCE inflation likely stood at 2.9 percent in August. However, after removing\nestimated tariff effects, core PCE inflation has hovered around 2.5 percent in recent months,\nwhich is significant progress and within range of our target. This progress reflects a considerable\nslowing in core services inflation, which is consistent with recent softness in consumer spending\nand the labor market no longer being a source of inflation pressures.\nThe underlying trend in core PCE inflation appears to be moving much closer to our\n2 percent target than is currently shown in the data. With housing services inflation on a\nsustained downward trajectory, and further progress on other categories within core services\n2 See George Borjas (2015), “The Slowdown in the Economic Assimilation of Immigrants: Aging and Cohort\nEffects Revisited Again,” Journal of Human Capital, vol 9 (4), pp. 483–517; and Congressional Budget Office\n(2024), Effects of the Immigration Surge on the Federal Budget and the Economy (Washington: CBO, July).\n\n- 5 -\ninflation, only core goods inflation remains elevated, likely reflecting limited pass-through from\ntariffs.\nIn terms of risks to achieving our dual mandate, as I gain even greater confidence that\ntariffs will not present a persistent shock to inflation, I see that upside risks to price stability have\ndiminished. With softness in aggregate demand, and signs of fragility in the labor market,\nI think that we should focus on risks to our employment mandate and preemptively stabilize and\nsupport labor market conditions.\nMemories of pandemic worker shortages are still fresh, and businesses have so far chosen\nto maintain, rather than to reduce, their workforce in response to the slowing economic\nconditions. They also seem to be more willing to reduce profit margins as they are less able to\nfully pass through higher costs and raise prices given the weakness in demand. If demand\nconditions do not improve, businesses may need to begin to lay off workers, recognizing that\nit will not be as difficult to rehire given the shift in labor market conditions.\nOn trade policy, foreign suppliers are absorbing some of the new tariffs, and importers\nare shifting to lower-tariffed sources. Slack in the economy should also allow for only limited\none-time price effects this year and very little, if any, “second round” effects on inflation in the\nmedium term. I expect that lower immigration will continue to lessen demand and reduce\ninflation, especially on housing services. I also expect that less restrictive regulations, lower\nbusiness taxes, and a more friendly business environment are likely to boost supply and offset\nany tariff-related effects on economic activity and prices over the medium term.\nThe Policy Decision and the Path Forward\nSo far this year, even with inflation within range of our target, the Committee has focused\nprimarily on the inflation side of the dual mandate. Now that we have seen many months of\n\n- 6 -\ndeteriorating labor market conditions, it is time for the Committee to act decisively and\nproactively to address decreasing labor market dynamism and emerging signs of fragility. In my\nview, the recent data, including the estimated payroll employment benchmark revisions, show\nthat we are at serious risk of already being behind the curve in addressing deteriorating labor\nmarket conditions. Should these conditions continue, I am concerned that we will need to adjust\npolicy at a faster pace and to a larger degree going forward.\nI recognize and appreciate concerns that we have not yet perfectly achieved our inflation\ngoal. Because our dual mandate places equal weights on the two goals, we should turn our focus\ntoward the side of the mandate that is showing signs of deterioration or fragility even though\ninflation is above but within range of our target. This should be especially the case since\nforecasters widely expect inflation to significantly decline next year, and as further deterioration\nin labor market conditions would likely lead to more persistent damage to the employment side\nof the mandate that would be difficult to address with our tools.\nIn my role as monetary policymaker, I am agnostic about why shocks happen, I take\nconditions as they are, and I make monetary policy decisions to support the economy.\nThe credibility and effectiveness of the Federal Reserve depend on the public’s trust that we will\nnot bring a value judgment into our assessment of the underlying conditions.\nEconomic research is clear that, when conditions exist like those we are currently facing,\nmonetary policy should de-emphasize inflation. The U.S. economy is experiencing aspects of\na negative supply shock from higher tariffs that is also affecting aggregate demand. Since these\nconditions are unlikely to lead to persistent effects on inflation, and because changes in monetary\npolicy take time to work their way through the economy, optimal policy calls for looking through\ntemporarily elevated inflation readings. Therefore, we should proactively remove some policy\n\n- 7 -\nrestraint on aggregate demand to avoid damage to the labor market and a further weakening in\nthe economy, provided that long-run inflation expectations remain well anchored.\nIn addition, putting tariffs aside, the U.S. economy may also be experiencing an extended\nproductivity surge, in large part because of recent technological advances. And productivity\ngrowth has likely been higher than reported due to the downward benchmark revisions to payroll\ngains. These developments reinforce the case for removing policy restraint because monetary\npolicy should accommodate productivity shocks that raise potential output.\nIn light of all these considerations, in my view, it was appropriate to begin the process of\nmoving policy toward a more neutral stance at this meeting, and it has been for several months.\nIn thinking about the path forward, I supported revising the characterization of the policy outlook\nin the post-meeting statement. It is important we signal that last week’s action includes a\nforward-looking view of additional adjustments. If the statement had not included a reference to\nadditional cuts, it would have signaled to markets that the Committee would not be responsive to\nweakening labor market conditions.\nI am concerned that the labor market could enter into a precarious phase and there is a\nrisk that a shock could tip it into a sudden and significant deterioration. Characterizing an\nappropriate forward-looking view of additional policy adjustments is important because it shapes\nthe expected path of short-term interest rates, which, in turn, affects longer-term interest rates,\nincluding mortgage and corporate bond rates, that are key for household and business\ndecisionmaking. Cutting the policy rate 25 basis points and signaling additional adjustments at\nupcoming meetings should allow longer-term interest rates to remain materially lower than\nearlier this year and help to support the economy.\n\n- 8 -\nFinally, I should note that the rising downside risks to employment and the potential for\ngreater damage to the labor market underscore the need to shift our focus away from\noveremphasizing the latest data points. A strict interpretation of data dependence is inherently\nbackward looking and would guarantee that we remain behind the curve, requiring us to\novercorrect in the future. I think we should consider reframing our focus from overweighing the\nlatest data to a proactive forward-looking approach and a forecast that reflects how the economy\nis likely to evolve going forward. This approach would better position us to avoid falling behind\nthe curve and then having to implement abrupt and dramatic policy actions.\nDuring this intermeeting period, I will continue to carefully monitor the incoming data\nand information as the Administration’s policies, the economy, and financial markets continue to\nevolve. Before our next meeting in October, we will have received one additional month of\nemployment and inflation data. I will also continue to meet with a broad range of contacts to\ndiscuss economic conditions as I assess the appropriateness of our monetary policy stance going\nforward.\nIt is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course. At each FOMC\nmeeting, my colleagues and I will make our decisions based on each of our assessments of the\nincoming data and the implications for risks to the outlook, guided by the Fed’s dual-mandate\ngoals of maximum employment and stable prices.\nClosing Thoughts\nBefore we move on to the discussion, I’d like to touch on the supervision and regulatory\nwork underway. We have made a lot of progress in the past few months since I officially\n\n- 9 -\nbecame the Vice Chair for Supervision. And Congress has been hard at work considering\nimportant banking and digital assets legislation and the passage of the GENIUS Act.3\nIn addition to working to implement the Fed’s responsibilities under this law, we are\nmaking significant progress on a number of priorities in supervision and regulation. Early in my\ntenure, I described my approach that would require taking a fresh look at our activities.4\nWhile we are making progress in a number of areas, there is much left to do. Some of\nthis work will include improving the M&A process; reviewing the appropriateness of capital\nrequirements for all banks, including revising the community bank leverage ratio and approaches\nfor mutual banks; and addressing payments and check fraud (our request for information\ncomment period ended last week). We are continuing to enhance examiner training and\ndevelopment, and we will continue to prioritize economic growth and safety and soundness in\nthe bank regulatory framework. I look forward to sharing details with you during our discussion.\nThank you again for the invitation to join you today. It’s a pleasure to spend time with\nour nation’s community bankers.\n3 The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act was enacted on July 18, 2025.\n4 Michelle W.

    "text": "For release on delivery\n11:00 a.m. EST\nNovember 9, 2023\nRemarks on the Economy and Prioritization of Bank Supervision and Regulation\nby\nMichelle W. Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nNew York Bankers Association’s Financial Services Forum\nPalm Beach, Florida\nNovember 9, 2023\n\nIt is a pleasure to join you this morning for the New York Bankers Association’s\nFinancial Services Forum.1 I look forward to hearing your perspectives on the economy,\nthe financial system, and, more recently, the Federal Reserve’s regulatory reforms which\nhelp to shape my perspective on these issues. This month marks five years since I joined\nthe Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Over the years, I have drawn\nheavily upon my experience as a former state bank commissioner and a banker in\ncarrying out my responsibilities, especially as they relate to bank supervision, payments,\nand consumer and community affairs. This perspective informs my views about evolving\nbank regulations and the real-world impact that changes can have on financial\ninstitutions, their local communities, and the broader U.S. economy.\nAs you know, the federal regulatory agenda has been very active lately, with a\nsignificant volume of rules, guidance, and supervisory reforms either recently published\nor in the pipeline. Today, I will offer my thoughts on some of these developments, to lay\na foundation for a discussion about the vital importance of the prioritization of\nsupervisory and regulatory approaches for the banking system. As the agencies move\nforward with an active and potentially disruptive reform agenda, we should pause, reflect\nupon these changes, and ask several questions: Are these reforms efficient? In totality,\ndo they work together to enhance the regulatory framework, resulting in a rational and\nefficient framework? Are the reforms within the scope of our statutory authority? Have\nwe met the appropriate standards of due process and public engagement? And, given the\n1 The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee or the Board of Governors.\n\n- 2 -\ncurrent economic and banking landscape, are we focusing on the appropriate regulatory\nand supervisory priorities?\nBefore I dig a bit deeper into these questions, including the critical importance of\nprioritizing supervisory and regulatory actions, I’d like to offer a few thoughts on the\neconomy and monetary policy.\nAfter sharply tightening monetary policy over the past year and a half to reduce\ninflation, at our November meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) voted\nto maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent and continued\nthe run off of the Fed’s securities holdings.\nWe have seen considerable progress on lowering inflation, but inflation remains\nhigh and recent readings have been uneven. The latest personal consumption expenditure\n(PCE) inflation index data showed 12-month changes in total and core inflation of 3.4\npercent and 3.7 percent, roughly similar to the previous month’s reading. However, some\ncomponents of core services inflation have picked up, and I see a continued risk that core\nservices inflation remains stubbornly persistent. In my view, there is also a risk that\nhigher energy prices could reverse some of the progress made to bring overall inflation\ndown.\nThe economy has remained strong as the FOMC raised the federal funds rate, and\nrecent data indicate that economic activity has accelerated with real gross domestic\nproduct (GDP) growing at a 4.9 percent annual rate in the third quarter. Consumer\nspending has also accelerated, and the housing sector appears to be continuing to\nrebound.\n\n- 3 -\nThe latest employment report showed a labor market with healthy job gains. Over\nthe past year, labor force participation has improved with the average pace of job gains\nslowing somewhat, a sign that labor market supply and demand may be coming into\nbetter balance.\nThroughout the past few years, we have seen continued significant data revisions,\nwith the most recent of these revisions reflecting significant changes to employment data.\nJob gains in prior months were revised lower, but average hourly earnings for the past 12-\nmonths were revised higher. The frequency and extent of data revisions make the task of\npredicting how the economy will evolve even more challenging, and I will continue to\nmonitor these data carefully.\nWhile I continue to expect that we will need to increase the federal funds rate\nfurther to bring inflation down to our 2 percent target in a timely way, I supported the\nFOMC’s decision last week to hold the target range for the federal funds rate at the\ncurrent level as we continue to assess incoming information and its implications for the\noutlook. Currently, the federal funds rate appears to be restrictive, and financial\nconditions have tightened since September.\nSome of this tightening has occurred through longer-term bond yields, which can\nbe volatile over time as conditions change. For example, since the November FOMC\nmeeting, the 10-year Treasury yield has declined by around 35 basis points, or a bit more\nthan half of the increase in the 10-year yield since our September meeting. A variety of\nmodels attribute a significant portion of the increase in longer-term yields to higher term\npremiums. There are a number of potential factors that may be influencing term\npremiums, including an improved economic outlook, higher Treasury debt issuance,\n\n- 4 -\nconcerns about future inflation risk, and higher uncertainty about the future path of the\neconomy and monetary policy. Any or all of these factors may contribute to the\nmovement of longer-dated yields. I will continue to monitor these and the broader\nfinancial conditions to observe changing conditions and any potential effects on\neconomic activity and inflation and to better understand the implications for appropriate\nmonetary policy.\nI am also closely watching liquidity conditions and Treasury market functioning,\nwhich have held up well so far even amidst large movements in yields. The U.S.\nTreasury market plays a central role in the transmission of monetary policy, in financing\nthe federal government, and in providing safe and liquid assets to support the flow of\ncapital and credit to households and businesses. Treasury market liquidity strains could\nbe amplified and spill over to related financial markets if longer-dated Treasury securities\nexperience an abrupt selloff and investors reposition their portfolios in response to a rapid\nincrease in long-term Treasury yields. Financial market volatility spurred by additional\ngeopolitical shocks could further strain financial market functioning. These risks could\nbe exacerbated if bank holding company-affiliated market makers experience balance\nsheet constraints during periods of volatility. It is also important that Treasury markets\nremain resilient and stable.\nMore broadly, I believe we should keep in mind that we don’t yet know the\neffects of tightened financial conditions on economic activity and inflation. There is an\nunusually high level of uncertainty regarding the economy and my own economic\noutlook, especially considering recent surprises in the data, data revisions, and ongoing\n\n- 5 -\ngeopolitical risks. But I will be closely watching the incoming data as I assess the\nimplications for the economic outlook and appropriate monetary policy.\nIt is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course. My\ncolleagues and I will make our decisions at each meeting based on the incoming data. I\nremain willing to support raising the federal funds rate at a future meeting should the\nincoming data indicate that progress on inflation has stalled or is insufficient to bring\ninflation down to 2 percent in a timely way. Returning inflation to the FOMC’s 2 percent\ngoal is necessary to achieve a sustainably strong labor market and an economy that works\nfor everyone.\nI will turn now to address recent developments in the ongoing reform of the bank\nregulatory framework. While this is by no means a comprehensive list of all recent\nreforms—or more that may come in the months ahead—I will share some thoughts on\ncapital requirement reforms; the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA); the cap on debit\ninterchange fees; and climate guidance. I will also share my perspectives on the vital\nimportance of prioritization of supervisory and regulatory actions by regulators. It is\nessential that our actions are driven by data and are specifically designed to address core\nbanking risks or existing shortcomings in our bank regulatory framework.\nCapital Requirements Reform\nIn July of this year, the federal banking agencies proposed significant reforms to\ncapital requirements for banks with more than $100 billion in assets. Although many\nbanks would not be directly affected based on their asset size, the proposal could have a\nsignificant impact on the U.S. banking market and economy.\n\n- 6 -\nThe proposal would increase total risk-weighted assets across bank holding\ncompanies subject to the rule by an estimated 20 percent. These impacts would vary\nbased on firm-specific attributes—but not by asset size. I have spoken in the past about\nmy concerns with the quantitative and analytical foundations of this proposal. It is not\ndesigned to address identified regulatory deficiencies and shortcomings and gives\ninsufficient attention to the potential unintended consequences and harm that could result\nif finalized and implemented in its current form.\nIn drafting the Basel III capital proposal, it seems clear that the agencies made\nbroad assumptions that the current capital framework is insufficient to support bank and\nfinancial market activity. So, as a part of my remarks today, I will address the current\nstate of capital in the banking system, concerns with the proposed changes to the capital\nframework, and the path forward for fair and efficient capital reform.\nCurrent State of the Banking System\nTo begin, the U.S. banking system remains strong and resilient. The system is\nmuch better capitalized than after the 2008 financial crisis, with substantially more\nliquidity. U.S. banks are also subject to a range of new supervisory tools that did not\nexist prior to 2008. The current framework represents a risk-based, tailored approach,\nwhich strives to align regulation with institution and activity risk, fulfilling the\ncongressional mandate to tailor the prudential regulatory framework.2 The current level\nof capital in the U.S. banking system is a strength, not a weakness, which is\ncomplemented by liquidity regulations and other prudential requirements that have\n2 Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, Pub. L. No. 115-174, 132 Stat.\n1296 (2018).\n\n- 7 -\ncontributed to the resilience of U.S. banks. These banks also continue to play an\nimportant role in the U.S. economy by extending credit, providing banking and payment\nservices, and participating in U.S. securities and derivatives markets. Context matters,\nand when we discuss changes to the bank regulatory framework—including through\nchanges to capital requirements—we need to understand the direct and indirect\nconsequences that may result.\nPotential Consequences of Capital Reform\nOne of the key questions I ask when considering regulatory proposals is whether\nthe benefit of the change outweighs the costs of implementation, both for the financial\ninstitutions subject to the proposal and for the broader economy.\nOn a simplistic level, higher capital levels make the banking system safer. But\nthis must be the beginning of the analysis, not the definitive end. Increased safety comes\nat a cost, and the business of banking is built upon risk. The complete elimination of risk\nwould transform a bank into a public utility. Assuming this is not the desired end state of\nthe banking system, we must evaluate a proposal’s merit by thoroughly understanding the\nbalance between these benefits and the resulting costs.\nAs I noted earlier, the U.S. banking system continues to be much better\ncapitalized than before the 2008 financial crisis. That capital cushion has broadly\nenhanced the resiliency of the banking system through business, economic, and interest\nrate cycles, enabling the banking system to continue supporting the U.S. economy, even\nthroughout the pandemic and the related economic stress.\nWhile the full extent of “costs” under the proposal are not entirely clear, in the\naggregate, those costs—including the direct costs experienced by banks, and the indirect\n\n- 8 -\ncosts experienced by bank customers and the U.S. economy—would be substantial.\nCapital increases of this magnitude are likely to have a detrimental impact on U.S. market\nliquidity and lending, and firms without sufficient scale are likely to exit certain markets.\nIncreased capital requirements for certain types of loans may also lead to reduced credit\navailability or increased cost of credit, which could disproportionately harm underserved\nmarkets, businesses, and communities. Ultimately, bank customers will bear the cost of\nthese increases.\nThe Path Forward for Capital Reform\nWhat does the path forward entail? The agencies have received substantial initial\npublic feedback, and in response, have extended the comment period into mid-January\n2024. The agencies have also engaged in a parallel effort to gather more information\nabout the potential impact of the proposal’s approach and calibrations. These actions\nreflect an important recognition of the proposal’s length and complexity and are certainly\na positive step. While it would be impossible to highlight all the issues in the proposal\nthat raise concerns in my remarks today, I will note several areas that will be necessary to\naddress:\n• Redundancy in the Capital Framework. The proposal does not include\nan analysis of the appropriate aggregate level of capital requirements.\nThis consideration is important since many of the existing enhanced\ncapital standards that apply for U.S. banks were contemplated and\nfinalized while the prudential regulation framework, including capital and\nliquidity rules, were still under development. For example, there are\nknown overlaps and redundancies among the new market risk and\noperational risk requirements, and the stress capital buffer.\n• Calibration of the Market Risk Capital Rule. The revisions to the\nmarket risk rule alone will increase risk-weighted assets from $430 billion\nto $760 billion for Category I and II firms, and from $130 billion to $220\n\n- 9 -\nbillion for Category III and IV firms.3 These increases are significant,\nwith broad-based impacts, affecting business and municipal financing, risk\nmanagement, hedging of foreign exchange and interest rate risk, or\nmanaging the risks of fluctuating commodity prices through hedging\nactivities.\n• Inefficiency of Two Standardized Capital Stacks. Firms subject to the\nnew risk-based capital rule would remain subject to the standardized\napproach applicable to all firms, resulting in a “dual-stack” capital\ncalculation, with the firm required to use the lower capital ratio. This\napproach will add complexity to the capital calculation for all firms, but it\nwill be especially cumbersome for Category III and IV firms, applying a\none-size-fits-all approach for these smaller firms despite the variation in\ntheir risk, size, business models, and complexity, likely resulting in costs\nthat outweigh the benefits of this provision.4\n• Punitive Treatment of Fee Income. The proposal adopts a punitive\ntreatment for noninterest and fee-based income through the proposed\noperational risk requirements, coupled with an internal loss multiplier.\nImposing this type of capital charge for operational risk can deter banks\nfrom diversifying revenue streams, even though this can enhance an\ninstitution’s stability and resilience.\n• Missed Opportunity to Review Leverage Ratio Requirements. The\nproposal does not address or propose changes to leverage requirements,\nincluding the 5 percent leverage ratio that applies to U.S. global\nsystemically important banks, commonly referred to as the enhanced\nsupplementary leverage ratio (or eSLR). Treasury market intermediation\ncan be disrupted by constraints imposed by the eSLR, as occurred during\nthe early days of market stress during the pandemic. It seems prudent to\naddress this known leverage rule constraint before future stresses emerge\nthat would likely disrupt market functioning.\nPolicymakers may disagree about the best choices to further supervisory goals,\nbut we have an obligation to understand and assess the true cost of reform, going beyond\nthe direct costs to banks and their customers to include the potential harm to U.S. bank\ncompetitiveness in the global economy. As I have noted previously, unless we consider\n3 See Regulatory Capital Rule: Large Banking Organizations and Banking Organizations with Significant\nTrading Activity, 88 Fed. Reg. 64,028, at 64,168 (proposed September 18, 2023),\nhttps://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2023-09-18/pdf/2023-19200.pdf.\n4 Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, Pub. L. No. 115-174, 132 Stat.\n1296 (2018).\n\n- 10 -\nreforms with a thorough understanding of their combined and aggregate impact on the\ninstitutions subject to the revised regulatory framework, we create a significant risk of\narriving at a capital end state that is inefficient, contradictory, and potentially harmful to\nbanks, their customers, and the broader economy.\nI also want to briefly address the role of international coordination in establishing\ncapital standards both in the United States and around the world. International bodies\nand agreements can help foster the creation of similar regulatory frameworks across\njurisdictions. Significant banking activities occur in the international and cross-border\ncontext, and we know that financial stability risks can spread throughout global financial\nmarkets. By engaging in international coordination, U.S. regulators can promote\nminimum standards across jurisdictions, and these minimum standards can improve\ncompetitive equity in banking markets and make the financial system safer.\nWhile the capital proposal reflects elements of the agreed upon Basel standards, it\nis not a mere implementation of the Basel standards. In this proposal, the calibration—\nwith a large increase in capital requirements for U.S. firms—far exceeds the Basel\nstandards mandate. Instead, the scale of the increase is driven by deliberate policy\nchoices to significantly increase capital requirements for U.S. banks over $100 billion,\neven for those that are not internationally active. As we have seen since the proposal was\npublished, there has been growing support for improving the proposal’s quantitative,\nanalytical foundations, including the need for and impact of capital increases of this\nscale.\n\n- 11 -\nCommunity Reinvestment Act\nShifting away from capital rules, late last month, the federal bank regulators\nadopted a new final rule to implement the Community Reinvestment Act. The purpose of\nthe CRA is to improve access to credit in all communities where banks are located,\nespecially low- and moderate-income (LMI) communities. The CRA was enacted in\n1977 shortly after the civil rights movement and against the backdrop of other significant\nfederal laws designed to address financial inclusion and equal access to credit. I am a\nstrong supporter of these goals and the requirements that banks support their communities\nto the greatest extent possible. Unfortunately, as you know, my support for the important\ngoals of CRA did not translate into support for the final rule.\nWhile many positive changes are included in the rule, in my view those changes\nultimately did not outweigh its shortcomings, including that the agencies arguably\nexceeded the authority granted by the CRA statute. The rule is unnecessarily complex,\noverly prescriptive, and directs outcomes that result in disproportionately greater costs\nthan benefits, adding significantly greater regulatory burden for all banks, but especially\nfor community banks. Even the foundational question—are banks doing enough to\nsupport their communities?—is left unanswered in the final rule, perhaps because there is\nno evidence to support the agencies’ assumption that broadly speaking, banks are falling\nshort.\nScope and Impact on Community Banks\nFirst and foremost, the final rule applies the same regulatory expectations for\nsmall banks as it does for the largest banks. For example, a wide range of community\nbanks—those with more than $2 billion in assets—are treated as “large banks” under the\n\n- 12 -\nfinal rule, forcing these banks to comply with the same CRA evaluation standards as a\nbank with $2 trillion in assets. The lack of recognition that these banks are\nfundamentally different, with different balance sheets and business models, misses an\nimportant opportunity to appropriately tailor CRA expectations to a bank’s size, risk,\nservice area, and business model. This approach is a radical departure within the\nregulatory framework where no other provision considers a bank with $2 billion in assets\nas “large.”\nAs a result of this decision, many community banks will be subject to new and\nmaterially enhanced requirements, including a new retail lending test, significantly\nexpanded assessment areas, and increased data and reporting obligations. As I made\nclear throughout the development of the original proposal and final rule, instead of\nrequiring these changes, community banks should have had the option, at their discretion,\nto opt into the new retail lending test and assessment areas, or to continue with the\nexisting framework. The significant increases in burden and cost associated with these\nchanges are simply disproportional when applied to community banks, in a way that may\nconstrain the resources community banks can devote to supporting their communities.\nLack of Congressional Authorization\nThe final rule also arguably exceeds the authority granted by Congress. While the\nfinal rule aspires to modernize the CRA to account for changes in the way banks\noperate—for example, aligning the rule with current practices of extending credit in\ncommunities, including through mobile and online banking—there are limits to what the\nbanking agencies can do. Congress alone has the power to modernize the CRA statute,\nincluding reflecting the variety of financial institutions that provide credit and financial\n\n- 13 -\nservices in their communities. In my view, some of the changes made by the agencies,\nincluding those that evaluate banks outside of their deposit-taking footprint, are likely\nbeyond the scope of our authority under the statute.\nClarity and Transparency\nIf these new standards were in place today, based on data from 2018 through\n2020, there would be a nearly tenfold increase in banks with a “Needs to Improve” CRA\nrating. In some ways, this highlights a fallacy underlying these rule changes: that the low\nnumber of banks with a “Needs to Improve” rating itself demonstrates that the standards\nof the CRA regulations have been too lax historically, ignoring the more plausible\nexplanation that banks work hard to support their communities. It is not appropriate for\nthe banking agencies to materially increase the requirements on banks, resulting in a\ndowngrade of currently satisfactory performance to “Needs to Improve,” without a\nthorough, data-supported analysis that justifies a recalibration evidenced by actual\nshortcomings in bank activities.\nUnintended Consequences and Other Problematic Provisions\nPerhaps most concerning about the final rule is that it may incentivize banks to\nreduce their support for certain communities, forcing them to pare back lending in areas\nwhere there is a need for credit accessibility. The addition of retail lending assessment\nareas and outside retail lending areas, coupled with a new requirement for large banks to\ninclude an entire county instead of a partial county as an assessment area, may ultimately\nincentivize firms to pull back lending.\nThere are many other areas of the rule that raise concern—including the odd new\npublication of already available HMDA data, expanded reliance on summary of deposit\n\n- 14 -\ndata, and an implementation period of two years, which is far too brief in light of the\nrule’s extraordinary complexity. While I have confidence that banks will make the best\nof this new rule, and continue to support their communities, I regret that the new final\nrule may complicate, and in some instances frustrate, the important goals of the CRA.\nInterchange Fee Cap Proposal\nAlso, late last month, the Federal Reserve proposed amending the regulatory cap\non debit card interchange fees. For many years, bankers have expressed significant\nconcern about external factors, like fraud, increasing the costs of supporting bank debit\ncard programs—concerns that could be exacerbated by a lower regulatory cap on\ninterchange fees. While the Board’s proposed rule suggests that it could result in benefits\nto consumers, I am concerned that the costs of this fee cap revision for consumers—\nthrough the form of increased costs for banking products and services—will be real,\nwhile the benefits to consumers—such as lower prices at merchants—may not be\nrealized.5\nAt its heart, the proposal is unfair to many issuers and in some ways regressive in\nits impacts. The proposed rule acknowledges the varied size, business models, and\nproduct offerings of banks subject to the interchange fee cap and yet aims to achieve\n“rough justice” by establishing a single cap that applies to all covered issuers. This\napproach will disadvantage lower-volume issuers.\n5 The Board memo discussing the proposed revisions to the interchange fee cap suggests that “[m]erchants,\n… may pass on some portion of their savings from lower interchange fees to consumers.” See Proposed\nRevisions to Regulation II’s Interchange Fee Cap,” memorandum, Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System, Reserve Bank Operations and Payment Systems and Legal Divisions, October 18, 2023, p.\n9, https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/boardmeetings/reg-ii-memo-20231025.pdf.\n\n- 15 -\nRetail banking is an essential, core function for many smaller issuers, so this\npricing dynamic may not ultimately lead them to abandon their debit card programs.\nUnder the proposed rule, a staggering one-third of bank issuers would not be able to\nrecover even the partial costs that factor into the interchange fee cap. For banks that\noperate debit card programs at a loss, presumably those costs will need to be recovered\nelsewhere, such as through higher borrowing costs for bank customers or through other\nfees for services provided, which are also targeted by the banking agencies for\nelimination. Higher borrowing costs or fees could be particularly harmful for low-\nincome customers who may not qualify for credit card products or other alternatives, as\nbanks may be forced to discontinue their lowest-margin products, including options\ndesigned to increase financial inclusion and access for LMI individuals and families. I\nsincerely hope that this is not the case, but it is a real and important risk.\nI also want to note one other element related to the proposal. The proposal\napplies only to a subset of issuers—those with more than $10 billion in assets—but I\nexpect the fee cap will continue to affect a broader range of issuers, including community\nbanks and small credit unions. Issuers of all sizes use the same payment rails, and\nsmaller issuers will inevitably face some pricing pressure, at least indirectly, from the\ninterchange fee cap.\nUltimately, the net result of this proposal may be to simply shift costs from\nmerchants to bank customers, and to make those costs far less transparent (for example, if\nthose costs are recovered through higher loan interest rates). Of course, this proposal has\nbeen published for public comment, and my colleagues and I welcome public feedback\n\n- 16 -\non the proposal, particularly on the impacts it may have on financial institutions,\nincluding those not directly subject to the rule.\nClimate Guidance\nOn October 24, the Federal Reserve—in conjunction with the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency—published\nguidance directing banks’ approach to climate-related financial risks. The final guidance\nwill create confusion about supervisory expectations and will result in increased\ncompliance cost and burden, without a commensurate improvement to the safety and\nsoundness of financial institutions or to the financial stability of the United States. This\nis another regulatory action that raises questions about need and legal basis, but also\nabout whether the focus of reforms is appropriate in the current economic and\nsupervisory environment. This guidance represents a departure from sound banking\npolicy and potentially a distraction from more important risk-management objectives.\nWhile the guidance adopts a specialized regime for climate risks, it does not\nexplain why this unique treatment for climate risks is warranted. Without taking stock of\nrisk-management practices today and evaluating whether it is appropriate as it comes to\nclimate-related financial risks—essentially without identifying a problem statement—the\nguidance goes directly to solutions that are at once unclear and expensive, without clearly\npromoting safety and soundness or U.S. financial stability.\nUnder the guidance, banks must monitor and measure climate-related risks over\nindefinite time horizons and “develop strategies, deploy resources, and build capacity to\nidentify, measure, monitor, and control for climate-related financial risks.” The guidance\nincludes few specifics about this data collection expectation—which surely will expand\n\n- 17 -\nover time—nor does it clarify how banks are intended to integrate this new information\ninto risk-management programs and policies, and even into lending decisions. Indeed,\nthe guidance adopts an intentionally vague standard, with an expectation that data\ncollection and the planning horizon for “scenario analysis” to probe on such risks may\nextend “beyond the financial institution’s typical strategic planning horizon.” And yet,\nthe benefit of requiring banks to plan for events that occur far into the future seems\nlimited, as long-dated predictions about the future are likely to be highly speculative and\nheavily influenced by the underlying assumptions, and therefore of limited or no utility to\nthe bank in managing risk. This approach is a significant departure from existing\nsupervisory standards and includes no explanation for the deviation from normal\nsupervisory time horizons.\nIn addition to being unclear, the guidance will surely be expensive to implement.\nThe costs to implement new data collections will be substantial not only to institutions\nattempting to comply with uncertain elements of the guidance, but also to bank customers\nthat will be asked to provide more information when seeking credit or other banking\nproducts. One likely potential consequence could be to discourage banks from lending\nand providing financial services to certain industries, forcing them to seek credit outside\nof the banking system from nonbank lenders. This will undoubtedly result in decreasing\nor eliminating access to financial services and increasing the cost of credit to these\nindustries.\nI have every confidence that banks will work diligently to try to understand the\nexpectations created under the agencies’ climate guidance and will craft an approach that\nworks—despite the uncertainty the guidance itself creates. However, looking to the\n\n- 18 -\nfuture, I am concerned that the scope of this guidance—which is limited to banks with\nover $100 billion in assets—will trickle down to far smaller institutions by treating\napproaches adopted by large banks as “best practices” for banks of all sizes, resulting in a\nmuch higher regulatory burden for these firms.\nI am also concerned that the actions taken by banks to manage climate risk could\nhave unintended consequences for LMI communities, including increasing the cost of\ncredit or reducing credit availability in those communities. Oddly, while the guidance\nacknowledges this concern, it does not emphasize the obligations banks have under the\nCRA to help meet the credit needs of the communities in which they do business,\nespecially in LMI communities.\nWhile climate change is an important public policy issue in the United States and\nglobally, the Federal Reserve has limited, narrowly focused mandates and responsibilities\nthat are established by statute. These mandates and responsibilities do not extend to\nclimate policymaking.6 Although the climate guidance nominally focuses on climate-\nrelated “financial risks,” I am concerned that the guidance could be used by the Federal\nReserve and other federal banking agencies to pursue climate policies leveraging the\nopacity of the supervisory process, even though such actions would clearly exceed the\nstatutory authorities given to the Board by Congress.\nPrioritization of Regulation and Supervision\n6 While the climate guidance was released shortly after the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s\npronouncements about net-zero financing and investment, the climate guidance is silent about “net-zero”\ncommitments. See U.S. Department of the Treasury, Principles for Net-Zero Financing & Investment\n(Washington: U.S. Treasury Department, September 2023),\nhttps://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/NetZeroPrinciples.pdf.\n\n- 19 -\nI’d also like to spend a few minutes on a topic that has been an undercurrent\nthroughout my remarks so far: prioritization of supervisory and regulatory actions. In\nmy view, it is essential that regulators appropriately calibrate and prioritize their\nsupervisory and regulatory actions. Failing to do so could distract banks, bank\nmanagement, supervisors, and regulators from focusing on key risks.\nAs I noted earlier, the banking system remains strong and resilient, and banks are\nmuch better capitalized, with substantially more liquidity compared to 2008. The\nbanking agencies also have substantially more tools available than they did two decades\nago. Yet, in light of recent actions taken by regulators, some could be led to question\nwhether this was truly the case. We have seen several complex and lengthy proposals,\nrules, and guidance that do not relate to core banking risks and many other regulatory\nactions that do not appear to be designed to address shortcomings in our existing bank\nregulatory framework. In addition, our supervisory posture may have overcorrected\nrelative to the risks that some institutions may face following the banking stress earlier\nthis year.\nOn supervision, the primary focus of supervision should be to address a bank’s\ncritical shortcomings in a timely way. To effectively support a well-functioning and\nstable banking system, bank supervision must not simply pinpoint compliance issues,\nfailed processes, or rule violations. Instead, bank supervision must focus on a bank’s risk\nexposures, while prioritizing core safety and soundness issues in the context of the bank’s\nfinancial condition. If the supervisory process fails to identify and escalate critical risks\nor to hold management accountable for known deficiencies, such as excess interest rate\nrisk taking, that raises the potential for supervisory shortcomings, including impacting the\n\n- 20 -\nability of supervisors to anticipate how changes in the economy or banking sector could\naffect a bank’s condition.\nAt the same time, I have also heard reports, including from a number of state\nbanking regulators, that some recent supervisory actions are excessive in light of the risks\nposed by certain smaller institutions. These reports of increased scrutiny, including on\ncommunity and smaller regional banks—banks that were not responsible for the banking\nstresses earlier this year—are concerning, as they could undermine the nature of joint\nsupervision between state and federal supervisors under the dual banking system.\nOverzealous supervision is just as problematic as inattentive supervision. If banks are\noverwhelmed with remediating issues that do not relate to core supervisory risks, bank\nmanagement may be distracted from key risks. It is essential that supervisors focus on\nkey and critical issues.\nWe have seen a significant number of regulatory and guidance changes this year\ncompressed into a very short time frame. These changes do not appear to be prioritized\nbased on known shortcomings or deficiencies in our existing regulatory framework.\nSeveral of the rules I just discussed demonstrate that we have missed the mark on\nprioritizing our regulatory agenda. Instead, some of our actions could distract bank\nmanagement from focusing on important and key risks.\nThe Board’s new climate guidance is emblematic of this, but it is not the only\nexample. While climate change is an important issue, climate change is not a core risk to\nthe safety and soundness of financial institutions. The lessons learned from supervisory\nfailures during the bank stress in the spring clearly illustrate that bank examiners and\nbank management should focus on core issues, like credit risk, interest rate risk, and\n\n- 21 -\nliquidity risk. I am concerned that focusing our regulatory reform and guidance efforts\non issues like climate change that do not represent core banking risks will only serve to\nfurther distract bank management and supervisors.\nFinally, regulatory reform can also pose significant financial stability risks. The\ncumulative effects of recent proposed and final rules remain to be seen, but these\nsignificant regulatory changes could present ongoing risks to the health of certain\ninstitutions and the U.S. banking system. Many of the rules will be costly and\nburdensome to implement and are not based on any identified deficiencies in our\nregulatory toolkit. For example, the Basel III proposal increases capital for the largest\nbanks, but there has yet to be a data-driven analysis demonstrating that capital levels in\nthe banking system are currently deficient or improperly calibrated. In addition, while\nthe CRA serves a tremendously important purpose, there was no urgency to finalize this\nrule at a time when we have yet to fully address potential shortcomings in our regulatory\nand supervisory tools stemming from the banking stress earlier this year.\nConclusion\nThe recent volume and materiality of new reforms implemented and under\nconsideration by the federal banking agencies is significant. The rules and guidance total\nover 5,000 pages since July. While the unintended consequences of these reforms may\nnot be clear at the outset, our ability to predict these consequences is even more limited\nwhen the reforms overlap or conflict. The sheer volume of change presents significant\nchallenges for banks, who will be required to prioritize the implementation of new and\nrevised requirements, with the risk of being distracted from more material concerns or\nsupervisory issues.\n\n- 22 -\nMy voting record on these proposals is a reflection of my concern about the path\nof regulatory reform, particularly in the wake of the bank failures and banking system\nstress earlier this year, which highlighted that some reforms may be warranted, where\nthey address specific problems or clearly identified shortcomings. Regulators, like banks,\nshould never shy away from improving and evolving as the underlying conditions evolve.\nBut taking our focus away from potentially more pressing matters, like interest rate and\nliquidity risk management, could result in supervisors and banks that are less prepared\nand able to deal with emerging stresses.\nIn my view, our regulatory agenda should focus on evolving conditions and data-\ndriven, identified risks. When we are distracted by risks and matters that are tangential to\nour mandates and areas of statutory responsibility, we may inadvertently miss other, more\npressing areas that require our attention.",

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nFed Communities—Keys to Opportunity in the Housing Market:\nResearch on Strategies for Preserving and Expanding Rental Housing Affordability\nWashington, D.C.\n(via webcast)\nSeptember 26, 2023\n\nWelcome, and thank you for joining us for the Federal Reserve’s Community\nDevelopment Research seminar series. This series enables the sharing of important\nresearch on economic conditions and opportunities in lower-income communities. We\nbelieve that conducting research to better understand these topics is an important way to\nfurther the goal of promoting an inclusive U.S. economy.\nThe theme of this year’s seminar is “Keys to Opportunity in the U.S. Housing\nMarket.” Today’s event is hosted by the Board of Governors and the Reserve Banks of\nPhiladelphia, Atlanta, and Minneapolis, and will focus on the affordability of rental\nhousing and exploring potential strategies to address this important issue.\nWe know that high-quality research can help us understand and address\nchallenging issues, so I appreciate that we are joined by researchers and practitioners to\ndiscuss their work on this important topic.\nIndividual economic well-being and financial stability are often associated with\naccess to stable, affordable housing. Those at the lower end of the income spectrum tend\nto face the most acute hardships.\nWe often find that renters face housing affordability challenges, in part because\nrenters typically have lower incomes than homeowners. In addition, the median renter\nalso tends to pay substantially more for housing as a percent of their income than many\nhomeowners. As a result, they tend to have less room in their budgets for discretionary\nexpenses, potentially leaving them more vulnerable to income disruptions or unexpected\nexpenses.\n\n- 2 -\nThe most vulnerable populations faced significant risks going into the pandemic,\nbut public policy interventions mitigated many of these risks. Some of these policies will\nbe discussed today.\nThe job losses experienced during the pandemic and other economic disruptions\nexacerbated concerns about ongoing rent affordability and delinquency, but fortunately,\nthose did not materialize. Looking back, and with the goal of informing future\npolicymakers facing similar circumstances, the pandemic experience provides a unique\nopportunity for housing researchers to gain valuable insight into the utility and efficiency\nof different policy actions.\nWhich programs were most effective in supporting renters throughout this period?\nWere some more cost-effective than others? What are their lasting impacts on rental\nmarkets from these policies and protections? Are the lessons from the pandemic unique\nto that experience? Our first panel will offer insights into these questions as we think\nabout how to prepare for future economic conditions.\nMore recently, renters and their families have struggled with inflation. Rents also\ngrew rapidly as we emerged from the pandemic. While rent inflation has eased, prices\nfor renters seeking new leases grew by 18 percent in 2021 compared to 2 percent in 2019.\nThis price growth has strained renters’ budgets. A common way to measure whether\nrenters are cost burdened is whether they pay 30 percent or more of their income on rent.\nWhile wages have also risen during this time, in 2021, the percent of renters\nfacing increasing cost burdens rose to 49 percent, up from 46 percent in 2019. These\nincreased cost pressures underscore the importance of the Federal Reserve’s efforts to\n\n- 3 -\nfight inflation, which can complement efforts to address other factors affecting rent\nprices, including increasing the supply of rental housing.\nThe rate of rent increases has come down from the extremes of 2021 as units built\nduring the pandemic-era construction boom have begun to hit the market. However, the\nmost recent data show that new lease prices remain more than 20 percent higher than they\nwere before the pandemic. This means that the average renter signing a new lease in\n2023 will pay over $200 more per month on rent than they would have in 2019. For\nsingle-family rental properties, the average listing costs even more, around $300 more\nper month on average for a new lease today as compared to just before the pandemic.\nThese rent increases can be particularly challenging, given that renters have long\nfaced difficulty with rent affordability. As of May, 65 percent of lower-income renters\nfound it difficult to meet usual household expenses, 6 percentage points higher than in\nMarch but below peak levels from the summer of 2022. According to the Board’s 2022\nSurvey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking, 17 percent of renters were behind\non their rent in the prior year, up from 10 percent in 2019. I look forward to learning\nmore from the panelists and their research and experiences to understand how public\npolicy can best address these issues.\nIn our second panel, we will learn about promising approaches to address longer-\nterm rental affordability issues. For example, how do state and local land-use regulations\nimpact the availability of low-cost housing? How would novel approaches to housing\ndevelopment increase supply and longevity of affordable units? Should practitioners\nconsider more comprehensive programs that include workforce development and\nfinancial literacy to help renters and their families achieve economic stability? Access to\n\n- 4 -\nstable, affordable housing is critical for economic well-being, and it provides an\nimportant foundation for an individual to fully participate in the economy.\nI hope that today’s discussion is valuable for all our panelists and participants. I\nam excited that we are able to facilitate an ongoing dialogue among this distinguished\ngroup of researchers and practitioners to share information and discuss policy challenges\nrelated to affordable rental housing.\nI hope that these conversations can lead to identifying evidence-based solutions to\nmeet the demand for affordable housing that is so crucial in maintaining vibrant\ncommunities. Thank you for joining us.",

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nvia prerecorded video\nat\n2024 New York Fed Regional and Community Banking Conference\nNew York, New York\nApril 18, 2024\n\nGood morning, it is really a pleasure to join you by video. I would like to thank\nSupervision at the New York Fed for inviting me to join you at this year’s Regional and\nCommunity Banking Conference. These forums enable us to continue our engagement\nwith bankers in the industry to address a variety of issues and challenges that exist in the\ncurrent banking environment. Some of the topics that will be covered today include\ncontingency funding, operational readiness, market uncertainties, and banking\ninnovations. I appreciate that you have joined us to discuss these and several other topics\non our agenda.\nBefore we get started, I would like to highlight a few areas of concern and\nidentify some changed supervisory expectations that may provide a useful backdrop for\nthe discussions.\nThe Banking Landscape and Risks Today\nOver the past few years, we have experienced a number of challenges around the\nworld and in the U.S. that have reverberated throughout the economy and have required\nbanks to confront and mitigate the associated risks—including the pandemic, a sharp rise\nin inflation with an associated rapid rise in interest rates, CRE market uncertainties due to\nchanging work and business preferences, increased third-party fintech engagement in the\nbanking industry, and the 2023 bank failures. Today, we find ourselves at an inflection\npoint in banking and financial services. Some traditional risks—like liquidity risk and\ninterest rate risk—have become a higher priority concern for banks and regulators, while\nother risks—like third-party risk and cybersecurity risk—continue to evolve and pose\nnew challenges. Bankers and regulators alike must consider how our reactions to these\nissues will impact the future of the banking system, and how safety and soundness,\n\n- 2 -\nconsumer protection, U.S. financial stability, and the ongoing and future role of banks\nwithin the U.S. financial system will be affected.\nBanks must ensure their risk-management frameworks appropriately identify,\nmeasure, monitor, and control for both existing and emerging risks. They must continue\nto innovate responsibly and ensure their risk-management frameworks account for novel\nproduct offerings both prior to implementation and as the service and customer\nengagement evolves.\nRegulators must consider the many tradeoffs in their approach to supervision and\nregulation to most effectively support banks as they embark upon and continue on this\njourney. In their quest to be agile by offering new services and responding to new and\nevolving risks, banks must have access to and understand the rules of the road. Similarly,\nsupervisors must be knowledgeable in how to appropriately identify, supervise, and\nregulate emerging risks. Regulators must encourage and support responsible innovation\nas banks expand their product offerings to serve the needs of their customers and\ncommunities.\nRisk Management and Contingency Funding\nShifting to contingency funding plans, given the expanding number of challenges\nand shocks that the economy has faced over the past few years, it is prudent for banks not\nonly to continue to evolve and update emergency planning activities in light of these\nrisks, but also to test their emergency plans.\nSince the banking stress and bank failures last spring, these risks have led to\nheightened liquidity risks for some firms. I understand that supervisors at the New York\nFed and across the Federal Reserve System have engaged with state member banks and\n\n- 3 -\nholding companies about appropriate risk management and have indicated that those\nplans should include emergency borrowing from the discount window if a bank’s\ncondition warrants a need for emergency liquidity. Last year, the Federal Reserve Board\nissued updated guidance noting that depository institutions should regularly evaluate and\nupdate their contingency funding plans.1\nAll banks should have emergency contingency funding plans in place. Liquidity\nplanning must include access to funding sources that can be utilized when they are most\nneeded, which may include borrowing from the Federal Home Loan Banks or from the\ndiscount window.\nHowever, as I’ve noted previously, while it may be appropriate for supervisors to\nencourage banks to establish and maintain contingency funding sources, test the\ncontingency funding plans, and evaluate whether those plans are adequate in the context\nof examination, supervisors are not bankers. And we must be cautious not to cross the\nline from supervisor to member of the management team and avoid interfering with the\ndecisionmaking of bank management. We must also ensure that liquidity requirements\nand supervisory expectations are commensurate with the bank’s size, complexity, and\nrisk profile.\nSupervisory Changes\nRegulators have an important role to play in ensuring the safety and soundness of\nthe banking system in light of evolving risks. These risks can be exacerbated by\n1 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, National\nCredit Union Administration, and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, “Agencies Update Guidance\non Liquidity Risks and Contingency Planning,” news release, July 28, 2023,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20230728a.htm.\n\n- 4 -\nshortcomings in bank supervision, as we saw last spring. These bank failures and the\nevents and circumstances surrounding them warrant review, self-reflection, and where\nnecessary, appropriately targeted changes to identified gaps in regulation and supervision.\nWe should carefully examine what is working and what can be improved in bank\nsupervision. In doing so, we must appropriately and effectively manage our supervisory\nprograms, teams, and expectations to ensure that efficient, effective, and consistent\nsupervision is implemented across our regulated entities according to a bank’s\ncomplexity, size, risk profile, and scope of activities. Conducting supervision in a\nmanner that respects due process and provides transparency around supervisory\nexpectations goes a long way in accomplishing these goals.\nWe should acknowledge that changes to supervisory expectations and processes,\ncoupled with the sheer volume of recent regulatory and supervisory reforms and proposed\nreforms, will undoubtedly present additional challenges and risks for banks. While some\nchanges to the supervisory process and priorities may be appropriate to promote a safe\nand sound financial system and enhance financial stability, having an appropriate focus\non the most salient risks is important for effective risk management and effective\nsupervision. We should be cautious that these changes do not distract banks or\nsupervisors from focusing on core and emerging risks or impair the long-term viability of\nthe banking system—especially for mid-sized and smaller banks.\nIn closing, I hope that today’s conference provides an opportunity for open and\nfrank conversations about prudent risk management and how we can work together to\nmaintain a safe and sound financial system.

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe Roundtable on the Lender of Last Resort: The 2023 Banking Crisis and COVID, sponsored\nby the Committee on Capital Markets Regulation\nWashington, D.C.\nApril 3, 2024\n\nToday’s roundtable comes at an opportune time, as we recently passed the one-year\nanniversary of the failures of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank.1 The long shadow\nof these bank failures, and the subsequent failure of First Republic, have prompted a great deal of\ndiscussion about the bank regulatory framework, including capital regulation, the approach to\nsupervision, and the role of tailoring, among other topics. It is my hope that our discussion today\nreviews and considers the appropriate role of the Federal Reserve in providing liquidity to the\nU.S. banking system and, of course, its role as the “lender of last resort” through the discount\nwindow and authority under section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act.\nI look forward to today’s panels and a deeper examination of important policy questions,\nincluding the lessons that should be learned from the banking system stress experienced last\nspring, the broader stress in financial markets during the COVID-19 crisis, potential approaches\nto operationally enhance and optimize tools like the discount window to more effectively meet\nindustry liquidity needs, and the importance of effective resolution mechanisms in the banking\nsystem.\nBefore the panels get into a “deep dive” on these policy issues, I would like to briefly\ntouch on three main themes: (1) the broader framework in which the Federal Reserve supports\nliquidity in the banking system, particularly how this function complements other regulatory\nrequirements and sources of liquidity; (2) how this function can be optimized to work within the\nevolving liquidity framework; and (3) the challenges we face in making the Federal Reserve’s\nliquidity tools, particularly the discount window, effective.\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nThe Federal Reserve’s Role in Banking System Liquidity\nThe complexity of the U.S. financial system makes it difficult to predict where the next\nstress (or in the worst case, the next crisis) will arise. While today’s event will focus on recent\nepisodes that required the Federal Reserve to employ its liquidity tools—the COVID crisis and\nthe early 2023 banking stress—it is helpful to consider how the Federal Reserve’s authority has\nevolved in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.\nLet’s review the historical context, which could be helpful for framing the discussion. In\n1913, Congress established the Federal Reserve at least in part to help address the pattern of\ncyclical financial panics and the ensuing economic turmoil that followed by allowing the Fed to\ncreate a more elastic money supply to meet demand for liquidity during times of stress. This\nauthority included tools like open market operations, later used as a tool for monetary policy.2\nSince its establishment, the Federal Reserve was granted the authority to engage in discount\nwindow lending.3 In addition, during the Great Depression, the Fed was given a broader set of\ntools to engage in emergency lending under section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act.4\nMore recently, in 2003, the Federal Reserve restructured its previous discount window\nlending programs and established the Primary Credit Facility (PCF) and Secondary Credit\nFacility.5 Primary credit enabled financially strong banks to obtain secured loans from the\ndiscount window at a penalty rate. The secondary credit provided discount window loans at a\nhigher rate, and with higher collateral haircuts and other more stringent terms than apply for\n2 Federal Reserve Act, ch. 6, 38 Stat. 251 (1913).\n3 Federal Reserve Discount Window, “General Information: The Primary & Secondary Lending Programs,”\nhttps://www.frbdiscountwindow.org/Pages/General-Information/Primary-and-Secondary-Lending-Programs.\n4 Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act was added by section 210 of the Emergency Relief and Construction Act\nof 1932, https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/title/reconstruction-finance-corporation-act-752.\n5 Mark Carlson and Jonathan D. Rose, “Stigma and the Discount Window,” FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System, December 19, 2017), https://doi.org/10.17016/2380-7172.2108.\n\n- 3 -\nprimary credit, to solvent institutions that did not qualify to borrow from the PCF.6 This\nevolution of the discount window function more closely aligned operations with a theory, often\nattributed to Walter Bagehot, that central banks should lend freely to solvent institutions against\ngood collateral, at a penalty rate of interest.7\nThe Fed used its lending tools extensively during the 2008 financial crisis. Relying\nheavily on discount window lending authority and emergency lending facilities under section\n13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, the Fed provided emergency liquidity to support individual\nfirms that were under severe stress, and to facilitate the flow of credit more broadly. Of course,\nthe financial crisis left a lasting imprint on many Americans who suffered significant economic\nharm, many of whom have not yet fully recovered. It also prompted Congress to review and\namend the Fed’s authorities through the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer\nProtection Act (Dodd-Frank Act).\nThe banking system today is stronger and more resilient than it was before the 2008\nfinancial crisis with significantly more capital and substantially more liquidity. U.S. banks are\nalso subject to a host of supervisory tools that did not exist prior to the Dodd-Frank Act, like new\nstress testing requirements.8 Many of the regulatory changes implemented at that time were\ndesigned to reduce the probability of large bank failures, but the statute also mandated other\nchanges designed to improve the likelihood that failing large banks could be resolved without\nbroad systemic disruptions.9 Of course, these changes were additive to existing authorities that\n6 Carlson and Rose, “Stigma and the Discount Window.”\n7 Walter Bagehot, Lombard Street: A Description of the Money Market (New York: Charles Scribner’s Sons, [1873]\n1897).\n8 12 U.S.C. § 5365(i) (2010).\n9 12 U.S.C. § 5365(d) (2010).\n\n- 4 -\nare meant to promote banking system resilience, particularly the other core element of the federal\nsafety net, deposit insurance.10\nCongress also made significant changes to the Fed’s emergency lending authority. For\nexample, section 13(3) facilities must now be broad-based, rather than designed only for\nindividual firms, and must be approved by the U.S. Treasury Secretary. In addition, loans can\nonly be made to solvent institutions, and there are new collateral and disclosure requirements.11\nFurther, while the Dodd-Frank Act preserved the Fed’s ability to make discount window loans to\neligible borrowers, including depository institutions and U.S. branches of foreign banks, it made\nsome modifications. Notably, one change that I will return to later is the new requirement that\ndiscount window lending is no longer confidential. These loans, including the names of\nborrowing institutions, are now required to be disclosed with a two-year lag.12\nChanges made by the new law and other subsequent changes have attempted to strike a\nbalance between making firms more resilient to stress and adding additional parameters to the\nFed’s liquidity tools. The complementary tools we have—the prudential bank regulatory\nframework, tools to promote banking system liquidity and stability, discount window lending\nand “lender of last resort” authority, and resolution tools—all contribute to the safety and\nsoundness of individual banks, and more broadly, to financial stability.\nBroadly defined, the challenge we face is that banking crises and banking stress can arise\nfrom unpredictable events. They can be the product of external events (like a global pandemic)\nor can arise from cascading failures of bank management and regulators to identify and\n10 The Dodd-Frank Act also increased the deposit insurance limit from $100,000 to $250,000. See Pub. L. No.\n111–203, 124 Stat. 1540 (2010), § 335; 12 U.S.C. § 1821(a)(1)(E).\n11 Dodd-Frank Act, Pub. L. No. 111–203, 124 Stat. 2113, 2118 (2010), §§ 1101 and 1103.\n12 Dodd-Frank Act, Pub. L. No. 111–203, 124 Stat. 2118 (2010), § 1103(b).\n\n- 5 -\neffectively address and mitigate the buildup of risk. This risk can occur at a single institution,\nlike we saw in the lead-up to the failure of SVB, or more broadly throughout the financial\nsystem, as we saw during the last financial crisis. When we consider banking system stress and\npotential crises in the broader context, our primary goal should always be prevention,\nparticularly so that we can avoid contagion risks that lead to financial instability and more\nsignificant government intervention. We should be reluctant to intervene in private markets,\nincluding using emergency government lending facilities to support private enterprises.\nThe federal safety net that covers the banking system—including discount window\nlending and deposit insurance—is meant to make the U.S. banking system and broader economy\nmore resilient. Where market disruptions affect liquidity, it is important that these tools—\nparticularly discount window lending—function effectively. So, we must ask whether there are\nsteps we can take to optimize the functioning of these tools and identify some of the key\nchallenges we face in making these tools effective, including preserving industry standard access\nto liquidity outside of the Fed’s tools for day-to-day liquidity management, like advances from\nthe Federal Home Loan Banks.\nOptimizing the Lender of Last Resort Function\nWhen we think about the Fed’s lender of last resort function, we must think about the\nbroader framework that supports bank liquidity, including liquidity regulation, bank supervision,\ndeposit insurance, and day-to-day liquidity resources. While my discussion today focuses\nprimarily on discount window lending, I will also briefly address design issues that we\nexperienced with the recently expired Bank Term Funding Program.\nI think we can all agree that the discount window remains a critical tool, but it does not\noperate in isolation. It operates to support bank liquidity, but it is an additional resource in the\n\n- 6 -\nfederal safety net that allows eligible institutions to weather disruptions in liquidity markets and\naccess other resources.\nFirst, there are questions about the utility of the discount window in light of its scope and\nthe evolution of the banking system. There are a limited set of entities that have access to\ndiscount window loans, including depository institutions and, in unusual or exigent\ncircumstances, designated financial market utilities.13 As activities continue to migrate out of the\nregulated banking system, what are the implications of more activity occurring outside the\nbanking system as it relates to the effectiveness of the discount window as a tool?\nSecond, are there ways in which the Fed can enhance the technology, the operational\nreadiness, and the services underpinning discount window loans to make sure that they are\navailable when needed? Here, the events in the lead-up to the failure of SVB are illuminating—\nSVB experienced difficulty in accessing the discount window before its failure. We must\nunderstand and evaluate these difficulties and determine whether there are improvements the\nFederal Reserve System can make to ensure the discount window is an effective tool to provide\nliquidity support. Are there operational issues that can be improved, whether by improving the\ntechnology or extending business hours for the discount window and other Reserve Bank\npayment services like FedWire® and ACH (automated clearinghouse), particularly during times\nof stress? The Federal Reserve System must also take a close look at our operational readiness\nand capacity. Banking stress can manifest quickly and outside of regular business hours in\ndifferent time zones, and we must make sure that the tools we have are available and prepared\n13 Federal Reserve Act, 12 U.S.C. 347b; and Dodd-Frank Act, 12 U.S.C. 5465(b). For designated financial market\nutilities, this would require an affirmative vote by a majority of the Board after consultation with the Secretary of the\nTreasury.\n\n- 7 -\nwith trained and experienced staff ready to deal with the evolving risks of liquidity stress and\npressure.\nFinally, are there changes that need to be made to support contingency liquidity on the\nborrower side? One prominent issue that has come to light recently is whether there should be\nsome form of pre-positioning requirement—whether banking institutions should be required to\nhold collateral at the discount window, in anticipation of the need for accessing discount window\nloans in the future.14\nArguably, requiring pre-positioning at the discount window may serve a variety of\npurposes. One use case is ensuring the system is efficient enough to allow borrowers to access\ndiscount window loans in a timely manner, including by getting collateral to the discount\nwindow to support loans. We have much work to do on this front. To fulfill its function, the\ndiscount window must be able to provide liquidity quickly. The failure of SVB demonstrated\nhow rapidly a run can occur and revealed that the discount window must be able to operate in a\nworld in which new technologies, rapid communications, and the growth of real-time payments\nmay exacerbate the speed of a bank run. Identifying and mitigating the technology and\noperational issues that affect the discount window should go a long way to addressing this\nconcern. Understanding that these problems exist and requiring pre-positioning of collateral at\nthe discount window may not fully address any technological and operational shortcomings of\nthe discount window.\n14 See Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael J. Hsu, “Building Better Brakes for a Faster Financial World”\n(speech at the Columbia Law School, January 18, 2024), https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/speeches/2024/pub-\nspeech-2024-4.pdf; and Working Group on the 2023 Banking Crisis, Bank Failures and Contagion: Lender of Last\nResort, Liquidity, and Risk Management (Washington: Group of Thirty, January 2024),\nhttps://group30.org/images/uploads/publications/G30_Lessons-23-Crisis_RPT_Final.pdf.\n\n- 8 -\nBut as a secondary matter, the notion of required collateral pre-positioning has also been\nproposed as a complementary liquidity requirement for banks, in part to ensure greater liquidity\ncertainty to balance perceived “runnable” funding sources, as with SVB’s significant proportion\nof uninsured deposits. While this could be an effective approach, we do not fully understand the\nconsequences of a new pre-positioning requirement or whether, given the unique nature of\nSVB’s business model and lax supervision, other institutions would have similarly runnable\nuninsured deposits or if this was an idiosyncratic event.\nFurther, would required pre-positioning of collateral impede a bank’s ability to manage\nits day-to-day liquidity needs (including from private sources at lower cost)? Would pre-\npositioning collateral increase operational risk, or otherwise change bank activities? Would\nthere be any unintended consequences from requiring banks to encumber more assets on their\nbalance sheets? More fundamentally—is a change of this magnitude, requiring a new daily\nmanagement of discount window lending capacity, necessary and appropriate for all institutions,\nor are there particular bank characteristics that may warrant this additional layer of liquidity\nsupport? These are all important but as yet unanswered questions that need to be explored and\nunderstood before imposing such a radical shift.\nCurrently, banks are not mandated to use the discount window to access liquidity. In\nfact, one of the core functions of bank management is to make the day-to-day decisions about\nhow the institution will manage liquidity and other responsibilities. While it may be appropriate\nfor supervisors to encourage banks to test contingency funding plans and to evaluate whether\nthose plans are adequate in the context of examination, we must be cautious to not cross the line\nfrom supervisor to member of the management team and to avoid interfering with the\n\n- 9 -\ndecisionmaking of bank management by mandating across-the-board changes in response to the\nfailure of a single unique institution.\nWe need to ask whether having one standardized set of rules for institutions with\ndifferent activities, risk profiles, and funding structures is the most efficient and effective way to\nsupport bank liquidity, particularly as we think about not only stressed conditions and liquidity\ndisruptions in the market, but also day-to-day management and activities.\nChallenges\nToday’s panels will delve into the challenges and design problems that we confront in\nthinking about liquidity support of the banking system, and the special role of the Federal\nReserve as lender of last resort. As a foundation for this discussion, I will briefly touch on a\nnumber of these challenges and issues.\nStigma\nA long-standing challenge to the utility of discount window borrowing is the perception\nof stigma. During times of stress, signs of banking sector weakness are often magnified through\nsmall and independent actions of institutions, which may add to the reluctance to borrow from\nthe central bank when other sources may be available. The perception of stigma existed long\nbefore the new Dodd-Frank disclosure requirements, and it is possible that public disclosure of\nthe borrowing—even with a two-year delay—may create a greater deterrent. Regardless of the\ntiming of the disclosure, the reality is that market participants have a strong interest in\nidentifying any public signals of bank financial health, including discount window lending.\nEven where the market is just making educated guesses about discount window lending (for\nexample, by looking at public-facing liquidity management activities of banking institutions), the\n\n- 10 -\nstigma risk can be an important consideration for banks trying to manage public perceptions of\ntheir financial condition.\nThe Federal Reserve cannot entirely eliminate discount window borrowing stigma\nthrough regulatory fiat. One of the key sources of stigma seems to be the spectrum of reasons\nthat a bank may choose to borrow from the discount window: the need for borrowing could be\ndue to market disruptions in the provision of liquidity or a scarcity in the total amount of reserves\nin the banking system but could also indicate a specific borrower’s growing financial stress. Of\ncourse, it is possible that a combination of factors may lead a bank to access the discount\nwindow—as stress on banking institutions builds, there may be a “pullback” on the ordinary\nliquidity tools banks use, accompanied by increased demands for liquidity.\nIn this context, discount window lending becomes one additional data point for the\nmarket to interpret—while the signal it may send is unclear, one can easily imagine that the\nmarket may be skittish and fixate on any sign of financial weakness. The broader issue,\nhowever, is the health of the banking system and particular financial institutions, which can be\naffected by a number of other factors. For example, as we saw with SVB, the public messaging\naround the sale of securities and the prospective capital raised were both public announcements\nthat altered the perception of the institution’s financial health and risk profile. In short, while\ndiscount window “stigma” is an important issue, it is a subset of a broader concern—the\nperception of the institution’s financial health—that each bank must confront as it manages its\nfunding resources, risk profile, and liquidity.\nAt the same time, we should explore ways that the Federal Reserve can work to mitigate\nstigma concerns. In some ways, the design of primary discount window credit, where a borrower\nmust meet financial standards for borrowing, suggest that the “market signal” of discount\n\n- 11 -\nwindow borrowing should perhaps speak more toward market liquidity disruption than an\nindividual institution’s financial condition. We should explore ways to validate the use of\ndiscount window lending in our regulatory framework. While the federal banking agencies have\nencouraged institutions to be prepared to access discount window loans, we should also seriously\nconsider whether we should finally recognize discount window borrowing capacity in our\nassessment of a firm’s liquidity resources, including in meeting a firm’s obligations under the\nLiquidity Coverage Ratio.15\nOne of the emerging arguments about how the Federal Reserve can mitigate stigma\nconcerns is simply by mandating that banks pre-position collateral and periodically borrow from\nthe discount window. The notion is that the “signaling” effect of discount window borrowing\nbecomes more muted when more participants are essentially forced to use it to meet a regulatory\nrequirement or a supervisory expectation. I question whether this approach will truly address the\nunderlying stigma concern.\nThe discount window has not historically functioned as a source of ordinary day-to-day\nliquidity for the banking system, but rather as a backup liquidity resource and it is priced as such.\nOur expectation should not be that the Federal Reserve replaces existing sources of market\nliquidity for banks in normal times. As a source of backup liquidity, the question becomes\nwhether requiring pre-positioned collateral would mitigate the stigma of drawing on the discount\nwindow. To be effective, banks must be willing to obtain discount window loans when needed,\n15 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, National Credit\nUnion Administration, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, “Agencies Update Guidance on Liquidity Risks\nand Contingency Planning,” news release, July 28, 2023,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20230728a.htm. “The updated guidance encourages\ndepository institutions to incorporate the discount window as part of their contingency funding plans. Consistent\nwith other contingency funding sources, the guidance reinforces the supervisory expectation that if the discount\nwindow is part of a depository institution’s contingency funding plans, the depository institution should establish\nand maintain operational readiness to use the discount window, which includes conducting periodic transactions.”\n\n- 12 -\nand it is not clear that required pre-positioning or even testing requirements will address the\nperceived stigma associated with a bank’s need to access the discount window for emergency\nliquidity purposes. The market will continue to take signal from a bank’s external activities in\nliquidity markets—and try to extrapolate whether a bank is using the discount window—and\ndraw a negative inference from this borrowing.\nBroad-based Approach to Bank Liquidity\nThe discount window is a small but important element of bank liquidity, but banks\nmanage liquidity in many ways for day-to-day business needs and during times of market stress.\nConsidering discount window reform narrowly ignores the interrelationships among various\nliquidity resources, liquidity requirements and regulations, and liquidity planning. Building\nresiliency in the financial system requires policymakers to think about these variables together,\nensuring that reforms are rational and contribute to a complementary liquidity framework.\nThe complexity of liquidity issues warrants a broad-based review before we embark on\npiecemeal changes. That review should endeavor to understand not only the need for reform, but\nalso the tradeoffs of different approaches, including the economic cost. However, the proposed\nchange raises many questions about not only cost and effectiveness, but also unintended\nconsequences.\nAnother example is the use of Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances by some\nbanks as a supplemental source of liquidity, and how this resource functions along the continuum\nof day-to-day liquidity management to instances of widespread stress in the banking system and\namong individual firms. The FHLBs are an important source of liquidity for many banks. At the\nsame time, the operational design of FHLB advances make these advances poorly suited to\nfunction as emergency liquidity support for the banking system. By contrast, the Fed’s discount\n\n- 13 -\nwindow lending authority, and the flexible authority to lend under section 13(3) of the Federal\nReserve Act, place the Fed well to function as the lender of last resort in support of banking\nsystem liquidity during times of stress.\nA Note on the Design of Emergency Lending Facilities: The Bank Term Funding Program\nBefore closing, I would like to briefly reflect on events we saw this winter, when design\nflaws with the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) were first identified. On March 12, 2023,\nthe Federal Reserve, with the approval of the Treasury Secretary, announced the creation of the\nBTFP, which was designed to make additional funding available to institutions to “help assure\nbanks have the ability to meet the needs of all their depositors.”16 This program was initially\nauthorized to make new loans for a full year, even though at the time, it was not clear that\n“unusual and exigent” circumstances would continue to exist for a full year that would warrant\nthe ongoing availability of loans under the program.17\nUnder the BTFP, eligible depository institutions were able to pledge Treasury securities,\nagency debt, and agency mortgage-backed securities—valued at par—to obtain one-year loans.\nThis program allowed institutions to avoid selling those assets to generate additional liquidity.\nBy valuing the collateral at par—when the market value had declined due to the rising interest\nrate environment—the program allowed eligible borrowers to obtain a greater amount of\nliquidity than they would have been able to by simply pledging collateral to the discount\nwindow.\n16 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Federal Reserve Board Announces It Will Make Available\nAdditional Funding to Eligible Depository Institutions to Help Assure Banks Have the Ability to Meet the Needs of\nAll Their Depositors,” news release, March 12, 2023,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20230312a.htm.\n17 See section 13(3)(A) of the Federal Reserve Act, 12 U.S.C. § 343(3)(A).\n\n- 14 -\nThese generous collateral terms were accompanied by generous rate terms and\nprepayment flexibility. As originally designed, the interest rate for loans under the program was\nset at the one-year overnight index swap rate, plus 10 basis points.18 Borrowers were also\nentitled to prepay loans at any time without penalty.19 As has been well documented, the\ncombination of these terms over time created a significant arbitrage opportunity, which the Fed\nsensibly cut off as the program was approaching the end of its term for originating new loans.20\nWe must learn from this experience. When we identify flaws in program design or ways\nto improve our tools in the future, we should avail ourselves of the knowledge we have learned\nthrough experience, including by shutting down an authorized section 13(3) facility when it is no\nlonger needed, and lending at a true penalty rate so the usage of the facility naturally declines as\nmarket conditions normalize.\nClosing Thoughts\nAs regulatory attention turns toward the liquidity framework and liquidity regulation, I\nexpect we will see a growing momentum to “do something” that would help address the banking\nstress from 2023. While some reforms may be necessary, we should think about the response to\nbanking stress more broadly.\n18 “Bank Term Funding Program,” Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, March 12, 2023,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/monetary20230312a1.pdf.\n19 “Bank Term Funding Program.”\n20 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Federal Reserve Board Announces the Bank Term Funding\nProgram (BTFP) Will Cease Making New Loans as Scheduled on March 11,” news release, January 24, 2024,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20240124a.htm. “As the program ends, the\ninterest rate applicable to new BTFP loans has been adjusted such that the rate on new loans extended from now\nthrough program expiration will be no lower than the interest rate on reserve balances in effect on the day the loan is\nmade. This rate adjustment ensures that the BTFP continues to support the goals of the program in the current\ninterest rate environment. This change is effective immediately.” See “How America Accidentally Made a Free-\nMoney Machine for Banks,” The Economist, January 18, 2024,\nhttps://www.economist.com/leaders/2024/01/18/how-america-accidentally-made-a-free-money-machine-for-banks.\n\n- 15 -\nWe should continue to focus on improving the targeted approach of supervision, to\nenhance the “prevention” of banking system stress. We should think about the liquidity\nframework in a broad-based manner to ensure that the available tools, resources, and\nrequirements are working in a complementary way. And we should understand what changes we\nneed to make discount window lending and other emergency lending programs more efficient\nand effective.\nThank you for the opportunity to take part in this important and timely discussion, and for\nthe participation of our esteemed panelists in this important event. I look forward to hearing the\npanelists’ perspectives.",

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nCalifornia Bankers Association\n2025 Bank Presidents Seminar\nLaguna Beach, California\nJanuary 9, 2025\n\nLet me begin by recognizing the devastation caused by the fires in the Los Angeles\narea. My thoughts and prayers are with those who have been impacted and the first responders\nwho are fighting to bring the fires under control.\nI would like to thank the California Bankers Association for the invitation to speak to you\ntoday.1 I appreciate the opportunity to reflect on the past year, on both the path of monetary\npolicy and the economy and on how this past experience can inform the bank regulatory agenda\nas we look ahead to a new year.\nIn light of the policy decisions at the last few Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)\nmeetings, I will begin by providing some perspective on my votes and then discuss my current\nviews on the economy and monetary policy.\nUpdate on the Most Recent FOMC Meetings\nAt the September meeting last year, the FOMC voted to lower the target range for the\nfederal funds rate, for the first time since we began tightening monetary policy to combat\ninflation, by 1/2 percentage point to 4-3/4 to 5 percent. Although I was unable to support such a\nlarge cut at that time, I did agree with the Committee’s assessment that it was appropriate to\nbegin the process of recalibrating policy to reflect the progress in both lowering inflation and\ncooling the labor market since the middle of 2023.\nMy dissent favored a smaller initial cut to begin the recalibration process and was the\nfirst FOMC dissent by a Board member in nearly 20 years. I explained my reasoning in a\nstatement published after the meeting that noted that moving the policy rate down too quickly\nwould carry the risk of unnecessarily stoking demand and potentially reigniting inflationary\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\npressures. In addition, since inflation continues to hover well above our 2 percent goal, there\nwas a real risk that the Committee’s large policy action could be interpreted as a premature\ndeclaration of victory on our price-stability mandate.\nAt both our November and December meetings, the Committee lowered the target range\nfor the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point, bringing it to 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent.\nI supported the December policy action because, in my view, it represented the Committee’s\nfinal step in the policy recalibration phase. The target range now reflects 100 basis points of cuts\nsince September, and the policy rate is now closer to my estimate of its neutral level, which is\nhigher than before the pandemic. But given the lack of continued progress on lowering inflation\nand the ongoing strength in economic activity and in the labor market, I could have supported\ntaking no action at the December meeting. Still, I am pleased that the post-meeting statement\ncontinued to reference a flexible and data-dependent approach for considering future policy\nadjustments. It is important that we remain focused on returning inflation to 2 percent.\nI expect that the coming months should bring clarity on the incoming administration’s\npolicies and the carry over of inflationary pressures from 2024, reflecting private spending\ndecisions and an apparent faster spend-out of existing federal government appropriations in\nrecent months. It will be very important to understand how these factors will affect economic\nactivity and inflation going forward.\nThe Economy Towards the End of 2024 and Risks to the Outlook\nThe U.S. economy remained strong through the end of last year, with solid growth in\neconomic activity and a labor market near full employment. However, core inflation remains\nelevated, and I continue to see upside risks to inflation.\n\n- 3 -\nThe rate of inflation declined significantly in 2023, but this progress appears to have\nstalled last year with core inflation still uncomfortably above the Committee’s 2 percent goal.\nThe 12-month measure of core personal consumption expenditures inflation—which excludes\nfood and energy prices—moved back up to 2.8 percent in October and November, only slightly\nbelow its 3.0 percent reading at the end of 2023. Progress has stalled since the spring of last year\nmostly due to a slowing in core goods price declines. Persistently elevated core inflation\ncontinues to reflect pressures on housing services prices, possibly due to an increase in demand\nfor affordable housing amid an inelastic supply. It also appears to be originating from a few\nother major components in recent months, such as in goods and in services with imputed prices.\nGross domestic product increased at a solid pace in the third quarter, maintaining the\nmomentum from the previous four quarters. Growth continued to be driven by private domestic\nfinal purchases, as personal consumption, and retail sales in particular, strongly increased in the\nthird quarter, more than offsetting further weakness in housing activity due to high mortgage\nrates. The latest data suggest continued strength in consumer spending in the fourth quarter as\nretail sales and sales of light vehicles continued to rise appreciably.\nPost-election consumer sentiment appears to be improving, but it remains well below pre-\npandemic levels likely because of higher prices. And since housing, food, and energy price\nincreases have far outpaced overall inflation since the pandemic, lower-income households have\nexperienced the negative impacts of inflation hardest, especially as these households have\nlimited options to trade down for lower-cost goods and services.\nThe most recent labor market report shows that payroll employment gains rebounded in\nNovember, following a temporary drag in October from hurricanes Helene and Milton and the\nBoeing strike. On balance, job gains averaged about 130,000 over those two months, a pace only\n\n- 4 -\nslightly below the average gains in the second and third quarters. The unemployment rate rose to\na still low 4.2 percent in November, but it has moved sideways since July. While unemployment\nis notably higher than in 2023, it is still at a historically low level and below my and the\nCongressional Budget Office’s estimates of full employment, and we will receive the December\nemployment report tomorrow.\nThe labor market has loosened from the extremely tight conditions of the past few years.\nThe ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers has remained close to the historically elevated\npre-pandemic level in recent months. But there are still more available jobs than available\nworkers, a condition that before 2018 had only occurred twice for a prolonged period since\nWorld War II, further signaling ongoing labor market strength. Wage growth remains indicative\nof a tight labor market and above the pace consistent with our inflation goal.\nThe rise in the unemployment rate last year largely reflected weaker hiring, as job seekers\nentering or re-entering the labor force took longer to find work, while layoffs remained low.\nAlthough there has been some cooling in labor demand and the labor force participation rate\ndeclined a bit further in November, the household survey may have failed to capture the usual\nseasonal hiring ahead of the holidays due to the unusually early survey week and the late\nThanksgiving holiday.\nMore concerningly, the labor market data have become increasingly difficult to interpret,\nas surveys and other measurements struggle to incorporate large numbers of new workers and to\naccurately account for other influences. As the dynamics of immigration and business creation\nand closures continue to change, it has become increasingly difficult to interpret the monthly\ndata from the payroll and household surveys. It is crucial that U.S. official data accurately\ncapture structural changes in labor markets in real time, such as those in recent years, so we can\n\n- 5 -\nmore confidently rely on these data for monetary and economic policymaking. In the meantime,\ngiven conflicting economic signals, measurement challenges, and significant data revisions, I\nremain cautious about taking signal from only a limited set of real-time data releases.\nTurning to the risks to achieving our dual mandate, I continue to see greater risks to price\nstability, especially while the labor market remains near full employment, but it is possible that\nwe could see a deterioration in labor market conditions. Global supply chains continue to be\nsusceptible to shocks, including labor strikes and increased geopolitical tensions, namely in the\nMiddle East, Eastern Europe, and Asia, which could result in inflationary effects on food,\nenergy, and other commodity markets.\nThe potential release of pent-up demand following the election, especially with\nimproving consumer and business sentiment, could also present inflationary risks, as could an\nincreased demand for housing given the long-standing limited supply, especially of affordable\nhousing. While it is not my baseline outlook, I cannot rule out the risk that progress on inflation\ncould continue to stall.\nThe Path Forward\nLooking ahead, we should be cautious in considering changes to the policy rate as we\nmove toward a more neutral setting. Future actions should be based on a careful assessment of\nongoing and sustained progress in achieving our goals, and we must be clear in our\ncommunication about how further changes are intended to affect economic conditions. We\nshould also refrain from prejudging the incoming administration’s future policies. Instead, we\nshould wait for more clarity and then seek to understand the effects on economic activity, the\nlabor market, and inflation.\n\n- 6 -\nI also continue to be concerned that the current stance of policy may not be as restrictive\nas others may see it. Given the ongoing strength in the economy, it seems unlikely that the\noverall level of interest rates and borrowing costs are providing meaningful restraint. With\nequity prices more than 20 percent higher than a year ago, easier financial conditions may be\ncontributing to the lack of further progress on slowing inflation. In fact, concerns about inflation\nrisks seem to partly explain the recent notable increase in the 10-year Treasury yield back to\nvalues last seen in the spring of 2024. In light of these considerations, I continue to prefer a\ncautious and gradual approach to adjusting policy.\nLooking forward, it is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course.\nAt each FOMC meeting, my colleagues and I will make our decisions based on the incoming\ndata and the implications for and risks to the outlook and guided by the Fed's dual-mandate goals\nof maximum employment and stable prices. By the time of our next meeting later this month,\nwe will have seen new reports on consumer and producer price inflation. In addition to closely\nwatching the incoming data and broader financial conditions, I will continue to meet with a\nbroad range of contacts as I assess the appropriateness of our monetary policy stance.\nIt is also important to clearly explain how we consider progress in meeting our inflation\nand employment goals in our policy deliberations. Restoring price stability is essential for\nfostering a strong labor market and an economy that works for everyone in the longer term.\nApproach to Bank Regulatory Policy\nTurning to banking, I will start by sharing my thoughts on bank supervision and\nregulation. This year will see a transition in leadership at the banking agencies, and I expect that\nthis will translate into a shift in priorities and approach. I am optimistic that by working\ncollaboratively to focus on our statutory mandates, the banking agencies can improve how we\n\n- 7 -\nfulfill our responsibilities in a fair, efficient, and accountable way. Adopting a more pragmatic\napproach to policymaking, one that imposes discipline in the exercise of the extensive powers\nand important responsibilities granted by Congress, would be most effective.2\nPublic debates about the bank regulatory framework routinely focus on whether\nregulators are being “hard enough” on banks, or whether the framework is too “lenient.”\nFraming the debate this way suggests a binary approach that ignores the known tradeoffs in any\nregulatory action—like raising capital requirements or downgrading a bank’s management rating\nfor minor issues to show “toughness.” This approach interprets a rational prioritization of\nregulatory matters as being too bank friendly. While policy views may differ, policy debates\nshould not misinterpret the dynamic of how banks and regulators should operate. In short, bank\nregulation and supervision need not be an adversarial system, with banks and regulators acting in\nopposition. Rather, banks and regulators often have the shared goal of a banking system that is\nsafe, sound, and effective, with each serving an important role in furthering these objectives.\nAs we move away from this type of binary thinking, that leaves the question of how\nregulators can best accomplish their statutory objectives. As a starting point, we must identify\nthe objectives we are trying to achieve. In conducting bank regulation and supervision, the\nFederal Reserve has the important responsibility of promoting the safe and sound operation of\nindividual banks and the stability of the broader financial system. In many cases, these goals are\ncomplementary. When individual banks operate in a safe and sound manner, the banking system\ngenerally promotes the stability of the U.S. financial system.\n2 Michelle W. Bowman, “Approaching Policymaking Pragmatically” (speech at the Forum Club of the Palm\nBeaches, West Palm Beach, Florida, November 20, 2024),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20241120a.pdf.\n\n- 8 -\nOf course, these objectives require a degree of balance if we want the banking system to\nserve the U.S. economy and facilitate economic growth. When we promote safety and\nsoundness—for example by raising capital requirements—that has an effect on the aggregate\nlending capacity of the banking system and the availability of credit, particularly for less\nqualified borrowers. We must approach the task of bank regulation with an understanding and\nappreciation of these tradeoffs, coupled with an affirmative acknowledgment that the banking\nsystem is an important driver of business formation, economic expansion, and opportunity. We\nhave the same responsibility to understand and appreciate the tradeoffs when we exercise our\nsupervisory authority.\nI am optimistic about the future of banking in the United States and believe that the\nbanking regulators can support the banking system by adopting a more pragmatic approach.\nWhile this is a non-exclusive list, I continue to believe the areas that we should focus on should\ninclude (1) prioritizing safety and soundness, (2) renewing our commitment to regulatory\ntailoring, and (3) increasing transparency.3\nPrioritization of Safety and Soundness\nIn 2024, bank regulators were still operating under the shadow of the 2023 bank failures,\nparticularly the failure of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). The risks facing SVB—interest rate and\nfunding risks, rapid growth, and the idiosyncratic business model and concentrated customer\nbase of the bank—have long been important issues that have been prioritized during\nexaminations. At its root, SVB’s failure exposed significant flaws not only in the bank’s\nmanagement but also in the approach to oversight and supervision.\n3 See Michelle W. Bowman, “New Year’s Resolutions for Bank Regulatory Policymakers” (speech at the South\nCarolina Bankers Association 2024 Community Bankers Conference, Columbia, South Carolina, January 8, 2024),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20240108a.pdf.\n\n- 9 -\nAs we approach regulatory and supervisory reform from the perspective of pragmatism,\nwe need to take a close look at what went wrong and what could be fixed. Regulatory tools to\nimprove management are imperfect and may be limited in their effectiveness before a bank has\nfailed, but we have great latitude to modify our approach to supervision. One pragmatic change\nwould be to prioritize safety and soundness and deprioritize matters that are not essential to—or\nthat are tangential to—our statutory obligations. After SVB’s failure, we saw a wide range of\nregulatory proposals. These have included substantial increases in bank capital requirements and\npushing down global systemically important bank (G-SIB) and large bank requirements to much\nsmaller firms. They have also included finding supervisory deficiencies in the management of\nwell-capitalized and financially sound firms and considering widespread changes to the funding\nand liquidity requirements and expectations that apply to all banks.\nMany of these proposals have targeted concerns well beyond remediating issues\nidentified during the 2023 banking stress but have been justified in a generic way—at least in\npart—as a “response” to the failure of SVB. In many cases, the nexus between a proposed\nreform and how that reform would remediate any of the underlying issues that caused the failure\nof SVB or caused stress in the broader banking system is not clearly articulated.\nWhen the agencies pursue reforms, it is critical that the problem is clearly identified and\nthat an explanation is given for how each proposal would address the problem. We should not\ncharacterize all reforms as “crisis response” actions, as doing so does not relieve us of the\nresponsibility to analyze and justify the tradeoffs and alternatives of any particular measure.\nThere is substantial room for agreement and consensus. We all want a banking system\nthat can effectively provide credit, including to underserved consumers and businesses. We all\nwant a banking system that is resilient in the face of changing economic conditions. We all want\n\n- 10 -\na banking system in which banks are free to experiment and innovate to better serve their\ncustomers. And we all want a banking system in which banks are held to high but economically\nreasonable standards in terms of capital, risk management and compliance.\nThe process of any reform or change to the bank regulatory framework should begin with\nan identification of the problem, followed by an analysis of whether proposed solutions are\nwithin the agency’s statutory authorities, and an evaluation of whether targeted changes could\nresult in improvements, remediation of gaps, or elimination of redundant and unnecessary\nrequirements. The resulting framework will better promote safety and soundness in a more\ndurable and consistent way over time, while also continuing to support economic growth.\nRenewed Commitment to Tailoring\nLike you, I firmly believe in the virtues of tailoring not only as a statutory responsibility\nbut as a key to forming sensible and effective bank regulatory policy.4 Tailoring can help ensure\nregulators focus on the most critical risks over time and avoid the over-allocation of resources or\nimposition of unnecessary costs on the banking system. Tailoring also allows us to allocate\nlimited supervisory resources to most effectively support safety and soundness of the banking\nsystem and U.S. financial stability. The Federal Reserve has not only statutory responsibilities\nestablished by Congress, but a responsibility to use our resources efficiently and effectively in\nthe execution of our duties.\nOver the past two years, we have seen proposals that would materially reduce the\ntailoring of regulatory requirements, particularly as it relates to capital (the so-called Basel III\n“endgame” reforms) and new long-term debt requirements that would apply to all banks with\n4 See Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, Pub. L. No. 115-174, 132 Stat. 1296\n(2018); Michelle W. Bowman, “Tailoring, Fidelity to the Rule of Law, and Unintended Consequences” (speech at\nthe Harvard Law School Faculty Club, Cambridge, Massachusetts, March 5, 2024),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20240305a.pdf.\n\n- 11 -\nover $100 billion in assets. Both proposals raise significant policy questions as to whether the\ncosts are justified by the benefits—questions not sufficiently addressed in the proposals—and\npose significant risks of unintended consequences.\nEssentially, this type of approach to capital “flattens” requirements across large banks.\nAnd coupled with other potential reforms to liquidity and funding requirements, this approach\ncould lead to substantial industry consolidation as medium-sized banks weigh the benefits and\ncosts to comply with an aggregate set of requirements more suitable for the largest banks. We\nshould be cautious of these types of piecemeal regulatory proposals and instead think more\nholistically about the aggregate impacts as part of our process.\nTailoring also plays an important role in supervision, an area that historically has\ndifferentiated expectations for firms based on size, business model, risk profile, and complexity.\nThese criteria provide a reasonable basis to take a different approach based on the unique\ncharacteristics of each bank, and as banks shift in size and evolve in business model and risk, it is\nappropriate to recalibrate expectations. However, I see a growing risk that under the veil of\nsupervision, there has been an erosion of a risk-based approach, and effectively a “push-down”\nof regulatory requirements designed and calibrated for larger firms to apply to smaller firms.\nI continue to believe that tailoring should be a central tenet of our regulatory and\nsupervisory approach and framework and believe that we must renew our commitment to this\nphilosophy going forward. I am confident that going forward, regulators will return to regulatory\ntailoring, particularly for community banks with straightforward business models.\nIncreasing Transparency\nRegulators should operate in a transparent way and carefully and meticulously follow\nadministrative procedures when making revisions to the regulatory framework. We should take\n\n- 12 -\na similar approach to shifts in supervisory focus. Doing so promotes trust and accountability to\nthe public and should be integral to the important work we do promoting the safe and sound\noperation of the banking system and financial stability. Transparency also promotes innovation\nin the financial system by enabling banks to understand how to engage in new activities. This is\nespecially important as digital assets and artificial intelligence are becoming increasingly more\nprevalent in the financial system.\nA deliberate, transparent, and fact-based approach to pursuing statutory objectives helps\nus “show our work,” that we are focused on pursuing our policy goals, and are avoiding straying\ninto political concerns outside of statutory purposes or functions. Promoting safety, soundness,\nand financial stability should not devolve into an exercise of regulatory allocation of credit—\npicking winners and losers—or promoting an ideological position through more open-ended\nprocesses like bank supervision and examination.\nTransparency promotes fairness, as regulated entities and the public can better understand\nwhy and how our actions further our goals. When we identify areas that suffer from a lack of\ntransparency, we should act promptly to address those concerns. Take, for example, the Federal\nReserve’s supervisory stress testing process. On December 23, the Fed announced that it would\nsoon seek public comment on “significant changes” to the stress testing process designed to\nimprove transparency of the tests and reduce volatility of the resulting stress capital buffers that\napply to large financial institutions.5 Given my longstanding support for revisiting the stress\n5 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Due to Evolving Legal Landscape & Changes in the\nFramework of Administrative Law, Federal Reserve Board Will Soon Seek Public Comment on Significant Changes\nto Improve Transparency of Bank Stress Tests & Reduce Volatility of Resulting Capital Requirements,” press\nrelease, December 23, 2024, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20241223a.htm.\n\n- 13 -\ntesting framework to promote transparency and reduce volatility, I am pleased with this\ndevelopment.6\nTransparency can lead to better public engagement and outcomes and should be a central\npart of the regulatory and supervisory approach, even when not legally mandated, such as in\nsupervision. Supervision involves examiners probing bank operations and assessing a bank’s\napproach to risk and risk management. Much of this information is confidential and\ncommercially sensitive and, therefore, not available to the public or released without risking\nsome degree of harm to the institution.\nBut the confidential nature and approach to supervision tends to result in a wide range of\ninformation being categorized as confidential supervisory information (CSI) and subject to\nrestrictions on sharing. This information ends up being shielded from public scrutiny and\nbecomes a barrier to banks engaging in discussion with peers and other regulators to better\nunderstand supervisory expectations. Supervisory expectations should not surprise regulated\nfirms, and yet changes in supervisory expectations often arise in the course of an ongoing\nexamination. As a result, the ability of a financial institution to be proactive—to work to meet\nany new expectations—is impossible until they have received supervisory feedback, often in the\nform of a supervisory finding or matter requiring attention or, in extreme cases, in a formal or\ninformal supervisory action.\nI am not suggesting that there are always simple solutions to improve transparency, and\ncertainly it is appropriate that much of the information developed in the supervisory process\nremains shielded as confidential supervisory information. But regulators must also acknowledge\n6 Michelle W. Bowman, “The Future of Stress Testing and the Stress Capital Buffer Framework” (speech at the\nExecutive Council of the Banking Law Section of the Federal Bar Association, Washington, D.C., September 10,\n2024), https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20240910a.pdf.\n\n- 14 -\nthe new world in which we operate, one in which administrative law increasingly demands\ngreater transparency and accountability to act as a check on regulatory overreach.\nClosing Thoughts\nThank you for the opportunity to share my thoughts on the economy and bank regulatory\nmatters with you today. In the coming months, I look forward to seeing the impacts of the new\nadministration’s policies on the economy and assessing how monetary policy should respond\ngoing forward. Today, the U.S. economy begins the new year on a strong footing, with still\nelevated inflation and a solid labor market.\nThe new year brings an opportunity to reflect on the experience and lessons learned in the\npast few years and to take a critical look at improving the bank regulatory framework, including\nboth supervision and regulation. And while I have laid out a few broad areas that I think deserve\nspecial attention—focusing on safety and soundness, renewing our commitment to tailoring, and\nimproving transparency—my hope is that the steps we take to improve the regulatory framework\nin the future focus on pragmatism as a guiding principle.",

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nIndependent Community Bankers of Colorado, Golden Jubilee\nVail, Colorado\nSeptember 22, 2023\n\nThank you for the invitation to join you today, and congratulations on 50 years of\nworking together to better serve the people of Colorado.1 As a former community\nbanker, it is always great to be with community bankers and to recognize the importance\nof your work to strengthen economic opportunities for your communities and your\ncustomers. I look forward to hearing more about the issues affecting your institutions\nand your customers, including the impact of the Federal Reserve’s regulation and\nsupervision.\nBefore we turn to our conversation, I’d like to offer a few thoughts on the\neconomy and monetary policy, since the members of the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC) met earlier this week. As you know, at that meeting, my colleagues\nand I voted to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent,\nafter raising rates sharply over the past year and a half to reduce inflation. During that\ntime, we have seen considerable progress on lowering inflation, warranting a more\ngradual pace of increases this year and supporting the decision this week to hold rates\nsteady. However, inflation is still too high, and I expect it will likely be appropriate for\nthe Committee to raise rates further and hold them at a restrictive level for some time to\nreturn inflation to our 2 percent goal in a timely way.\nMost recently, the latest inflation reading based on the consumer price index\nshowed that overall inflation rose, responding in part to higher oil prices. I see a\ncontinued risk that energy prices could rise further and reverse some of the progress we\nhave seen on inflation in recent months.\n1 The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee or the Board of Governors.\n\n- 2 -\nAt the same time, the economy has remained strong as the FOMC has tightened\nmonetary policy. Real gross domestic product has been growing at a solid pace.\nConsumer spending has been robust, and the housing sector appears to be continuing to\nrebound. The most recent employment report showed a labor market with solid job\ngains. The average pace of job gains over the past year has slowed somewhat and the\nlabor force participation rate has also improved over the same time frame, a sign that\nlabor market supply and demand may be coming into better balance.\nThe banking system continues to be strong and resilient. Banks have tightened\nlending standards due to higher interest rates and funding costs and in anticipation of\nfuture regulatory requirements. Despite this tightening of bank lending standards, we\nhave not seen signs of a sharp contraction in credit that would significantly slow\neconomic activity. Though bank loan balance growth has slowed, the ongoing strong\nbalance sheets of households and businesses combined with the growing importance of\nnon-banks as sources of credit suggest that the effects of monetary policy on bank\nlending may have smaller effects on the economy than in the past.\nGiven the mixed data releases—strong spending data but a decline in inflation and\ndownward revisions to jobs created in previous months—I supported the FOMC’s\ndecision to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate. But I continue to expect\nthat further rate hikes will likely be needed to return inflation to 2 percent in a timely\nway. The Summary of Economic Projections released in connection with the September\nFOMC meeting showed that the median participant expects inflation to stay above 2\npercent at least until the end of 2025. This, along with my own expectation that progress\non inflation is likely to be slow given the current level of monetary policy restraint,\n\n- 3 -\nsuggests that further policy tightening will be needed to bring inflation down in a\nsustainable and timely manner.\nIt is important to reiterate that monetary policy is not on a pre-set course. My\ncolleagues and I will make our decisions based on the incoming data and its implications\nfor our economic outlook. We should remain willing to raise the federal funds rate at a\nfuture meeting if the incoming data indicates that progress on inflation has stalled or is\ntoo slow to bring inflation to 2 percent in a timely way. Returning inflation to our 2\npercent goal is necessary to achieve a sustainably strong labor market and an economy\nthat works for everyone.\nTurning to bank regulation and supervision, I would also like to briefly address\nbank regulatory policy. With the bank failures and accompanying banking system stress\nearlier this year, it was clear that the Federal Reserve, and in some cases the other federal\nbanking agencies, need to address supervisory shortcomings and potentially consider\nrevision of some failure-related bank regulations.\nIn my view, any proposals considered by the Board and any others jointly\nproposed by the bank regulatory agencies should be\n(1) Focused on remediating identified issues and shortcomings;\n(2) Informed by data, analysis, and genuine debate and discussion among\npolicymakers within each of the participating agencies; and\n(3) Developed through a transparent and open process that allows policymakers\nand the public to understand the context, data, and analysis underlying the proposed\nreforms. Of course, this process must also incorporate the opportunity to solicit\nmeaningful public comment.\n\n- 4 -\nIt is absolutely imperative that stakeholders—including bankers—share their\nviews with policymakers on regulatory reform proposals. All of the comments, data, and\nanalysis enable policymakers to make informed decisions throughout the rulemaking and\nproposal process. Information about the intended and unintended impacts of these\ninitiatives is especially informative. If the Fed and other banking agencies have not\nprovided sufficient context, data, and analysis to satisfy stakeholder questions or\nconcerns, commenters should provide that perspective as well.\nAs you know, there are a number of regulatory rulemakings under consideration\nby the Board and the other bank regulatory agencies. Some have already been published\nfor comment including the proposal to implement Basel III “endgame” by significantly\nexpanding capital requirements and bringing the threshold for compliance down to\ninclude all banks over $100 billion in assets from only the largest GSIB banks, and the\nexpansion of the long-term debt requirement from only the largest banks again to all\nbanks over $100 billion in assets. Still other proposals have not yet been published or\nmoved to the next stage of the rulemaking process, including the Community\nReinvestment Act rulemaking, the further consideration of climate guidance, and others.\nThe Board has also publicly indicated it may propose additional revisions in the future to\nRegulation II.\nI recognize that in some instances, multiple, interrelated proposals out for\ncomment at the same time may complicate or even frustrate the ability to provide\nmeaningful comment. Even so, I strongly encourage your participation to inform the\nrulemaking process. This audience is uniquely positioned to provide real-world feedback\nabout the intended and unintended consequences of agency rulemakings. I look forward\n\n- 5 -\nto all of the stakeholder comments and feedback throughout the current and upcoming\nregulatory rulemaking processes. I look forward to our conversation.",

Bowman\nVice Chair for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe Community Bank Conference\nHosted by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nWashington, D.C.\nOctober 9, 2025\n\nGood morning, everyone and welcome. It’s a privilege to be here today at the Federal\nReserve Board with so many of our nation’s community bank CEOs. I want to start by thanking\nour bankers for the essential work you do every day—serving your communities, supporting\nsmall businesses and families and keeping local economies strong and growing. Today’s event\nprovides us an opportunity to come together and discuss the future of community banking.\nThis great nation hosts the largest and most effective financial system in the world,\nensuring that capital flows to those who need it and can put it to productive use. I think of\ncommunity banks as the foundation of our financial system. You are often the first call for small\nbusinesses seeking to grow, for families looking to buy homes, and for anyone seeking to\nachieve their financial goals. At a time of rapid technological change, a shifting regulatory\nlandscape, and evolving consumer expectations, your work has never been more vital or more\nchallenging.\nThe purpose of this conference is about looking ahead, at the opportunities, risks and\ninnovations that will shape the future of community banking. It’s also about telling the\ncommunity bank story: not only the services you provide and impact you have in your\ncommunities but also the value of having strong, profitable and well-managed companies as the\nfoundation of the banking system. There’s a story to tell here and we want to ensure community\nbanks tell it and create their own their narrative.\nThis conference brings together more than a hundred community bank CEOs in person\nand many more attending virtually. Our panels will include CEOs from across our diverse\nfinancial system. I look forward to hearing directly from these leaders to share what they are\nseeing—emerging trends, economic shifts and innovations that are shaping the financial system,\nincluding the impact of artificial intelligence and fraud, and which may affect your businesses.\n\n- 2 -\nThis conference also brings a broader perspective, from our Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, to\nnew technologies with Paxos CEO Chad Cascarilla to private credit and global outlook with\nBlackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman, and consumer digital platforms with Robinhood CEO\nVlad Tenev. These leaders will help us think more broadly about how economic and industry\ndevelopments intersect with community banking.\nAnother special guest joining us today is CNBC host Jim Cramer, who will moderate a\npanel of experienced community bank CEOs who have a combined century of banking\nleadership. Today, we will showcase how community bankers have consistently adapted,\ninnovated, and outperformed while staying true to their mission. These efforts do not necessarily\nmake headlines on the front page of the business section, but they should. And there’s no one\nbetter to help elevate the community bank narrative and amplify the value that community banks\nbring to America’s economy than CNBC’s Jim Cramer.\nFinally, we will also host a traditional policy panel, featuring community bank CEOs\ndiscussing capital and liquidity regulation. This session will provide an opportunity for a\nthoughtful, candid discussion about how our regulatory frameworks affect your institutions and\nyour ability to serve your communities. These conversations are essential to help shape our\nthinking and inform how we as regulators work to ensure that policies are effective, fair, and\nbalanced.\nThe goal and the theme running through all of today’s panels is clear: there is\ntremendous support from the public and private sector for a strong, resilient, thriving\ncommunity banking industry. Each of our sessions today reflects a shared belief in the\nimportance of community banks to America’s economic future.\n\n- 3 -\nThank you for being with us today. Now I would like to thank our Treasury Secretary\nScott Bessent for taking time from his busy schedule to be here to discuss community banking,\nand I will now invite him to share his insight with us.",

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nExecutive Council of the Banking Law Section of the\nFederal Bar Association\nWashington, D.C.\nSeptember 10, 2024\n\nThank you for the invitation to join you.1 Given the recent conclusion of the Board’s\nstress test, it seems timely to share my thoughts on the stress testing program. In the past, I have\nnoted reservations about the stress testing process, so today I’d like to discuss in greater detail\nthe benefits, challenges, and issues I would like to see resolved as the stress testing program\nevolves in the future.2\nEarlier this summer, the Board announced the results of the supervisory stress tests. At a\nhigh level, all 31 banks subject to the test remained above their minimum common equity tier\none (CET1) capital requirements from the hypothetical recession scenario.3 Under this scenario,\nbanks would have absorbed projected hypothetical losses of nearly $685 billion, and would have\nexperienced an aggregate CET1 capital decline of 2.8 percent.4 The hypothetical scenario\nincluded a 40 percent decline in commercial real estate prices, a substantial increase in office\nvacancies, a 36 percent decline in house prices, a spike in unemployment to a peak of 10 percent,\nand related declines in economic output.5 This year also saw the introduction of “exploratory”\nstress scenarios, which included two different funding stress scenarios, and for a subset of banks,\n1 These remarks represent my own views and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 Michelle W. Bowman, “Large Bank Supervision and Regulation” (remarks at the Institute of International\nFinance, Washington, D.C., September 30, 2022),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20220930a.pdf; and Statement by Governor\nMichelle W. Bowman on the Basel III Endgame Proposal (July 27, 2023)\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bowman-statement-20230727.htm, (“Today’s proposal is\nintended to improve risk capture, but in some circumstances, leaves in place and even introduces new regulatory\nredundancies, as with changes to the market risk capital rule, credit valuation adjustments, and operational risk that\noverlap with stress testing requirements and the stress capital buffer”).\n3 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Federal Reserve Board Annual Bank Stress Test Showed\nThat While Large Banks Would Endure Greater Losses Than Last Year's Test, They Are Well Positioned to\nWeather a Severe Recession and Stay Above Minimum Capital Requirements,” news release, June 26, 2024,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20240626a.htm.\n4 Id.\n5 Id.\n\n- 2 -\nincluded two trading book loss scenarios.6 The Board’s press release announcing the results\nreported that large banks are well positioned to weather a severe recession and remain above\nminimum capital requirements.7\nMore recently, the Fed announced the final individual capital requirements for all large\nbanks, effective on October 1, 2024.8 The firm-specific capital requirements are “informed by”\nthe stress test results, and include a 4.5 percent minimum capital requirement, a stress capital\nbuffer that is set at a minimum of 2.5 percent, and if applicable, a capital surcharge for the most\ncomplex banks that is based on each firm’s systemic risk.9 The announcement of this year’s\nresults also noted the modification of the stress capital buffer for a single firm based on a\nreconsideration request. While firms subject to the stress test have long had the ability to request\nreconsideration—and many have done so in the past—this was notable as it was the first time\nthat a reconsideration request was successful in producing a change to a firm’s stress capital\nbuffer.\nAs we conclude this most recent cycle of stress testing—and as many firms begin to turn\nto the next round—I think it is helpful to pause and consider whether and how the process could\nbe improved. My remarks today will address the value of stress testing on bank safety and\nsoundness and on financial stability, my concerns about the current implementation of the stress\ntest, and finally what I see as a potential path forward. I hope this discussion leads to a broader\n6 Id.\n7 Id.\n8 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Federal Reserve Board Announces Final Individual Capital\nRequirements for All Large Banks, Effective on October 1,” news release, August 28, 2024,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20240828a.htm.\n9 Id.\n\n- 3 -\nconsideration of stress testing, its role in the current prudential framework as a supervisory tool,\nand as a mechanism to set large bank capital standards through the stress capital buffer.\nThe Value of Stress Testing\nLet me start by emphasizing that my remarks today should not be interpreted as a\nwholesale criticism of the stress testing process and framework. I firmly believe that stress\ntesting is and will remain a valuable mechanism that provides insights that can inform\nsupervision and can inform the public about how the largest and most complex banks would fare\nunder a severe stress scenario. This exercise helps us gauge a bank’s capital position and\ndetermine whether it has sufficient capital to absorb losses and continue lending during an\neconomic stress event.\nIn practice, stress testing provides a very granular assessment of a firm’s risk, one that is\nmore refined and risk-sensitive than capital standards alone. It relies on detailed balance sheet\ninformation—fixed at a particular date in the past—to do a deeper analysis of the firm’s financial\ncondition at that point in time. By subjecting this balance sheet to a hypothetical shock, we\ndevelop a better sense of not only the firm’s risk, but also the firm’s capacity to respond and\nadapt to changing economic conditions. This type of analysis would be impractical to conduct\non a continuous basis, but it is a useful periodic supplement to ongoing capital requirements and\ncan be used to support more robust supervisory practices.\nThe Need for Reform\nWhile there are many virtues of stress testing, as currently implemented and executed\nthere are several significant drawbacks. These drawbacks arguably make the process less fair,\ntransparent, and useful than it could and should be.\n\n- 4 -\nI have long supported and argued in favor of fairness and transparency in the bank\nregulatory framework.10 The rules and supervisory practices that comprise this framework\nshould be consistent among firms, and consistent over time. Banks should have a clear\nunderstanding of these rules to allow them to make informed business decisions that consider the\nimpact of the regulatory framework. But we also know that the diversity and variability of bank\nbusiness models can present a challenge to the clarity of the framework. Clarity is needed both\nto promote equitable treatment among banks with different business models, and to create rules\nthat are fair over time. This allows firms to anticipate regulatory expectations as their business\nactivities and balance sheets evolve in response to, among other things, changing economic\nconditions. Each bank is unique, and one need look no further than the balance sheets, business\nactivities, and risk profiles of large banks to observe this variability. But the onus is on\nregulators to ensure that over time, regulations and supervisory practices are applied fairly and\nconsistently, and that evolution in the framework is accompanied by appropriate transparency for\nregulated entities.\nThe challenge of creating rules that are fair and transparent is nowhere more notable than\nin stress testing. Stress testing serves an important role in our regulatory framework, but one that\nrequires evolution to ensure relevancy and effectiveness. To date, the evolution of stress testing\nhas focused on refining the tests to be more robust over time and to provide more granular risk\n10 See, e.g., Michelle W. Bowman, “My Perspective on Bank Regulation and Supervision,” (remarks to the\nAmerican Bankers Association Community Banking Conference, February 16, 2021),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20210216a.pdf; Michelle W. Bowman, “Large\nBank Supervision and Regulation,” (remarks at the Institute of International Finance, Washington, D.C., September\n30, 2022), https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20220930a.pdf; and Michelle W.\nBowman, “Independence, Predictability, and Tailoring in Banking Regulation and Supervision,” (remarks to the\nAmerican Bankers Association Community Banking Conference, Orlando, FL, February 13, 2023),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20230213a.pdf.\n\n- 5 -\ninformation about these banks. While these incremental improvements have been helpful, the\ntask of addressing identified problems is equally important.\nTo be clear, these problems extend beyond model accuracy and consistency across firms.\nWhile by no means a comprehensive list, I would like to address four of my concerns in\nparticular: (1) volatility in firm results from year to year, (2) the challenge of linking stress\ntesting outcomes with capital through the stress capital buffer, (3) the broad lack of transparency,\nand (4) the overlap with other capital requirements like the overlap between the global market\nshock in stress testing and the market risk rule under the Basel III endgame proposal.\nVolatility\nOne area of particular concern is the year-over-year volatility in stress testing results.\nMany of the stress test design features are intended to promote consistency across firms—the\nexercise uses a common scenario design, and subjects similarly situated firms to stress testing at\nthe same frequency. This format allows for comparisons across firms and can provide important\nsupervisory insights as regulators can look across firms to find common risk factors that could\naffect multiple firms—and lead to more significant and widespread economic impacts—in a\nstress event. But we have seen that stress test results for several firms vary considerably from\nyear to year based on the interaction of the specific scenario being tested with a firm’s business\nmodel, changes to the model, and each firm’s balance sheet. This variability then flows through\nto the stress capital buffers that apply to the largest firms.11\n11 From 2020–2024, six firms were subject to the stress capital buffer “floor” of 2.5 percent, while other firms\nabove the floor have seen significantly greater volatility. While the operation of the stress capital buffer floor has\nreduced volatility for these six firms and several others that have been subject to the floor at some point in time, this\nset of firms also has been subject to a higher stress capital buffer charge than would have been indicated by the\nresults of the stress test. More than half of all firms subject to the stress test from 2020–2024 have experienced a\nchange in their applicable stress capital buffer of at least 1 percent over time. See Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System, “Annual Large Bank Capital Requirements,” https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/large-\nbank-capital-requirements.htm.\n\n- 6 -\nSome variability is to be expected as the risk factors and balance sheet composition of the\ntested firms both change over time. However, the test results observed year over year often\nproduce results that are not predictable in advance—for example, some of the volatility we see is\nnot based on fundamental changes to a tested bank’s business model.\nThe link between stress testing and capital also creates a practical timing issue for firms.\nThe time frame for compliance with stress capital buffers compounds the issue of excessive year-\nover-year volatility. While many capital requirements give firms a runway to comply and adjust\ncapital planning projections going forward, stress capital buffers allow a very brief window of\ntime for firms to comply.12 As a real-time example, this year’s preliminary stress capital buffer\nrequirements were announced in late June, with required compliance by October 1st.\nThis concern is experienced differently across firms—for example, some firms can likely\npredict that they will be subject to the stress capital buffer “floor,” which perhaps can help with\nlonger-term capital planning. But for those firms whose stress capital buffers exceed the floor,\nthis short turnaround can pose significant planning challenges. Although banks historically have\nnot been required to raise capital to meet higher stress capital buffer results, volatility is not a\nnonissue. As a matter of practice, banks maintain management buffers—additional capital in\nexcess of capital and regulatory buffer requirements—to ensure that they operate at levels\nsignificantly above the “well-capitalized” threshold. Unexpectedly steep increases in stress\ncapital buffers may force firms to recalibrate or reconsider their management buffer, perhaps\noperating at a higher level than would otherwise be necessary to account for known volatility in\nstress capital buffers over time.\n12 See 12 CFR § 225.8(h)(4); 12 CFR § 238.170(h)(4).\n\n- 7 -\nThis variability is not without cost. Firms engage in capital planning over a long-term\nplanning horizon. Significant variability can disrupt these practices and require firms to hold\nmore capital and higher capital management buffers than prudent business practices would\nindicate.\nThe link between stress testing and capital—the stress capital buffer\nAs currently implemented, the stress test exercise presents a single hypothetical shock to\na firm’s balance sheet, with the goal of better understanding firm performance and risks in the\nface of this stress. But the test is not intended to be—nor is it in practice—predictive of an actual\nstress event that the firm would experience. During the banking stress of 2023, the key risk\nfactor was rapidly rising interest rates, and yet this type of economic stressor was not included in\nany past iteration of the test design.\nWhy do we select one scenario and use that hypothetical to establish binding capital\nrequirements for many firms regardless of their business model? What incentives does this\nsystem create as regulators design scenarios?\nUnquestionably, stress testing can provide valuable insights to inform supervision.\nTesting multiple stress scenarios could provide additional information that could be used to\nprobe the unique risks and resilience of particular firms. And it could provide regulators and the\npublic with a clearer understanding of financial stability risks across firms under different\nplausible future states of the world.\nBut a more robust use of stress testing would require rationalizing the link between stress\ntesting and capital to ensure that any change in overall calibration was driven by an intentional\nprocess that results in a reasonable policy outcome. As a practical matter, testing additional\nscenarios raises the question of what consequences should flow from a multi-scenario testing\n\n- 8 -\nregime. Would such an approach require across-the-board capital increases, as regulators\ncalibrate stress capital buffers based on the most severe outcome of any tested scenario for each\nfirm? Or should regulators pick a common scenario to calibrate stress capital buffers for all\nfirms, even in a multi-scenario stress testing regime? Or should regulators take a different\napproach and sever the link between stress testing and capital requirements?\nThe link between stress testing and capital raises important policy questions about the\noptimal level of capital, but ultimately should not dissuade us from using stress testing to better\nunderstand firm-specific and broader financial stability risks. At the same time, we need to pay\ncareful attention to the design of all capital requirements—including not just the stress capital\nbuffer, but also other risk-based capital requirements, leverage requirements, and long-term debt\nrequirements—to ensure that the overall calibration of these requirements is proportionate to\nrisk. In my view, an up-calibration of capital requirements through an expanded scenario-testing\nregime would not be supportable based on the underlying risks.\nTransparency\nOne persistent issue with the stress tests is the lack of public transparency around the\nmodels. This opacity frustrates bank capital management and allocation. When a bank engages\nin an activity or prices a product or service, as a sound business practice, they must anticipate the\nfinancial consequences and the accompanying risks. Before making any decisions, a bank will\noften try to project the anticipated costs and revenues. In addition, the bank will want to evaluate\nthe projected growth of the business or activity over time, determine whether the activity\ncomplements other existing products and services, and decide whether there will be sufficient\ncustomer demand to justify the cost based on the contemplated pricing levels and margins. One\n\n- 9 -\nimportant consideration in this exercise is the cost of capital. Banks often quantify the cost of\ncapital and “allocate” those costs across various business lines.\nThe capital requirements and supervisory risk assessment of activities are important\ninputs for bank decision-making. Banks benefit when they understand the regulatory perception\nof their activities. That feedback is often a critical part of the supervisory process. A regulatory\nperspective is embedded in stress testing, through the common parameters, assumptions, and\nconditions that will be used in the exercises. But much of this work remains hidden from public\nscrutiny and from the financial institutions subject to the stress tests. Providing access to this\ninformation—making clear the regulatory perspective—by improving the transparency of the\nprocess would enable banks to better manage their business and make more informed decisions.\nOf course, greater disclosure is not without its detractors. A common criticism of\nincreased transparency is that disclosing the more granular parameters of particular calculations\nwould lead to “gaming” of the test by large banks seeking to optimize their capital. The\nunderlying premise of this concern seems to be that the stress tests are and must be static over\ntime, and that if firms make changes to their activities that have no economic consequences—but\ninstead are used only for “gaming” purposes to reduce stress losses—that regulators are limited\nin making further changes. I think this misinterprets the dynamism and review that should\ncomplement the stress testing process. Greater disclosure and transparency should be\naccompanied by a careful review of how firms incorporate and use any additional information,\nand to the extent that gaming activity is identified, further changes to the test design may be\nappropriate.\nAnother criticism is that by disclosing test results, all firms—including in their internal\nstress testing practices—will “converge” on a common standard and that this standard will in\n\n- 10 -\nsome way increase risk. For example, if firms’ stress testing practices are uniform, but include\nsome flawed assumption or parameter, this could create a systemic weakness. Put differently,\nthe model “monoculture” caused by greater transparency could miss important systemic risks.\nWe should ask whether more granular disclosures would override the informed risk assessments\nof banks in managing their business—would all firms simply adopt whatever the regulators are\ndoing in the supervisory stress test, undermining the utility of other practices like internal stress\ntests? However, we should not think about stress testing in isolation—supervision informed by\nstress testing, and ongoing improvements to supervisory stress testing can operate as a backstop\nto address risks that may accompany more transparency.\nI am concerned about changes that could undermine the utility of both regulatory and\ninternal stress testing at large firms. Regulators should not seek to take risk-management\ndecisions away from banks. But greater transparency, debate, and discussion of test parameters\nneed not lead to a dilution of standards. These discussions could actually promote a cycle of\ncontinuous improvement and feedback. We have seen over time that the regulatory stress tests\nare not static. As regulators learn more, they adjust and adapt different elements of the exercise\nin light of lessons learned from the process.\nThe issues of transparency around the stress tests extend beyond just disclosure. The\nreconsideration process itself could be improved by developing a more transparent process and\nclearer standards against which reconsideration requests will be evaluated. While this year saw a\npositive development with the Board for the first time changing a firm’s stress capital buffer\nrequirement in response to a request for reconsideration, the high failure rate of such requests\nover time shows the need for rethinking and revisiting the process.\n\n- 11 -\nOverlap with other capital requirements\nFinally, as I have noted in the past, we must ensure that each element of the capital\nframework operates in a complementary and not contradictory way, and that requirements are\ncalibrated proportionate to risks. Failing to appropriately calibrate capital and risk requirements\ncreates risks—incentivizing banks to curtail activities that are assigned a punitive capital\ntreatment and devoting more resources to activities that are assigned an inappropriately low\ncapital risk weighting. Over time, these dynamics can have real-world market and economic\nconsequences, resulting in negative outcomes for customers and economic activity.\nWhen we view capital requirements in their totality, one potential overlap can be found in\nthe proposed changes to the market risk capital rules and operational risk rules with the “global\nmarket shock” and operational risk elements of the supervisory stress testing framework. We\nneed to ensure that the risks captured and methodologies underpinning these distinct\nrequirements do not lead to an over-calibration of capital requirements for activities that support\nthe important role of U.S. capital markets in the global economy.\nThe Path Forward\nAs we look ahead to the future of stress testing, I think we need to carefully consider how\nthe current framework can be improved. These issues—volatility, the link between stress testing\nresults and capital and the short capital implementation compliance time frame, the lack of\ntransparency, and the overlap between the global market shock in stress testing with the market\nrisk test of Basel III—can all be addressed and should be prioritized in the ongoing evolution of\nthe stress testing framework and stress capital buffer requirements. It is important that regulators\nconsider the lessons learned from past tests and feedback from banks and other members of the\npublic to ensure that stress testing is fair, transparent, and more useful going forward.\n\n- 12 -\nFirst, we need to address the excessive year-over-year volatility, which flows through to\nthe calculation of stress capital buffers. As I noted, capital planning for many firms is a long-\nterm enterprise, and excessive volatility and unpredictability of stress capital buffer levels can\nincrease costs and complicate capital allocation and management. Of course, the goal is not to\neliminate variability over time—variability based on changing economic conditions and\nchanging firm business activities and balance sheets—but rather to blunt the excessive volatility\nobserved over the history of stress testing.\nThere are many possible ways to limit excessive volatility while maintaining the value of\nthe Board’s stress tests. For example, one solution could be to average results over multiple\nyears, so a firm’s stress capital buffer would move in smaller increments through the averaging\nprocess. Another possibility is to constrain variability in annual stress test scenario design.\nCountercyclicality in the design of the regulatory stress tests—where the stress\nexperienced by firms is more severe when economic conditions are better—acts as a\ncounterweight to the inherent procyclicality of risk models. This approach “eases” capital\nrequirements (through lower stress capital buffers) as economic conditions decline. But this\ncountercyclicality is also a driver of volatility, and we should look more closely as to whether\nour attempts to adjust for countercyclicality are appropriate through the lens of stress test\nvolatility.\nSecond, I think there is a benefit to promoting greater transparency in stress testing,\nparticularly as it relates to the disclosure of the underlying models. Stress testing need not be an\nexercise shrouded in secrecy, and the Federal Reserve has shown in the past that improvements\nare possible. For example, in 2019, the Board adopted new principles that guide the design of\n\n- 13 -\nthe stress tests, and promoted greater transparency.13 In addition to these principles, the Board\nmoved to provide more information about its stress testing models, including ranges of loss rates\nfor actual loans held, portfolios of hypothetical loans with loss rates estimated by the Board’s\nmodels, and more detailed descriptions of the Board’s models (including some granular\ninformation about certain equations and variables used in the models).14 While these were\npositive steps in promoting transparency, the announcement of design principles and enhanced\ndisclosures did not go far enough in my view, and we have seen that even after several years,\nfirms continue to struggle to understand and anticipate the results of supervisory stress tests and\nthe accompanying stress capital buffer requirements.\nThe simple solution here seems to be disclosure of more granular information about all of\nthe models used in stress testing. In my view, disclosure of these models—and even subjecting\nthe models to appropriate notice and comment processes and public feedback—would not\nundermine the goal of the stress tests of having a regulator-created model that is separate and\ndistinct from the internal models used by firms. Regulators would still control the contours and\ncontent of the models but would have the benefit of public feedback. If we believe in the\nvalidity and reasonableness of our model design choices, we should not shy away from public\nfeedback.\nThird, we should adjust the compliance framework for stress capital buffers. Firms\nshould not be forced to comply with higher capital requirements after only a few months’ notice\nbut should have a reasonable time frame for compliance. I would note that a longer compliance\n13 “Stress Testing Policy Statement,” 84 Fed. Reg. 6664 (February 28, 2019),\nhttps://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2019-02-28/pdf/2019-03503.pdf.\n14 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Federal Reserve Board Finalizes Set of Changes That Will\nIncrease the Transparency of Its Stress Testing Program for Nation's Largest and Most Complex Banks,” news\nrelease, February 5, 2019, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20190205a.htm.\n\n- 14 -\nrunway is particularly important in a world in which testing is opaque and volatility continues to\nbe excessive. To the extent that these more fundamental issues are addressed, this may mitigate\nthe need for a shorter compliance window.\nFinally, as we move forward with Basel III implementation, we need to take a careful\nlook at whether market risk and operational risk requirements are overlapping and redundant\nwith the “global market shock” and operational risk elements of stress testing and think about the\ncalibration of these requirements in the aggregate. Would these tests in tandem produce\nexcessively calibrated capital requirements, and if so, what would the impact be on U.S. capital\nmarkets? In my view, there are strong indications that as currently formulated, the combination\nof these requirements would result in an excessive calibration of risk-weighted assets for market\nmaking and trading activities. And of course, we must think broadly about the optimal level of\ncapital in the banking system, taking into account the full range of risk-based and leverage\ncapital requirements and long-term debt requirements.\nThere are many possible ways to move forward with stress testing, and the proposals I\nhave offered above are merely a subset of possible changes that could improve the process and\naddress many of the known deficiencies. But I believe there is a growing awareness of the need\nfor a fundamental rethink and strategic reform of stress testing, and any such process must\nacknowledge and address these known issues within the framework.15\nClosing Thoughts\nThank you again for the invitation to join you today. The stress test is an important\nsupervisory tool, and I think it is imperative that we work to continually improve it. I have laid\n15 See Daniel K.

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nvia prerecorded video\nto\n“Advance Together: Celebrating the Achievements of Texas Community Partnerships,”\na public event at the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\nDallas, Texas\nJuly 24, 2024\n\nI’d like to thank everyone for joining us today to celebrate the achievements of\nTexas community partnerships. I am so excited to be a part of this important milestone,\nmarking the end of the pilot round of Advance Together and to announce a second round\nfor this initiative.\nBack in 2021, during the depths of COVID, I took part in the Dallas Fed’s\nAdvance Together launch event, welcoming the awardees into the initiative and looking\nahead to their success. This is truly a special opportunity to recognize the progress and\nachievements of the four participating partnerships, each representing their diverse\ncommunities and regions in the great state of Texas.\nAdvance Together is an accelerator program for regional public–private–nonprofit\npartnerships seeking to improve education and employment outcomes for lower-income\ncommunities in Texas. The Dallas Fed and the Federal Reserve System are focused on\nreducing and removing barriers to education attainment and workforce development to\nfoster a strong, resilient economy.\nAs the nation’s central bank, the Federal Reserve Board is focused on our dual\nmandate of price stability and maximum employment. When we think about maximum\nemployment, we also need to consider how to foster an inclusive economy that provides\neconomic opportunities for everyone regardless of their circumstances.\nEvery Reserve Bank relies on its community development function to understand\nthe economic circumstances of communities through community initiatives and research.\nIn response to local needs in their respective Districts, each Reserve Bank develops\ninitiatives and focus areas to support these efforts.\n\n- 2 -\nCollaboration Matters for Better Community Outcomes\nAdvance Together was designed to address core challenges in education and\nworkforce development. Often, a lack of coordination among key organizations,\nfragmentation across existing resources, or incomplete approaches that don’t fully\nidentify or address the root causes of community issues lead to less successful outcomes.\nResearch from the Boston Fed has found that durable economic success\nthroughout economic cycles is less dependent on factors like industry mix, demographics,\nor even geographic location. Instead, it is the ability of local leaders to work together\nacross different sectors that leads to economic resilience. Leaders that collaborate with\nan identified plan and path over a sustained period of time toward a comprehensive vision\nachieve better outcomes and more inclusive economic growth.\nA few years ago, the Dallas Fed identified an opportunity in Texas to support\ncommunity partnerships, specifically in education and workforce development.\nWorking across different sectors and industries brings its own set of unique\nchallenges. Each brings different goals, operations, and even terminology to the\ndiscussion.\nWe know that collaboration is necessary, and it is achievable. Advance Together\nprovides the structure, ongoing support, and investment from external partners to support\ncommunities in strengthening their collaborative work. It takes time and skill to build\ndeep and trusting partnerships.\nIt also takes time and resources for communities to agree upon a common\nunderstanding of complex, local needs like improving college and career readiness or\ndeveloping pathways to living wage employment.\n\n- 3 -\nThis work requires that all partners move in the same direction, toward those\ncommon strategies and goals. When communities collaborate effectively, the results can\nlead to broader access to economic opportunity.\nAT Team Introductions\nWe are here today to celebrate the success of our pilot participants; I’d like to\nreintroduce each of them:\n• The Big Country Manufacturing Alliance is building awareness and creating\naccessible pathways to well-paying manufacturing careers through training,\nrecruitment, and retention.\n• The Deep East Texas College & Career Alliance supports rural and first-\ngeneration college students in attaining postsecondary credentials that employers\nseek in their workforce.\n• The Education Partnership of the Permian Basin is developing a cradle-to-career\ncontinuum of support by working to improve early childhood outcomes and\ncollege and career readiness in the region.\n• The Travis County 2-Gen Coalition is expanding practices and policies to\nsupport dual generations of parents and children in education attainment and\nachieving long-term financial stability.\nConclusion\nAs we begin today’s celebration, I’d like to recognize the vision of the Dallas Fed\nteam for creating this incredible opportunity for our partners. I’d also like to thank our\nAdvance Together partnerships for their hard work and progress. I also want to\nrecognize them for the work that they will continue to accomplish in their communities as\n\n- 4 -\nthey move forward. This work is challenging and will continue to build pathways to a\nmore inclusive economy.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n6:00 p.m. EDT (11:00 a.m. September 28 local time in New Zealand)\nSeptember 27, 2023\nPanel remarks by\nMichelle W. Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n2023 Symposium on Indigenous Inclusion\nThe Central Bank Network for Indigenous Inclusion and\nThe Reserve Bank of New Zealand—Te Pūtea Matua\nAuckland, New Zealand\nSeptember 27, 2023\n\nGovernor Bowman was asked to make remarks responding to two questions.\nBelow are the questions and her responses.\nPanel Question 1: Why should Indigenous financial inclusion be a core focus for\ncentral banks?\nI’d like to thank the Reserve Bank of New Zealand and Governor Orr for hosting\nthis symposium and for the invitation to participate.1\nIt is an honor to join my Network colleagues for this important discussion. As the\nFederal Reserve Board’s representative to the Network, I recognize and acknowledge that\nthe United States and the foundation of its economy were built on land enriched by its\noriginal Indigenous inhabitants and their stewardship of its natural resources.\nRecent natural disasters affecting Indigenous communities in Network countries\nhighlight the importance of our work. Those harmed by the recent wildfires in Hawaii\nand Canada, as well as Cyclone Gabrielle here in New Zealand, face substantial\neconomic headwinds. I hold these communities close in my thoughts.\nI see two fundamental reasons why central banks should focus on Indigenous\nfinancial inclusion. The first is our responsibility to foster an economy that works for\neveryone. Second is the wisdom we can gain from community-led approaches to\nexpanding financial opportunity.\nIn order to effectively support inclusive economic growth, we need to understand\nthe economic conditions of Indigenous communities. The Federal Reserve’s ongoing\nresearch and outreach enable us to gain insight about economic barriers that Indigenous\n1 The views here expressed are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System or at the Reserve Banks.\n\n- 2 -\ncommunities face. Our recent research notes several challenges, including those related\nto labor market conditions, affordable credit and financial services access,\nhomeownership, and broadband access. Our efforts to understand these challenges\nsupport our ability to provide information and resources that can help address the needs.\nFor example, our research has found that Indigenous communities have less\naccess to high-speed internet. During the pandemic, Indigenous communities\nparticipated less in remote work—which may, in part, reflect this lack of access. In\naddition to our research, we will convene a conversation among Indigenous communities,\nfederal policymakers, and researchers to discuss the challenges and opportunities to\nadvance broadband service networks.\nOur research has also shown that on average, Indigenous borrowers pay more for\nhome loans. While there is a diversity of housing conditions, land tenure, and very\ndifferent legal frameworks governing lending and other financial services for Indigenous\ncommunities, our research helps raise awareness of the challenges and informs our work\nto promote Indigenous homeownership.\nOur research has also found that the lack of credit and financial services access is\na key barrier to economic development in Indigenous communities. Native Community\nDevelopment Financial Institutions—or CDFIs—play a vital role in addressing this credit\nand financial services gap.\nThe Federal Reserve’s research and engagement efforts have significantly\nadvanced our understanding of the economic barriers for Indigenous communities, but\nthere is still much to learn. The Center for Indian Country Development is working to\naddress data gaps of U.S. Indigenous populations to provide needed information to their\n\n- 3 -\nleaders, policymakers, and practitioners to inform decisions that best serve their\ncommunities.\nThe Center has developed datasets on Indigenous community labor market\nconditions, reservation profiles including key demographic and economic indicators, and\na tool that identifies economic development resources and opportunities in these\ncommunities.\nThe Center is currently developing a Native Entity Enterprise Dataset to better\nunderstand businesses owned by Alaska Native corporations, Native Hawaiian\norganizations, and tribes.\nIn addition to identifying economic needs, these datasets can help policymakers\ndirect resources where they will be most effective. Above all, these datasets equip\nIndigenous communities with information to plan their economic futures.\nFinancial inclusion is an important focus for central banks, and Indigenous-led\napproaches can help further efforts to achieve an inclusive economy. Native CDFIs serve\nas critical sources of credit and financial services for Indigenous communities, and their\nunique lending practices provide new insights about strategies to reduce loan delinquency\nrisks. Like community banks, Native CDFIs take a holistic approach to assessing credit\nrisk, which includes conventional measures like credit scores and community- and\ncharacter-based criteria that leverage their understanding of their communities and\ncustomers. In a recent study of Native CDFI loan data, we found that these customer\nrelationships can reduce uncertainty in lending outcomes. These research findings could\nbe useful for other financial institutions serving Indigenous communities.\n\n- 4 -\nThe Fed has also increased Indigenous participation on boards and advisory\ncouncils and has hired staff to engage with these communities. We are working to ensure\nthat Indigenous perspectives inform our work and create new opportunities to learn from\ntheir practices and approaches.\nThank you for the opportunity to reflect on this important area of focus for central\nbanks. I look forward to hearing from my colleagues on this topic.\nPanel Question 2: What two or three key actions taken by your organization have\nbeen instrumental in accelerating progress towards Indigenous financial inclusion?\nIn recent years, the Federal Reserve has improved efforts to focus on Indigenous\ncommunities, including convening listening sessions and outreach events, conducting\nresearch in partnership with these communities, supporting economic and financial\neducation, and offering programs that build the capacity of Indigenous organizations.\nOur Reserve Banks lead these efforts, and our involvement in the Central Bank Network\nfor Indigenous Inclusion broadens our perspective as we engage in this work.\nWe are accelerating progress in three ways: The first is engagement. Our work to\nadvance Indigenous financial inclusion requires that Indigenous communities value the\nFed as a trusted partner and resource. Throughout the System, we are engaging these\ncommunities through outreach events, including listening sessions and tribal leader\nroundtables to discuss economic issues—from housing to early childcare, and from\neducation to business.\nOne of these engagements, an affordable housing forum in Hawaii, led to\nfinancing discussions for housing projects that will benefit Native Hawaiian\ncommunities. Another facilitated a small business lending working group that regularly\n\n- 5 -\nconvenes local, state, and federal partners to address challenges with access to capital for\nAlaskan small businesses, especially those owned by Native Alaskans. This group has\nhelped connect local Native CDFIs to banks and state and federal partners for funding\nand technical assistance.\nWe also recently partnered with national Indigenous organizations to host a\nwebinar featuring new research on the opportunity for Indigenous business entities to\nengage in federal contracting. The event brought together a range of Indigenous\nenterprise executives who reflected on research, discussed challenges and opportunities\nfor Indigenous entities pursuing federal contracting, and shared their own stories of\neconomic diversification.\nConversations like this support our Indigenous partners—by allowing us to share\nour research insights and by providing a forum for Indigenous community members to\nshare their own stories and perspectives.\nThe second way we are making progress is research. We are conducting research\nfor and with Indigenous communities. Accurate, comprehensive information on\nIndigenous economic conditions helps to identify challenges and opportunities, providing\ndata to inform decisionmaking.\nThe Federal Reserve’s Small Business Credit Survey gathers information to help\npolicymakers understand changes in small business credit practices. The survey now\nincludes Indigenous small business owners, which improves our understanding of their\nconditions and needs.\nWe also conduct a recurring survey of CDFIs, including Native CDFIs, to\nunderstand their current challenges and opportunities.\n\n- 6 -\nWe continue to conduct research in consultation with Indigenous-led\norganizations and tribal governments. Our research is conducted in accordance with data\nprinciples recognizing the important responsibilities associated with collecting and\nanalyzing Indigenous data to ensure that Indigenous data sovereignty and governance are\nrespected.\nThe third, and perhaps most important, is empowerment. Our research and\nprograms enable our Reserve Banks to assist Indigenous communities through\ninformation and resources to plan their own economic futures.\nFor example, our Native Economic and Financial Education Empowerment\nprogram works with Indigenous communities to provide free economic and personal\nfinance education that incorporates Indigenous language and culture.\nOur Working Communities Challenge facilitates local collaboration to increase\neconomic opportunity in rural areas. This program serves as a first-of-its-kind venue to\nconnect tribal leaders, nonprofit organizations, and private- and public-sector leaders\naround economic development efforts. Most recently, leaders convened to understand\ndata gaps across the full partnership and how they can better leverage data across\norganizations as they work toward expanding the number of living-wage jobs and\nreducing rates of childhood poverty within the community. Indigenous voices and\nperspectives are a critical part of this effort.\nWe’re also developing new data tools and research partnerships that help\nIndigenous communities conduct research on economic opportunities. For example, our\nNative American Funding and Finance Atlas is a publicly available interactive map tool\n\n- 7 -\nthat identifies the financial institutions, lending activity, and economic development\nprograms in their tribal community and surrounding areas.\nI’m proud of the Federal Reserve System’s efforts to further Indigenous financial\ninclusion, and I’m grateful for this opportunity to learn from the dedicated efforts of our\nNetwork partners.\nThere is so much important and impactful work happening, and I look forward to\nthe progress that we will continue to make together.\nThank you.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n2:00 p.m. EDT (1:00 p.m. CDT)\nOctober 17, 2019\nOpening Remarks\nby\nMichelle W. Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Monetary Policy’s Impact on Workers and Their Communities”\na Fed Listens event\nsponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago\nChicago, Illinois\nOctober 17, 2019\n\nThank you, President Evans, for hosting this event today, and to our moderator\nand participants for taking part in this valuable discussion. Today’s event is the last in\nour series of Fed Listens events held across the country to learn about how Americans\nthink about monetary policy and how they think about the Federal Reserve.\nIn keeping with the purpose of Fed Listens, I would like to spend most of our time\nin conversation. But I do want to offer a few thoughts about why the Fed is reaching out\nto seek a broad range of views, and what we are hoping to accomplish through this\ninitiative.\nFed Listens is a new comprehensive outreach to the public on monetary policy.\nFor many decades there was a sense at the Board that the public wasn’t interested or even\nwilling to dive into the complexities of monetary policy. That view has changed in a\nfundamental way, especially in the aftermath of the financial crisis when it was urgently\nimportant that the public understand what we were doing. So we began explaining as\naccessibly and as clearly as we could what we were doing and why. Now we are\nlistening carefully.\nSince I became a Board member almost a year ago, it has become clear to me that\npeople are not only willing to engage on complex economic issues, but they also want to\nknow that their concerns are being taken into consideration on issues that affect their\nfinancial well-being. The Fed’s movement toward greater transparency and public\nengagement is well underway, and advancing that effort is one of my top priorities.\nAt the same time, we recognize that the clear communication of our policies\nactually helps us achieve our goals. When we communicate our views on the economic\noutlook and our expectations for where interest rates may be heading, consumers and\n\n- 2 -\nbusinesses take that information into account when making decisions on spending,\ninvestment, and hiring. For that reason, our policy communications are an important part\nof the Fed’s toolkit for influencing the direction of the economy.\nFed Listens is a natural outcome of this commitment to public engagement. We\nhave heard from many people from different parts of the country and from different\nsectors of the economy about how monetary policy affects them and their communities.\nIt is our responsibility as a public institution to be accountable to the public. Hearing a\nbroad range of perspectives on these issues will help us make good decisions as we\nconsider new approaches to monetary policy.\nAs I mentioned before, this afternoon’s discussion is the last in a series of Fed\nListens events that we began back in February. Looking at the depth of experience of our\npanelists and of David Wessel, our distinguished moderator, I think we can make a strong\ncase that we saved the best for last. Our first panel focuses on disadvantaged workers’\nlong-term job prospects. I am eager to hear from our panelists how they think the labor\nmarket and our policies are impacting the communities they serve in Illinois, Michigan,\nand in other states in the Midwest.\nAs a former community banker, I am also very interested to hear from people who\nare implementing creative strategies to build wealth and support access to credit for low-\nand moderate-income communities. The panelists in our second session can speak to\ntheir experiences doing just that, because they are helping to bring credit and housing\nopportunities to Appalachia, Indianapolis as well as right here in Chicago.\nOur monetary policy review will have implications for financial markets, but we\nalso want to know more about what the impact will be on Main Street. My colleagues\n\n- 3 -\nand I are keenly aware of our responsibility to focus on how the decisions we make affect\nthe real economy for people in communities all across the country.\nThe two goals for monetary policy—maximum employment and stable prices—\nare determined by the Congress and are not subject to our framework review. How we\nreach those goals is the topic for discussion. One question I hope to explore is whether\nwe need new strategies to more effectively achieve our goals. For example, inflation has\nrun modestly below our 2 percent objective for many years. Given that, it would be\nhelpful to hear whether you think the Federal Open Market Committee should consider\nstrategies that aim to have inflation exceed our target for a period of time to make up for\nthe earlier shortfall or whether you think that would threaten the decades of success the\nFed has had keeping the public’s inflation expectations low and stable.\nAnother question concerns the Fed’s existing toolkit for monetary policy.\nCurrently, our available policy tools include setting interest rates, purchasing longer-term\nassets, and forward guidance about the expected future path of policy. Are there other\ntools we should consider to help us reach and sustain our objectives more effectively? I\nalso want to know how the Federal Open Market Committee’s communication of its\npolicy framework might be improved. How can we help you better understand our work\nso you can hold us accountable?\nYour perspectives on questions like these are a vital part of this monetary policy\nreview. So I want to thank you again for your time and your contributions. Once the\npolicy review is complete, we will share our findings with the public, probably during the\nfirst half of next year. I look forward to our discussion.",

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nvia prerecorded video\nto the\nUneven Outcomes in the Labor Market Conference\nWashington, D.C.\n(virtual)\nFebruary 7, 2024\n\nMandate for Maximum Employment\nGood afternoon and welcome to the third day of the Federal Reserve’s Uneven Outcomes\nin the Labor Market Conference.1 It is a pleasure to join so many researchers, policymakers, and\npractitioners interested in understanding the labor market and its implications for the overall\neconomy and the financial well-being of workers.\nAt the Federal Reserve, the labor market is often top of mind. As many of you are aware,\nthe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has a mandate to effectively promote maximum\nemployment and price stability. My FOMC colleagues and I strive to find the balance between\nthese objectives, and when considering how best to promote a healthy economy, it is important\nthat the Fed supports a labor market that works for both employees and employers.\nToday, I’d like to highlight the role of small businesses and entrepreneurship in the U.S.\nlabor market and, in turn, the importance of access to capital in creating and maintaining jobs in\nthose businesses. I’m sure many of us know business owners who put their own personal\nsavings—even their homes—at risk to start or to grow their businesses. I will discuss why\nexternal sources of capital and financial institutions that provide access to capital are vital for\nboth successful small businesses and a robust labor market.\nThere are many pathways for workers to find employment. For some, entrepreneurship\noffers the opportunity to fulfill a personal goal to create a new business or to have more control\nover their careers. While not all start-ups are successful, many grow into stable businesses that\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve\nBoard.\n\n- 2 -\nemploy additional workers. In fact, small businesses currently employ nearly half of America’s\nprivate sector workers and have accounted for over 60 percent of net new jobs since 1995.2\nThroughout my experience as a banker, bank commissioner, and Federal Reserve\nGovernor, I have been inspired by the success stories shared by entrepreneurs from across the\ncountry. At the same time, I’ve also heard about many of the difficulties they face, particularly\nin hiring and retaining employees, and sourcing capital for business operations. For example, a\nbakery owner in Texas recently shared the challenges her business has faced in hiring and\nretaining workers. Another small business owner in Maryland shared the difficulties he has\nfaced in accessing capital to open new restaurant locations. While these are just two examples\nthat I have heard personally, I know that it can be very difficult for many small businesses to find\nqualified workers and access the capital they need to grow.\nAs policymakers consider making changes to existing rules and expectations that may\nimpact a business’s access to funding sources, we need to identify and understand any potential\nunintended consequences of these new policies, especially if those policies may affect the ability\nof small businesses and entrepreneurs to access capital.\nRecent Trends in Small Business\nWhile many of these challenges are typical hurdles for entrepreneurs and start-ups, the\npandemic created new complications for businesses, small and large. Firms owned by women\nand minorities were particularly vulnerable due to many being newer businesses, more fragile\n2 “Frequently Asked Questions,” U.S. Small Business Administration, March 2023, https://advocacy.sba.gov/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2023/03/Frequently-Asked-Questions-About-Small-Business-March-2023-508c.pdf.\n\n- 3 -\nfinancially, and more likely to be part of the sectors hit hardest by the pandemic, including food\nservices, personal services, and retail.3\nYet, while many small businesses shut their doors due to the effects of the pandemic, in\n2020, the United States saw a boom in business creation, which began shortly after the initial\nlockdown period. This increase has continued long after the labor market recovery. In fact, the\nCensus Bureau’s November 2023 analysis of business applications shows that business\nformation since 2021 has remained 32 percent higher than in the previous ten years.4 Many of\nthese new businesses were started by minority business owners.5 Increased rates of workers\nvoluntarily quitting their jobs and high levels of unemployment during the pandemic appear to\nhave encouraged some workers to become self-employed or become entrepreneurs.\nThis growth in start-up businesses could help to address the challenge of closing\nemployment gaps for workers who typically face the greatest headwinds in the labor market. For\nexample, start-ups are more likely to hire new workers and workers with lower levels of\neducational attainment.6 New businesses have also been responsible for a surprising amount of\njob growth, with an average of nearly one million jobs created each quarter from early 2021\nthrough the beginning of 2023, which is a significantly higher pace than was typical prior to the\npandemic.7\n3 August Benzow and Nora Esposito, “Minority- and Women-Owned Businesses Tend to be Younger, Making them\nMore Vulnerable in the Coming Recession,” Economic Innovation Group, August 2020, https://eig.org/minority-\nand-women-owned-businesses-vulnerable-recession.\n4 U.S. Census Bureau data accessed in Federal Reserve Economic Data.\n5 Current Population Survey conducted by the US Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n6 “2023 Report on Employer Firms: Findings from the 2022 Small Business Credit Survey,” Small Business Credit\nSurvey, Federal Reserve Banks, March 8, 2023, https://doi.org/10.55350/sbcs-20230308.\n7 Bureau of Labor Statistics data on jobs created by new establishments averaged 976,000 per quarter from 2020:Q3\nto 2023:Q1, compared with 810,000 per quarter from 2009 to 2019.\n\n- 4 -\nFed Support for Access to Capital for Small Businesses\nOf course, in order to create jobs, small businesses need access to sufficient amounts of\naffordable credit and capital to form, grow, and succeed. Otherwise, they may underperform, not\nreaching their growth potential either in revenue or employment. The share of small businesses\nreporting that they rely on personal sources for capital increased from about half in 2019 to two-\nthirds in 2022, according to the Fed’s Small Business Credit Survey (or SBCS) from that year.8\nThis suggests a high degree of personal risk for owners and their workers. Moreover, personal\nfinancial resources are often limited, which can constrain growth. Ideally, small businesses\nshould be able to access external funding, which can be a key to their growth and stability.\nMost businesses that seek external financing turn to banks—community banks and larger\ninstitutions. Community banks remain an essential resource for many small businesses to access\ncapital to support their businesses. These banks are focused on relationship banking, which\nuniquely positions them to meet the challenge of assessing the creditworthiness of local, small\nbusinesses. Community banks make greater investments in small business lending relative to\nlarger banks.9 Furthermore, according to the 2022 Small Business Credit Survey, small\nbusinesses were more likely to be satisfied with their experiences dealing with small bank\nlenders than with large bank lenders or finance companies.10\nI’d like to take a moment to share some of the ways the Fed supports small businesses\nthrough community banks. First, the Fed engages community banks through its Community\n8 From the 2023 SBCS Report on Employer Firms, 56 percent of small businesses relied on personal sources for\ncapital in the 2019 SBCS compared to 66 percent in the 2022 SBSC.\n9 A Fed analysis of June 2023 call report data shows that community banks have larger shares of small-business\nloans relative to their total assets than larger institutions. See Eldar Beiseitov, “Small Banks, Big Impact:\nCommunity Banks and Their Role in Small Business Lending,” October 20, 2023,\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/regional-economist/2023/oct/small-banks-big-impact-community-banks-\nsmall-business-lending.\n10 2023 SBCS Report on Employer Firms.\n\n- 5 -\nDepository Institutions Advisory Council (CDIAC), which advises the Board on matters of\npublic policy. CDIAC members include community bankers who provide insight and\ninformation about the economy, lending conditions, and other issues that they see firsthand in\ntheir communities. Second, the Federal Reserve supervises and regulates smaller banks based on\na variety of factors specific to their size, condition, risk profile, and business model to assess\ntheir safety and soundness. One of the Federal Reserve’s unique strengths is the localized nature\nof our supervision, which relies on regional Reserve Banks that understand their local markets\nand community needs.\nMany community banks also have a mission to serve historically underserved\npopulations. These include Minority Depository Institutions (MDIs), Women-Owned\nDepository Institutions (WDIs), and Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs).\nThese banks are vital sources of capital to many underrepresented small businesses. For\nexample, the Philadelphia Fed found that community banks, including these unique banks, are\ntraditionally more successful than larger institutions at small business lending in times of crisis.\nThis finding was well supported by volume of lending conducted by these banks through the\nPaycheck Protection Program (PPP) during the COVID-19 pandemic.11\nThe PPP provided loans to small businesses to keep their workers employed. The\nprogram was implemented in large part through community banks, including MDIs, WDIs and\nCDFIs. The Fed supported the PPP by providing liquidity through its emergency lending\n11 Allen N. Berger, Maryann P. Feldman, W. Scott Langford, and Raluca A. Roman, “‘Let Us Put Our Moneys\nTogether’: Minority-Owned Banks and Resilience to Crises” (Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, June 2023),\nhttps://www.philadelphiafed.org/-/media/frbp/assets/working-papers/2023/wp23-13.pdf.\n\n- 6 -\nprogram, the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility.12 Notably, MDIs originated more\nthan 20,000 PPP loans to support small businesses during that time.13\nThe Federal Reserve has also supported CDFIs and MDIs through their work with the\nU.S. Treasury Department on the implementation of the Emergency Capital Investment Program\n(ECIP). This COVID-relief program provided $9 billion in capital directly to CDFIs and MDIs.\nThese funds were to be used for loans, grants, and forbearance to small and minority-owned\nbusinesses, especially in low-income and underserved communities.14\nI’d like to close with a brief note on the CDFI Fund’s recently released revisions to the\nCDFI Certification Application. In addition to ECIP funding, certified CDFIs are eligible to\naccess other federal resources, state and local governmental funds, philanthropic support, and\nprivate sector investment. I look forward to engaging with community banks as they and other\nfinancial institutions begin to digest these revised application requirements. I also look forward\nto learning about how these changes may affect the certification process for renewing or\nobtaining a CDFI certification.\nConclusion\nThe Fed continues to support the growth of start-ups and small businesses as a means of\ncreating opportunity for all workers. This afternoon’s discussion will focus on how employer\n12 See the Federal Reserve Board's website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/ppplf.htm.\n13 Anthony Barr and Mac McComas, “Minority Depository Institutions: State of Knowledge, Sector Summary &\nLending Activity, and Impact, 2010-2020” (paper presented at the National Bankers Association Foundation and\nJohns Hopkins 21st Century Cities Initiative, May 2023),\nhttps://www.nationalbankers.org/_files/ugd/93bce2_97f4419fd0c140aaa28a79d4ee543fa5.pdf?index=true.\nSeparately, the Fed supports MDIs through the Fed’s Partnership for Progress (PFP) program, which provides\ntechnical assistance on regulatory matters, conducts research, hosts convenings, and provides examiner training to\nsupport and promote the stability of MDIs.\n14 U.S. Department of the Treasury, “Biden-Harris Administration Announces Over $8.28 Billion in Investments in\nCommunity Development Financial Institutions and Minority Depository Institutions through the Emergency\nCapital Investment Program,” press release, September 22, 2022, https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/ECIP-\nPress-Release.pdf.\n\n- 7 -\nstructure and financing may affect employee wages and benefits.

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nNew Jersey Bankers Association Annual Economic Leadership Forum\nSomerset, New Jersey\nMarch 7, 2024\n\nI would like to thank the New Jersey Bankers Association for the invitation to share my\nthoughts with you today.1 While I welcome the opportunity to share my thoughts about\nmonetary policy, the economy, and the path of regulatory reform, I find it even more valuable to\nhear your views on local banking and economic conditions in the communities you serve, and\nyour perspectives on trends in bank regulation and supervision. These conversations provide\nvaluable insights to inform my work at the Federal Reserve—both for my understanding of the\neconomy and the banking environment.\nBefore discussing bank regulation, I would like to briefly touch on the economy and\nmonetary policy.\nMonetary Policy\nOver the past two years, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has significantly\ntightened the stance of monetary policy to address high inflation. At our most recent meeting in\nJanuary, we voted to continue to hold the federal funds rate target range at 5¼ to 5½ percent and\nto continue to reduce the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings.\nWe have seen continued progress on inflation over the past year, with the 12-month\nreadings through January of total and core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation\nmoving down to 2.4 percent and 2.8 percent, respectively, both at the lowest rates we have seen\nsince early 2021. Although inflation declined over the second half of 2023, the January inflation\ndata suggest that progress in bringing inflation down further may be slower going forward.\nThroughout this time, economic activity has remained strong with ongoing strength in consumer\nspending. We had also seen signs of the labor market coming into better balance, but recent\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nstrong jobs reports—including upward revisions to employment growth—show a continued tight\nlabor market. Last year, the average pace of job gains slowed and the labor force participation\nrate rose through November, with the unemployment rate edging up to 3.7 percent. In recent\nmonths, however, job growth has rebounded, and the labor force participation rate declined,\nretracing some of its earlier gains.\nAt its current setting, our monetary policy stance is restrictive and appears to be\nappropriately calibrated to reduce inflationary pressures. As I’ve noted recently, my baseline\noutlook continues to be that inflation will decline further with the policy rate held steady, but I\nstill see a number of upside inflation risks that affect my outlook. These include risks from\ngeopolitical developments, including the risk of spillovers from geopolitical conflicts and the\nextent to which food and energy markets and supply chains remain exposed to these influences.\nThere is also the risk that a loosening in financial conditions and additional fiscal stimulus could\nadd momentum to demand, stalling any further progress or even causing inflation to reaccelerate.\nFinally, there is a risk that continued labor market tightness could lead to persistently high core\nservices inflation. Recent labor market data suggest ongoing elevated wage growth as some\nbusinesses continue to report above-average wage increases to compensate for elevated prices\nand high inflation.\nGiven these risks, and the general uncertainty regarding the economic outlook, I will\ncontinue to watch the data closely as I assess the appropriate path of monetary policy. The\nfrequency and extent of data revisions over the past few years, as seen in the most recent\nemployment report, make the task of assessing the current state of the economy as well as\npredicting how the economy will evolve even more challenging, and I will remain cautious in my\napproach to considering future changes in the stance of policy. Should the incoming data\n\n- 3 -\ncontinue to indicate that inflation is moving sustainably toward our 2 percent goal, it will\neventually become appropriate to gradually lower our policy rate to prevent monetary policy\nfrom becoming overly restrictive. In my view, we are not yet at that point. Reducing our policy\nrate too soon could result in requiring further future policy rate increases to return inflation to 2\npercent over the longer run.\nIt is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course. My colleagues and I\nwill make our decisions at each FOMC meeting based on the incoming data and the implications\nfor the outlook. While the current stance of monetary policy appears to be at a restrictive level\nthat will bring inflation down to 2 percent over time, I remain willing to raise the federal funds\nrate at a future meeting should the incoming data indicate that progress on inflation has stalled or\nreversed. Restoring price stability is essential for achieving maximum employment and stable\nprices over the longer run.\nNotable Developments in Bank Regulation and Supervision\nAs I look at the bank regulatory agenda, I am struck by the sheer volume of matters that\nhave recently been completed, that have been proposed, and that are in the pipeline. These\nreforms touch on a wide range of topics that directly or indirectly impact banks of all sizes. This\nwork shows no signs of slowing down. The large number of finalized, proposed, and potential\nchanges suggest insufficient prioritization in furthering the primary goal of prudential bank\nregulation and supervision—promoting a safe and sound banking system. In fulfilling this\nstatutory objective, we must also focus on efficiency and effectiveness and always consider how\nregulatory reforms affect the banking market, the economy, and those who use banking services.\nWe should also ensure, in our pursuit of reform, that our efforts result in a bank framework that\nis appropriately tailored and calibrated.\n\n- 4 -\nI have spoken at length over the past few months about some recent notable\ndevelopments in bank regulation, touching on capital reform, the Community Reinvestment Act,\nthe cap on debit card interchange fees, and climate-related financial risk guidance.2 Today, I\nwant to recap my views on some of these developments, particularly around bank mergers and\nacquisitions (M&A), liquidity regulation, and trends in bank supervision.\nBank mergers and acquisitions\nBank mergers and acquisitions continue to be an important part of the banking\necosystem. In this process, timing is key. However, this is another policy area where I expect to\nsee ongoing focus from federal regulators, the Department of Justice, and others. As\npolicymakers engage on this topic, a key consideration should be whether the application process\nis fair, transparent, and consistent with the applicable statutory requirements.3 And yet, policy\nreforms may make bank M&A transactions more difficult for regulators to approve and slow the\napplication processing timeline.\nAs all bankers know, application processing delays can be quite harmful, resulting in\ngreater operational risk, increased expenses due in part to contract delays, reputational risk, and\nstaff attrition due to the prolonged uncertainty. In the broader context, reducing the efficiency of\nbank mergers and acquisitions may also act as a deterrent to a healthy evolution of the banking\nsystem. Taken together, reducing merger or acquisition activity could have the consequence of\nprohibiting transactions that may preserve the presence of banks in rural or underserved areas,\n2 See Michelle W. Bowman, “Reflections on the Economy and Bank Regulation” (speech at the Florida Bankers\nAssociation Leadership Luncheon Events, Miami, FL, February 27, 2024),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20240227a.pdf.\n3 See, e.g., Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), “Business Combinations Under the Bank Merger Act:\nNotice of Proposed Rulemaking,” OCC Bulletin 2024-4, January 29, 2024, https://occ.gov/news-\nissuances/bulletins/2024/bulletin-2024-4.html.\n\n- 5 -\ntransactions that may further prudent growth strategies, or transactions that may result in\nincreased competition with larger peers.\nRegulatory reforms in this area should prioritize speed and timeliness. Stakeholders who\nare concerned about current bank M&A procedures and policies should consider direct\nengagement with regulators.4\nLiquidity\nFollowing the bank failures last spring, significant attention has been paid to the alleged\n“lessons learned” creating a path for regulatory reform efforts. This has generated discussion\namong both policymakers and the public on how to think about liquidity regulation: Should\nthese requirements be expanded to a broader range of institutions? Should the calibration or\noperation of liquidity requirements like the Liquidity Coverage Ratio and Net Stable Funding\nRatio be modified? Should we consider new liquidity requirements, and if so, what form should\nthey take?\nI have significant concerns about the path ahead as it comes to regulatory reforms\ninvolving liquidity requirements. All banks must manage their liquidity but should have\nflexibility based on a range of factors, including risk, business model, size, complexity, funding\nneeds, vulnerability to deposit runs, and other considerations. Liquidity requirements, if not\nappropriately designed and calibrated, could trap resources that would otherwise be put to better\n4 One avenue by which interested parties can provide feedback is through the recently launched mandatory review\nof regulatory burdens under the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act of 1996. See Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and OCC, “Federal Bank\nRegulatory Agencies Seek Comment on Interagency Effort to Reduce Regulatory Burden,” joint news release,\nFebruary 6, 2024, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20240206a.htm; and “Statement\nof Michelle W. Bowman on the Review of the Board’s Regulations under the Economic Growth and Regulatory\nPaperwork Reduction Act of 1996 (EGRPRA), February 6, 2024,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20240206a1.htm.\n\n- 6 -\nuse, like lending to bank customers. Before moving forward, we need to identify gaps in the\ncurrent framework and build a foundation for any proposed changes that is based on research,\nevidence, and data.\nLiquidity regulation also has the potential to impose significant costs and limit the\nlending capacity and business operations of banks, which we must recognize and take into\naccount before imposing any new requirements.\nWe must think about liquidity broadly, including the sources and uses of liquidity that\ninstitutions use today, including the Federal Reserve’s discount window and its role as lender of\nlast resort, advances from the Federal Home Loan Banks, and other sources that may be\navailable in the market. In this context, we must be honest about the capability and capacity of\nthese resources, and the challenges and limits of these tools.\nRevisions to the liquidity framework must also be coordinated to ensure that reform\nefforts are complementary and can support the banking system’s liquidity needs. When\nconsidering new liquidity requirements, we must think about not only calibration and scope, but\nalso the unintended consequences of any such requirements and whether these measures will be\neffective during stressed conditions.\nTrends in supervision\nDuring 2023 and into 2024, many banks reported very material shifts in bank\nexaminations and ongoing intensification in supervisory expectations. Many of these\nexamination-related shifts have received little public acknowledgement or attention in large part\nbecause the rules designed to protect confidential supervisory information frustrate visibility into\nstructural shifts in the supervisory process. As you all know well, changes in supervisory\nexpectations frequently come without the benefit of guidance, advance notice, or published\n\n- 7 -\nrulemaking, and in the worst-case scenario these shifts, cloaked by the veil of supervisory\nopacity, can have significant financial and reputational impacts or can disrupt the management\nand operations of affected banks.\nThese changes largely occurred after the bank failures in the spring of 2023 and the\nensuing banking stress. In part, the changes in supervisory practices may be attributable to\nflawed post-mortem reviews conducted in the immediate aftermath of these failures. Many of\nthese reviews suffered from serious shortcomings, including compressed timeframes for\ncompletion and the significantly limited matters that were within the scope of review.\nNevertheless, these reviews were, and continue to be, singularly relied upon as a basis for\nresetting regulatory and supervisory priorities. These trends in supervision are concerning and\nadd to the already significant burdens placed on regulated institutions from an aggressive\nregulatory reform agenda. I worry that the mere fact of bank failures and the material banking\nstress we experienced last year has been interpreted as a “blank check” to remake supervision as\na blunt instrument, one that ignores the unique characteristics of each firm and the benefits of an\napproach that prioritizes engagement and communication between banks and examiners.\nOf course, the banking agencies cannot regulate our way to better or more effective\nsupervision; in the aftermath of the banking stress, it is appropriate to look carefully at what is\nworking, and what isn’t, in the realm of bank supervision. But in doing so, we must\nappropriately manage our supervisory programs and teams to ensure that effective and consistent\nsupervision is implemented within each firm, and that it is effective and consistent across our\nregulated entities. Conducting supervision in a manner that respects due process and provides\ntransparency around supervisory expectations can help us accomplish these goals.\n\n- 8 -\nClosing Thoughts\nThank you again for the opportunity to speak with you today. We are experiencing\nsignificant changes in the banking industry, not least of which are those coming from the\nregulators. It is imperative that you continue engaging on all matters involving regulatory\nreform. Policymakers cannot fulfill the responsibility of promoting a safe and sound banking\nsystem if we ignore efficiency, tailoring, and appropriate calibration of requirements in the\nreform agenda. These tenets should be central to the reform process. I welcome your insight on\nwhat is working, what is not, and the real-world consequences of regulations and regulatory\nreform efforts. Your input helps us ensure that the bank regulatory framework supports safety\nand soundness in an efficient and fair way.\nThank you for your continued engagement, and I look forward to our conversation.",

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe American Bankers Association\n2025 Conference for Community Bankers\nPhoenix, Arizona\nFebruary 17, 2025\n\nThank you for the invitation to join you here in Phoenix at the ABA’s Conference for\nCommunity Bankers.1 For the past seven years, this conference provided an excellent forum for\nme and bankers to meet and interact with a range of state and federal regulators, policymakers,\nservice providers, and other stakeholders. Today I would like to share a brief update on my\nviews on monetary policy and the economy, before I turn to bank regulatory issues, and describe\nhow I think that regulators should approach the important work of “maintenance” of the\nregulatory framework.\nEconomic Outlook and Monetary Policy\nToward the end of last year, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) began the\nprocess of moving the target range for the federal funds rate to a more neutral setting to reflect\nthe progress made since 2023 on lowering inflation and cooling the labor market. At our\nSeptember meeting, the FOMC voted to lower the target range, for the first time since we began\ntightening monetary policy to combat inflation, by 50 basis points to 4-3/4 to 5 percent.\nYou may remember that I dissented from that decision, the first time a Fed Governor\ndissented from an FOMC rate decision in nearly 20 years. I preferred a smaller initial cut to\nbegin the policy recalibration phase. I explained my reasoning in a statement published after the\nmeeting noting that the strong economy and a healthy labor market did not warrant a larger cut.\nIn addition, moving the policy rate down too quickly could unnecessarily risk stoking demand,\npotentially reigniting inflationary pressures, and could be interpreted as a premature “declaration\nof victory” on our price-stability mandate.\n1 The views expressed in these remarks are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of my colleagues on the\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nAt the most recent FOMC meeting last month, my colleagues and I voted to hold the\nfederal funds rate target range at 4-1/4 to 4‑1/2 percent and to continue to reduce the Federal\nReserve's securities holdings. I supported this action because, after recalibrating the policy rate\nby 100 basis points through the December meeting, I think that policy is now in a good place,\nallowing the Committee to be patient and pay closer attention to the inflation data as it evolves.\nIn my view, the current policy stance also provides the opportunity to review further\nindicators of economic activity and get further clarity on the administration's policies and their\neffects on the economy. It will be very important to have a better sense of these policies, how\nthey will be implemented, and establish greater confidence about how the economy will respond\nin the coming weeks and months.\nFor now, the U.S. economy remains strong, with solid growth in economic activity and a\nlabor market near full employment. Core inflation is still somewhat elevated, but has appeared\nto resume its downward path, and my baseline expectation has been that it will moderate further\nthis year. Even with this outlook, there are upside risks to my baseline expectation for the\ninflation path.\nIn 2023, the rate of inflation declined significantly, but it has taken longer to see further\nmeaningful declines since that time. The latest consumer and producer price index reports\nsuggest that the 12-month measure of core personal consumption expenditures inflation—which\nexcludes food and energy prices—likely moved down to around 2.6 percent in January, which\nwould represent a noticeable stepdown from its 2.8 percent reading in December and 3.0 percent\nat the end of 2023. Progress had been especially slow and uneven since the spring of last year\nmostly due to rising core goods price inflation.\n\n- 3 -\nAfter increasing at a solid pace, on average, over the first nine months of last year, gross\ndomestic product appears to have risen a bit more moderately in the fourth quarter, reflecting a\nlarge drop in the volatile category of inventory investment. In contrast, private domestic final\npurchases, which provide a better signal about underlying growth in economic activity,\nmaintained its strong momentum from earlier in the year, as personal consumption rose robustly\nagain in the fourth quarter. Following strong readings in December, retail sales and sales of\nmotor vehicles softened in January. However, these data can be noisy around this time of the\nyear and sales were likely affected by the cold and wintery weather last month.\nPayroll employment gains have picked up since the summer of last year and averaged a\nstrong pace of about 240,000 per month over the past three months, with last month’s gains\nlikely held back by the Los Angeles wildfires and the harsh winter weather. The unemployment\nrate edged down further to 4.0 percent in January and has moved sideways since the middle of\nlast year, remaining below my estimate of full employment.\nThe labor market appears to have stabilized in the second half of last year, after it\nloosened from extremely tight conditions. The rise in the unemployment rate since mid-2023\nlargely reflects weaker hiring, as job seekers entering or re-entering the labor force are taking\nlonger to find work, while layoffs have remained low. The ratio of job vacancies to unemployed\nworkers has remained close to the pre-pandemic level in recent months, and there are still more\navailable jobs than available workers. The labor market no longer appears to be especially tight,\nbut wage growth remains somewhat above the pace consistent with our inflation goal.\nThe recent revision of the Bureau of Labor Statistics labor data further vindicates my\nview that the labor market was not weakening in a concerning way during the summer of last\nyear. Although payroll employment gains were revised down considerably in the 12 months\n\n- 4 -\nthrough March 2024, job gains were little revised, on net, over the remainder of last year. It is\ncrucial that U.S. official data more accurately capture structural changes in labor markets in real\ntime, so we can confidently rely on these data for monetary and economic policymaking. But in\nthe meantime, given conflicting economic signals, measurement challenges, and significant data\nrevisions in recent years, I remain cautious about taking signal from only a limited set of real-\ntime data releases.\nAssuming the economy evolves as I expect, I think that inflation will slow further this\nyear. As the inflation data since the spring of last year show, its progress may be bumpy and\nuneven, and progress on disinflation may take longer than we would hope. I continue to see\ngreater risks to price stability, especially while the labor market remains strong.\nWith encouraging signs that geopolitical tensions may be abating in the Middle East,\nEastern Europe, and in Asia, I will be monitoring global supply chains which could continue to\nbe susceptible to disruptions, and lead to inflationary effects on food, energy, and other\ncommodity markets. In addition, the release of pent-up demand following the election could\nlead to stronger economic activity, which could also influence inflationary pressures.\nHaving entered a new phase in the process of moving the federal funds rate toward a\nmore neutral policy stance, there are a few considerations that lead me to prefer a cautious and\ngradual approach to adjusting policy, as it provides us time to assess progress in achieving our\ninflation and employment goals.\nGiven the current policy stance, I think that easier financial conditions from higher equity\nprices over the past year may have slowed progress on disinflation. And I am watching the\nincrease in longer-term Treasury yields that has occurred since the start of policy recalibration at\nthe September meeting. Some have interpreted it as a reflection of investors' concerns about\n\n- 5 -\ninflation risks and the possibility of tighter-than-expected policy that may be required to address\ninflationary pressures.\nThere is still more work to be done to bring inflation closer to our 2 percent goal.\nI would like to gain greater confidence that progress in lowering inflation will continue as we\nconsider making further adjustments to the target range. We need to keep inflation in focus\nwhile the labor market appears to be in balance and the unemployment rate remains at\nhistorically low levels. Before our March meeting, we will have received one additional month\nof inflation and employment data.\nLooking forward, it is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course.\nAt each FOMC meeting, my colleagues and I will make our decisions based on the incoming\ndata and the implications for and risks to the outlook and guided by the Fed's dual-mandate goals\nof maximum employment and stable prices. I will also continue to meet with a broad range of\ncontacts to help me interpret the signals provided by real-time data and as I assess the\nappropriateness of our monetary policy stance.\nBringing inflation in line with our price stability goal is essential for sustaining a healthy\nlabor market and fostering an economy that works for everyone in the longer run.\nMaintenance of the Regulatory Framework\nI will now turn to bank supervision, the bank applications process, and regulation.\nCommunity banks experience the burden of the regulatory framework most acutely when it is not\nappropriately tailored to their size, risk, complexity, and business model. While promoting\nsafety and soundness in the banking system—particularly among community banks—is an\nimportant and necessary regulatory objective, we must also be cautious to ensure that the\n\n- 6 -\nframework does not become an impediment to their operations, preventing them from providing\ncompetitive products and services, innovating, and engaging in appropriate risk-taking.\nDuring my tenure at the Board, I have laid out a wide range of issues and concerns that I\nsee as critical components that are necessary to build and maintain an effective regulatory\nframework.2 While I will only address a subset of these issues today, I’d like to begin by\nclarifying what I mean by this.\nOur work to maintain an effective framework is never really complete. Just as\ncomplacency can be fatal to the business of a bank, complacency can also prevent regulators\nfrom meeting their statutory obligation to promote a safe and sound banking system that enables\nbanks to serve their customers effectively and efficiently.\n2 See, e.g., Michelle W. Bowman, “Bank Regulation in 2025 and Beyond” (speech at the Kansas Bankers\nAssociation Government Relations Conference, Topeka, Kansas, February 5, 2025),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20250205a.pdf; Michelle W.

In our everyday\nlives, we invest significant time in maintenance. We schedule regular oil changes for our cars,\nand we invest in the infrastructure that allows our economy to function. Devoting resources to\nmaintenance often prevents more costly issues down the road—it’s easier to get oil changes than\nit is to rebuild an engine.\nSo, what does maintenance look like in practice? To address this question, I think it’s\nhelpful to look at three core areas in the bank regulatory framework: Supervision, Bank\napplications, and Regulation.\nApproach to Supervision\nLet’s start with supervision. Supervision operates almost entirely outside of the public\nview. Much of the work involves the review of proprietary business information from banks,\nand the preparation of examination reports shielded from public scrutiny under the auspices of\nprotecting confidential supervisory information. But confidentiality should not be used to\nprevent scrutiny and accountability in the assignment of ratings.\nSo, today, I am going to dig a bit deeper into the realm of supervision to discuss\nsupervisory ratings, accountability, and the troubling trend of inaction and opacity within the\nsupervisory toolkit.\nRational Standards & Ratings\nWhile there is some public disclosure of supervisory information, it is often difficult to\nget a true understanding of supervision based on data that may be released. In fact, this data\noften sends confusing and conflicting signals. For example, the Board’s Supervision and\nRegulation Report presented information stating that only one-third of large financial institutions\n\n- 8 -\nmaintained satisfactory ratings across all relevant ratings components in the first half of 2024.3\nAt the same time, this report noted that most large financial institutions met supervisory\nexpectations with respect to capital and liquidity.4\nThe odd mismatch between financial condition and overall supervisory condition as\nassessed by the prudential regulators raises a more significant issue, whether subjective examiner\njudgment—those evaluations based on subjective, examiner-driven, non-financial concerns—is\ndriving the firm’s overall rating. Are ratings trends based on the materiality of the identified\nissues, or do they imply that the regulators see widespread fragility in the banking system?\nWhile this example highlights a large bank ratings framework issue, it is symptomatic of\na broader issue that warrants scrutiny—whether the approach to supervision has led to a world in\nwhich core financial risks have been de-prioritized, and non-core and non-financial risks—things\nlike IT, operational risk, management, risk management, internal controls, and governance—\nhave been over-emphasized. These issues are important, and certainly worthwhile topics for\nexaminers to consider, but their review should not come at the expense of more material\nfinancial risk considerations—and they should not drive the overall assessment of a firm’s\ncondition. There is evidence that supervision has undergone such a shift, not only among large\nbanks, but among regional and community banks as well.5 For all institutions, financial metrics\nare not among the primary findings determined from the examination process, and arguably they\nhave been de-emphasized when assigning supervisory ratings.\n3 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Supervision and Regulation Report at 16-17\n(Washington: Board of Governors, November 2024), https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/202411-\nsupervision-and-regulation-report.pdf (describing data for the first half of 2024, the most recent period for which\ndata is available).\n4 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Supervision and Regulation Report.\n5 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Supervision and Regulation Report at 17, 20.\n\n- 9 -\nPrioritization is valuable in the supervisory process, both to inform how examiners\nallocate their time, but also in helping banks allocate resources to remediate issues identified\nduring the supervisory process. The frequency of supervisory findings related to non-financial\nmetrics may be a byproduct of how long it takes to remediate these issues, like longstanding\nissues with IT systems that have not been enhanced over many years of growth. However, we\nshould also be vigilant and deliberate about any shift in supervisory focus from financial risk\ntoward non-financial risks and internal processes, as this shift is not focused on fundamental\nsafety and soundness issues and it is not cost-free.\nWe should also not expect every firm to coalesce around a single set of products, internal\nprocesses, and risk-management practices. Variety in banking models is a strength and a\nnecessity of the U.S. banking system, relying on management and boards of directors to\ndetermine bank strategy, rather than a bank’s business model effectively being set by supervisory\ndirectives.\nSupervisory practices like horizontal reviews can create examiner incentives to expect\nuniformity and “grade on a curve,” but this approach perversely punishes variation among bank\npractices, stifling competition and innovation. Supervisory findings also inform bank ratings,\nwhich can have follow-on effects like limiting options for mergers and acquisitions (M&A);\nraising the cost of liquidity; or diverting resources away from other, more important bank\nmanagement priorities.\nDiagnostic Accountability\nTo maintain strong and appropriate supervisory standards and practices, we need to take a\nstep back and diagnose the bank regulatory system in its entirety: what is working, what is\nbroken, and what needs to be updated. When things go wrong, having an impartial check on\n\n- 10 -\nsubjective judgments can lead to a better diagnosis. Of course, a better diagnosis can produce\nmore efficient and targeted improvements, and better promote accountability. Accountability is\ncritical to maintaining an effective regulatory system, and yet it can be difficult to establish a\nregulatory culture that includes mechanisms to promote accountability for supervisors and\nregulators.6\nAt every organizational level, from examiners to agency leadership, judgments are made\nthat contribute to the overall effectiveness of the supervisory process. Reserve Bank examiners\nplay a critical role in examining Fed-regulated institutions, both banks and holding companies.\nThe Federal Reserve exercises its supervisory responsibilities by supervisory portfolio, with each\nportfolio relying on a combination of Board and Reserve Bank staff.7 But this split allocation of\nresponsibility should not diminish the accountability for supervisory decision making.\nResponsibility for supervisory decisions must be coupled with accountability for these decisions.\nThe misalignment of responsibility and accountability limits our ability to conduct effective\nsupervision.\nThis division of responsibility can pose a challenge to accountability. In the aftermath of\nthe bank failures in 2023 and the broader stress to the banking system, the Board and other\nagencies proposed a variety of regulatory reform measures to remediate and address identified\nissues, based on internal reviews of the failures and banking stress. While I applaud efforts to\nhold ourselves accountable, we must ensure that self-reviews are credible, both in the causes they\nidentify and in the reform agenda that they are used to support. An internal review process poses\n6 See Michelle W. Bowman, “Accountability for Banks, Accountability for Regulators” (Essay published in\nStarling Insights, February 13, 2024), https://www.federalreserve.gov/bowman-starling-insights-20240213.pdf.\n7 “Understanding Federal Reserve Supervision,” Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, last modified\nApril 27, 2023, https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/approaches-to-bank-supervision.htm.\n\n- 11 -\nthe temptation to avoid responsibility by assigning blame elsewhere, even when the review may\nbe motivated by good intentions and with the outward appearance of impartiality.\nMany of the core problems in the lead-up to the bank failures involved well-known, core\nbanking risks—interest rate risk, liquidity risk, and poor risk management. But if we look at the\nsubsequent reform agenda, we see that the policy emphasis has been on broader regulatory\nchanges rather than addressing supervisory program deficiencies. In my mind, this highlights the\nneed to have a process that challenges the subjective judgments of those that were involved in\noversight, not only in performing the diagnostics, but evaluating how identified issues can best\nbe remediated.\nPurging Inaction and Opacity from the Supervisory Toolkit\nSupervision differs significantly from the regulatory process. Implementing new\nregulations, or amending existing ones, requires a public notice and comment process established\nby the Administrative Procedure Act. When done appropriately, regulations require regulators to\n“show their work” by providing extensive analytical and factual support for proposals and final\nrules and soliciting comment from the public and addressing those comments before finalizing a\nregulation. In contrast, the execution of bank examinations and the issuance of supervisory\nguidance lack these procedural safeguards, instead relying heavily on discretion and judgment\nwith far lower standards for justifying actions taken with factual and analytical support under the\nveil of confidential supervisory information. The greater flexibility afforded in the supervisory\nprocess can lead to poor outcomes, often caused by the temptation to use inaction and opacity as\nsupervisory tools. In my view, these tools, inaction and opacity, are not appropriate and must be\nsubject to appropriate scrutiny or purged from the toolkit altogether.\n\n- 12 -\nFirst let’s consider inaction. The exam process requires open communication between\nexaminers and banks. Often interpretive questions arise during the exam process; how do\nexisting rules and statutes apply in a particular circumstance? These questions arise when\nexisting rules and guidance are unclear, which is a frequent occurrence. For example, how can a\nbank operate in a safe and sound manner while offering a new product or service, or when\nserving customers in particular business lines with unique needs? Banks go to great effort to\nmeet all applicable requirements and regulatory expectations, and regulators should welcome\nbanks seeking supervisory input and relying on a compliance-focused mindset.\nOpen communication with regulated banks is a hallmark of good supervision, but\nregulators must live up to their end of the bargain by not leaving banks in “limbo” for extended\nperiods of time. When a bank requests feedback and engages in good faith to provide\ninformation and respond to reasonable questions, regulators have an obligation to provide a clear\nresponse. Banks should not be left to wonder whether an interpretation of existing laws,\nregulations, and guidance is consistent with the understanding of regulators.\nNext, let’s consider opacity. Questions raised in the supervisory channel often result\nfrom supervisory expectations that lack sufficient clarity or the application of rules and\nregulations to new and emerging products and services. While regulators should not form an\nopinion without understanding the relevant facts and circumstances, they must also strive to\nprovide clarity—not just to the bank being examined, but to all banks. Supervisory expectations\nshould not surprise regulated firms, and yet transparency around expectations is often\nchallenging to achieve.8\n8 See Michelle W. Bowman, “Approaching Policymaking Pragmatically” (speech at the Forum Club of the Palm\nBeaches, West Palm Beach, Florida, November 20, 2024),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20241120a.pdf.\n\n- 13 -\nThe problem of opacity in supervisory expectations is exacerbated by the umbrella of\nconfidential supervisory information, or CSI, which is the label given to most materials\ndeveloped in the examination process. The rules designed to protect CSI limit the public’s\nvisibility into shifting priorities and expectations in the supervisory process.9 Changes in\nsupervisory expectations frequently come without the benefit of guidance, advance notice, or\npublished rulemaking. In the worst-case scenario these shifts, cloaked by the veil of supervisory\nopacity, can have significant financial and reputational impacts or can disrupt the management\nand operations of affected banks.\nOpacity in supervisory expectations, or in the interpretation of applicable laws and\nregulations, should not be discovered only at the conclusion of an examination with the issuance\nof deficiencies, matters requiring attention, matters requiring immediate attention, or other\nshortcomings.\nApproach to Applications\nSunshine is the best disinfectant when it comes to an approach that fosters transparency\nand accountability. So, I would like to spend a few minutes discussing how we can better shine a\nlight into the dark corners of the bank applications process.\nDe Novo Formation\nDe novo formation has essentially stagnated over the past several years. While many\nfactors have contributed to the decline in the aggregate number of banks in the United States, one\nkey factor has been the lack of new bank formation to replace banks that have been acquired or\nclosed their doors. This lack of de novo bank approvals does not necessarily indicate a lack of\n9 See Michelle W. Bowman, “Reflections on the Economy and Bank Regulation” (speech at the New Jersey\nBankers Association Annual Economic Leadership Forum, Somerset, New Jersey, March 7, 2024),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20240307a.pdf.\n\n- 14 -\ndemand for new charters though, particularly in light of ongoing demand for bank “charter strip”\nacquisitions where banks have been acquired just for their charters, the growing demand for\nbanking-as-a-service partnerships, and the shift of activities outside of the banking sector into the\nnon-bank financial system.10 We should consider whether the applications process itself has\nbecome an unnecessary impediment to de novo formation.\nHow can we improve the process of de novo formation? As fewer applications come in,\ninstitutional muscle memory for how to deal with new bank charters erodes, and it becomes\ndifficult to navigate and ultimately to overcome institutional inertia. A few steps like developing\nspecialized expertise, streamlining the application process, and improving transparency can yield\nsignificant improvements.\nFirst, de novo formations are very different from other bank applications where there are\nexisting institutions with established supervisory ratings and examination records. A de novo\nformation has no supervisory record of performance on which to base a decision or inform\njudgments about whether an application is consistent with approval. Instead, regulators must\nevaluate the proposal based on applicable statutory requirements: Is the business plan sound? Is\nappropriate bank leadership in place? Does the bank have a viable business plan and strategy?\nIs the bank’s proposal supported by sufficient capital? Should there be an expectation that all of\nthese questions are answered exhaustively often well over a year before the bank would be\nformed, if it is approved?\nIn recent years de novo formations have been rare, and therefore staff tasked with\nevaluating these proposals do not have a recent perspective or deep well of experience from\n10 See Michelle W. Bowman, “The Consequences of Fewer Banks in the U.S. Banking System” (speech at the\nWharton Financial Regulation Conference, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, April 14, 2023),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20230414a.pdf.\n\n- 15 -\nwhich to draw. Under our current approach, regional Reserve Banks are the primary point of\ncontact for de novo applicants. We should consider creating a specialized resource that can be\nutilized by any reserve bank to assist them during the pre-filing conversations with de novo\napplicants. Our goal should be to facilitate new bank creation—identifying and finding\nachievable pathways to yes, instead of expecting and insisting on increasing requirements to\nunachievable levels or those that are intended to deter applicants from filing or moving forward.\nWe should also consider whether there are ways to streamline the application process,\nincluding, if needed, by recommending statutory changes. While the agencies use some common\nforms, de novo formations currently involve a range of regulatory approvals. A de novo\napplicant must apply for a bank charter from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency or a\nstate banking authority, deposit insurance from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and\npotentially membership or a parallel holding company formation application with the Federal\nReserve.\nEach regulator may be focused on different aspects of the application, and each has the\nright to ask for additional information as part of the application review and analysis potentially\nsignificantly extending the review timeframe. We should have clear standards of review and\napproval—and coordinated actions—among the state and federal regulators involved in any\napplication. This should include clear timelines for the point at which a regulator forfeits their\nopportunity to object due to inaction, delay, or stalling tactics.\nBut standards for de novo approval are not always clear to applicants, which can lead to\nlengthy back-and-forth discussions with banking agency staff even after an applicant has\nprepared the information required by the appropriate application forms. The need for extensive\nadditional information from de novo applicants can be caused by a failure to provide information\n\n- 16 -\nrequested in the application form, but I suspect the submission of incomplete information is often\na product of forms that do not include all necessary information.\nWe should not need to constantly supplement application forms with ad hoc information\nrequests. If additional information is needed, we should modify the required application forms.\nOne area where the lack of transparent and clear standards is most evident is with the amount of\ncapital required to establish a de novo bank. Discussions around required capital often hinge on\nsubjective assessments based on planned business model and growth, but they rarely involve\nregulators providing a minimum required capital amount. Standards for approval should not be\nshrouded in mystery.\nReform of the de novo applications process should not be thought of as a deregulatory\nexercise. Clear and transparent standards do not imply “low” or inadequate standards. At the\nsame time, if we want to encourage a pipeline of de novo bank formations, we should also be\ncomfortable with the uncertainty that accompanies any new business, including the risk that\nsome de novo banks will not succeed.\nThe cost of eliminating the failure of de novo banks—or really of any banks at any\ntime—is simply too great. Banking is fundamentally about appropriately managed risks, and\nregulators play a key role in promoting a system that is safe and sound while also serving to\nsupport the banking needs of customers and broader economic growth. Our goal should not be\nto create a banking system that is safe, sound, and ultimately irrelevant.\nMergers and Acquisitions\nThe issues with the banking applications process extend beyond de novo formations, but\ninvolve some of the same concerns, whether there are clear standards, and we are able to act in a\ntimely manner. As a threshold matter, if regulators are clear about the information they need to\n\n- 17 -\nprocess an application—for example, by updating applications forms to include the full set of\ninformation needed to analyze each statutory approval requirement—then we should also hold\nourselves to fixed approval timelines. In my view, the purgatory of a long application process is\nanother form of regulatory “inaction” that must be eliminated.\nWe should also address aspects of the applications process that contribute to delay,\nincluding both the approach to competition and the public comment process.\nThe banking agencies have long relied on competitive “screens” to evaluate the pro\nforma effect of a merger. This process looks at the standalone institutions, imagines a merger in\nwhich their operations are combined, and then looks at how measures of competition will change\nin the areas served by the merged institutions. Where there is overlap in markets served, there is\nthe potential for tripping competitive screens and triggering additional scrutiny. At the Federal\nReserve, when a competitive screen is triggered the application process takes more time, as staff\nreviews the conflict, and the matter is removed from the Reserve Bank-delegated processing\ntrack.\nPerversely, many banks that trigger additional scrutiny operate in rural markets and have\nless aggregate banking business over which institutions can compete. In these concentrated\nmarkets, the analytical approach may involve a counterfactual in which only two future states of\nthe world exist—the banks continue to operate on a standalone basis, or the banks merge and\noperate as a consolidated whole. However, this framing ignores a possible third option, that one\nor both of the institutions will cease being viable and shut its doors, or be acquired by a credit\nunion, similarly leading to an erosion of market competition and potentially greater disruption to\nthe communities served. This analytical approach to evaluating competition no longer remains\nappropriate, and it needs to be reformed to better reflect actual market realities. This must\n\n- 18 -\ninclude competition from credit unions, the farm credit system, internet banks, financial\ntechnology firms and other non-banks.\nFinally, many M&A applications come to the Board due to the receipt of an adverse\ncomment from the public about the past supervisory record of one or both of the institutions\ninvolved in a merger. The receipt of an adverse comment causes substantial delays in the\nprocessing of an application, as this too removes an application from the “delegated” processing\nby the local Federal Reserve Bank, escalating the matter to the Board of Governors in D.C.\nWhile it is important that regulators take into account public feedback—and indeed, is required\nby applicable law—we should also be concerned about comments that may lack factual support\nor may solely rely on matters always considered in the review of a proposal, like the existing\nsupervisory records of the acquirer and the target institution, and may be negated by the\nregulator’s own examination report.\nApproach to Regulation – Cleanup and the Statutory Regulatory Review\nSince the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act nearly 15 years ago, the body of regulations that\nall banks are subject to has increased dramatically. Many of the reforms made after the 2008\nfinancial crisis were important and essential to ensuring a stronger and more resilient banking\nsystem. Yet, a number of the changes are backward looking—responding only to that mortgage\ncrisis—not fully considering the potential future unintended consequences or future states of the\nworld.\nWith well over a decade of change in the banking system now behind us post-\nimplementation, it is time to evaluate whether all these changes continue to be relevant. Some of\nthe regulations put in place immediately after that financial crisis resulted in pushing\nfoundational banking activities out of the banking system into less regulated corners of the\n\n- 19 -\nfinancial system. We need to ask whether this is appropriate. These tradeoffs are complicated,\nand we must consider not only the changes that were made but also the evolution of and\ndifferences in the banking system today.\nDriving all risk out of the banking system is at odds with the fundamental nature of the\nbusiness of banking. Banks, after all, are businesses. And they must be able to earn a profit and\ngrow while also managing their risks. Adding requirements that impose more costs must be\nbalanced with whether the new requirements make the correct tradeoffs between safety and\nsoundness and enabling banks to serve their customers and run their businesses. The task of\npolicymakers and regulators is not to eliminate risk from the banking system, but rather to ensure\nthat risk is appropriately and effectively managed.\nIn a well-functioning and appropriately regulated banking system, banks serve an\nindispensable role in credit provision and economic stability. The goal is to create and maintain\na system that supports safe and sound banking practices, and results in the implementation of\nappropriate risk management. No efficient banking system can eliminate all bank failures. But\nwell-designed and well-maintained systems can limit bank failures and mitigate the harm caused\nby any that occur.\nMaintenance of the regulatory framework is necessary to ensure that our regulations\ncontinue to strike the right balance between encouraging growth and innovation, and safety and\nsoundness. One easily identifiable way to achieve this is using the Economic Growth and\nRegulatory Paperwork Reduction Act (EGRPRA) review process, which the agencies initiated in\nFebruary last year.\nAlthough to-date it has not done so, the EGRPRA review requires the federal banking\nagencies to identify any outdated, unnecessary, or overly burdensome regulations and eliminate\n\n- 20 -\nunnecessary regulations and take other steps to address the regulatory burdens associated with\noutdated or overly burdensome regulations. As I noted, prior iterations of the EGRPRA process\nhave been underwhelming in their ability to result in meaningful change, but it is my expectation\nthat this review, and eventually the accompanying report to Congress, will provide a meaningful\nprocess for stakeholders and the public to engage with the banking agencies in identifying\nregulations that are no longer necessary or are overly burdensome. It is also my expectation that\nregulators will be responsive to concerns raised by the public.\nAnother area that is ripe for review are several of the Board’s rules that address core\nbanking issues—from loans to insiders, to transactions with affiliates, to state member bank\nactivities, and holding company requirements. Many of the Board’s regulations have not been\ncomprehensively reviewed or updated in more than 20 years. Given the dynamic nature of the\nbanking system and how the economy and banking and financial services industries have\nevolved over that period, it is imperative that we update and simplify many of the Board’s\nregulations, including thresholds for applicability and benchmarks.\nFinally, I want to address the unintended consequences of anti-money laundering\nrequirements in the provision of banking services. I think we can agree that fighting money\nlaundering, terrorist financing, and other illicit activities is not only a statutory responsibility of\nthe banking system but it also serves important public policy goals. But while the regulatory\nframework prescribing how banks fulfill this role is not within the Federal Reserve’s\nresponsibilities, it is important to consider how these requirements affect the ability of banks to\nserve customers. For example, the threshold for currency transaction reports (CTR) was\nestablished more than 50 years ago and has not been updated or indexed to inflation during that\n\n- 21 -\ntime. Just as an example, at the time it was implemented, a fully loaded Cadillac cost less than\nthe CTR threshold. We’ve come a long way since 1972.\nIt has also created a regime of more extensive and invasive reporting of customers’\ntransactions that may pose little actual risks related to tracking illicit activities. This reporting\nregime is also not cost-free, as banks may opt to avoid banking customers that trigger high\nvolumes of CTR reporting, or that otherwise trigger the filing of suspicious activity reports. The\ncalibration of reporting requirements, their effect on bank customers, and the growing problem\nof customer “de-banking,” warrant greater public attention.\nThe Federal Reserve should review the supervisory messages given to banks and their\nholding companies about how supervisors will evaluate and consider the bank’s risks associated\nwith customers that are caught in the Bank Secrecy Act or Anti-Money Laundering reporting\nweb. I am concerned that this framework is being used to downgrade a bank’s condition based\non a disproportionate weighting of its compliance with these requirements in comparison to its\noverall condition. There are separate examinations conducted for this purpose, and they should\nbe viewed separately, not as a cudgel for downgrading a bank’s condition through the\ngovernance and controls mechanism or management assessment.\nClosing Thoughts\nThe banking system can be an engine of economic growth and opportunity, particularly\nwhen it is supported by a bank regulatory framework that is rational and well-maintained. The\nwork of rationalizing and maintaining this system is an ongoing cycle. While my remarks today\nhave touched on a wide range of issues that require rationalization and “maintenance,” this is by\nno means an exhaustive list.\n\n- 22 -\nMaintaining an effective framework is not only about ensuring the existing plumbing\ncontinues to work (and making it more efficient where possible) but it also must include\npromoting a system that is responsive to emerging threats and the needs of the banking system.\nAs an example, the significant increase in fraud over the past few years has not generated the\nstrong regulatory and governmental response necessary, even though fraud can become a source\nof material financial risk, particularly to smaller institutions.\nThank you again for the opportunity to share my thoughts with you today. As always, it\nis a pleasure to be with you!",

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe South Carolina Bankers Association\n2024 Community Bankers Conference\nColumbia, South Carolina\nJanuary 8, 2024\n\nIt is a pleasure to join you this afternoon for the South Carolina Community Bankers\nConference.1 I always welcome the opportunity to learn from and share my perspective with\nbankers on issues affecting the U.S. economy and the financial industry. Today, I will focus my\ndiscussion on monetary policy, bank regulatory reforms, the evolving standards in bank\nsupervision, and new developments in the payments system. I look forward to learning from\nyour insights and perspectives on these issues, particularly your views on bank supervision,\nregulatory reforms, and your thoughts on the direction of the economy. As we kick off the new\nyear, it’s also a good time to look back on 2023 and consider a few New Year’s resolutions for\nthe coming year.\nBefore discussing bank regulation and supervision, I’d like to offer my thoughts on the\neconomy and monetary policy.\nOur Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in December left the target range\nfor the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent and continued the run-off of the Fed’s\nsecurities holdings. Inflation data over the past six months indicate that the Committee’s past\npolicy actions are having the intended effect of bringing demand and supply into better balance.\nThis continued progress on lowering inflation reflects a restrictive policy stance with the most\nrecent 12-month total and core personal consumption expenditures inflation readings through\nNovember at 2.6 and 3.2 percent respectively. Employment data, though often significantly\nrevised, continue to show signs of a tight labor market with reports of healthy job gains. The\naverage pace of job gains has slowed over the past year, which may be a sign that labor market\nsupply and demand are coming into better balance. The economy has remained strong even with\n1 The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee or the Board of Governors.\n\n- 2 -\nthe pace of real gross domestic product projected to moderate from the third quarter 2023\nstrength.\nConsidering this progress, I voted to maintain the policy rate at its current level while we\ncontinue to monitor the incoming data and assess the implications for the inflation and economic\noutlook. And based on this progress, my view has evolved to consider the possibility that the\nrate of inflation could decline further with the policy rate held at the current level for some time.\nShould inflation continue to fall closer to our 2 percent goal over time, it will eventually become\nappropriate to begin the process of lowering our policy rate to prevent policy from becoming\noverly restrictive. In my view, we are not yet at that point. And important upside inflation risks\nremain.\nTo the extent that both food and energy markets remain exposed to geopolitical\ninfluences, they present upside risks to inflation. There is also the risk that the recent easing in\nfinancial conditions encourages a reacceleration of growth, stalling the progress in lowering\ninflation, or even causing inflation to reaccelerate. Finally, there is a risk that continued labor\nmarket tightness could lead to persistently high core services inflation. While I do not tend to\ntake too much signal from one report, last Friday’s employment report showed continued\nstrength in job gains and wage growth, and the labor force participation rate declined.\nGiven these risks, and the general uncertainty regarding the economic outlook, I will\ncontinue to watch the data closely—including data revisions, which have increased in magnitude\nand frequency since the pandemic—as I assess the appropriate path of monetary policy. I will\nremain cautious in my approach to considering future changes in the stance of policy.\nIt is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course. My colleagues and I\nwill make our decisions at each meeting based on the incoming data and the implications for the\n\n- 3 -\noutlook. While the current stance of monetary policy appears to be sufficiently restrictive to\nbring inflation down to 2 percent over time, I remain willing to raise the federal funds rate\nfurther at a future meeting should the incoming data indicate that progress on inflation has stalled\nor reversed. Restoring price stability is essential for achieving maximum employment and stable\nprices over the longer run.\nTwenty-twenty-three was a particularly busy year for banking regulators. Before I dig\ndeeper into bank regulation, I’d like to recap a few of 2023’s notable banking industry events.\nAnd since we are embarking on a journey into the new year, I will conclude by offering a few\nideas for New Year’s resolutions for regulators to consider prioritizing for 2024. These\nresolutions borrow heavily from principles that I have discussed publicly a number of times in\nthe past, but they continue to be critical in guiding my thinking and approach to regulation. And\nI encourage my colleagues in banking regulation and supervision to consider these ideas as we\nbegin 2024 with a full regulatory agenda.\nKey Developments in 2023\nTwenty-twenty-three brought many significant developments in bank regulation and\nsupervision, beginning with speculation about the now-issued proposal to finalize the Basel III\n“endgame” capital rules. The Basel III capital rules were designed to apply only to the largest\nbanks with significant cross-border activities, so much of the speculation early last year focused\non scope—which banks would be subject to the rules under the new proposal—and calibration,\nhow the capital requirements would change—whether they would increase, decrease, or remain\nthe same. On the question of calibration, much of the speculation centered around whether\nregulators would propose significant increases to aggregate capital requirements or adopt a\n“capital neutral” approach by refining standards but keeping aggregate capital levels largely the\n\n- 4 -\nsame. The objective of having a “capital neutral” proposal seemed reasonable to many, based on\nthe understanding that a holistic review of the capital framework was in process at the Federal\nReserve Board.\nIn March, however, priorities and focus changed. The failures of Silicon Valley Bank\n(SVB) and Signature Bank resulted in the exceedingly rare steps to invoke the systemic risk\nexception to guarantee all depositors of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank,2 and to create\nthe Bank Term Funding Program.3 These were significant emergency actions to support and\nstabilize the banking system. It is important to note that the Bank Term Funding Program is\nscheduled to expire in mid-March of this year. Understandably, the bank failures led regulators\nto take a hard look at what may have been missed in our supervision and what had driven\nregulatory and supervisory priorities leading up to these bank failures.\nSeveral post-mortem reviews were conducted in the immediate aftermath of the failures\nto identify and analyze the circumstances and factors that contributed to the bank failures. Many\nof these reviews suffered from serious shortcomings, including compressed timeframes for\ncompletion and the significantly limited matters that were within the scope of review.\nNevertheless, these reviews were, and continue to be, singularly relied upon as a basis for\nresetting regulatory and supervisory priorities. The findings of these limited reviews have also\ncontinued to influence proposals that had long been in the pipeline, especially those related to\ncapital reforms.\nI view the remainder of last year as something akin to a regulatory tidal wave, in light of\nthe sheer volume of regulatory initiatives considered, published, and finalized. Many were\n2 See 12 U.S.C. § 1823(c)(4)(G).\n3 See 12 U.S.C. § 343.\n\n- 5 -\nundertaken or expanded with the purported goal to help address root causes of the bank failures\nand banking system stress. But this also included a rulemaking agenda that at times had little to\nno nexus with the root causes of the failures. Without a doubt, it was a challenge to support the\nregulatory agenda this past year.\nThe published capital rulemaking proposal incorporated an expansive scope, a notable\nshift in approach, pushing down new Basel capital requirements to all banks with over $100\nbillion in assets, regardless of their international activities.4 At the same time, the capital\nproposal would substantially increase regulatory capital buffer and minimum requirements for\nthe covered firms. In close succession, the agencies proposed new “long-term debt”\nrequirements. This long-term debt proposal would require firms with over $100 billion in assets\nto issue debt at the top-tier parent level that could better absorb losses during bankruptcy, which\nonly becomes relevant after the bank fails, not in order to prevent a failure. In part, these\nproposals were characterized as helping to address the root causes of the bank failures. As I’ve\nnoted in the past, I think there are reasons to question whether these proposed revisions are\neffective and appropriately targeted and calibrated, particularly when considering that bank\nmanagement and supervisory shortcomings more directly contributed to the bank failures than\nregulatory shortcomings. The banking agencies simply cannot regulate better or more effective\nsupervision. We must appropriately manage our supervisory programs and teams to ensure that\neffective and consistent supervision is implemented within each firm and that it is effective and\nconsistent across our regulated entities.\n4 See dissenting statement, “Statement by Governor Michelle W. Bowman” on the proposed rule to implement the\nBasel III endgame agreement for large banks, news release, July 27, 2023,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bowman-statement-20230727.htm.\n\n- 6 -\nFor community banks, two of the most important developments last year were the\nfinalization of revisions to the Community Reinvestment Act regulations, and the proposal to\namend the debit interchange fee cap in the Board’s Regulation II. Many in the banking industry\nhave expressed concern with the amendments to the CRA regulations, noting among other things\nthe increased cost and burden associated with a number of the proposed revisions and new data\nsystems required for compliance. In addition, many raised concerns about the potential adverse\nconsequences of the rules, which include the possibility that these rules will reduce the\navailability of credit in some underserved markets if banks cut back lending activities due to\nrevisions made to assessment areas defined in the new rules.5 Similarly, the proposed revisions\nto Regulation II have generated concern from banks directly subject to the rules, but also from\nexempt banks concerned that the practical effect will be to push lower interchange fees down to\nall debit card issuers.6\nOf course, supervision also saw significant changes in 2023, with the publication of new\nguidance on third-party risk management applicable to all financial institutions, without tailoring\nor guidance to assist the smallest banks in compliance,7 and climate guidance that on its face\napplies only to institutions with more than $100 billion in assets.8 In 2023, many banks also\nreported very material shifts in bank examinations, with a renewed focus on interest rate risk,\n5 See dissenting statement, “Statement on the Community Reinvestment Act Final Rule by Governor Michelle W.\nBowman,” news release, October 24, 2023, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bowman-\nstatement-20231024.htm.\n6 See dissenting statement, “Statement on Proposed Revisions to Regulation II’s Interchange Fee Cap by Governor\nMichelle W. Bowman,” news release, October 25, 2023,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bowman-statement-20231025.htm.\n7 See dissenting statement, “Statement on Third-Party Risk Management Guidance by Governor Michelle W.\nBowman,” news release, June 6, 2023, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bowman-\nstatement-20230606.htm.\n8 See dissenting statement “Statement by Governor Bowman on Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk\nManagement for Large Financial Institutions,” news release, December 2, 2022,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bowman-statement-20221202.htm.\n\n- 7 -\nliquidity risk, and management, and banks continue to see ongoing changes in supervisory\nexpectations. Many of these examination-related shifts have received little public\nacknowledgement or attention, in large part because the rules designed to protect confidential\nsupervisory information frustrate visibility into structural shifts in the supervisory process. As\nyou all know well, changes in supervisory expectations frequently come without the benefit of\nguidance, advance notice, or published rulemaking, and in the worst-case scenario these shifts,\ncloaked by the veil of supervisory opacity, can have significant financial and reputational\nimpacts.\nResolutions for 2024\nThe new year provides a prime opportunity to reflect on the past 12 months and think\nabout how the Federal Reserve can improve our approach. I’m sure many of us took the\nopportunity to reflect on recent experiences as we rang in 2024. I see the new year as a perfect\ntime to think about how the banking regulators can implement some recent lessons learned. This\nvery brief snapshot of the past year does not cover all of the important developments in the\nbanking system, and the bank regulatory framework, that occurred in 2023. But it is a helpful\nstarting point for considering the year ahead. So now, I’d like to offer three new year’s\nresolutions for bank regulators.\nPrioritize Safety and Soundness\nFirst, safety and soundness should be renewed as the highest priority supervisory\nconcern. This is a regulator’s greatest responsibility and ensures the safe and sound continuous\noperation of the financial system. Last year’s stress, precipitated by the spring bank failures,\nvalidated the tenet that supervision, when implemented effectively and appropriately, is the\nsingle most effective tool to support a safe and sound banking system. In the case of SVB,\n\n- 8 -\nsupervisors failed to appreciate, appropriately identify, and mitigate the known significant,\nidiosyncratic risks of a business model that relied on a highly concentrated, uninsured base of\ndepositors, and the buildup of interest rate risk without appropriate risk management.\nBut as every banker in this room knows, concentration risk and interest rate risk are not\nnovel or unique risks, and these good old-fashioned risks can create vulnerabilities fatal to\nindividual institutions if not appropriately anticipated and managed. Banking regulators and\nsupervisors at all levels of our dual banking system have long focused on these risks. Therefore,\nI recommend that regulators collectively resolve to renew the focus on these and other\nlongstanding and fundamental risks to banks and the banking system.\nSo, what should bank regulators do differently to prioritize safety and soundness? In my\nview, the problems in 2023 resulted from a failure to identify and prioritize the appropriate areas\nof risk. Instead, the focus was on broader, more qualitative, more process- and policy-oriented\nareas of risk. This focus resulted in a disproportionate emphasis on issues that distracted from\nthe fundamental risks to the bank’s balance sheet.\nRegulators often identify evolving conditions and emerging risks before they materialize\nas pronounced stress in the banking system. But too often, regulators fail to take appropriately\ndecisive measures to address them. Regulators can also fall into the trap of getting distracted\nfrom core financial risks, and instead focus on issues that are tangential to statutory mandates\nand critical areas of responsibility. Focusing on risks that pose fewer safety and soundness\nconcerns increases the risk that regulators miss other, more foundational and pressing areas that\nrequire more immediate attention.\nIn my view, the new climate guidance introduced by the federal banking agencies last\nyear effectively illustrates this lost focus. While perhaps well-intended, this guidance mandates\n\n- 9 -\na diversion of limited supervisory resources away from critical, near-term safety and soundness\nrisks. Setting aside differing views about the appropriateness of the content of the guidance, the\nfundamental question is whether climate change is a core, present-tense risk to safety and\nsoundness—not whether climate change is an important public policy issue. And here, the\nevidence suggests that climate change is not currently a prominent financial risk to the banking\nsystem.\nThis lack of attention and focus on the most material safety and soundness risks may\nresult from intentional policy preferences, or simply may be the product of allowing ourselves to\nbe distracted from known, longstanding risks over calm periods of banking conditions.\nWhatever the cause, it comes at a significant cost, as both banks and regulators shift resources\nand supervisory attention away from the most pressing risks.\nRenewed Commitment to Tailoring\nSecond, is a renewed commitment to our Congressionally mandated obligation to\ntailoring. The current bank regulatory framework relies upon a risk-based, tailored approach,\nwhich strives to fulfill the congressional mandate to tailor the prudential regulatory framework\nfor institutions with more than $100 billion in assets by aligning regulation with risk.9 As we\nengage in ongoing regulatory reform, we must not lose sight of the virtues of this approach, for\ninstitutions of all sizes. Tailoring helps regulators prioritize the allocation of supervisory\nresources to focus on the most important risks and emerging threats to the financial system.\nTailoring regulations does not mean that regulators can or should ignore safety and soundness\nissues at smaller institutions, or that the standards for smaller institutions should not be robust.\nAs this audience knows well, all banks are subject to periodic examinations, capital\n9 Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, Pub. L. No. 115-174, 132 Stat. 1296 (2018).\n\n- 10 -\nrequirements, and regulatory reporting requirements, and have regular engagement with bank\nexaminers at the state and or federal levels. Starting with an approach that acknowledges the\nimportance of tailoring helps us avoid the impulse to simply crank regulatory dials to their\nhighest level for all firms (or “up to 11,” like the amplifiers in the classic film, This Is Spinal\nTap).10 This type of approach overlooks fundamental differences in business model and asset\nsize, while tailoring ensures that we appropriately calibrate regulations and expectations to the\nsize, complexity, and business model of institutions.\nThe existing capital framework provides a well-reasoned model for how this tailored\napproach results in appropriate requirements based on firm characteristics. The largest firms are\ndivided into four categories based on size and complexity, with the largest and most complex\nfirms being subject to the most stringent requirements. Regional banks, with $10 billion to $100\nbillion in assets, are subject to a somewhat more streamlined capital framework. And finally, the\nsimplest rules are reserved for community banks that rely on a less complex, relationship-based\nbusiness model.\nAs this example illustrates, incorporating graduated requirements not only helps to\neffectively allocate limited supervisory resources, but it also avoids creating regulatory\nincentives that could unintentionally alter the banking landscape. For example, without tailoring,\nit is likely that the requirements for the largest and most complex banks would be pushed down\nto smaller banks that have simple, straightforward business models, either directly through\nchanges to regulation, or indirectly through opaque supervisory expectations. This environment\nwould create overwhelming incentives for industry consolidation, since a bank with a simple\nbusiness model would be subject to and expected to comply with requirements designed for\n10 This Is Spinal Tap, directed by Rob Reiner (1984).\n\n- 11 -\nlarger and more complex banks, and consolidation creates economies of scale that make it more\ncost-effective to comply with these requirements.\nMy concern is that an overbroad application of requirements—requirements that are not\ntailored—could become a characteristic of future regulatory reforms. The Basel capital proposal\nhighlights this concern. While the comment period is still open until January 16, much of the\nfeedback shared with me so far has focused on two prominent concerns: (1) that the increases to\ncapital requirements would be significantly higher than stakeholders anticipated, and (2) that the\nproposal would largely “flatten” the regulatory requirements for all banks over $100 billion,\ncreating a severe cliff effect for firms approaching or crossing that threshold. Banks within this\nasset range are already carefully considering the ongoing viability of remaining at an asset size\nnear that threshold. Firms just above the threshold will face strong pressure to shrink below the\nthreshold or to merge to achieve economies of scale to comply with the breadth and complexity\nof the new requirements. Firms just below the threshold will need to be very intentional about\napproaching it and may consider revising business strategies and activities to remain below the\nthreshold.\nWhile the capital proposal does not directly apply to regional and community banks, all\nbanks are affected when policymakers shift away from or deemphasize tailoring. When we fail\nto recognize fundamental differences among firms, there is a strong temptation to continually\npush down requirements designed and calibrated for larger and more complex banks, to smaller\nand less complex banks that cannot reasonably be expected to comply with these standards. As\nwe look to the future and the anticipated regulatory agenda for 2024, the critical role of tailoring\nmust be incorporated as a foundational element of these regulatory reforms.\n\n- 12 -\nIncrease Transparency\nThe third and final resolution is increasing transparency in supervisory expectations.\nWhile policymakers may have different views on the decisions embedded in the regulatory\nframework, such as where thresholds should be set, and the calibration of different requirements,\none virtue of regulation is that the requirements are spelled out in public, in advance, and in\nsome specificity and granularity. If you are a bank, you know which regulations apply to your\nbusiness model.\nBut is this true in practice? As a banker, do you always know the standards to which you\nwill be held prior to the examination? One of the concerning trends in 2023 were reports,\nincluding from state banking regulators, that some supervisory actions were excessive in light of\nthe risks posed by some smaller institutions. It seems reasonable that the banking system stress\nplayed a role in tightening supervisory expectations. But we must also ensure that supervisory\nexpectations and the resulting actions are appropriately calibrated and based on existing\nconditions, rather than driven by premature judgments and uncertain or unsupported supervisory\npredictions or assumptions. Transparency allows bankers to understand supervisory expectations\nin advance and work to meet those expectations. As you know, bankers have a deep\ncommitment to operate safely and soundly but have no ability to look inside the mind of an\nexaminer to divine that expectations have shifted. Opaque shifts in expectations can create\nunwelcome surprises in the examination process. These “surprises,” in the form of ratings\ndowngrades, can create significant issues for banks: they can disrupt business plans, including\nbank mergers and acquisitions, and create pressure on a bank to divert resources away from\nserving customers to addressing non-critical supervisory matters.\n\n- 13 -\nThe increasing trend of supervisory “surprises” we saw in 2023 suggests to me a\nshortcoming in supervisory transparency. This by no means suggests that banks should not be\nheld to high standards. To the contrary, it means that we should hold banks to standards that are\nknown and identifiable, and when those standards inevitably evolve over time, we should give\nadvance notice to our regulated institutions so they can manage their businesses accordingly to\nensure continued compliance.\nClosing Thoughts\nI will conclude by expressing my appreciation for the opportunity to speak to you today.\nWe are entering the new year at a time when significant changes to the banking system and bank\nregulatory framework are actively being considered. Many of these changes will have a lasting\nimpact on banks of all sizes and their current and future customers, how banks run their\nbusinesses, and the broader U.S. economy.\nMy hope is that you, as bankers, and other interested stakeholders play an active role in\nthis process, by sharing your views and concerns broadly, including with regulators directly.\nThis input provides valuable insights into the specific impacts—intended and unintended—of\nchanges to the bank regulatory framework. Voicing your concerns enables us to identify, and\nwhere needed, address, the real-world consequences of regulatory and supervisory reforms. I\ncertainly don’t need to remind this audience that the stakes are extremely high. My sincere hope\nfor 2024 is that policymakers have the humility to acknowledge the intended and unintended\nconsequences of these and upcoming regulatory reform efforts, and the courage to change\ncourse, when necessary, to mitigate and minimize these consequences. The future of the banking\nsystem and the ongoing strength of the U.S. economy depend on it.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n7:15 p.m. EDT\nApril 2, 2019\nFostering Closer Supervisory Communication\nRemarks by\nMichelle W. Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nConference of State Bank Supervisors\nWashington, D.C.\nApril 2, 2019\n\nThank you to the Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS) for this\nopportunity to share my perspective and some of my goals as a Federal Reserve Board\ngovernor on issues of interest to you and many in your states.1\nI emphasize that word “perspective” because the view from Washington can be\nvery different from how things look in your states and communities. No one knows that\nbetter than I do, of course, because not so long ago, I was sitting where you are, enjoying\nthe dinner provided by CSBS and hearing the perspective from Washington. I’m still\nenjoying the dinner tonight, but find I am now, so to speak, also on the menu. And in this\nposition, as part of the Federal Reserve but also still deeply rooted in my experience as a\ncommunity banker and state regulator, I’ll offer my thoughts on forging a closer\nrelationship and strengthening communication between the Board of Governors and state\nbanking commissioners.\nFirst, to establish some context, let me say a few words about the Fed’s role and\nperspective on supervising community banks. The lion’s share of community banks are\nthose with total assets of $500 million or less, with the Fed defining the sector as those\nwith up to $10 billion in assets. The Federal Reserve directly supervises 731 state-\nchartered community banks, which is only a small share of the number of state-chartered\nbanks overseen by CSBS members. The fact that this is only a small share of the total\nmight sound to some people like the Federal Reserve has only a small role in community\nbanking. But it’s important to remember that the Fed is the primary federal supervisor\nresponsible for all bank and thrift holding companies, a total of 3,912. This includes the\nvast majority of all community banking organizations. The Fed also influences the\n1 My views are my own and do not represent the view of the Board of Governors or its other members.\n\n- 2 -\nsupervision of all community and regional banks by developing both safety and\nsoundness and consumer rules to implement laws passed by Congress, applicable to\ninsured depositories and their holding companies. Typically this is done in collaboration\nwith other federal agencies and after seeking the public’s input. I mention Congress and\nthese other agencies to emphasize that the Fed shares responsibility for writing and\nimplementing federal regulations for community banks.\nNow, let me describe my role. In addition to my broader responsibilities in\nsupervision and regulation, I am Chair of the Board’s Smaller Regional and Community\nBanking subcommittee, which oversees our work in this area. I am also the Chair of the\nBoard’s committee tasked with oversight of our rulemaking and supervision on consumer\nissues.\nI also participate in carrying out the Federal Reserve’s other responsibilities, such\nas conducting monetary policy and overseeing the payment system. But it’s fair to say\nthat my background in community banking was an important reason I was chosen and\nconfirmed by Congress as the first person to fulfill a new requirement that at least one\ngovernor have primary experience working in or supervising community banks. My\nbackground and commitment to community banking is also some important context for\nwhat I have to say about the Fed’s interests in improving communication with the\nmembers of CSBS.\nI mentioned a moment ago that the perspective in Washington, and from the\nBoard, can be different from the view from your position as banking commissioners, and\nthat is certainly true. But one thing I have learned, since joining the Board in November,\nis that my fellow governors, along with the staff at the Board, share your view, as I do,\n\n- 3 -\nabout the vital importance of community banking and the essential role community banks\nplay in our financial system.\nCommunity banks are frequently the economic engines supporting and driving the\neconomies of many communities, especially in rural areas. In these communities, they\nare the primary providers of financial services for individuals and small businesses, and a\nsource of financial advice and civic leadership. They play an indispensable role in areas\nnot served by larger institutions and in other communities of all different sizes, from\nurban to rural, serving a range of customers, including some that are sometimes not as\nhigh a priority for larger banks.\nI think it is important to note, and too often overlooked, that the vast majority of\ncommunity banks managed their risks well in the years leading up to and during the\nfinancial crisis and were not the source of the excessive risk taking that caused the crisis.\nFor this reason among others, the Federal Reserve has been engaged in an active effort to\ntailor regulations, including those issued in the wake of the financial crisis, to\nappropriately reflect the potential risk that an institution might pose to financial stability.\nI am pleased to see some evidence we are making progress. Last year’s CSBS\nsurvey found that community banks reported a decrease in regulatory costs in 2017.2\nThis was the first reduction in burden reported since the survey began in 2014. The\ndecline was attributed to the implementation of changes stemming from the recent review\nby the banking agencies under the EGRPRA, the Economic Growth and Regulatory\nPaperwork Reduction Act of 1996. There has been progress in tailoring regulations that\n2 Federal Reserve System, Conference of State Bank Supervisors, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.,\n2018 Community Banking in the 21st Century (Research and Policy Conference, October 3–4, 2018),\nhttps://www.communitybanking.org/~/media/files/publication/cb21pub_2018_final.pdf.\n\n- 4 -\naffect community banks, and I believe more progress lies ahead as we implement the\nchanges that Congress included in S. 2155 and explore additional opportunities to reduce\nburden while maintaining the resiliency and strength of smaller banks.3\nBefore I go further, let me give a brief assessment of how community banks are\nfaring. This might seem like an issue that is primarily of interest to community bankers\nand regulators, but I don’t look at it that way at all. One of my most important\nresponsibilities now is voting on the monetary policy decisions of the Federal Open\nMarket Committee, and that requires me to closely and constantly monitor the health of\nthe U.S. economy. And when community banks are the source for more than half of all\nlending to small businesses, which together account for two-thirds of private sector job\ncreation, then the health of community banking has a big influence on the health of the\nU.S. economy.4\nSince the financial crisis, the health of the community-banking sector has\nimproved significantly. Over those years and today, the large majority of community\nbanks have maintained sound levels of capital. Although the number of community\nbanks in the United States continues to fall due to consolidation, overall the sector\ncontinues to post strong earnings, which, in turn, contribute to maintaining healthy capital\npositions. One measure of this strong financial position is that no community banks\nfailed in 2018. The shared responsibility we have as financial supervisors to ensure the\nongoing viability of community banks requires cooperation and coordination. We must\n3 Pub. L. No. 115-174, 132 Stat. 1296 (2018)\n4 U.S. Small Business Administration, Office of Advocacy, Frequently Asked Questions About Small\nBusiness (August 2018), https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/advocacy/Frequently-Asked-Questions-\nSmall-Business-2018.pdf.\n\n- 5 -\ncontinue to ensure that the institutions we supervise are proactively managing their risks\nto remain strong. It’s our job to identify emerging risks to community banks and to\nensure bankers are identifying and managing their risks appropriately. We want to ensure\nthat loans are underwritten prudently and that bankers are actively managing the\nconcentrations of credit risk in their portfolios.\nWe welcome the strong lending growth that many community banks are\nexperiencing, which is fueling job creation and sustaining our economic expansion,\nwhich in July will become the longest in U.S. history. But strong lending growth must be\nsupported by prudent, well-managed funding plans in order to manage the risk that strains\non liquidity may arise more quickly than is sometimes anticipated.\nNow, let me turn back to my main theme today, which is fostering better\ncommunication between CSBS and state banking commissioners and the Board of\nGovernors. Improved communication is a top priority for me for several reasons.\nFirst, it is very much my approach to government service, and leadership in\nparticular, to do a lot of listening. A wise person once said that the most effective leaders\ndo more listening than talking. When I became Kansas’ State Bank Commissioner, I\nstarted a twice-yearly series of roundtables with the chief executives of banks across the\nstate. It was an excellent way for me to better understand the issues that were impacting\nbankers in a way that was less formal than when banks comment on rules and less fraught\nthan the supervisory process. Sure, it took time away from the office, from consultation\nwith the legislature, and the deadlines all of us have faced. In my case, considering the\nsize of Kansas, it was also time away from home and family. However, I don’t have to\n\n- 6 -\ntell those of you who have also found a lot of merit in such tours that it is an enormous\nadvantage to find out what is on the minds of those in the field.\nThe second, very straightforward reason to foster better communication with all\nof you is that the nature of financial regulation and supervision in the United States\nargues strongly for better coordination. To a much greater extent than in other nations, in\nthe United States financial oversight is divided between the federal government and\nsubnational authorities--the states. At the federal level, responsibility is further divided\nbetween different agencies, such as the Fed, the FDIC, the Office of Comptroller of the\nCurrency, and the National Credit Union Administration. This system evolved over time,\nand as things stand, there are some advantages to this specialization. But this division of\nlabor may, at times, inhibit information sharing, and as a general principle, better\ncommunication can help overcome this challenge.\nMore specifically, better communication and information sharing between state\nbanking commissioners and the Federal Reserve can further improve the early\nidentification and resolution of emerging issues at community banks. Harnessing and\nsharing these sometimes divergent views can serve to strengthen a financial regulatory\nsystem that shares responsibility among many state and federal agencies. Better\ncommunication and information sharing will benefit both you and the Federal Reserve,\nbut my motivation is that the Fed has much to gain here. Because states are responsible\nfor chartering and co-supervising the large majority of community banks, they can\nprovide a broader perspective into local community banking issues and trends.\nLet me pause here for a moment and say that improving communication doesn’t\nnecessarily mean that the Federal Reserve and the CSBS members will always agree. We\n\n- 7 -\nwon’t, and perhaps we shouldn’t. A diversity of views can be a strength. A robust\ndiscussion requires a thorough analysis of differing views, which leads to a more\ninformed understanding of issues. This healthy give and take is the fourth reason for\nbetter communication: It leads to better outcomes.\nI will cite one example that I know is on the minds of many of you--the\nrulemaking process the agencies are currently engaged in on the community bank\nleverage ratio (CBLR). Here is an excellent example of where it makes good sense to\nconsult closely. I know you have a lot of knowledge and expertise to bring to bear on\nthis issue, which helps explain why Congress has required the agencies to consult with\nthe states. As you know, the Fed and the other agencies are now gathering and evaluating\ncomments on the CBLR and getting feedback on this interagency proposal. So, now is a\ngood time to re-engage. I am committed to re-engaging with you on the interagency\nproposal and ways we might be able to improve it. I am eager to hear your thoughts.\nI have one more reason for better communication, but first I will give you an idea\nof what I have in mind for that consultation. The formal means by which CSBS and\nothers comment on a rulemaking is important, but I think we would also all benefit from\nmore informal, and more frequent contact. If you have an issue, if you have something to\nsay, just pick up the phone. It is also my intention to be on the road a lot, visiting Federal\nReserve Districts and talking to bankers, consumers, and community groups. When I\ncome to your state, I hope to see you, and I promise to make time to talk.\nMy final reason for better communication brings me back to a point I made at the\noutset: the United States needs a strong community-banking sector. We need strong\ncommunity banks because they help support strong communities. Strong communities\n\n- 8 -\nare the building blocks of a strong nation. They provide safety, education and economic\nopportunities, and help define the values we hold dear. Community banks are vital to the\nsuccess of communities. They help us save and plan for a better future. The credit they\nextend helps preserve farming as a way of life for American families, and provides the\nmeans for small businesses to start and to thrive, which is so important to the health of\ncommunities.\nThis is not an abstract notion for me. As a community banker, I have seen how\naccess to credit and support from a financial institution with deep roots in a community\ncan make a direct and immediate difference in people’s lives. I continued to feel that\nway when I did the job you do, as a state banking commissioner, helping ensure that\nfamilies and communities have access to financial services that are so important to their\nsuccess. I enjoyed being a community banker, and I hope you know I’ve enjoyed\nworking closely with all of you as a banking commissioner, and I now look forward to\nbuilding a stronger partnership between all of you and the Federal Reserve Board.\nThank you for the opportunity to speak to you today. I hope to see you soon in\nyour states, and I wish you a productive and enjoyable visit to Washington.",

Bowman\nVice Chair for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nWyoming Blockchain Symposium 2025\nTeton Village, Wyoming\nAugust 19, 2025\n\nGood afternoon and thank you to the organizers of the 2025 Wyoming Blockchain\nSymposium for inviting me to speak to you today.1 It is an honor to be included in this year’s\nevent, which is being held at a critical moment for American leadership in the digital asset space.\nWe are at the beginning of what appears to be a seismic shift in the way we think about money,\nvalue, and the fabric of our financial system. This shift is not just about incremental changes or\ntweaks to the existing system. What we are witnessing has the potential to fundamentally\ntransform the way we live, work, and interact in society.\nIt is inspiring to be together with all of you, as thought leaders engaged in developing\ntechnologies that could help shape the financial system in the future. You don’t need a tech\nbackground to appreciate the opportunity that blockchain provides to the financial system.\nFinancial services innovation drives faster, safer, cheaper, and more customized products\nthat more efficiently meet the needs of consumers and businesses. Digital processes like wire\ntransfers and ACH disrupted the need to move large amounts of physical currency and other hard\nassets, making the system more efficient and safer. Through technology, there is opportunity to\ntransform how we think about transferring assets.\nThroughout recent history, whether previous transformations involved industrialization,\ncommunications, or the internet, each of these advances had a profound and lasting impact on\nour society. While the future is unknown and unknowable, I expect we will look back at some\npoint to consider the impact of blockchain, AI, and quantum computing and marvel at the\ntransformation of everyday business processes. Time will tell, but the opportunities and\npossibilities that lie ahead may be profound.\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of Governors\nof the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nOf course, you know better than most that bank regulators approach technology and\nperiods of change with caution and skepticism, concerned about rapid growth, new business\nmodels, greater interconnectedness and interdependence, often focusing only on the risks. But\nrisks may be offset or at least determined to be manageable when we recognize and consider the\npotentially extensive benefits of new technology.\nToday, I’d like to address the Federal Reserve’s approach to thinking about technology\nand tools like blockchain in context of bank supervision, including recent developments, the cost\nof supervisory focus on “reputational risk,” and principles for a tailored regulatory framework\nthat accommodates technology.\nReframing the Regulatory Mindset\nBank regulators work to promote safety and soundness in the financial system through\nregulation and supervisory practices. Our goal is not just a safe and sound banking system, but\none that also serves its intended purpose of supporting consumers, businesses, and communities,\nand fostering economic growth. To accomplish this goal, regulators strive to strike a balance\nbetween managing risks that threaten safety and soundness, while also creating an environment\nthat allows new technologies to take root and grow.\nInnovation outside the banking system often complements the development and use of\ntechnology within the banking system, and often far outpaces that growth. As you’re all aware,\nmany groundbreaking tech innovations have been pioneered by developers outside of the\ntraditional banking system.\nDevelopments in the Banking System\nWe are seeing a number of promising developments in the banking and financial system,\nand I’ll start with tokenization.\n\n- 3 -\nWhile progress on tokenization is moving ahead, it’s helpful to identify and understand\nthe problem that it is intended to solve. One clear friction is in the transfer of asset ownership,\nwhich includes both completing the asset transfer—which may involve re-registering securities,\nor transferring physical assets—and coordinating the timing of the purchase and sale. Asset\ntransfer frameworks are designed to minimize the risk of transaction failures, and have\nhistorically relied on escrow agents and manual processes. Tokenization has the potential to\nfacilitate faster ownership transfer, mitigating some of these well-known risks and potentially\nlowering costs in the process.\nTokenized assets enable a transferor to pass title without changing a custodian or moving\nany physical security or asset. Many banks and international organizations have begun projects\nto develop this technology, but we have not yet seen broad adoption. It is possible that we could\nsee a “tipping point” where the processes themselves are well-established, and legal frameworks\nhave been updated to permit a wider range of activities relying on the new technology, and\ntokenized asset transfers become more of a market standard.\nThere are other potential advantages to tokenization, including expanding access to\ncapital markets and facilitating near real-time payments. The speed and cost of wholesale\npayments, especially internationally, is a longstanding problem that tokenization could help to\naddress. Banks of all sizes, including community banks, can benefit from efficiency gains that\nflow from asset tokenization. New technology and processes can open the door to direct, faster,\nand lower cost payments.\nWhile tokenization may be part of the solution to a number of known frictions in the\nbanking system, the blockchain technology that it relies upon has already changed how banks\nseek to engage with their customers. For example, while digital assets have been considered to\n\n- 4 -\nbe risky, many banks are improving their tech stacks and security infrastructure to provide digital\nasset custody services to a wider range of retail customers. Very few bankers, and even fewer\nregulators, anticipated that the market would accommodate this development even just a few\nyears ago. Yet we’ve seen much progress and a growing appetite for traditional bank\nengagement in this space. We are also seeing positive signs in the evolution of the digital asset\nuser experience, making digital assets more accessible and easier to use.\nOne recent development—Congress passing the GENIUS Act and the President signing it\ninto law—has brought stablecoins to the forefront of many discussions. And they are now\npositioned to become a fixture in the financial system, with implications and opportunities for\nthe traditional banking system, including the potential to disrupt traditional payment rails.\nCongress tasked the banking agencies with creating a regulatory framework for stablecoins, and\nwe are working with our colleagues in the other agencies to move forward.\nIt is essential that banks and regulators are open to engaging in new technologies and\ndeparting from an overly cautious mindset. Regulators must understand new products and\nservices and recognize the utility and necessity of embracing technology in the traditional\nfinancial sector.\nSo how do we accomplish this? Some of you may have had direct experience with\nregulators and the banking system, as you attempted to engage in this type of partnership with\nbanks through the introduction of new technology and services. I am sure that many of you were\nnot satisfied with these interactions. When you start from a world of possibility, where you\nmove fast and break things to make rapid improvements, you may struggle with the complex and\nrigid regulatory constructs familiar to bankers and regulators. In this world, inertia can easily set\n\n- 5 -\nin and pose resistance to anything not deemed within the realm of “traditional” banking\nactivities.\nDespite this past inertia, change is coming.\nBank regulators are taking important steps to create a framework for digital assets and the\nadoption of blockchain technology within the banking system. These steps will promote\naccessibility to banking products and services by removing supervisory impediments that have\nstood in the way of bank relationships. I am also encouraged by the promise of this technology,\nby its ability to solve problems and improve the efficiency of the traditional financial system.\nTo this point, I have noted several use cases that have already been adopted or are in\ndevelopment within the banking system, but I would also like to encourage the industry to\nengage with regulators to help us understand blockchain and its potential to solve other\nproblems. What is the value proposition of any new product or approach? What problem is it\nintended to address? And how should regulators consider both the risks and benefits, so we can\nprovide a path to allow its use within the banking system?\nWe have already seen some initial benefits of bank AI adoption, and I continue to be\nencouraged by the significant ongoing investments being made in AI and in machine learning.\nThese technologies have the potential to transform how business is conducted, including the way\nwe detect and prevent fraud, manage risk, and provide customer service. During a recent\nbanking conference at the Fed, Sam Altman, the CEO of Open AI, joined me for a fireside chat\non AI in the banking and financial sector.2 One highlight from our discussion was the two-sided\nnature of how technology can impact banking transactions—just as AI can undermine customer\n2 Michelle W. Bowman, “Fireside Chat with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman,” conducted at the Integrated Review of the\nCapital Framework for Large Banks Conference, Washington, D.C., July 22, 2025,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/conferences/integrated-review-of-the-capital-framework-for-large-banks.htm.\n\n- 6 -\nverification methods designed to identify and mitigate fraud, AI tools can also be leveraged to\ndetect and mitigate fraud.\nI see a similar challenge with blockchain technologies. Some bankers have expressed\nconcerns about new technologies posing a threat to traditional business models and practices.\nBut the banking system is constantly evolving, and technology can change the banking system\nregardless of how banks and regulators choose to respond. We must choose whether to embrace\nthe change and help shape a framework that will be reliable and durable—ensuring safety and\nsoundness and incorporating the benefits of both efficiency and speed—or to stand still and\nallow new technology to bypass the traditional banking system altogether. From a regulator’s\nperspective, the choice is clear.\nI am open to these discussions, and I look forward to learning more. Many of you have a\ngreat deal to share and have new ideas about the best regulatory approach to blockchain and\ndigital assets. Let me start with a specific request on fraud: how can new technologies be\nleveraged to fight fraud? Fraud is a major challenge in the financial services sector, and if\nblockchain or other new tools could mitigate it, we should explore those use cases. If fraud can\nbe addressed using new technology, we should make sure that the regulatory framework does not\nstand in the way. I see this as an exciting opportunity for collaboration between industry and the\nFed.3\nThe promise of technology and advances like AI are already positioned to impact parts of\nthe banking and financial system. Ideally, changes will occur with the willing embrace of\n3 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation, “Federal Bank Regulatory Agencies Seek Comment to Address payments and\nCheck Fraud,” press release, June 16, 2025,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20250616a.htm. Comments on the RFI are due on\nSeptember 18, 2025.\n\n- 7 -\nregulators—allowing use cases to proliferate in a way that benefits the banking system. If this is\nnot our approach, then we risk the banking system becoming less relevant to consumers,\nbusinesses, and the overall economy. As a result, the banks will play a diminished role in the\nfinancial system more broadly. Those who follow developments in bank regulation have\nhopefully recognized some positive steps that demonstrate our commitment to embrace change.\nI am committed to changing our culture and attitude toward the adoption and integration of\ntechnology and new products and services.\nThe Hidden Role of Reputational Risk\nIn late June, the Board announced that reputational risk would no longer be considered in\nour supervisory process.4 To implement this lasting change, we are updating guidance,\nexamination manuals, handbooks, and other supervisory materials to ensure the durability of this\napproach, which is a critical step in addressing the problem of de-banking. I am also considering\nwhether we need a regulatory change to provide greater transparency and certainty about this\napproach. It is not the role of examiners or policymakers to direct which customers or industries\nto serve or which products to offer. That decision lies solely within the purview of bank\nmanagement, limited by the safety and soundness of the institution,, the legal activities of its\ncustomer, and risks, if any, to financial stability.\nOver time, “reputational risk” emerged as a priority area that policymakers emphasized\nfor examinations. Exams or reviews focused on reputational risk have often lacked a sufficient\nnexus to financial risk and safety and soundness considerations that are the appropriate focus of\nour supervisory activities.\n4 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Federal Reserve Board Announces That Reputational Risk\nWill No Longer Be a Component of Examination Programs in Its Supervision of Banks,” press release, June 23,\n2025, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20250623a.htm.\n\n- 8 -\nLet me be clear. We must adopt an approach that does not penalize or prohibit a bank\nfrom banking a customer engaged in legal activity. This approach must allow and encourage\nbanks to provide banking products and services to any legal business, without disfavoring any\nparticular viewpoints, businesses, or industries.\nThe Importance of Outreach\nThe industry—whether traditional finance, community banking, or digital assets—should\nexpect a constructive engagement with our supervisors when discussing strategies and\napproaches for innovation. As regulators, we must engage in a way that enables our supervisory\nteams to understand the technology or innovation under consideration and have an open-minded\nview about the benefits and possibilities of a new approach, while also understanding effective\nmitigation strategies to address any risks. Banks should be encouraged to explore new\ntechnology, to engage in discussions with their regulators about how they can be deployed, and\nwhat reasonable supervisory expectations should apply. In this context, a healthy dialogue and a\ncommitment to learning ensures the bank and examiner relationship can be collaborative rather\nthan antagonistic in tone.\nInnovators, banks, and regulators must develop a constructive relationship, and this relies\non a commitment to ongoing outreach. As I have demonstrated throughout my tenure as a\nregulator at both the state and federal levels, I am committed to outreach that enhances my\nunderstanding of industry preferences, challenges and better ways to engage with both\ndevelopers and adopters. We should build an examination workforce that requires skills\ndevelopment and informed judgement to address evolving business preferences, practices and\nexpectations. In a step toward doing so, last week, I announced that the Fed’s “novel\nsupervision” activities would be reintegrated into our Reserve Bank examination staff. This will\n\n- 9 -\nreestablish the role of the normal supervisory process in monitoring banks’ so-called “novel\nactivities.”5\nOur approach should consider allowing Federal Reserve staff to hold de minimus\namounts of crypto or other types of digital assets so they can achieve a working understanding of\nthe underlying functionality. While there are many resources available to learn about these\nfinancial products, and we will soon be establishing a framework for supervising issuers of these\nassets, there’s no replacement for experimenting and understanding how that ownership and\ntransfer process flows.\nI certainly wouldn’t trust someone to teach me to ski if they’d never put on skis,\nregardless of how many books and articles they have read, or even wrote, about it. We should\nconsider whether limits on staff investment activities may be a barrier to recruiting and retaining\nexaminers with the necessary expertise and for existing staff to better understand the technology.\nBuilding a Tailored and Proportional Regulatory Framework\nGoing forward it will be necessary to continue to implement a tailored approach to these\nnew technologies in our supervisory activities, an approach that balances the supervisory and\nregulatory expectations in a way that is commensurate with risk.\nWhat would this look like in practice? It needs to include regulatory certainty, tailoring,\nsafety and soundness, consumer protection, and maintaining America’s reputation for providing\nan open environment for innovation. Regulators should abide by these principles in developing\nthis framework.\n5 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Federal Reserve Board Announces That It Will Sunset\nIts Novel Supervision Program And Return to Monitoring Banks’ Novel Activities Through the Normal Supervisory\nProcess,” press release, August 15, 2025,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20250815a.htm.\n\n- 10 -\nThe first principle is essential. That is regulatory certainty. Justifying investing in new\nblockchain development specifically for the banking industry, or even repurposing existing\nblockchain technologies for this sector, requires significant investment. Why would you make\nthat investment without a clear understanding about how regulators will evaluate new use cases\nin a highly regulated industry? Would you choose to partner with banks, knowing that this will\nbring regulatory scrutiny and uncertainty, or would you develop alternatives outside of the\nbanking system? Your industry has already experienced significant frictions with bank\nregulators applying unclear standards, conflicting guidance, and inconsistent regulatory\ninterpretations. We need a clear, strategic regulatory framework that will facilitate the adoption\nof new technology, recognizing that in some cases, it may be inadequate and inappropriate to\napply existing regulatory guidance to address emerging tech.\nHaving clear and transparent rules is not effective if these rules are unnecessarily\nburdensome and restrictive. So, my second principle is that rules must be well-calibrated and\ntailored to address risks. Well-calibrated regulation promotes responsible innovation while also\naligning incentives for long-term growth and stability. Tailoring rules and supervision requires\nregulators to approach each use case based on particular facts and circumstances, rather than\napplying expectations designed for an imaginary “worst-case” scenario that differs from the\nactual use case. We cannot adopt a one-size-fits-all approach. Regulators must recognize the\nunique features of these new assets and distinguish them from traditional financial instruments or\nbanking products.\nA third principle is that frameworks must be consistent with generally applicable rules\nand requirements. Customer-facing products must comply with consumer protection laws,\nincluding those prohibiting unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices. We must think\n\n- 11 -\ncarefully about appropriate regulations to protect consumers and investors, maintain bank safety\nand soundness, and preserve the stability of the financial system. Any legal framework must\nalso include appropriate Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money-laundering requirements, to fulfill the\nimportant policy objectives of these requirements.\nFinally, we need to build a framework that allows the United States to continue to be the\nbest place in the world to innovate. Failing to do so could jeopardize American competitiveness\nover the long run. Regulators have taken preliminary steps to support blockchain technology\nwithin the banking system, as well as to eliminate deterrents for banks to provide services to the\ndigital asset industry. I am confident that with the benefit of ongoing outreach and education we\nwill build a framework that is fair, efficient, and transparent.\nClosing Thoughts\nWe stand at a crossroads: we can either seize the opportunity to shape the future or risk\nbeing left behind. By embracing innovation with a principled approach, we can define the\ncourse of history and fulfill our responsibility to promote the safety and soundness of the\nbanking system and financial stability.\nWe are mindful of the potential risks and vulnerabilities that result from rapid\ntransformation. We are cautious about the unintended consequences, and our mindset, and\npolicies guide us toward minimizing risks. But we must pay equal attention to the benefits side\nof the equation. Innovation and regulation don’t need to be on opposite ends of the spectrum. In\nfact, they complement each other. A more modern, efficient, and effective financial system\nfurthers key regulatory objectives—promoting safe and sound banking operation, financial\nstability, and economic growth.",

Bowman\nVice Chair for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nvia prerecorded video\nto\n“Unleashing a Financially Inclusive Future,” the second annual Financial Inclusion Conference\nhosted by the Federal Reserve Board\nWashington, D.C.\nJuly 15, 2025\n\nGood morning. I’m very pleased to welcome you to the second annual Financial\nInclusion Conference hosted by the Federal Reserve Board.1 Last year, at our inaugural event, I\nunderscored that financial inclusion is essential for creating an economy that works for everyone,\nwith innovation in the financial sector playing an important role.2\nThis year’s conference builds upon increased engagement across both the public and\nprivate sectors, with a collective effort to leverage technology to broaden financial service access\nand improve the financial well-being of consumers and small businesses. The Federal Reserve\nwill continue to play an important role in these efforts through its research, community\nengagement, and regulatory approach. This work supports our ability to understand and\ncommunicate the state of financial inclusion, how banks support access to affordable financial\nservices, and the role that our policies and practices play in promoting inclusion.\nProgress to Date\nBanks of all sizes are working to improve access to financial services for all Americans.\nAs I’ve noted in the past, the U.S. banking system is well-positioned to bring consumers and\nsmall businesses into the financial mainstream by providing access to safe, fair, and responsive\nfinancial products and services.3 These efforts greatly benefit from our continued focus on\nbroader access and innovation, including understanding how our supervisory and regulatory\nframework either supports or impairs a bank’s ability to provide affordable financial services that\nare consistent with safety and soundness.\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 See Michelle W. Bowman, “Promoting an Inclusive Financial System,” speech delivered at Financial Inclusion\nPractices and Innovations Conference at the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, Washington, D.C., July 9, 2025,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20240709a.pdf.\n3 Bowman, “Promoting an Inclusive Financial System.”\n\n- 2 -\nInnovation comes in many forms. One example is through banks’ use of alternative data,\nwhich can enable banks to provide services like affordable small-dollar loans or to provide\naccess to credit invisibles who may not have access to loans and other financial services from\ntraditional lenders.4 This growing area of focus also helps align financial service offerings with a\ncustomer’s financial goals.\nA well-functioning financial system provides a foundation for strong consumer financial\nhealth. To further this, the federal banking agencies recently published a request for information\non check and payments fraud to help address the impact of this growing problem on banks and\ntheir customers. I am committed to working together with a wide range of state and federal\npartners, including law enforcement, to address this issue.5\nA More Financially Inclusive Future\nAlthough there has been significant progress in providing access to financial services,\nthere is more work left to be done. We know that financial institutions, both small and large, are\nworking to build innovative approaches to meet their customers’ needs while maintaining the\nsafety and soundness of the banking system.\nToday’s Conference\nThe theme of this year’s conference is “Unleashing a Financially Inclusive Future.”\nToday, we will hear from a number of experts that will help to explore what the future might hold\n4 For more details on regulations related to alternative data use in credit underwriting and small-dollar lending, see\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Interagency Statement on the Use of Alternative Data in Credit\nUnderwriting,” CA letter 19-11 (December 12, 2019),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/caletters/caltr1911.htm, and Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System, “Interagency Lending Principles for Making Responsible Small-Dollar Loans,” SR letter 20-14/CA\n20-8 (May 20, 2020), https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/srletters/SR2014.htm.\n5 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency, “Federal Bank Regulatory Agencies Seek Comment to Address Payments and Check\nFraud,” press release, June 16, 2025,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20250616a.htm.\n\n- 3 -\nfor financial inclusion.

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe New England CEO Summit\nPortsmouth, New Hampshire\nJanuary 31, 2025\n\nLet me begin by saying my thoughts and prayers are with the families of the passengers\nand crew who perished in the tragic flight accident in Washington, D.C. Wednesday evening.\nThank you for the invitation to speak to you today.1 It is a pleasure to be with you\nvirtually for your CEO Summit. I always enjoy the opportunity to meet bankers from across the\ncountry, especially New England, to learn about the issues that are important to you. The\nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC) concluded its January meeting earlier this week, so\nI will begin by offering some brief remarks on the economy, and then share my views on a\nnumber of mutual and community bank issues, before addressing some questions that were\nsubmitted by your members in advance of today’s meeting.\nUpdate on the Most Recent FOMC Meeting\nAt our FOMC meeting this week, my colleagues and I voted to hold the federal funds rate\ntarget range at 4-1/4 to 4‑1/2 percent and to continue to reduce the Federal Reserve’s securities\nholdings. I supported this action because, after recalibrating the level of the policy rate towards\nthe end of last year to reflect the progress made since 2023 on lowering inflation and cooling the\nlabor market, I think that policy is now in a good place to position the Committee to pay closer\nattention to the inflation data as it evolves.\nLooking ahead to 2025, in my view, the current policy stance also provides the\nopportunity to review further indicators of economic activity and get clarity on the\nadministration’s policies and their effects on the economy. It will be very important to have a\nbetter sense of the actual policies and how they will be implemented, in addition to greater\nconfidence about how the economy will respond.\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nBrief Remarks on the Economy\nThe U.S. economy remained strong through the end of last year, with solid growth in\neconomic activity and a labor market near full employment. Core inflation remains elevated, but\nmy expectation is that it will moderate further this year. Even with this outlook, I continue to see\nupside risks to inflation.\nThe rate of inflation declined significantly in 2023, but it slowed by noticeably less last\nyear. Without having seen the December data released this morning, I estimate that the 12-\nmonth measure of core personal consumption expenditures inflation—which excludes food and\nenergy prices—likely remained unchanged at 2.8 percent in December, only slightly below its\n3.0 percent reading at the end of 2023. Progress has been slow and uneven since the spring of\nlast year mostly due to a slowing in core goods price declines.\nAfter increasing at a solid pace, on average, over the initial three quarters of last year,\ngross domestic product appears to have risen a bit more slowly in the fourth quarter, reflecting a\nlarge drop in inventory investment, which is a volatile category. In contrast, private domestic\nfinal purchases, which provide a better signal about underlying growth in economic activity,\nmaintained its strong momentum from earlier in the year, as personal consumption rose robustly\nagain in the fourth quarter.\nSome measures of consumer sentiment appear to have improved recently but are still well\nbelow pre-pandemic levels, likely because of higher prices. And since housing, food, and energy\nprice increases have far outpaced overall inflation since the pandemic, lower-income households\nhave experienced the negative impacts of inflation hardest, especially as these households have\nlimited options to trade down for lower-cost goods and services.\n\n- 3 -\nPayroll employment gains rebounded strongly in December and averaged about 170,000\nper month in the fourth quarter, a pace that is somewhat above average gains in the prior two\nquarters. The unemployment rate edged back down to 4.1 percent in December and has moved\nsideways since last June, remaining slightly below my estimate of full employment.\nThe labor market appears to have stabilized in the second half of last year, after having\nloosened from extremely tight conditions. The rise in the unemployment rate since mid-2023\nlargely reflected weaker hiring, as job seekers entering or re-entering the labor force are taking\nlonger to find work, while layoffs have remained low. The ratio of job vacancies to unemployed\nworkers has remained close to the pre-pandemic level in recent months, and there are still more\navailable jobs than available workers. The labor market no longer appears to be especially tight,\nbut wage growth remains somewhat above the pace consistent with our inflation goal.\nI hope the revision of the Bureau of Labor Statistics labor data, which will be released\nnext week, will more accurately capture the changing dynamics of immigration and net business\ncreation and bring more clarity on the underlying pace of job growth. It is crucial that U.S.\nofficial data accurately capture structural changes in labor markets in real time, such as those in\nrecent years, so we can more confidently rely on these data for monetary and economic\npolicymaking. In the meantime, given conflicting economic signals, measurement challenges,\nand significant data revisions, I remain cautious about taking signal from only a limited set of\nreal-time data releases.\nAssuming the economy evolves as I expect, I think that inflation will slow further this\nyear. Its progress may be bumpy and uneven, and the upcoming inflation data for the first\nquarter will be an important indication of how quickly this will happen. That said, I continue to\n\n- 4 -\nsee greater risks to price stability, especially while the labor market remains near full\nemployment.\nDespite the prospect for some reduction in geopolitical tensions in the Middle East,\nEastern Europe, and Asia, global supply chains continue to be susceptible to disruptions, which\ncould result in inflationary effects on food, energy, and other commodity markets. In addition,\nthe release of pent-up demand following the election, especially with improving consumer and\nbusiness sentiment, could lead to stronger economic activity, which could increase inflationary\npressures.\nThe Path Forward\nAs we enter a new phase in the process of moving the federal funds rate toward a more\nneutral policy stance, I would prefer that future adjustments to the policy rate be gradual.\nWe should take time to carefully assess the progress in achieving our inflation and employment\ngoals and consider changes to the policy rate based on how the data evolves.\nGiven the current stance of policy, I continue to be concerned that easier financial\nconditions over the past year may have contributed to the lack of further progress on slowing\ninflation. In light of the ongoing strength in the economy and with equity prices substantially\nhigher than a year ago, it seems unlikely that the overall level of interest rates and borrowing\ncosts are exerting meaningful restraint.\nI am also closely watching the increase in longer-term Treasury yields since we started\nthe recalibration of our policy stance at the September meeting. Some have interpreted it as a\nreflection of investors’ concerns about the possibility of tighter-than-expected policy that may be\nrequired to address inflationary pressures. In light of these considerations, I continue to prefer a\ncautious and gradual approach to adjusting policy.\n\n- 5 -\nThere is still more work to be done to bring inflation closer to our 2 percent goal.\nI would like to see progress in lowering inflation resume before we make further adjustments to\nthe target range. We need to keep inflation in focus while the labor market appears to be in\nbalance and the unemployment rate continues to be at historically low levels. By the time of our\nMarch meeting, we will have received two inflation and two employment reports. I look forward\nto reviewing the first quarter inflation data, which, as I noted earlier, will be key to\nunderstanding the path of inflation going forward. I do expect that inflation will begin to decline\nagain and that by year-end it will be lower than where it now stands.\nLooking forward, it is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course.\nAt each FOMC meeting, my colleagues and I will make our decisions based on the incoming\ndata and the implications for and risks to the outlook and guided by the Fed’s dual-mandate goals\nof maximum employment and stable prices. I will also continue to meet with a broad range of\ncontacts as I assess the appropriateness of our monetary policy stance.\nBringing inflation in line with our price stability goal is essential for sustaining a healthy\nlabor market and fostering an economy that works for everyone in the longer run.\nPerspective on Mutual and Community Banks\nTurning to banking, I will start with a brief discussion of the important role of mutual\nbanks in the banking system before addressing other bank regulatory issues. One of the unique\ncharacteristics of the U.S. banking system is the broad scope of institutions it includes and the\nwide range of customers and communities it serves. Given this institutional diversity, regulators\nmust strive to foster a financial system that enables each and every bank, no matter its size, to\nthrive, supporting a vibrant economy and financial system.\n\n- 6 -\nMutual Bank Issues\nIn the Northeast, everyone is familiar with mutual banks given their significant presence\nin this region. Since the early 1800s, these banks have been dedicated to serving their local\ncommunities.2 Their ownership structure differs from traditional banks in that mutuals are\nowned by their depositors, rather than by shareholders. Like other community banks, they focus\non local issues that are important to their communities and to their depositors.\nMany of the challenges mutual banks face are similar to those faced by other financial\ninstitutions, including competition from other banks, credit unions, and non-banks. But mutual\nbanks also face unique issues that can add cost and expense to their operations. Two issues I\nwould like to discuss are the challenges mutual institutions face raising capital, and unique\nprocedural hurdles mutuals face in managing the dividend process. While these issues are\nunique to mutuals, both highlight the challenges of a lack of transparency, and insufficient focus\non efficiency.3\nJust as with other community banks, a challenge for many mutuals is the difficulty of\nraising additional capital. This difficulty is exacerbated by their ownership structure, which\ntypically requires mutuals to rely heavily on retained earnings. Although mutual institutions\nhave historically been more highly capitalized relative to their stock-owned peers, if a mutual\ncapital raise is needed, it would be helpful to provide some regulatory flexibility in the process.\nRecently, some mutuals have issued subordinated debt as a form of capital, but another form of\nregulatory capital may be preferable: mutual capital certificates.\n2 The first mutual banks in the United States were chartered in 1816. The Provident Institution for Savings and the\nPhiladelphia Savings Fund Society were both chartered that year. See https://www.jstor.org/stable/2123609;\nhttps://www.mass.gov/info-details/history-of-the-division-of-banks.\n3 Michelle W. Bowman, “Reflections on 2024: Monetary Policy, Economic Performance, and Lessons for Banking\nRegulation” (speech at the California Bankers Association 2025 Bank Presidents Seminar, Laguna Beach,\nCalifornia, January 9, 2025), https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20250109a.htm\n\n- 7 -\nTo date, it has been unclear whether mutual capital certificates qualify as regulatory\ncapital. These instruments could provide mutual banks an additional way to raise capital without\ndisrupting their mutual structure. In my view, the banking agencies should be receptive to these\nkinds of instruments to ensure that mutual banks can both raise capital and maintain their\ndepositor-owned structure. Mutuals need clarity and transparency about the regulatory treatment\nof these instruments and whether they qualify as regulatory capital.\nAnother concern for mutuals is the annual requirement to receive regulatory approval for\na mutual holding company’s waiver of a dividend issued by its subsidiary bank.4 The Board\npractice is to require a mutual holding company to submit an application each year to implement\na waiver. This prior approval requirement is complex and imposes significant costs on these\nsmall institutions, reducing the investment they can make in their communities. Because of the\ntime and expense of these waiver requirements, it is possible that the inefficiencies of the\nrequired application process erode the value of a mutual holding company structure, which\nwould further constrain a mutual bank’s ability to raise capital.\nSince the Board has nearly 20 years of experience considering these waiver requests, it\nseems appropriate to consider whether the applications process for these waivers is efficient.\nWhat lessons have we learned? Is the prior approval requirement effective in its review of\nholding companies waiving receipt of their dividends, or can this be resolved in a more efficient\nand cost effective manner? In my view, the Board should consider whether this process is\neffective and efficient in addressing concerns related to dividend waivers.\nMutual banks, like all community banks, are vital to the economic success of their\ncommunities. It is critical that our applications process not act as a limit on a particular type of\n4 12 CFR § 239.8(d).\n\n- 8 -\ninstitution simply due to regulatory inaction or lack of clarity and transparency. Regulators must\nfind efficient and effective ways to support a vibrant and diverse banking system that enables\nthese and other small institutions to thrive while supporting and investing in their local economy.\nTailoring\nTransparency and efficiency are just two of the necessary components of a regulatory\napproach that promotes a healthy and vibrant banking system. Another component that I speak\nabout frequently is the use of “tailoring” in the regulatory framework. For those familiar with\nmy philosophy on bank regulation and supervision, my interest and focus on tailoring will come\nas no surprise.5 In its most basic form, it is difficult to disagree with the virtue of regulatory and\nsupervisory tailoring—calibrating the requirements and expectations imposed on a firm based on\nits size, business model, risk profile, and complexity—as a reasonable, appropriate and\nresponsible approach for bank regulation and supervision. In fact, tailoring is embedded in the\nstatutory fabric of the Federal Reserve’s bank regulatory responsibilities.6\nThe bank regulatory framework inherently includes significant costs—both the cost of\noperating the banking agencies, and the cost to the banking industry of complying with\nregulations, the examination process, and supplying information to regulators both through\nformal information collections and through one-off requests. In the aggregate, these costs can\nultimately affect the price and availability of credit, geographic access to banking services, and\nthe broader economy. The cost of this framework—both to regulators and to the industry—\nreflects layers of policy decisions over many years. But this framework could be more effective\n5 See, e.g., Michelle W. Bowman, “Tailoring, Fidelity to the Rule of Law, and Unintended Consequences” (speech\nat the Harvard Law School Faculty Club, Cambridge, Massachusetts, March 5, 2024),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20240305a.pdf.\n6 See, Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, Pub. L. No. 115-174, § 401(a)(1)\n(amending 12 U.S.C. § 5365), 132 Stat. 1296 (2018).\n\n- 9 -\nin balancing the mandate to promote safety and soundness with the need to have a banking\nsystem that promotes economic growth.\nFor example, let’s consider costs. As regulatory and supervisory demands grow, there is\noften parallel growth in the staff and budgets of the banking agencies. We should not only be\ncognizant of these costs, but we should act in a way that requires efficiency while ensuring safety\nand soundness. Some degree of elasticity in regulator capacity is necessary to respond to\nevolving economic and banking conditions, as well as emerging risks, but there must be\nreasonable constraints on growth. Expansion of the regulatory framework is not a cost-free\nendeavor, and the costs are shouldered by taxpayers, banks, and, ultimately, bank customers.\nThe bank regulatory framework has great potential to provide significant benefits,\nincluding supporting an innovative banking system that enhances trust and confidence in our\ninstitutions, and promotes safety and soundness. When we consider the benefits and the costs,\nwe can institute greater efficiencies in both banking regulation and in the banking industry itself.\nThe bank regulatory framework is complex, and the various elements of this framework are\nintended to work in a complementary way. As banks evolve—by growing larger, or by engaging\nin new activities—tailoring can help us to quickly recalibrate requirements in light of the new\nrisks posed by the firm.\nBut the regulatory framework, especially how supervisors prioritize its application to the\nbanking industry, can pose a serious threat to a bank’s viability. For example, imposing the\nsame regulatory requirements on banks with assets of $2 billion to $2 trillion under the new rules\nimplementing the Community Reinvestment Act demonstrated a missed opportunity to promote\n\n- 10 -\ngreater effectiveness and efficiency.7 I question the wisdom of applying the same evaluation\nstandards to banks within such a broad range.\nLikewise, supervisory guidance can provide fertile ground to differentiate supervisory\nexpectations under a more tailored approach. While supervisory guidance is not binding on\nbanks as a legal matter, it can signal how regulators think about particular risks and activities,\nand often drives community banks to reallocate resources in a way that may not be necessary or\nappropriate. The Fed’s guidance on third-party risk management is an example of this.\nOriginally, this guidance was published in a way that applied to all banks, including community\nbanks. Yet, it was acknowledged even at the time of publication that it had known shortcomings,\nparticularly in terms of its administration and lack of clarity for community banks.8\nTailoring is important for all banks, but it is particularly important for community banks.\nThere are real costs not only to banks, but to communities, when the framework is insufficiently\ntailored, as community banks faced with excessive regulatory burdens may be forced to raise\nprices or shut their doors completely. These banks often reach unbanked or underbanked corners\nof the U.S. economy, not only in terms of the customers they serve but also in terms of their\ngeographic footprint. We are all familiar with banking deserts and the challenges many\nlegitimate and law-abiding businesses and consumers have in accessing basic banking services\nand credit. It is difficult to imagine that a system with far fewer banks would as effectively serve\nU.S. banking and credit needs and sufficiently to support economic growth.\n7 See dissenting statement, “Statement on the Community Reinvestment Act Final Rule by Governor Michelle W.\nBowman,” news release, October 24, 2023, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bowman-\nstatement-20231024.htm.\n8 See “Statement on Third Party Risk Management Guidance by Governor Michelle W. Bowman,” news release,\nJune 6, 2023, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bowman-statement-20230606.htm.\n\n- 11 -\nIt is imperative that we keep the benefits of tailoring in focus as the bank regulatory\nframework evolves. A tailored regulatory and supervisory approach can help inform our policies\non a wide range of industry issues that are likely to emerge in the coming years.\nProblem-Based Solutions\nOne of the most difficult challenges on the regulatory front is prioritization, both for\nbanks managing their businesses and for regulators deciding how to fulfill their responsibilities.\nAt a basic level, the role of regulators is dictated by statute. Congress granted the Federal\nReserve and other banking agencies broad statutory powers but has constrained how those\npowers may be directed through the use of statutory mandates, including to promote a safe and\nsound banking system, and broader U.S. financial stability. In the execution of these\nresponsibilities, the Federal Reserve must also balance the need to act in a way that enables the\nbanking system to serve the U.S. economy and promote economic growth. While these\nobjectives are not incompatible, they do require us to consider tradeoffs when establishing\npolicy.\nHow can regulators best meet these responsibilities? As many of you may already know,\nI strongly believe in a pragmatic approach to policymaking.9 This requires us to identify the\nproblem we are trying to solve, determine whether we are the appropriate regulator to address the\nproblem based on our statutory mandates and authorities, and explore options for addressing the\nidentified issue.\nAs a first step, we must be attuned to the banking system and how regulatory actions\naffect that system. We oversee a wide range of banks of varying sizes, activities, affiliates, and\n9 Michelle W. Bowman, “Approaching Policymaking Pragmatically” (remarks to the Forum Club of the Palm\nBeaches, West Palm Beach, Florida, November 20, 2024),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20241120a.pdf.\n\n- 12 -\ncomplexity. These banks interact with a range of service providers, financial market utilities,\npayments providers, and non-bank partners, regularly competing with non-bank financial\nintermediaries. The banking system can be a key driver of business formation, economic\nexpansion, and opportunity.\nAs we look at the banking system, including the regulatory framework, we must focus on\nthose issues that are most important to advancing statutory priorities. There is always the risk of\nmisidentification and mis-prioritization, and that we fail to take appropriately robust action on\nkey issues or focus on issues that are less material to a bank’s safety and soundness. Our goal\nshould be to develop a better filter to promote appropriate and effective prioritization.\nFraud\nWe have seen several instances where this filter did not produce appropriate results, as\nwe have recently seen with fraud. The incidence of fraud, particularly check fraud, has been\nrising substantially over the past few years, causing harm to banks, damaging the perceived\nsafety of the banking system, and importantly hurting consumers who are the victims of\nfraudulent activity. Sometimes these efforts target vulnerable populations, like the elderly, who\nare particularly susceptible to certain forms of fraud.\nDespite this known problem, efforts by regulators have been frustratingly slow to\nadvance, and seem to have done little to address the underlying root causes of this increase in\nfraud. Why has this important issue failed to garner greater attention from all of the appropriate\nregulatory and law enforcement bodies? Different governmental agencies may share an\nimportant role in addressing this problem, but the need for a joint and coordinated solution does\nnot excuse collective inaction.\n\n- 13 -\nClimate-Related Financial Risk\nOf course, not every issue falls within the scope of the Federal Reserve’s responsibilities.\nEven when policymakers identify an issue or priority that they would like to pursue, it is\nimperative to ask whether that priority falls within the scope of our mandate and authorities.\nStatutes and regulations, paired with the “soft” power of examination, can be deployed in ways\nthat may not be primarily directed towards the priorities mandated for banking regulators. I’ve\nnoted previously that the banking agencies’ climate-related financial risk guidance arguably\npushes the boundaries of appropriate regulatory responsibilities. Banks have long been required\nto manage all material risks, including weather- and climate-related risks. And while this\nadditional guidance seemed to do little to advance the goals of promoting the safe and sound\noperation of banks it, in effect, posed significant risks of influencing credit allocation decisions.\nUltimately, banking regulators should not dictate credit allocation decisions, either by rule or\nthrough supervision. Bank regulatory policy should be used to address the needs of the\nunbanked and expand the availability of banking services. It should not be used to limit or\nexclude access to banking services for legitimate customers and businesses in a way that is\nmeant to further unrelated policy goals, sometimes referred to as “de-banking.”\nOnce we have identified problems and determined that they are within the Fed’s\nresponsibility, we must consider alternative approaches to address them, focusing on identifying\nefficient solutions. New technologies and services often require novel regulatory and\nsupervisory approaches, and we recognize that past approaches may not be effective. Often\nregulators take a “more is better” approach to regulation and guidance. Over the past several\nyears, the banking industry has faced an onslaught of proposed and final regulations and\nguidance, materials that require a significant time commitment to review, to comment on, and to\n\n- 14 -\nimplement. Many times, these require changes to policies and procedures or risk management\npractices.\nIt is critical that in our urgency to address issues in the banking system—particularly for\ncommunity banks—that we consider not just the direct and indirect effects of regulatory action\nbut also this cumulative burden. Community banks are resilient and dedicated to serving their\ncommunities, but at some point, the cumulative burden of the bank regulatory framework can\nadversely affect the availability and pricing of banking services and threaten the ongoing\nviability of the community bank model. The community banks in this country are important\neconomically and to their communities, and we should strive to support these institutions and\ntheir ongoing viability.\nOther Notable Issues and Concerns\nIn preparation for today’s event, conference attendees were asked to submit questions in\nadvance. So before concluding my remarks I’d like to address a few of these, since we won’t be\nable to do a live Q&A session in this virtual format. Thank you for submitting your questions in\nadvance.\nAs community bankers, we are deeply invested in supporting the growth and resilience of our\nlocal economies. With ongoing regulatory pressures, what specific actions can the Federal\nReserve take to ensure smaller institutions like ours remain competitive and capable of\ndelivering the personalized service that our communities depend on?\nOne of the things I think is critical in identifying how to support community banks is\nlistening to the industry—which issues are top-of-mind for you? Being an effective regulator\nrequires a degree of humility, and receptiveness to hearing about issues that affect the business of\nbanking, particularly when there are alternative ways that regulators can better promote safety\n\n- 15 -\nand soundness, or where regulatory actions have resulted in unintended consequences. At the\nsame time, during my conversations with banks, a few themes have emerged that deserve\nattention. This will be a non-exclusive list, but hopefully will give you a sense of the types of\nissues and concerns that I hear about most frequently when talking to community banks.\nFirst, I think there is room to improve the transparency of regulatory communication.\nBanks should not be left to guess what regulators think about the permissibility of particular\nactivities, or what parameters and rules should apply to those activities. Uncertainty discourages\ninvestments in innovation and the expansion of banking activities, products, and services, and\ncan call into question whether internal processes and procedures are consistent with supervisory\nexpectations. Banks already must confront the challenges of dealing with evolving economic\nand credit conditions, regulators should not compound these challenges through opaque\nexpectations and standards.\nSecond, I think we need to address shortcomings in the processing of banking\napplications, employing a more nimble and predictable approach specifically in the de novo\nformation and mergers and acquisitions (M&A) contexts. Today, the process to obtain\nregulatory approval can be influenced by many factors under a bank’s control—for example, the\ncompleteness of the application filed and responsiveness to addressing questions and providing\nnecessary additional information. However, the timeline for application decisions is often\nuncertain and beyond the bank’s control. This can be due to questions about the minimum\namount of capital needed and early-stage supervisory expectations (for a de novo bank), or\nuncertainty about the competitive effects of a transaction, or the filing of a public comment\nraising concerns about an application in the M&A context.\n\n- 16 -\nFinally, I think regulatory and supervisory “trickle-down” is real and it has significantly\nharmed community banks. I am referring to regulators conveying expectations to community\nbanks (for example, during the examination process) that lack a foundation in applicable rules or\nguidance, or that were designed for larger institutions, or based on a horizontal review of unique\nbanks.\nIt is very difficult to insulate community banks from the harmful consequences of\n“trickle-down,” and broader structural changes may be needed to shield them from inapplicable\nand unreasonable expectations. At the same time, we must preserve strong supervisory standards\nas banks cross asset thresholds, so banks that grow larger and riskier are subject to appropriately\ntailored and calibrated requirements and expectations. I would also note that some degree of\n“trickle down” has occurred over time because the regulatory asset “line” defining community\nbanks has remained constant at $10 billion in assets for over a decade. During that time, the\neconomy has grown significantly, and inflation has rendered this asset definition obsolete. Many\n“community banks”—as defined by business model and activities rather than asset size—now\nexceed the threshold and must comply with broader regulatory requirements that may be\nexcessive.\nWhat support or guidance can community banks expect from the Federal Reserve as we\nnavigate technological innovation and increased cybersecurity threats?\nBoth innovation and cybersecurity are issues that are top of mind for me. Innovation has\nalways been a priority for banks of all sizes and business models. Banks in the U.S. have a long\nhistory of developing and implementing new technologies, and innovation has the potential to\nmake the banking and payments systems faster and more efficient, to bring new products and\nservices to customers, and even to enhance safety and soundness.\n\n- 17 -\nRegulators must be open to innovation in the banking system. Our goal should be to\nbuild and support a clear and sensible regulatory framework that anticipates ongoing and\nevolving innovation—one that allows the private sector to innovate while also maintaining\nappropriate safeguards. We must promote innovation through transparency and open\ncommunication, including demonstrating a willingness to engage during the development\nprocess. By providing clarity and consistency, we can encourage long-term business investment,\nwhile also continuing to support today’s products and services. A clear regulatory framework\nwould also empower supervisors to focus on safety and soundness, while ensuring a safe and\nefficient banking and payment system.\nOn cybersecurity, banks often note cybersecurity and third-party risk management as\nareas that raise significant concerns. Cyber-related events, including ransomware attacks and\nbusiness email compromises, are costly in terms of expense and reputation, and are time-\nconsuming events that pose unique challenges for community banks.\nThe maintenance of cyber assets and technology resources required to support a\nsuccessful cybersecurity program are often difficult for smaller banks. Regulators can promote\ncybersecurity, and stronger cyber-incident “resilience” and response capabilities by identifying\nresources and opportunities, such as exercises, for banks to develop “muscle memory” in cyber\nincident response.\nThe Federal Reserve plays an important role in supervising banks and supporting risk\nmanagement practices. For example, the Federal Reserve hosts the Midwest Cyber Workshop,\nwith the Federal Reserve Banks of Chicago, Kansas City, and St. Louis.10 Over the past couple\n10 See Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, and Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas\nCity, “Midwest Cyber Workshop 2024,” June 25-26, 2024, https://www.chicagofed.org/events/2024/midwest-cyber-\nworkshop.\n\n- 18 -\nof years, this workshop has provided a forum to discuss cyber risk among community bankers,\nregulators, law enforcement, and other industry stakeholders. Community banks can also turn to\nthe Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) website, which includes the\nFFIEC Cybersecurity Resource Guide and links to other external cybersecurity resources.\nWe know well that cyber threats pose real risks to the banking system, and we recognize\nthat community banks may have unique needs in preventing, remediating, and responding to\ncyber threats. Regulators should, therefore, ensure that a range of resources are available to\nsupport banks and seek further opportunities to help build bank resilience against these threats.\nCommunity banks are integral to rural and underserved communities. How can the Federal\nReserve support us in maintaining our presence in these areas, particularly amid ongoing\nconsolidation trends?\nAs I noted earlier, it is essential that the U.S. banking system is broad and diverse,\nincluding institutions of all sizes serving all the different markets across the country.\nCommunity banks play a particularly valuable role in rural and underserved communities, and\nwe need to ensure that the community banking model remains viable into the future.\nTo do that, we need to have a regulatory system in which both de novo bank formations\nand M&A transactions are possible. Viable formation and merger options for banks of all sizes\nare necessary to avoid creating a “barbell” of the very largest and very smallest banks in the\nbanking system, with the number of community banks continuing to erode over time.\nM&A ensures that banks have a meaningful path to transitioning bank ownership. In the\nabsence of a viable M&A framework, there is potential for additional risks, including limited\nopportunities for succession planning, especially in smaller or rural communities. Uncertainty\nrelated to the M&A process also may act as a deterrent to de novo bank formation, as potential\n\n- 19 -\nbank founders may stay on the sidelines knowing that future exit strategies—like the strategic\nacquisition of a de novo bank by a larger peer—may face long odds of success.\nAnother challenge particularly in rural markets are the competitive “screens” that are\nused to evaluate the competitive effects of a proposed merger. Using these screens often results\nin a finding that M&A transactions in rural markets can have an adverse effect on competition\nand should therefore be disallowed.11 Even when these transactions are eventually approved, the\nmechanical approach to analyzing competitive effects often requires additional review or\nanalysis and can lead to extensive delays in the regulatory approval process. Reducing the\nefficiency of the bank M&A process can be a deterrent to healthy bank transactions—it can\nreduce the effectiveness of M&A and de novo activity that preserves the presence of community\nbanks in underserved areas, prevent institutions from pursuing prudent growth strategies, and\nactually undermine competition by preventing firms from growing to a larger scale.\n11 Michelle W.

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nVenCent Fintech Summit\nLittle Rock, Arkansas\nAugust 17, 2022\n\nThank you, Commissioner Marshall, for the invitation to speak to you today. It’s really a\npleasure to be here, finally in person at the Venture Center.1 Much has happened over the past\nfew years, and I have been following your work closely.\nTechnology Is Changing Financial Services\nTechnology and innovation are a priority interest for my work at the Board of Governors.\nTechnology can offer increased speed, lower costs, and greater efficiency in providing services\nand products in the financial industry. This week’s conference agenda includes many of the\ntopics I follow closely through our work on innovation.\nMuch of the innovation in financial services is occurring in the nonbank sector, but\ntechnology is also changing the business of banking in profound ways. More and more\ncustomers interact with their banks exclusively through digital channels. They check their\nbalances, apply for credit cards, and make deposits and payments via their phones, rather than\nvisiting bank branches.\nBut the changes run deeper than that. Technology is also changing fundamental aspects\nof bank operations. For example, banks are beginning to use artificial intelligence (AI) in credit\nunderwriting, back-office operations, various aspects of risk management, and customer service.\nTechnology is also leading to new bank business models. Many banks are using\napplication programming interfaces and other technology to allow nonbank technology firms to\nprovide financial services. Under many of these arrangements, the technology firm maintains\nthe customer relationship, while the bank provides the underlying financial infrastructure,\nincluding deposit services and access to the payment rails.\n1 These remarks reflect my views and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of Governors or the\nFederal Open Market Committee. I am grateful for the assistance of Federal Reserve Board staff Jeff Ernst, Kavita\nJain, Molly Mahar, Jason Hinkle, and Kirstin Wells in preparing these remarks.\n\nFederal Reserve Support for Innovation\nThe Federal Reserve is monitoring these transformations closely, and we are encouraged\nby the potential for improvements that can be brought by responsible innovation.\nI think it is critically important for banking regulators to support innovation in banking.\nTraditionally, banking regulators may have viewed banking innovation solely as a risk on a long\nlist of risks that need to be appropriately managed. While that perspective won’t change, I\nrecognize that evolving consumer preferences are requiring banks to meet these technology-\nenabled expectations. It is true that new services and products present new risks, but these are\nnot unmanageable risks. And, frankly, there is greater risk in standing still—in not recognizing\nthe need to move forward. Failure to innovate can undermine a bank’s competitiveness, posing a\nthreat to safety and soundness just as innovating recklessly can. The Fed supports responsible\ninnovation in a variety of ways, and I will mention a few of them in this discussion.\nFor the past few years, I have been working to assist banks to address the challenges\nbrought by the process of partnering with a third-party service provider. Last year, the Fed,\nalong with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation, proposed interagency guidance to assist in the management of risks involved in\nthird-party engagement. The agencies received over 80 comment letters and are reviewing those\ncomments as we move toward finalizing the guidance. In my view, it is especially helpful to\nprovide clarity for banks in these kinds of relationships and to help them establish a solid\nfoundation as banks and fintechs continue to engage in partnerships.\nLast year at this time, the federal banking agencies released a guide designed to assist\ncommunity banks to assess risks in constructing and considering relationships with fintech\ncompanies.\n\nAnd lastly, this past September, the Federal Reserve published a paper detailing industry\nperspectives and experiences on the different types of partnerships between community banks\nand fintech companies.2 We conducted extensive outreach with community banks, fintechs, and\nother stakeholders and incorporated real world experiences of the strategic and tactical decisions\nthat led to effective partnerships.\nFor the remainder of my remarks, I will focus on several issues that are likely top of mind\nfor those who are engaged in financial services innovation.\nCrypto-Assets\nLet’s start with digital and crypto-assets. I am hearing more discussions involving banks’\ninterest in offering services involving crypto-assets. The chatter seems to originate more from\nthose outside the banking industry, but I’ll put that aside for now.\nThere seem to be a number of reasons for this interest and why customers might seek to\nengage in this type of activity. First, although the interest seemed to have cooled lately, given\nrecent developments in the crypto industry, we have seen significant consumer demand for\nengagement in these types of services. It seems reasonable that because bank customers are\naware of crypto and have discussed these assets with their banks, banks want to better understand\nthis type of engagement and potentially provide those services to their customers.\nSecond, we have also been told that banks have observed their deposits flowing to\nnonbank crypto-asset firms and, understandably, would like to stem that outflow by offering the\nservices themselves. I certainly recognize and appreciate these challenges. But before a bank\nbegins to engage in or offer crypto-asset-related services, it must seriously and carefully consider\n2 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Reserve Publishes Paper Describing Landscape of\nPartnerships Between Community Banks and Fintech Companies, news release, September 9, 2021,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20210909a.htm.\n\nthe risks involved—both to the bank and its customers. The recent turmoil in the digital-asset\nindustry only underscores that point.\nFederal Reserve staff is working to articulate supervisory expectations for banks on a\nvariety of digital asset-related activities, including\n• custody of crypto-assets\n• facilitation of customer purchases and sales of crypto-assets\n• loans collateralized by crypto-assets, and\n• issuance and distribution of stablecoins by banking organizations.\nWe understand that everyone involved in this space is seeking clarity. One of the most\nimportant tools that we have as a regulator is the ability to clearly articulate our supervisory\nexpectations. It is also our most direct path to encouraging and supporting responsible\ninnovation.\nEarlier this week, we released supervisory guidance addressing banks that are engaging\nin or seeking to engage in crypto-asset related activities.3 This guidance will provide banks with\nadditional information about the risks of crypto activities and remind them to ensure that the\nactivities are legal, and they should have adequate systems, risk management, and controls in\nplace to conduct the activities in a safe and sound manner consistent with applicable law.\nCritically, one important element of this release is that firms should contact their supervisors\nabout these types of activities and expect that supervisory staff will provide timely feedback, as\nappropriate.\n3 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Reserve Board Provides Additional Information for\nBanking Organizations Engaging or Seeking to Engage in Crypto-Asset-Related Activities, news release, August 16,\n2022, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20220816a.htm.\n\nBased on my conversations with bankers across the country, I believe that providing the\nrules of the road—highlighting the risks we are most concerned about and laying out our\nexpectations for how those risks should be managed—is invaluable for banks considering\nwhether and how to innovate.\nArtificial Intelligence\nThe Federal Reserve is taking a similar approach with respect to banks’ use of AI. Last\nyear, the Fed joined with four other financial agencies to issue a Request for Information and\nComment on Financial Institutions’ Use of Artificial Intelligence, Including Machine Learning.4\nAs noted in that document, banks are using AI in a variety of ways, including fraud monitoring,\npersonalization of customer services, credit decisions, risk management, and textual analysis.\nThese applications of AI can, to varying degrees, involve risk-management challenges around\nissues such as explainability, data governance, cybersecurity, third-party risk management, and\nconsumer compliance.\nThe banking agencies received over 100 responses to the Request for Information. Those\nresponses give us a window into what questions banks need regulators to answer about using AI.\nFederal Reserve staff is working with the other regulators to provide further clarity in this area.\nPayments: FedNow and Central Bank Digital Currencies\nPayments is another area where innovation continues to flourish, and the Federal Reserve\nis actively engaged in shaping the future payments landscape.\nThe FedNowSM Service will enable financial institutions of every size, and in every\ncommunity across America, to provide safe and efficient instant payment services. It is intended\nto be a flexible, neutral platform that will support a broad variety of instant payments. It will\n4 86 Fed. Reg. 16,837.\n\nallow depository institutions and their service providers to offer value-added services to their\ncustomers, ultimately enhancing competition in the market for payment services. Completing\nand implementing FedNow is a high priority, and we expect it to be available by mid-2023.\nFedNow will help transform the way payments are made through new services that allow\nconsumers and businesses to make payments conveniently, in real time, on any day, and with\nimmediate availability of funds for receivers. Our assessment of these benefits has not changed\neven as we consider whether a central bank digital currency (CBDC) might fit into the future\nU.S. money and payments landscape.\nMy expectation is that FedNow addresses the issues that some have raised about the need\nfor a CBDC. As I’m sure you are already aware, earlier this year we published a discussion\npaper that outlined some design principles, costs, and benefits of a CBDC and solicited public\ncomments.5 We received over 2,000 comments, and we are currently reviewing these comments\nand plan to publish a summary of them.\nNovel Charters and Access to Federal Reserve Account Services\nBefore I wrap up, let me touch on one more topic that relates to innovation in bank\ncharter types.\nIn recent years, there has been an increase in novel charter types being authorized or\nconsidered across the country at the state and national levels. As a result, Federal Reserve Banks\nare receiving an increased number of inquiries and requests for access to Reserve Bank master\naccounts and financial services, which could provide those institutions with access to the nation’s\npayment system.\n5 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Money and Payments: The U.S. Dollar in the Age of Digital\nTransformation, January 2022, https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/money-and-payments-\n20220120.pdf.\n\nOn August 15, the Board of Governors published final guidelines that govern how\nReserve Banks will evaluate requests for account access. The guidelines take into account the\nBoard’s goals to (1) ensure the safety and soundness of the banking system; (2) effectively\nimplement monetary policy; (3) promote financial stability; (4) protect consumers; and (5)\npromote a safe, efficient, inclusive, and innovative payment system.6\nThe approach articulated in the guidelines is based on a foundation of risk management\nand mitigation, recognizing that access to Fed accounts and services can create significant risks.\nThe systematic evaluation of these different risks is intended to establish a framework ensuring\nsimilar treatment for legally eligible institutions with similar risk profiles across the Reserve\nBanks. For example, requests for accounts and services from non-federally insured institutions\nwould generally be subject to a higher standard of review. The Board expects Reserve Banks to\ncollaborate on reviews of account and service requests, and conduct ongoing monitoring of\napproved accountholders, to ensure that the guidelines are implemented in a consistent manner.\nPublishing the guidelines is an important step to providing transparency and consistency\nacross the Federal Reserve System. However, more work remains to be completed before a\nprocess is established to fully implement the guidelines. In the meantime, there is a risk that the\nguidelines could establish false expectations regarding the timeline for evaluating and acting on\nthese requests.\nIn closing, I’d like to once again thank the Venture Center for hosting this event and for\nproviding the opportunity to get together to discuss innovation in financial services. It’s great to\n6\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Reserve Board Announces Final Guidelines That\nEstablish a Transparent, Risk-Based, and Consistent Set of Factors for Reserve Banks to Use in Reviewing Requests\nto Access Federal Reserve Accounts and Payment Services, news release, August 15, 2022,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20220815a.htm.\n\nfinally be back in Little Rock and to have the chance to meet so many of you in person after such\na long time.

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n2025 U.S. Monetary Policy Forum\nNew York, New York\nMarch 7, 2025\n\nThank you for the invitation to participate at this year’s U.S. Monetary Policy Forum\nconference. It is a pleasure to be here to discuss the conference report and present my views on\nthe transmission of monetary policy to real activity in recent years.1 I would like to start by\nthanking the authors of the paper for their thoughtful and comprehensive analysis of the effects\nof monetary policy on economic activity. As you all may know, my background is in banking\nand bank regulation, so my experience with and interest in understanding the transmission and\neffects of monetary policy stems from my responsibilities as a Member of the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (FOMC).\nTurning to the discussion, I will begin with a few comments and suggestions on the paper\nand then focus on how monetary policy and other factors influenced U.S. economic performance\nduring the tightening cycle that started in March 2022. I will then conclude with some thoughts\non the relevance of the results in the paper for monetary policy going forward.\nComments and Suggestions on “Monetary Policy Transmission to Real Activity”\nThe paper’s stated purpose is to estimate how monetary policy shocks affect gross\ndomestic product (GDP) and employment through the use of a range of models. The evidence is\ngenerally similar to previous studies, supporting the broader principle that monetary policy\nexerts its effects with long lags and has a limited contribution to changes in real activity when\nthe shock is small and not very persistent. We should keep in mind, however, that many other\nshocks hit the economy and that at times it may be hard to see the effects of monetary policy\nactions estimated in the paper as they work through the actual economy.\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee. I would like to thank Eugenio Pinto and Michele Cavallo for their\nassistance in preparing these remarks.\n\n- 2 -\nThe paper notes that a 1 percentage point increase in the federal funds rate that retraces\ngradually, taking five to six quarters to reach half of its initial size, has persistent negative effects\non GDP and employment. At maximum, this shock lowers GDP by 0.4 percent in about\n18 months and employment by 0.3 percent in about two years, on average across the models\nconsidered in the paper. However, there is a wide range of estimated responses, as they depend\non each model specification and the data used. The most sensitive components of GDP are\nresidential investment, business fixed investment, and durable goods consumption, which is\nconsistent with employment in the construction and durable goods manufacturing industries\nbeing highly interest-rate sensitive.\nThe paper analyzes the transmission of monetary policy to real activity, but it would have\nbeen very interesting to go one step further and also see the effects of monetary policy on\ninflation. This is especially relevant because the FOMC has been focused on bringing inflation\ndown to its 2 percent target over the past few years. Of course, higher interest rates lower\ninflation by dampening aggregate demand and real activity, thereby removing pressure on\nresource utilization, wages, and prices.\nThe authors use several models to analyze the transmission of monetary policy. They use\ntwo well-known structural models created by Federal Reserve Board staff that have been used in\nTealbook, the FRB/US and EDO models, in addition to two reduced-form VAR models, the New\nYork Fed Bayesian VAR model and a simple four-variable proxy VAR model. It is reassuring\nthat the estimated responses to a federal funds rate shock in the two models that I am most\nfamiliar with, the Board FRB/US and EDO models, seem consistent with previous findings.2\n2 See Brayton et al. (2014) and Chung et al. (2010).\n\n- 3 -\nOne small issue is that neither of the VAR models directly includes the federal funds rate.\nThe authors acknowledge this limitation in the analysis and address it by roughly estimating that\na 100-basis points shock to the policy rate boosts the 1-year and 2-year Treasury yields by 45\nand 40 basis points, respectively. This approach may have resulted in the implied monetary\npolicy shock in the two VAR models looking more persistent than in the two structural models. I\nwould suggest the authors take another look at this aspect of their exercise, so that the contours\nof the monetary policy shocks look more similar across the different models.\nAn alternative approach would have been to take the 1- and 2-year averages of the federal\nfunds rate from the FRB/US and EDO impulse responses and possibly add a small term\npremium. This approach would have suggested larger effects of the federal funds rate shock on\nthe 1- and 2-year Treasury yields than estimated by the authors. Another approach, especially in\nthe proxy VAR setting, would have been to use a measure of the shadow federal funds rate,\nwhich provides a gauge of the overall monetary policy stance and is not constrained by the zero\nlower bound.3\nThe paper focused on the effect of changes in the policy rate, but an important channel\nfor the transmission of monetary policy is how it affects private interest rates that are relevant for\nhouseholds and businesses consumption and investment decisions. Private rates include interest\nrates charged on outstanding credit card balances, rates on auto and other durable goods loans,\nmortgage rates, and corporate bond yields. Although credit card rates move closely in line with\nthe policy rate and include a time-varying spread that depends on the default risk profile of the\nborrower, longer-term private fixed rates on mortgages and corporate bonds depend on the\nexpected path of the federal funds rate, the term premium embedded in longer-term Treasury\n3 The estimated measure of the shadow federal funds rate is based on the work by Wu and Xia (2016).\n\n- 4 -\nyields, and risk spreads relative to Treasury securities of comparable maturity. Accordingly,\nmonetary policy tools other than the policy rate, including forward guidance and the amount of\nsecurities holdings in the central bank’s balance sheet, are also important for the transmission of\nmonetary policy since they can more forcefully affect the expected path of the federal funds rate,\nterm premiums, and risk spreads.\nThe authors analyze the contribution of major aggregate demand components to the\noverall effect of a monetary policy shock on GDP. One minor issue is that not all the models\ntreat business investment equally. In particular, the EDO model includes inventory investment\nunder business investment, while all other models do not appear to do so. This difference may\ncontribute to the much larger initial reaction of business investment in the EDO model compared\nto the other models, as inventory investment reacts quickly to a shock in the federal funds rate.\nI would like to offer one last comment on the relatively small effect of monetary policy\non real activity. Although I do not disagree with the authors’ assessment, I think that the\nestimated effects can cumulate to be quite sizable even for the transient unexpected shock\nconsidered. The FOMC quickly raised interest rates to fight surging inflation between March\n2022 and July 2023 by a cumulative 5-1/4 percentage points. According to the average impulse\nresponses, a shock of this magnitude would lead to declines of about 2 percent on the level of\nreal GDP and 1.5 percent on the level of employment, which would translate into a similarly\nlarge increase in the unemployment rate if those who lost their jobs mostly remained in the labor\nforce. This seems to suggest the potential for fairly large effects on real activity, especially when\nthe monetary policy shock has more persistent effects on the policy rate and results in larger\nincreases in term premiums and risk spreads.\n\n- 5 -\nThe Recent Tightening Cycle\nThe FOMC started raising the federal funds rate in March 2022 to combat rising\ninflation. Although the initial rate hike was a mere 1/4 percentage point, the pace of tightening\nwas faster over the remainder of the year, with an overall increase of more than 4 percentage\npoints in the policy rate by the end of 2022. Rate hikes continued in smaller 1/4 percentage point\nsteps the following year, adding to 1 additional percentage point increase by July 2023. As the\nauthors note in the paper, the rapid pace of monetary policy tightening was somewhat surprising,\nespecially as the FOMC was initially slow to react to signs that the rise in inflation during 2021\nwas not merely transitory and required more aggressive action.\nAs financial conditions tightened rapidly and the yield curve inverted in 2022, fears of an\nimpending recession started to rise, with Federal Reserve Board staff mentioning downside risks\nto real activity and that a mild recession seemed equally likely to the baseline Tealbook\nprojection for sluggish economic growth over the next year.4 The staff eventually predicted a\nmild recession in the Tealbook forecast after the bank failures and banking system stress in the\nspring of 2023.5 Such recession was widely predicted and, in hindsight, it never materialized.\nAs you well know, the yield curve inversion has not been the only predictor of recessions that\nhas failed in recent years.\nOn a Q4-over-Q4 basis, GDP growth slowed considerably in 2022 to a modest pace of\nonly 1.3 percent. The components of GDP that exerted the most drag on growth that year were\nresidential investment, goods consumption, and inventory investment, subtracting a total of\n1-1/2 percentage points from real GDP growth in 2022.\n4 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System FOMC Minutes (November 2022).\n5 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System FOMC Minutes (March 2023).\n\n- 6 -\nResidential investment weakened rather quickly and fell more than 16 percent in 2022.\nThe sharp decline in this category seems largely explained by higher mortgage rates, which\nsurged more than 3 percentage points over the course of the year as the FOMC aggressively\ntightened monetary policy. In addition to higher interest rates, the 1-1/2 percent drop in goods\nconsumption in 2022 likely reflected the imprint of higher inflation on real disposable income\nand the unwinding of previous fiscal stimulus.\nSomewhat at odds with the empirical results in the paper, business fixed investment\ncontinued to rise appreciably as special factors led to a delayed response to the rise in interest\nrates. A broader measure of business investment that includes inventories did show a slowdown\nin growth, but even this broad measure continued to rise appreciably in 2022. Business fixed\ninvestment was likely supported by construction of new microchip and battery plants, the\ncontinued boost to software investment following the switch to remote work, and a rebound in\nnonresidential structures and transportation equipment investment after their protracted decline\nover the pandemic.\nPayroll employment increased strongly in 2022 as labor force participation rose, the\nunemployment rate declined, and the labor market tightened considerably. Payroll employment\nmoved back up to its pre-pandemic level and approached its trend as social distancing receded.\nThe recovery dynamics in employment largely masked any effects from rising interest rates in\n2022. The effect from higher interest rates on employment also tends to lag and be more\npersistent than the effect on GDP, so any effects likely showed up in 2023, an outcome that is\nconsistent with the findings in the paper.\n\n- 7 -\nSome Reasons Why the Economy Outperformed\nThe economy outperformed in 2023 as widespread predictions of an impending recession\nnever materialized and instead growth picked up. From the point of view of the models in the\npaper, the stronger economy in 2023 also seems surprising, but this likely reflected other factors\nthat influenced the economy and that are not accounted for in the model simulations.\nDespite significant tightening in broad financial conditions in 2023, GDP growth\nstrengthened notably as fiscal policy turned from a drag into a meaningful boost to growth and\npotential output accelerated further due to increased immigration and strong productivity growth.\nThese favorable supply developments allowed for stronger economic activity along with easing\nof inflationary pressures. Although growth surprised to the upside in 2023, labor market\ntightness eased with the unemployment rate edging up over the year and payroll employment\ngrowth slowing markedly.\nFaster GDP growth in 2023 was driven by a rebound in goods consumption, some\nrecovery in residential investment, and stronger government spending. Goods consumption was\nboosted by strong gains in real compensation and personal income, including from declining\ninflation. Despite continued drag from higher mortgage rates, residential investment started\nrecovering in 2023 as other factors supported demand. In particular, the labor market remained\nstrong and household balance sheets were still healthy. The sharp rise in mortgage rates also\ncreated a lock-in effect that increased demand for new housing and construction activity.\nThe marked deceleration in employment in 2023 seems consistent with the longer lags in\nthe response of employment to the rise in interest rates relative to that of GDP, especially as a\nsignificant portion of employment gains reflected increased labor supply from immigration,\nwhich allowed the labor market to come into better balance. Also consistent with the paper\n\n- 8 -\nresults, employment gains in the construction and durable goods manufacturing industries were\nmore noticeably below their 2015-2019 trends than employment gains for the aggregate\neconomy.\nAs the authors argue, another reason why real activity was more resilient in the face of\nhigher interest rates may have been the healthy balance sheets of households and businesses at\nthe start of the tightening cycle. Households had accumulated excess savings during the\npandemic, reflecting both increased fiscal stimulus and reduced consumption due to social\ndistancing and supply bottlenecks.6 In fact, data from the Financial Accounts of the U.S. indicate\nthat in the two years between the end of 2019 and the end of 2021, household bank deposits rose\nby nearly $4 trillion.7\nIn addition, many households and nonfinancial businesses were able to refinance their\nmortgages and corporate bonds at very low rates during the pandemic. Although higher interest\nrates likely held back additional consumption expenditures and investment spending, they had\nless of an effect on households’ and nonfinancial businesses’ net cash flows as the average\ninterest rates on household mortgages and business debt remained low.8\nWith historically low borrowing costs during the pandemic era, mortgage originations\nand refinancing activity reached very high levels. As a result, the share of outstanding\nmortgages with an interest rate below 4 percent increased to nearly 70 percent by 2022 and it\nremains well above pre-pandemic levels today. Similarly, nonfinancial businesses issued record\namounts of corporate bonds and extended the maturity of their debt to avoid new debt issuance\n6 See Aladangady et al. (2022).\n7 See Castro et al. (2022).\n8 The effectiveness of monetary policy can be substantially reduced both during a long period of low interest rates\nand for a long period after interest rates renormalize. See Eichenbaum et al. (2022) for the mortgage refinancing\nchannel and Fabiani et al. (2024) and Jungherr et al. (2024) for the corporate debt maturity channel.\n\n- 9 -\nearlier in the subsequent rate hiking cycle. Between 2020 and 2021, the fraction of triple-B\ncorporate bonds maturing within three years fell to its lowest levels in nearly 20 years.\nFiscal policy also reentered expansionary territory in 2023, with above-trend stimulus\npartly driven by strong state and local government spending. Although the unwinding of\nCOVID-19 fiscal support continued in 2023, the federal budget deficit turned back up and rose to\nnear 6 percent of GDP, while the primary deficit inched up towards 4 percent of GDP. These\ndeficit levels are unusual for an expansion, especially as fiscal policy seems to have contributed\nto the degree of tightness in the economy.\nOne way to describe the resiliency of real activity to higher interest rates during the\nrecent tightening cycle is to say that some of the previously noted factors led to a rise in r-star.\nHigher population growth, from the influx of new immigrants, and higher productivity growth,\narguably from the use of new technologies like artificial intelligence and the surge in new\nbusiness formations, especially in high-tech industries, have likely boosted investment demand.\nIn addition, the lack of significant fiscal consolidation has also increased demand for savings.\nAn economy with stronger investment demand and very little household savings likely requires a\nhigher equilibrium interest rate relative to pre-pandemic norms.\nRelevance of Results for Monetary Policy Going Forward\nThe U.S. economy has been experiencing major shocks and structural changes since the\npandemic, which may have influenced or masked the transmission of monetary policy to real\nactivity. It is, therefore, not straightforward to see how the impulse responses shown in this\npaper have translated in practice. And, as the paper acknowledges, a large portion of the\nfluctuations in real activity are driven by shocks other than those to monetary policy. Although\nthe FOMC has been focused on lowering inflation in the past few years, as we continue to make\n\n- 10 -\nprogress on approaching our 2 percent target, I expect that the labor market and economic\nactivity will become a larger factor in the FOMC’s policy discussions. Accordingly, the stylized\nresults on real activity effects in the paper will prove especially useful going forward.\nConclusion\nI will conclude by saying that I enjoyed the paper, and that I appreciate the opportunity to\nbe here to share my views on this topic. I look forward to the discussion and to hearing feedback\nfrom other participants and the perspective of my FOMC colleague and fellow discussant.\n\n- 11 -\nReferences\nAladangady, Aditya, David Cho, Laura Feiveson, and Eugenio Pinto (2022). “Excess Savings\nduring the COVID-19 Pandemic,” FEDS Notes.

Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nAspen Institute\nWashington, D.C.\nDecember 5, 2023\n\nI would like to thank the Aspen Institute for inviting me to join you at this event to\ndiscuss efforts to develop a more inclusive financial system.1 It is really a pleasure to join so\nmany stakeholders that are at the forefront of this important work. As I have often said, one of\nour important responsibilities is to foster an economy that works for everyone.2 Consumers are\nbetter positioned to benefit from economic growth when they have access to financial products\nand services that responsibly meet their needs.\nMy perspective on financial inclusion is informed, in no small part, from my own\nexperience as a banker. Small banks, especially community banks, have a deep understanding of\nthe local economies they serve, and can respond quickly and effectively to local needs. Indeed,\nfinancial inclusion is a core mission of community banks; but no entity or group of financial\ninstitutions alone can solve the challenge of creating a more inclusive financial system. Today, I\nwill discuss my views on why financial inclusion is important to all of us—from community\nbanks to central banks. I will then highlight activities in which the Federal Reserve participates\nto promote financial inclusion and conclude with ideas for future work and collaboration.\nWhy Financial Inclusion Is Important\nAn inclusive financial system offers access and choices that enhance consumers’ and\nbusinesses’ financial well-being. From checking and savings accounts to credit and insurance,\nconsumers benefit from having financial products and services that are affordable, safe, and\nresponsive to their needs. Without them, consumers may turn to alternative financial services,\nwhich can often be more costly or may lead to consumer harm.\n1 Thank you to Jennifer Fernandez, Alejandra Lopez-Fernandini, Daniel Gorin, and Kirsten Noland of the Federal\nReserve Board for their assistance in preparing this text. These views are my own and do not necessarily reflect\nthose of the Federal Reserve Board.\n2 Michelle W. Bowman, panel remarks at the 2023 Symposium on Indigenous Inclusion, The Central Bank Network\nfor Indigenous Inclusion and The Reserve Bank of New Zealand—Te Pūtea Matua, Auckland, New Zealand\n(September 27, 2023), https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20230927a.htm.\n\n- 2 -\nAn inclusive financial system recognizes that consumers come from a wide range of\neconomic circumstances; have varied perceptions of and experiences with the banking system;\nand most importantly, different needs for financial products and services. And despite the\ngeneral availability of online financial services, geography, location, and accessibility matter.\nFinancial inclusion may look very different, for instance, in rural communities, compared to the\nsuburbs of Washington, D.C., or the islands of Hawaii. The entire economy gains when more\nhouseholds achieve financial stability. That said, the benefits of financial inclusion do not\nnecessarily result in the same outcomes for everyone.\nFederal Reserve Activities and Promising Developments\nThe road to fostering a more inclusive financial system is long and winding and may, at\ntimes, seem daunting. We have been on this road for some time, and the Federal Reserve and\nmany others have already taken many promising steps. So, I’d like to share a few examples of\nthe Fed’s recent efforts to promote financial inclusion that will help to provide some context to\nour ongoing efforts.\nSupporting access to responsive products: small-dollar lending\nFor many years, a variety of surveys have indicated that consumers use small-dollar\ncredit to address temporary cash-flow imbalances, unexpected expenses, or income shortfalls\nduring periods of economic stress or natural disasters. So, we began to consider the ways in\nwhich the Federal Reserve and other financial regulators could be helpful. Shortly after I joined\nthe Federal Reserve, in 2019 and through 2020, we issued two interagency statements meant to\nprovide clarity to banks on the use of alternative data for underwriting and on principles for\noffering responsible small-dollar loans.3 Our guidance clarified that with a consumer’s\n3 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau,\n\n- 3 -\npermission, banks can use alternative data, like checking account balance activity, to qualify\nthem for credit. Our guidance also underscored that small-dollar lending products that support\nsuccessful repayment outcomes and that avoid continuous cycles of debt due to rollover and\nreborrowing can help facilitate financial inclusion. We have seen some evidence that suggests\nthe release of these small-dollar Interagency Lending Principles correlated with a subsequent\nincrease in bank consumer lending.4 Ensuring that small-dollar lending is available through\ndepository institutions rather than through other non-depository lenders could increase the credit\nopportunities available to consumers at lower cost and with fewer fees.\nBanks may also pursue expanding their lending opportunities through technology\ninnovations that provide mechanisms for more effective risk modelling or enhancing their online\naccess to financial services for consumers. These advancements can result in faster loan\ndecisionmaking, more convenient customer access, and reduced costs and risks for both banks\nand borrowers. Over time, we are seeing more banks incorporating these approaches to better\nserve clients with credit, including the use of alternative data to support underwriting. We will\ncontinue to monitor these promising developments to better understand the impact on consumers.\nSupporting mission-driven organizations\nI will turn now to the Fed’s efforts to build the institutional capacity of a set of key\nstakeholders: Minority Depository Institutions (MDIs), Women-Owned Depository Institutions\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation, National Credit Union Administration, Office of the Comptroller of the\nCurrency, “Interagency Statement on the Use of Alternative Data in Credit Underwriting,” CA letter 19-11\n(December 12, 2019), https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/caletters/caltr1911.htm; Board of Governors\nof the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, National Credit Union Administration,\nOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency, “Interagency Lending Principles for Making Responsible Small-Dollar\nLoans,” SR letter 20-14 / CA letter 20-8 (May 20, 2020),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/srletters/SR2014.htm.\n4 Daniel Gorin, Sarah Gosky, and Michael Suher, “Empirical Assessment of SR/CA Small-Dollar Lending Letter\nImpact,” FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, July 28, 2023),\nhttps://doi.org/10.17016/2380-7172.3329.\n\n- 4 -\n(WDIs), and Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs), whose missions are to\nreach historically underserved populations. Providing support for these institutions is an\nimportant part of the Federal Reserve’s mission to provide a safe, sound, and accessible banking\nsystem that protects consumers.5\nThrough the Fed’s Partnership for Progress (PFP) program, we provide technical\nassistance on regulatory matters, conduct research, host convenings, and provide examiner\ntraining to support and promote the stability of MDIs and WDIs.6 Research suggests that MDIs\nare more likely to focus their products and services to benefit diverse communities and to work\nwith more consumers who experience credit constraints in comparison with non-MDIs.7 The\nextent of their reach was evident during the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic,\nwhen they demonstrated effective contributions to the economic resiliency of their\ncommunities.8 During the pandemic, MDIs and CDFIs provided Paycheck Protection Program\n(PPP) loans to small businesses and financially underserved firms.9 The Fed supported these\nimportant financial service providers by providing liquidity through its emergency lending\nprogram, the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility.10\nThe Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP) provided additional support to MDIs\nand CDFIs. Through the ECIP, MDIs and CDFIs received over $8.5 billion in low-cost capital\n5 See the Federal Reserve’s Partnership for Progress website at https://www.fedpartnership.gov.\n6 Section 308 of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 describes goals for the\npreservation of MDIs though the OCC, FDIC, and Federal Reserve.\n7 Maude Toussaint-Comeau and Robin Newberger, “Minority-Owned Banks and Their Primary Local Market\nAreas,” Economic Perspectives, 41, 4 (Chicago: Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, May 2017),\nhttps://www.chicagofed.org/publications/economic-perspectives/2017/4.\n8 Allen N. Berger, Maryann P. Feldman, W. Scott Langford, and Raluca A. Roman, “‘Let Us Put Our Moneys\nTogether’: Minority-Owned Banks and Resilience to Crises,” Working Paper 23-13 (Philadelphia: Federal Reserve\nBank of Philadelphia, June 2023), https://www.philadelphiafed.org/-/media/frbp/assets/working-papers/2023/wp23-\n13.pdf.\n9 Emily Ryder Perlmeter, “Mission-Oriented Banks in Texas and Underserved Businesses: Lessons from the\nPaycheck Protection Program” (Dallas: Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, December 16, 2022),\nhttps://www.dallasfed.org/cd/pubs/2022/mdi-cdfi-ppp.\n10 See the Federal Reserve Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/ppplf.htm.\n\n- 5 -\nto support the provision of loans and grants to small businesses and consumers in their\ncommunities. The Federal Reserve conducted collective webinars and individualized outreach to\nMDIs to encourage enrollment in the program. Our early internal analysis shows, on average,\nthat eligible banks are using ECIP to strengthen balance sheets, build internal capacity, and\nenhance product offerings. As a result, we have seen ECIP recipients increase their lending\nabout a year after receiving funds, relative to MDIs and CDFIs that did not receive ECIP\nfunding.\nSupporting Central Bank Network for Indigenous Inclusion\nThis brings me to another aspect of the Federal Reserve’s efforts to support financial\ninclusion. The Fed recently became a member of the Central Bank Network for Indigenous\nInclusion (CBNII). This group brings together the central banks of the United States, Canada,\nNew Zealand, and Australia with the purpose of understanding and researching related economic\nand financial issues, knowledge sharing, and financial education targeted to these communities.11\nAs the Federal Reserve’s network representative, I recently participated in the CBNII’s biennial\nsymposium focused on the importance of Indigenous financial inclusion.12 My remarks there\nreiterated the view that a financial system must be inclusive for the economy to work for\neveryone and must include access for Indigenous communities.\nOur work with Indigenous groups includes all U.S. native populations, Native Hawaiian,\nNative Alaskan, and Native American Indians. The Fed’s CBNII work is supported by many of\nour Reserve Bank teams, including the San Francisco Reserve Bank, the Minneapolis Center for\nIndian Country Development (CICD), and the St. Louis Native Economic and Financial\n11 The Federal Reserve Banks of Atlanta, Minneapolis, San Francisco, and St. Louis support our participation in the\nCBNII based on their work with Native communities in their Districts and throughout the country.\n12 Michelle W. Bowman, 2023 Symposium on Indigenous Inclusion, panel remarks,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20230927a.htm.\n\n- 6 -\nEducation Empowerment (NEFEE) program. Together, these teams and programs work with\nIndigenous organizations and tribal nations to provide access to economic and personal finance\neducation incorporating Indigenous language and culture.\nSupporting research informing financial inclusion\nAs a final example, I’ll highlight some of the Fed’s financial inclusion data and research.\nTwo of our most important contributions to the study of financial well-being and consumer\nwealth are the annual Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking (SHED) and the\ntriennial Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF).13 Responses to these surveys are publicly\navailable and are extensively cited by other practitioners and researchers.\nResearchers and practitioners also rely upon the St. Louis Reserve Bank’s Bank On\nNational Data (BOND) Hub, which was created in partnership with Cities for Financial\nEmpowerment’s Bank On program.14 Through voluntary and aggregated data reporting, this\nresource enables the public to track the growth and usage of Bank On accounts in communities\nacross the country. We encourage the public’s continued engagement with and analysis of these\nimportant data.\nLooking Ahead\nToday, I’ve spoken about the Fed’s work in the areas of small-dollar credit, mission-\ndriven organizations and networks, and data. Before I close, I would like to raise several issues\non my mind that might prompt discussion in your event today.\n13 See the Federal Reserve Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/consumerscommunities/shed.htm and\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/scfindex.htm.\n14 The Bank On program promotes a national standard for bank accounts that are both low cost and low risk for\ncustomers. See https://www.stlouisfed.org/community-development/bank-on-national-data-hub and\nhttps://cfefund.org/project/bank-on/.\n\n- 7 -\nFirst, building on some progress in small-dollar credit, how can we encourage the\ndevelopment of lower-cost products and refine our understanding of the degree to which these\nproducts may foster consumers’ financial well-being?\nSecond, given the value of mission-driven organizations in expanding access to financial\nproducts and services in underserved communities, how can we best provide support to the\nactivities of MDIs, WDIs, and CDFIs?\nThird, the CBNII relies on the participation and wisdom of Indigenous leaders and\ncommunity members to advance financial inclusion. How can we leverage this model of\nengagement and shared learning?\nFinancial inclusion is not a one-size-fits-all issue. Involving consumers and communities\nin identifying issues and crafting approaches for solutions is critical to success. Advancing\nfinancial inclusion will clearly take many hands and a diverse set of stakeholders, including\neveryone participating here today.\nClosing\nIn closing, greater inclusiveness in the financial system is an ongoing priority for the\nFederal Reserve, and we will continue to engage on these important issues in the years to come.\nProgress requires collaboration, and I look forward to engaging with all of you as we continue on\nthe journey to make our financial system more inclusive.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n6:15 p.m. EST\nNovember 22, 2024\nArtificial Intelligence in the Financial System\nRemarks by\nMichelle W. Bowman\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe 27th Annual Symposium on Building the Financial System of the 21st Century:\nAn Agenda for Japan and the United States\nWashington, D.C.\nNovember 22, 2024\n\nDiscussions of artificial intelligence (AI) inevitably center on two main points: risks and\nbenefits.1 Both of these can be frustratingly vague and amorphous. Proponents of AI project its\nwidespread adoption will be as momentous as the industrial age—radically improving efficiency,\nincreasing labor productivity, and changing the world economy. Skeptics largely focus on the\nrisks, noting that it may introduce new and unpredictable variables into the economy and the\nfinancial system, including new forms of cyber-risk and fraud.\nIt would be impossible to predict what the future holds for AI, or how its use and impact\nwill evolve over time. But as the technology continues to mature, as new use cases evolve, and it\nis rolled out more broadly, we will almost certainly be surprised by how it is ultimately used.\nLooking at the financial industry-specific implications of AI, it is helpful to consider not\nonly how it may change the financial system, but also how regulatory frameworks should\nrespond to this emerging technology. Are the existing frameworks sufficient? If not, how can\nregulators best balance the risks AI may pose to bank safety and soundness and financial stability\nwith the need to allow for continued innovation?\nBroader availability of generative AI and large language models have created headlines\nand spiking stock prices, but the financial services sector has been using AI for some time.2\nOver time, it has become clear that AI’s impact could be far-reaching, particularly as the\ntechnology becomes more efficient, new sources of data become available, and as AI technology\nbecomes more affordable.\n1 The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board or\nthe Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 In 2017, the Financial Stability Board was already considering the financial stability implications of AI and\nmachine learning in financial services. See Financial Stability Board, “Artificial intelligence and machine learning\nin financial services: Market developments and financial stability implications” (Basel: Financial Stability Board,\nNovember 2017), https://www.fsb.org/uploads/P011117.pdf.\n\n- 2 -\nDo We Need a Definition of AI?\nBefore discussing the implications of AI and regulatory policy approaches, we should ask\nwhether we need a definition of AI. As it has advanced, the number and variety of definitions\nused to define AI have expanded.3 Some definitions focus on the algorithms—like the use of\nmachines to learn and reason in a way that simulates human intelligence. Others focus on the\noutputs—the ability to perform complex tasks normally done by humans. In 2021, an\ninteragency request for information from federal banking regulators, including the Federal\nReserve, sought comment on banks’ use of AI, but notably avoided using any single definition.\nInstead, this request listed a few possible use cases, features, and forms. These included the use\nof structured and unstructured data; the use of alternative data sources; voice recognition and\nnatural language processing; the algorithmic identification of patterns and correlations in training\ndata to generate predictions or categorizations; and “dynamic updating,” where an algorithm has\nthe capacity to update without human intervention.4\nWhile each definition of AI may serve its own purpose in the context of how it is used,\nany single narrow definition can be criticized. A more generic definition runs the risk of\noversimplifying the range of activities, use cases, and underlying technology. A definition that\ncaptures the variability of AI technology in a more granular way runs the risk of being unwieldy\nin its length, and obsolete in the short-term as new forms and use cases emerge.\n3 The National Artificial Intelligence Initiative Act of 2020, 15 U.S.C. § 9401(3) defines artificial intelligence as\n“… a machine-based system that can, for a given set of human-defined objectives, make predictions,\nrecommendations or decisions influencing real or virtual environments. Artificial intelligence systems use machine\nand human-based inputs to-(A) perceive real and virtual environments; (B) abstract such perceptions into models\nthrough analysis in an automated manner; and (C) use model inference to formulate options for information or\naction.”\n4 See Request for Information and Comment on Financial Institutions’ Use of Artificial Intelligence, Including\nMachine Learning, 86 Fed. Reg. 16837 (March 31, 2021), https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2021-03-\n31/pdf/2021-06607.pdf.\n\n- 3 -\nWithin this definitional question—of whether and how you define AI—lies a more\nimportant policy question: Specifically, for what purpose is a definition required? In the context\nof the financial system, the definition of AI may help to delineate how the regulatory system\naddresses it and establishes the parameters for how it can be used by regulated institutions.\nOther specific contexts could also be included, like third-party service providers that support\nbanks or other financial services providers, or use by regulators in support of their mandates.\nA definition helps regulators and regulated institutions understand the activities that are\nsubject to rules and requirements by defining the scope. While this definitional question is\nimportant to establish clarity about the scope of what constitutes AI, it can also distract us from a\nmore important point—what is the appropriate policy framework to address the introduction and\nongoing use of AI in the financial system?\nI have no strong feelings about the ideal or optimal definition of AI, and some version of\nthe many definitions floating around are probably adequate for our purposes. At a minimum\nthough, a definition must establish clear parameters about what types of activities and tools are\ncovered. But before leaving the topic, I want to offer a cautionary note. A broad definition of AI\narguably captures a wider range of activity and has a longer “lifespan” before it becomes\noutmoded, and potentially never becomes outdated. But a broad definition also carries the risk\nof a broad—and undifferentiated—policy response. This vast variability in AI’s uses defies a\nsimple, granular definition, but also suggests that we cannot adopt a one-size-fits-all approach as\nwe consider the future role of AI in the financial system.\n\n- 4 -\nInnovation and Competitiveness\nKnowing that the technology and use of AI continues to evolve leads to the question of\nhow it should be viewed by regulators, particularly in light of the need for innovation and the\neffect on competition.\nInnovation\nAI tools have the potential to substantially enhance the financial industry. In my view,\nthe regulatory system should promote these improvements in a way that is consistent with\napplicable law and appropriate banking practices.\nOne of the most common current use cases is in reviewing and summarizing unstructured\ndata. This can include enlisting AI to summarize a single report or to aggregate information\nfrom different sources on the same or related topics. The AI “output” in these cases may not\ndirectly produce any real-world action, but it provides information in a more usable way to assist\na human. AI use cases like this may present opportunities to improve operational efficiency,\nwithout introducing substantial new risk into business processes. In some ways, the joining of\nAI outputs with a human acting as a “filter” or “reality check” can capture efficiency gains and\ncontrol for some AI risks. Similarly, AI can act as a “filter” or “reality check” on analysis\nproduced by humans, checking for potential errors or biases.\nAI tools may also be leveraged to fight fraud. One such use is in combatting check fraud,\nwhich has become more prevalent in the banking industry over the last several years. In a recent\nreport, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network noted that from February to August of 2023,\nthere were over 15,000 reports received related to check fraud, associated with more than $688\n\n- 5 -\nmillion in transactions (including both actual and attempted fraud).5 The growth in check fraud\nover the past several years has caused significant harm not only to banks and the perceived safety\nof the banking system but also to consumers who are the victims of fraudulent activity. The\nregulatory response to help address this growing problem has unfortunately been slow, lacking in\ncoordination, and generally ineffective.\nCould AI tools offer a more effective way for banks to fight against this growing fraud\ntrend? We already have some evidence that AI tools are powerful in fighting fraud. The U.S.\nTreasury Department recently announced that fraud detection tools, including machine learning\nAI, had resulted in fraud prevention and recovery totaling over $4 billion in fiscal year 2024,\nincluding $1 billion in recovery related to identification of Treasury check fraud.6 While the\nnature of the fraud may be different in these cases, we should recognize that AI can be a strong\nanti-fraud tool and provide significant benefits for affected bank customers.\nIf our regulatory environment is not receptive to the use of AI in these circumstances\ncustomers are the ones who suffer. AI will not completely “solve” the problem of fraud—\nparticularly as fraudsters develop more sophisticated ways to exploit this technology. But it\ncould be important if the regulatory framework provides reasonable parameters for its use.\nAnother often-discussed use case for AI in financial services is in expanding the\navailability of credit. AI is not the first technology with potential to expand access to credit for\nthe “un-” or “underbanked.” We have long viewed alternative data as a potential opportunity for\n5 Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, Financial Trend Analysis: Mail Theft-Related Check Fraud: Threat\nPattern & Trend Information, February to August 2023 (Vienna: Financial Crimes Enforcement Network,\nSeptember 2024), https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/shared/FTA-Check-Fraud-FINAL508.pdf.\n6 See U.S. Department of the Treasury, “Treasury Announces Enhanced Fraud Detection Processes, Including\nMachine Learning AI, Prevented and Recovered Over $4 Billion in Fiscal Year 2024,” news release, October 17,\n2024, https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2650.\n\n- 6 -\nsome consumers, like those with poor or no credit history but with sufficient cash flow to support\nloan repayment.7\nAI could be used to further expand this access, as financial entities mine more data sets\nand refine their understanding of creditworthiness. Of course, we also know that using AI in this\ncontext—in a way that has more direct impact on credit decisions affecting individual\ncustomers—also presents more substantial legal compliance challenges than other AI use cases.\nAI also has promise to improve public sector operations, including in regulatory agencies.\nAs I have often noted, the data relied on to inform the Federal Open Market Committee decision-\nmaking process often is subject to revisions after-the-fact, requiring caution when relying on the\ndata to inform monetary policy.8 Perhaps the broader use of AI could act as a check on data\nreliability, particularly for uncertain or frequently revised economic data, improving the quality\nof the data that monetary policymakers rely on for decision-making. Additional data as a\nreliability check or expanded data resources informed by AI could improve the FOMC’s\nmonetary policymaking by validating and improving the data on which policymakers rely.\nWhile these use cases present only a subset of the possibilities for the financial system,\nthey illustrate the breadth of potential benefits and risks of adopting an overly cautious approach\nthat chills innovation in the banking system. Over-regulation of AI can itself present risks by\n7 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation, National Credit Union Administration, and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,\n“Interagency Statement on the Use of Alternative Data in Credit Underwriting,” news release, December 12, 2019,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/caletters/CA%2019-\n11%20Letter%20Attachement%20Interagency%20Statement%20on%20the%20Use%20of%20Alternative%20Data\n%20in%20Credit%20Underwriting.pdf\n8 See Michelle W. Bowman, “Perspectives on U.S. Monetary Policy and Bank Capital Reform,” (speech at Policy\nExchange, London, England, June 25, 2024)\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20240625a.pdf.\n\n- 7 -\npreventing the realization of benefits of improved efficiency, lower operational costs, and better\nfraud prevention and customer service.\nEffect on Competition\nThe regulatory approach and framework can also promote competition in the\ndevelopment and use of AI tools in the financial system.\nAn overly conservative regulatory approach can skew the competitive landscape by\npushing activities outside of the regulated banking system or preventing the use of AI altogether.\nInertia often causes regulators to reflexively prefer known practices and existing technology over\nprocess change and innovation. The banking sector often suffers from this regulatory\nskepticism, which can ultimately harm the competitiveness of the U.S. banking sector.\nIn the United States, we often think about the financial system based on the regulatory\n“perimeter.” We view institutions within the scope of federal banking regulation (banks and\ntheir affiliates) as being “in the perimeter,” while entities that operate under other regulatory\nframeworks (including money transmitters licensed under state law) are “outside the perimeter.”\nOf course, the global financial system includes institutions that operate on a cross-border basis,\nand tools and approaches often permeate throughout the financial system once they have been\ndeployed successfully in some other part of the system. But we know that the regulatory\nperimeter is permeable, and there is always the risk that activity pushed outside the perimeter can\ntransmit risk back into the system even as the activities garner less scrutiny and regulation than\nbanks. Put differently, the overly conservative approach may present only a façade of safety,\nmasking underlying risks to the financial system and those who rely on it.\nOf course, there are risks to being overly permissive in the AI regulatory approach. As\nwith any rapidly evolving technology, supervision of its use should be nimble. Its users must\n\n- 8 -\nmake sufficient risk-management and compliance investments to conduct activities in a safe and\nsound manner, and in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. While the banking\nsystem has generally been cautious and deliberate in its AI development and rollout, others have\nnot. When left improperly managed and unmonitored, it can result in unintended outcomes and\ncustomer harm. For example, certain generative AI models have been known to generate\nnonsensical or inaccurate outputs, sometimes called “hallucinations.” In some cases, AI\nhallucinations have not involved significant harm, for example when discovered in a testing\nenvironment without customer-facing implications.\nThe Sufficiency of Existing Regulatory Tools\nWhile helpful to acknowledge the risks of over-regulation and under-regulation, we must\nunderstand our currently regulatory stance—what tools do we have to promote AI’s benefits\nwhile helping to mitigate the risks? To address this topic, we should widen the lens to consider\nour approach to innovation broadly. Supporting innovation in the financial system can and\nshould apply to the introduction and use of AI.9\nWhen we consider AI risks, many of these are already well-covered by existing\nframeworks. For example, AI often depends on external parties—cloud computing providers,\nlicensed generative AI technologies, and core service providers—to operate. AI can also pose\nmodel risks in the banking context, with associated data management and governance concerns.\nAI can also impact a bank’s cyber-resiliency as AI-related fraud tools become more widespread\nand more anti-fraud tools become available.\n9 See Michelle W. Bowman, “Innovation and the Evolving Financial Landscape” (speech at The Digital Chamber\nDC Blockchain Summit 2024, Washington, D.C., May 15, 2024),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20240515a.pdf.\n\n- 9 -\nWhile AI may be on the frontier of technology, it does not operate outside the existing\nlegal and regulatory framework. AI is not exempt from current legal and regulatory\nrequirements, nor is its use exempt from scrutiny. This is particularly true with AI; its use must\ncomply with current laws and regulations, including fair lending, cyber security, data privacy,\nthird-party risk management, and copyright. And when AI is deployed in a bank, an even\nbroader set of requirements may apply depending on the use case.\nRegulators are often playing “catch-up” with banks at the forefront of innovation. As a\nresult, they often suffer from significant disadvantages in terms of understanding how the\ntechnology works, understanding the uses of AI within financial institutions, and keeping up-to-\ndate with the latest AI developments. Of course, further compounding this challenge is that\nmuch of the work in AI innovation occurs far outside the banking system, including in the\ndevelopment and testing of generative AI models and in compiling the data sources on which to\ntrain the models.\nDespite these challenges—and the understandable regulatory instinct to limit its use in\nthe financial system—we must avoid this temptation. A few general principles should govern a\ncoherent regulatory approach, which are the same principles that I apply to innovation\ngenerally.10\nFirst, we must understand AI before we consider whether and how to change our\nregulatory approach. With respect to various internal use cases, the Board has published a\ncompliance program that governs artificial intelligence.11 One of the foundational elements for a\n10 See Bowman, “Innovation and the Evolving Financial Landscape.”\n11 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Compliance Plan for OMB Memorandum M-24-10\n(Washington: Board of Governors, September 2024), https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/compliance-\nplan-for-omb-memorandum-m-24-10-202409.pdf.\n\n- 10 -\nsuccessful approach to AI, and one mentioned in this plan, is the development and acquisition of\nstaff expertise.\nMany banks have increased AI adoption to an expanding number of use cases. As this\ntechnology becomes more widely adopted throughout the financial system, it is critical that we\nhave a coherent and rational policy approach. That starts with our ability to understand the\ntechnology, including both the algorithms underlying its use and the possible implications—both\ngood and bad—for banks and their customers.\nIn suggesting that we grow our understanding and staff expertise as a baseline, I\nacknowledge that this has been, and is likely to remain, a challenge. The Federal Reserve and\nother banking regulators compete for the same limited pool of talent as private industry. But we\nmust prioritize improving our understanding and capacity as this technology continues to become\nmore widely adopted.\nSecond, we must have an openness to the adoption of AI. We need to have a receptivity\nto the use of this technology and know that successful adoption requires communication and\ntransparency between regulated firms and regulators. One approach regulators can use to\nreframe questions around AI (and innovation generally) is to adopt a posture that I think of as\ntechnology agnosticism.\nWe should avoid fixating on the technology, and instead focus on the risks presented by\ndifferent use cases. These risks may be influenced by a number of factors, including the scope\nand consequences of the use case, the underlying data relied on, and the capability of a firm to\nappropriately manage these risks. Putting activities together may be a helpful way to get a sense\nof broad trends (for example, the speed of AI adoption in the industry), but is inefficient as a way\nto address regulatory concerns (like safety and soundness, and financial stability). This may\n\n- 11 -\nseem like an obvious point, but at times regulators have fallen prey to overbroad categorizations,\ntreating a diverse set of activities as uniformly and equally risky.\nThis approach allows us to be risk-focused, much like we try to do with other forms of\nsupervision, moderating intensity for low-risk activities, and increasing the intensity for higher-\nrisk ones.\nOf course, regulatory agencies do not operate in a vacuum, so we must also ask what type\nof coordination we need to ensure that we promote safe and sound adoption of AI, and address\nbroader financial stability risks, both domestically and internationally. As a threshold matter, we\nneed coordination both within each agency and among domestic regulators that play a role in the\nsupervision and regulation of the financial system, which requires an environment of open\nsharing of information.\nA posture of openness to AI requires caution when adding to the body of regulation.\nSpecifically, I think we need a gap analysis to determine if there are regulatory gaps or blind\nspots that could require additional regulation and whether the current framework is fit for\npurpose. Fundamentally though, the variability in the technology will almost certainly require a\ndegree of flexibility in regulatory approach.\nClosing Thoughts\nBefore closing, I want to thank the organizers of this event for the invitation to address\nyou this evening, and to thank the many speakers and participants who have contributed to the\nsymposium.\nArtificial intelligence has tremendous potential to reshape the financial services industry\nand the broader world economy. While I have suggested in my remarks that we need not rush to\nregulate, it is important that we continue to monitor developments in AI and their real-world\n\n- 12 -\neffects. In the long run, AI has the potential to impact many aspects of the Fed’s work, from our\nrole in supervising the payment system, to the important work we do promoting the safe and\nsound operation of banks and financial stability. AI may also play a growing role in monetary\npolicy discussions, as the introduction of AI tools alter labor markets, affecting productivity and\npotentially the natural rate of unemployment and the natural rate of interest.\nBut as we engage in ongoing monitoring—and expand our understanding of AI\ntechnology and how it fits within the bank regulatory framework—I think it is important to\npreserve the ability of banks to innovate and allow the banking system to realize the benefits of\nthis new technology.",

    "text": "November 19, 2020\n\nGovernor Michelle W. Bowman\n\nAt the âFinancial Stability: Stress, Contagion, and Transmissionâ 2020 Financial Stability Conference hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and the Office of Financial Research, Cleveland, Ohio (via webcast)\n\nGood afternoon, everyone. It is a pleasure to join you here today and to share a few of my thoughts on financial stability issues with you. I would like to thank the Cleveland Fed and the Office of Financial Research for hosting this conference and for that very kind introduction. It is encouraging to see so many great minds devoting their time and attention to studying financial stability. At the Board, we dedicate considerable attention to this topic as well, and I would like to thank my colleagues, Vice Chair for Supervision Randy Quarles, Chair of the Financial Stability Board (FSB), and Governor Lael Brainard, for their leadership on these issues both internationally and at the Board.\n\nIt seems especially relevant to look closely at financial stability at this time, as the COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the U.S. economy and has tested the resilience of our financial system over the past nine months. Efforts to contain the virus triggered an economic downturn that was unprecedented in both its speed and its severity. Early on, more than 22 million jobs were lost in March and April, and though a significant number of people have returned to work since that time, we still face a shortfall in employment relative to its level before the onset of the pandemic.\n\nFortunately, both our economy and our financial system were very strong when the pandemic hit. Most banks began 2020 with higher capital ratios and more liquid assets than they had in previous downturns, which helped them remain a source of strength in March and April. As the crisis intensified in March, serious cracks emerged in several areas of financial intermediation crucial to the health of the economy, including Treasury markets, corporate and municipal bond markets, money market mutual funds, mortgage real estate investment trusts, and residential mortgage markets. Today I am going to focus on the strains in mortgage markets.\n\nTo address strains in mortgage finance, the Federal Reserve took prompt action to purchase large quantities of agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities (MBS), because as we learned during the previous financial crisis, the proper functioning of mortgage markets is necessary for monetary policy to support the economy. Unfortunately, the problems in mortgage finance in this crisis were broader than just the MBS markets. This crisis period has also revealed a number of newâor, in some cases, renewedâvulnerabilities related to lending and loan servicing by nonbank mortgage companies, which I will refer to from here on as mortgage companies.\n\nThese vulnerabilities were not entirely a surprise to me. When I served as a banker and, subsequently, as the state bank commissioner in Kansas, I saw firsthand the increasing share of mortgage companies in mortgage origination and servicing as well as some of the weaknesses in the mortgage company business model. And in my role as a Board member with a focus on community banks, I frequently hear about the issues that have caused some regional and community bankers to pull back from originating and servicing mortgages. I view this as a significant problem, because I believe firmly that a healthy financial system must have a place for institutions of many different types and sizes that are able to serve the varying needs of different customers.\n\nI will begin today by describing the evolving role of mortgage companies in mortgage markets and the risks to financial stability that activity entails. I will then focus on developments in mortgage markets during the COVID-19 pandemic and discuss how actions by the Federal Reserve and the other parts of the government helped stabilize financial markets and prevent more severe damage to the economy. Finally, I will explain how vulnerabilities associated with mortgage companies could pose risks in the future, and I will review ongoing work across the regulatory agencies to monitor and address these vulnerabilities. I will end by enlisting your help. Figuring out how to achieve a balanced mortgage systemâone that delivers the best outcomes for consumers while being sufficiently resilientâis a highly complex task that could benefit from the insights of those of you here today.\n\nThe Role of Nonbank Financial Institutions in Mortgage Markets In the 1980s and 1990s, the share of mortgages originated by mortgage companies increased considerably, as expanded securitization of mortgages allowed mortgage companies, which lack the balance sheet capacity of banks, to compete with banks in the mortgage market. The role of mortgage companies increased further in the 2000s with the growth of the private-label mortgage market, where MBS sponsors are private firms without government support. But the last financial crisis and the prolonged housing slump that followed led to a sharp contraction in mortgage company activity. In 2006, mortgage companies accounted for around 30 percent of originations; by 2008, at the bottom of the housing crisis, this share had fallen to around 20 percent.\n\nIn the past few years, the market share of mortgage companies has risen sharply, well surpassing their share before the housing crisis. Today these firms originate about half of all mortgages, including more than 70 percent of those securitized through Ginnie Mae and the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. 1 Nonbanks also service roughly three-fourths of mortgages securitized through Ginnie Mae and about one-half of those securitized through the GSEs. 2 Although some mortgage companies specialize in origination or servicing, most large firms engage in both activities.\n\nThe expanding presence of mortgage companies has brought benefits to consumers and the economy. Among the benefits are increased competition and technological innovation. Mortgage companies are generally able to react more nimbly to changes in market conditions and have been faster to deploy new technologies such as online mortgage origination platforms. But the rising market share of mortgage companies has also brought with it increased risks. I will focus here on the risks most relevant to financial stability.\n\nOne major vulnerability of mortgage companies is liquidityâthat is, their ability to finance their portfolios of assets. 3 Unlike banks, mortgage companies typically do not have access to liquidity from the Federal Home Loan Banks or the Federal Reserve System. Mortgage companies also do not have access to deposits as a stable funding source. So while banks will hold some originations on their balance sheets, mortgage companies first fund their originations on warehouse lines of credit that are usually supplied by banks. Typically, after a couple of weeks, the mortgage company repays the warehouse line and securitizes the mortgages. During the last financial crisis, when the private-label mortgage securitization market started to freeze, mortgage lenders could not transition their originations from the warehouse lines to securitization. Warehouse lenders became concerned about their exposures to the nonbank companies and cut off their access to credit. As a result of this funding crunch and other factors, many lenders failed, including household names like New Century Financial Corporation.\n\nThe risk of events like this one repeating is probably more limited today because mortgage companies primarily originate mortgages that are securitized through the far more stable GSE or Ginnie Mae markets. Instead, the main liquidity concern today comes from mortgage servicing. If borrowers do not make their mortgage payments, mortgage servicers are required to advance payments on the borrowers' behalf to investors, tax authorities, and insurers. Although servicers are ultimately repaid most of these advances, they need to finance them in the interim. The servicers' exposure is greatest for loans securitized through Ginnie Mae, as they require servicers to advance payments for a longer period than the GSEs. In some cases, servicers may also have to bear large credit losses or pay significant costs out of pocket. Because mortgage companies are now the major servicers for Ginnie Mae, this liquidity riskâand possibly solvency riskâis a significant vulnerability for these firms if borrowers stop making their payments.\n\nIf these firms collapse, what are the repercussions? Clearly, there is considerable potential for harm to consumers, and that harm would likely be concentrated in communities that are traditionally underserved. In recent years, mortgage companies originated the majority of the mortgages obtained by Black and Hispanic borrowers as well as the majority of mortgages to borrowers living in low- or moderate-income areas.\n\nWhat does this have to do with financial stability? One aspect of financial stability is the amplification of shocksâin other words, how a problem initially confined to one part of the financial system can spread to involve broader swaths of borrowers and investors. During the housing crisis, the fragility of mortgage companies was an important source of this kind of amplification. In particular, rising mortgage defaults led to the collapse of many mortgage companies, which in turn was one of the key drivers of a significant pullback in the supply of mortgage credit. That tightening in credit then weighed on house prices, as potential homebuyers, who once would have been able to get a loan, found mortgages expensive or impossible to obtain. As a result, even families who had not been involved in the mortgage frenzy of the mid-2000s found the prices of their homes falling sharply. Today's housing market is much more robust, and the risk of a financial crisis originating from this sector is currently low. Nonetheless, if some large mortgage companies fail and other firms do not step in to take their place, we could see adverse effects on credit availability.\n\nPolicy Responses to the COVID-19 Crisis Against this backdrop, the massive economic shock triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic broadly tested the resilience of our financial system. As the pandemic unfolded, strains occurred across financial markets as investors dashed for cash amid widespread lockdowns and fears about the economic and financial outlook. Mortgage markets, in particular, began to show significant signs of stress. The MBS market, like those for other fixed-income securities, became extremely volatile, and with the unemployment rate spiking, market participants worried that borrowers would be unable to make their mortgage payments.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's response to the crisis, which was prompt and forceful, included moving the policy interest rate to the effective lower bound, conducting large-scale purchases of Treasury securities and agency MBS, and implementing a number of emergency lending facilities to support the continued flow of credit to families, businesses, nonprofits, and state and local governments.\n\nOn the fiscal policy front, the CARES Act (Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act) provided economic stimulus checks and enhanced unemployment benefits to individuals as well as eviction moratoriums for renters and a requirement that mortgage servicers grant borrowers up to 12 months of forbearance. All of these policy responses were crucial in easing the stresses in financial markets and helping us weather the period when much of the economy was shuttered.\n\nAn unfortunate consequence of the mortgage forbearance measure was the pressure it put on the funding needs of servicers, particularly mortgage companies, which are required to continue advancing payments on loans in forbearance. In April, Ginnie Mae alleviated these strains somewhat by announcing a program that provides servicers with financing for principal and interest advances, and which would not be considered a default by the servicer. 4 Similarly, in April, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) announced that servicers would be required to advance only four months of missed payments for GSE loans. 5\n\nLooking Back and Taking Stock Although we continue to closely monitor the path of the virus and the public response to it, economic and financial conditions have improved much more than many had expected in the spring. It is a great relief that the most dire scenarios that seemed possible in the spring have not come to pass, which is largely due to supportive fiscal and monetary policy. In addition, the near-term stresses in financial markets have abated, providing support for the very strong recovery to date. The Federal Reserve's interest rate actions and MBS purchases have contributed to exceptionally low mortgage rates, which have boosted housing demand and the associated mortgage originations for new home purchases. We are also seeing a surge in mortgage refinancing. As a result, mortgage companies have experienced an influx of cash and an increase in profitability, and they have not had difficulties financing the advance payments.\n\nTo date, mortgage delinquencies and the take-up on forbearance appear to be limited and well below early fears of significant problems. The increase in employment since April, income support from stimulus payments, programs such as the Paycheck Protection Program that helped small businesses retain workers, and enhanced unemployment insurance all helped borrowers continue making their mortgage payments. And forbearance provisions in the CARES Act to homeowners with mortgages securitized by the GSEs or Ginnie Mae (around 65 percent of outstanding mortgages in the United States) have, so far, helped prevent foreclosures, which also supports home prices.\n\nThe share of mortgages in forbearance rose above 8 percent last spring, but it has since fallen to below 6 percent. And of those loans in forbearance, about one in six are current in their payments, reflecting the broader economic recovery. 6 This improvement has not been uniform, though, and the decline in the forbearance rate for loans in Ginnie Mae pools has been slower than those in GSE pools. And, of course, significant uncertainties remain, including the fact that forbearance for federally backed mortgages is set to expire in the first quarter of next year.\n\nSome Lessons Learned Even as we take some comfort in these positive developments, we are also giving due consideration to the financial market vulnerabilities that were made evident in this crisis, and we are examining ways to address them. One prominent vulnerability, which I have described here today, relates to the funding and liquidity profile of mortgage companies. In different circumstances, the large-scale delinquencies and defaults we saw last spring could have caused some mortgage companies to fail, especially if the surge in origination and refinancing income had not materialized. Because many mortgage companies both originate and service mortgages, strains in these firms' servicing books could also weigh on their origination activities. As I noted a moment ago, any reduction in credit availability would be most acute for borrowers from traditionally underserved communities, where mortgage companies have a particularly high market share.\n\nEven before the pandemic, regulators had widely recognized that the oversight and regulatory infrastructure for mortgage companies is much less well developed than for banks, and it could benefit from an update. To that end, Ginnie Mae announced new requirements for its servicers last year; the FHFA announced that it will propose updated minimum financial eligibility requirements for the GSE loan sellers and servicers; and, more recently, the Conference of State Bank Supervisors proposed a set of prudential standards for state oversight of nonbank mortgage servicers. 7 And, finally, the Financial Stability Oversight Council has been working closely with regulatory agencies to analyze risks related to nonbank servicers and to facilitate coordination among agencies. 8\n\nAn encouraging feature of all of these proposals is that they recognize the complexity of the mortgage company regulatory structure. The states are the primary regulators, but most large mortgage companies operate in multiple states and are also subject to counterparty requirements from the GSEs and Ginnie Mae. These proposals have all moved toward being more consistent with each other, which should reduce regulatory complexity and burden for mortgage companies and regulators.\n\nThe harder task, however, is thinking about what the overarching regulatory framework should be for mortgage companies. The risks that mortgage companies face are different from those that banks face. Mortgage companies will be more affected by shocks to the mortgage market than banks, which have much more diversified portfolios. As I have mentioned, mortgage companies have less access to liquidity than banks; at the same time, they do not pose the risk of a claim on the deposit insurance fund. These factors suggest that the optimal regulatory framework for mortgage companies should differ from that of banks.\n\nThese are difficult questions, and a casual observer might wonder if it is really necessary to grapple with them, especially as the industry appears to have successfully weathered the strains of the past few months. But I would argue that this \"success\" was reliant on rising home prices, low defaults, and massive fiscal and monetary stimulus. But we certainly can't count on all of these factors being present in future periods of economic stress.\n\nAround the world, regulators are deliberating about how to address a variety of nonbank entities that can pose systemic risks. In work published last week, the FSB highlighted the need for a macroprudential approach to nonbank financial intermediation. 9 Members of the FSB are not calling for bank-like regulation for nonbanks, but they recommend a framework of supervision and regulation that takes into account systemic risks that can be posed by nonbanks.\n\nI would also note one lesson we learned in March, which is that conditions in financial markets can deteriorate very rapidly and unexpectedly. I'm paying close attention to the issues highlighted in my remarks today, and keeping an open mind. But I think it's clear, that doing the hard thinking and planning nowâat a time when conditions afford us the time do soâis a very worthwhile investment. Our financial system and our mortgage market will be more resilient when they welcome and appropriately manage the risks associated with both bank and nonbank mortgage firms.\n\n1.

    "text": "June 23, 2021\n\nGovernor Michelle W. Bowman\n\nAt the Policy Summit 2021: Pathways to Economic Resilience in our Communities, Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, Cleveland, Ohio (via prerecorded video)\n\nThank you, Emily, and thank you to the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland for hosting this policy summit. I'd also like to thank the participants and attendees for taking part in these critical conversations. It's really a pleasure to be here with you to support the discussions of economic resiliency that will take place over the next several days. Considerations of what builds resilient communities are at the top of the list as we look back at the economic impact from the pandemic and look ahead, as we experience a recovery that we want to benefit everyone.\n\nI would also like to highlight that three of the sessions taking place over these next few days will provide an opportunity for all of you to convey your own perspectives on the economic recovery from the pandemic. We would like to hear directly from you about how you see the recovery progressing in your own communities, whether you see unique aspects to the way businesses and families in your communities experienced the downturn and ongoing recovery, and what opportunities or challenges you think may lie ahead as we all adjust to lasting changes in the economy following the pandemic.\n\nThese discussions will be the first of several aimed at continuing the Fed Listens initiative that began in 2019 and was part of the Federal Reserve's broad review of its monetary policy framework. The initial purpose of Fed Listens was to interact in a public setting with members of the public and community groups to hear about issues relating to our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability. The insights gained from these conversations proved to be highly valuable. Even though our framework review concluded last year, we are continuing the Fed Listens initiative with a focus this year on the economic recovery from the pandemic. We expect these listening sessions will benefit the Federal Reserve's ongoing policymaking process, while also providing important insights from affected communities, and enhancing transparency and public accountability.\n\nWith that in mind, let me briefly describe what I see as the current state of national economic conditions. As we continue to see progress toward the recovery, including the lifting of economic and social-distancing restrictions, the economy is growing at the fastest pace in decades. Economic output has likely surpassed its pre-pandemic peak, but even with this progress, there are over 10 million people still without jobs who are either actively looking for employment or have since left the labor force. Employment has been recovering rapidly in the sectors of the economy related to goods production and sales, but the services economy has been much slower to recover. Employment in the leisure and hospitality sectors is down by more than 3 million jobs since February of 2020. 1\n\nAs the recovery in the labor market and spending on goods and services continues to gain momentum, we are seeing upward pressures on consumer prices. In recent months, inflation has risen to well over the Federal Reserve's longer-run goal of 2 percent. This rise has reflected, in part, the fact that inflation numbers at the onset of the pandemic were very low. As those low values drop out of the 12-month average of price changes, this measure of inflation has increased and will likely increase further. But there is more to the recent rise in inflation than just these measurement issues. The impressive upswing in economic activity has played an important role as it has led to a number of supply chain bottlenecks and put upward pressure on prices for many goods. These upward price pressures may ease as the bottlenecks are worked out , but it could take some time, and I will continue to monitor the situation closely and will adjust my outlook as needed.\n\nPostâCOVID-19 economic outcomes We know that economic downturns are hardest for lower-income people, those with less education, and some minority groups. I believe that government responses to the pandemicâthe lockdowns, school closures, and economic restrictions on businessesâsignificantly widened differences by income, education, race, and gender, and those disparities have persisted during the recovery. For example, we know that those with a high school education or less were among the hardest hit in the downturn last spring, and I am concerned about those individuals falling behind. In 2020, 20 percent of prime-age adults with less than a bachelor's degree experienced a layoff, 8 percentage points higher than for those with at least a bachelor's degree. 2\n\nIt seems that women, and especially minority women, have shouldered a larger share of adverse labor market impact because of limited child care options and the need to assist school-aged children with remote learning during the pandemic. The impact of COVID-19 has been especially hard for Black and Hispanic women in the workforce. Over 3.5 percent of Black and Hispanic women dropped out of the labor force altogether, compared with 1.7 percent of women overall. 3\n\nWe also see divergent outcomes for small business owners across race and ethnicity. In the Federal Reserve's 2021 Small Business Credit Survey, 52 percent of Asian-owned, nonemployer small businesses reported their financial conditions as poor, compared with 38 percent of Hispanic-, 36 percent of Black-, and 28 percent of White-owned firms. 4\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee views the maximum level of employment as a broad-based and inclusive goal. Thus, these gaps in employment and other measures of economic wellbeing can be interpreted to show that more progress is needed to reach maximum employment. The goal is to promote an economy in which all can contribute to and share in the benefits of economic growth.\n\nCommunity voices With the experiences of the pandemic fresh in our minds, an event like this policy summit offers insights and perspectives from a broad range of community voices about what is working on the ground. I find it especially rewarding and valuable to hear from groups like those attending this summit. Conversations with the leaders of community groups inform me and other Fed policymakers of community and consumer experiences in real time.\n\nJust last month, for example, the Board of Governors met with our Community Advisory Council (CAC). This council consists of a diverse group of experts and representatives of consumer and community development organizations and interests. In our conversation, they provided thoughtful insights about the recovery as it is evolving in communities across the country. Their perspectives touched on the disparities the pandemic has exacerbated and on the challenging road ahead.\n\nPerspectives on economic resilience In the time I have with you this morning, I'd like to offer my perspective on economic resilience. I often find striking similarities between urban and rural communities, just as the upcoming panel on the \"common ground in urban and rural America\" will explore. When it comes to building economic resilience, there are a few key elements that facilitate a quicker recovery across different kinds of communities after challenging times. There are a wide range of topics on this conference's agenda, from broadband access to workforce development to affordable housing to small business developmentâI will focus on just a few of these.\n\nOne key element to community resiliency is the engagement of local financial institutions in providing access to credit and supporting small businesses with funding and technical assistance. As a former community banker, I know that few understand their communities better because they live in the local economy and can step in to lend in a targeted way to those best prepared to benefit. During the pandemic, community bankers and other lenders such as community development financial institutions (CDFIs) were the key to making sure that healthy businesses temporarily hurt by lockdowns, economic restrictions, and social distancing were able to access the multiple rounds of Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) funding that kept workers on their payrolls.\n\nIn other ways, community banks once again showed how irreplaceable they were in responding to the needs of consumers and small business clients. While I have heard from community groups that small businesses struggled to navigate the PPP application process, especially those that did not have a preexisting banking relationship, community banks and CDFIs made a concerted effort to meet small business needs. The 2021 Small Business Credit Survey results showed that small banks were the most common source for PPP loans among employer firms, and applicants leveraging assistance from smaller banks were the most successful in obtaining all of the PPP funding they applied for. 5 Additionally, I heard from the CAC last month that CDFIs were also effective in lending to smaller borrowers with limited or no financial institution relationships.\n\nAn environment that supports resilient small businesses means more jobs and economic growth in local communitiesâboth urban and rural. In the past 10 years, small businesses created over 10 million net new jobs, or about two-thirds of net new job creation, overall. In rural counties, 65 percent of the total jobs, which is a significant majority, were provided through employment in a small business. 6 Creating and encouraging an environment that supports small business growth and entrepreneurship is a vital component of economic vitality and advancing a more broad-based recovery. This is exactly the type of environment that the Federal Reserve has been working to encourage with accommodative financial conditions promoting the flow of credit to households and small businesses.\n\nAnd finally, as all of us are acutely aware after more than a year of pandemic-related shutdowns, broadband access has become even more of an essential utility. It's something that families need for children attending virtual school online, for expanding work opportunities, and for remotely accessing goods and services. This essential service is often unavailable or considered a luxury in many rural and lower-income urban communities. Data from the Census Bureau show that only about 65 percent of households in both rural and lower-income counties pay to have a subscription to internet services, compared with the national average of about 80 percent. 7\n\nA report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia also found income- and race-related gaps in both broadband availability and adoption rates across neighborhoods in Philadelphia. 8 Internet access has become necessary for those looking for a job, and, not surprisingly, the unemployment rate for those without a computer connected to the internet was about 3 percentage points higher than the unemployment rate for those with a computer with internet access . Investing in the infrastructure to increase broadband availability and to support broadband adoption in these communities could help close the employment gaps. Additionally, it can help level the playing field for children attending school, open opportunities for adults to pursue more stable and better-paying jobs and online education, and also enable access to online banking and other internet-based financial services.\n\nIn summary, it seems clear that much progress remains to be made in these areas. The Federal Reserve is committed to supporting the economic recovery and will do so through our monetary policy tools, supervisory responsibilities, and community development function . I'm looking forward to seeing how the opportunities from your collaborations and the creative solutions arising from this summit will help support vulnerable communities in adapting to and recovering from economic shocks. Through this approach, and with partnerships among practitioners like those here today, we can ensure that those who experienced the greatest effects from the pandemic are included in the economic recovery. Thank you again for this opportunity to be here today, and I wish you a productive and successful conference.\n\n1.

    "text": "February 22, 2021\n\nGovernor Michelle W. Bowman\n\nAt the \"Advance Together\" Celebration sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas (via webcast)\n\nThank you, President Kaplan, our Advance Together partners, and everyone here for joining us today. I am honored to participate in this event and welcome the awardees of this important initiative to celebrate your success. Today marks a significant milestone in this effort to improve economic opportunity for residents of 25 counties across the great state of Texas. The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas created Advance Together as a way to promote initiatives in Texas that reduce inequities in education and workforce development, and these Implementation Awards recognize outstanding examples of furthering those goals.\n\nThe Importance of Education and Workforce Development Initiatives At the Federal Reserve, our community development mission is to promote economic growth and financial stability across the country, particularly in vulnerable communities. The ability to access quality education and training to build workforce skills is critical for low-income workers seeking greater opportunity for themselves and their families. Likewise, reducing the disparities in labor market opportunities among individuals in our society helps to support broader economic growth and financial stability.\n\nThese issues have taken on even greater importance over the past year. The COVID-19 pandemic has upended our personal and professional lives and continues to cause economic hardship for many Americans. While the economy has recovered substantially from the effects of the pandemic, it is concerning to see signs that the improvements have been uneven, with some households continuing to struggle with unemployment and facing financial difficulty.\n\nInformation from the Federal Reserve Board's Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking, or SHED, provides evidence of these disparities. 1 In the July 2020 responses to the SHED, many households reported major employment disruptions due to COVID-19, including layoffs, reductions of hours, or unpaid leave. By mid-summer, many of the affected individuals had returned to work, and many were receiving unemployment insurance benefits and other financial assistance. Even so, unemployment remained very high in July, and 23 percent of SHED respondents said they were either \"just getting by\" or \"finding it difficult to get by.\" Not surprisingly, those experiencing employment disruptions disproportionately reported that they were likely to have difficulty paying their bills.\n\nThe survey showed that employment disruptions and financial challenges disproportionately affected people of color and low-income families. And, unlike during previous recessions, a larger share of working women than men were laid off from their jobs. 2\n\nFor many families, the pandemic exacerbated existing financial challenges. Economic mobility is largely driven by family financial stability and geographic resources such as transportation, quality education, and broadband access. The Fed's research and its ongoing work in community development show that there is no quick fix for the disparities in household financial stability. And no single organization or government agency can solve these complex problems alone.\n\nThe Importance of Collaborative Efforts This brings me to the importance of collaboration to address multidimensional community issues. While affordable housing and quality jobs are two very visible needs for low-income households, meeting these needs requires strategies that stretch across the fabric of the whole community, including childcare, education and training, transportation, and a safe and healthy environment. Collaboration between individuals and organizations of different talents and strengths can help find the kind of holistic solutions needed to bring greater opportunity to those at risk of being left behind in the recovery.\n\nToday, we are here to celebrate Advance Together, one such effort to foster economic inclusion through innovative and collaborative programs. In 2020, the Federal Reserve completed a review of \"place based\" community development initiatives, those focused on a single community or area, across its 12 districts. While the place-based initiatives varied in purpose, scope, and approach from community to community, the very best of those local collaborations are reflected in Advance Together's winning proposals. Most notably, each of these community-driven initiatives uses evidence-based research, fosters publicâprivate partnerships, and promotes a collective vision for success.\n\nThe four winners that we are honoring today are the Educate Midland and Education Partnership of the Permian Basin; the Big Country Manufacturing Alliance, based in Abilene; the Family Pathways 2-Gen Coalition in Austin; and the Deep East Texas College and Career Alliance.\n\nIt has truly been a pleasure to learn about the unique and innovative efforts each of you are undertaking to address the education and workforce challenges in your own communities. Members of the Educate Midland & Education Partnership are analyzing student data to deepen their understanding of student outcomes by race and to identify practices that can reduce inequities in education and workforce development that limit economic opportunity. The Big Country Manufacturing Alliance is streamlining training and job placement for young workers interested in manufacturing careers. The Family Pathways 2-Gen Coalition supports students with children on their path to a college degree. And, finally, the Deep East Texas College and Career Alliance is helping rural and first-generation college students attain post-secondary credentials that are in demand by employers.\n\nJust as Advance Together benefited from past place-based initiatives, the lessons learned from your local collaborations will inform and influence new community strategies going forward. I look forward to following your efforts to create economic opportunity in communities across Texas. It's really an honor to join in your celebration today. Congratulations to the winners and thank you to all of the participants.\n\n1.

    "text": "February 16, 2021\n\nGovernor Michelle W. Bowman\n\nAt the Conference for Community Bankers sponsored by the American Bankers Association (via prerecorded video)\n\nGood morning. I want to thank the American Bankers Association for inviting me to speak to you today. Two years ago, I gave my first speech as a Federal Reserve governor at this conference in San Diego, and it is always great to be with youâeven if remotely from our recording studio at the Board.\n\nIt's fair to say that a lot has happened over the past two years. It is an understatement to say that the COVID-19 pandemic has created significant challenges inside and outside the banking sector. Bankers significantly adapted operations to continue serving their communities and customers. You overcame staffing challenges and other hurdles, kept the virtual doors open, worked with your customers, and provided assistance to workers and businesses through the Paycheck Protection Program. Those efforts have made, and continue to make, a huge difference in the lives of many people affected by the pandemic, and I thank you.\n\nSince becoming a member of the Federal Reserve Board, I have made it a priority to enhance the Federal Reserve's dialogue with community bankers. I have embarked on an effort to meet with the leaders of every community bank and regional bank supervised by the Federal Reserve. This valuable interaction helps build an understanding of issues affecting small and regional banks, support supervisory decision-making, and shape some of my perspective. It has also helped the Federal Reserve identify initiatives to support the vital role of community banks in serving the financial needs of communities.\n\nToday, I would like to share my approach to supervision and regulation, which has helped guide the Fed's efforts to improve oversight of community banks over the past few years and shaped our priorities for 2021 and beyond. In most cases, my points about banking regulation also apply to supervision. I will then focus on several Federal Reserve initiatives that are underway to support community banks during the pandemic and into the future.\n\nThe first principle is fundamental to regulation but sometimes bears repeatingâregulation should always strike the right balance. For banking regulation, that means a balance between actions that promote safety and soundness and actions that promote an acceptable and manageable level of risk-taking. The challenge is doing neither too little to be effective to achieve the public benefit of government oversight, nor too much to prevent the regulated businesses from meeting their customers' needs. Some regulation is appropriate and necessary but striking the right balance means that at some point regulation can go too far and end up reducing the public's welfare. In recent years, the Federal Reserve and other agencies have made oversight more effective by better differentiating prudential regulation and supervision based on the asset size of banks, the complexity of their activities, and the related risks they pose to the financial system. This is especially important for community banks, most of which managed risks well before and during the 2008 financial crisis and have managed their risks well since. Achieving these principles also requires following consumer protection laws and regulations, including fair lending laws, to ensure fairness and broad access to credit and financial services that enable economic opportunity for individuals and communities.\n\nThe second principle is that the regulatory framework should be effective, but also efficient, and that means assessing the impact of the requirements. For the Federal Reserve, it means that we consider both a rule's benefit to safety and soundness and any potential negative effect, including limiting the availability of credit and services to the public, and the implications of compliance costs on banks. The wisdom in this approach is evident when considering the effect of a regulation on community banks and their role in providing financial services to their communities. Community banks have often been one of the few or only sources of credit and financial services to their customers. Their smaller operational scale relies on fewer staff to reach a more disbursed customer base with limited resources for compliance activities. Regulations should consider the potential impact on the availability of services in a community, as well as the costs to the bank of implementing a rule, particularly in more rural locations. It is necessary that a full and careful practical analysis of costs and benefits be a part of every rulemaking.\n\nThe third principle is that regulation and supervision should be consistent, transparent, and fair. Regulators are obligated by law to act in this manner, and it also makes good practical sense. These principles enhance safety and soundness and consumer compliance by making sure supervisory expectations are clear and that banks understand and respect the regulatory requirements. Supervisors should not and cannot be everywhere at every moment. But they should be available to provide clarification or answer questions when needed. A clear understanding of the rules and our expectations and a respect for the reasonable application of them is an effective approach to ensure effective compliance. By promoting respect and trust between regulators and the supervised institution, banks are more likely to communicate throughout the examination cycle to inform supervisors of changes they may be considering or challenges they may be facing and how best to resolve or approach them from a regulatory perspective.\n\nA final principle that flows from consistency, transparency, and fairness is that rules and supervisory judgments must have a legitimate prudential purpose, and in the majority of cases must not be solely punitive. The goal should be to encourage sound business practices and activities by supervised institutions. By clearly communicating our objectives, we build respect for the rules and make it more likely that any remedial actions against an institution will not be necessary because we encourage compliance through our supervisory approach. When a supervisory action or formal enforcement action is required to address violations at an institution, those actions should be framed in a way that seeks to promote safe, sound, and fair practices and not simply as punishment.\n\nThese principles that guide my approach to regulation and supervision are consistent with many of the major steps that the Federal Reserve has taken to improve community bank oversight since the implementation of the rules following the 2008 financial crisis. Some predate my arrival at the Fed, and some I have played a significant role in achieving. Most of these actions involve tailoring rules that treated community banks in the same way as larger, more complex institutions. For example, the Volcker rule was aimed at curbing proprietary trading by large banks, but it ended up creating significant compliance costs for community banks, which are not involved in this type of trading.\n\nMany of the most important improvements to the Federal Reserve's regulatory framework involve tailoring rules to fit to the size, business model, and risk profiles of community banks. For example, we raised the asset threshold for small banks to qualify for an 18-month exam cycle and similarly raised the threshold for small bank holding companies to be exempted from consolidated risk-based capital rules. The concept of tailoring is also expressed in our community bank supervisory framework, which has been updated to implement the Bank Exams Tailored to Risk (BETR) program. The BETR program allows examiners to identify higher and lower risk activities and, in turn, streamline the examination process for lower risk community banks, thereby reducing burden. In fact, Federal Reserve examiners have tailored examinations by spending approximately 65 percent less time on low/moderate risk state member bank exams than they do on high-risk exams. We also implemented the community bank leverage ratio that allows institutions to opt out of risk-based capital requirements. The Federal Reserve and the other agencies also raised the threshold for when an appraisal is required for residential real estate loans and tailored safety-and-soundness examinations of community and regional state member banks to reflect the levels of risk present and minimize regulatory burden for banks.\n\nThese improvements in regulation and supervision have helped right the balance I spoke of earlier between safety and soundness and consumer protection, on the one hand, and the ability to provide financial services and best meet the needs of their customers. We have also considered the impact of our actions, seeking to revise rules that impose significant costs to community banks but provide limited benefit to safety and soundness, consumer protection, or financial stability.\n\nAs a part of this approach, I have also prioritized efforts to improve the consistency, transparency, and reasonableness of regulation and supervision. One of those efforts is promoting greater consistency in supervisory practices across the Federal Reserve System. For example, we are actively working to improve the timeliness of providing banks with consumer compliance exam findings. Further, we are exploring ways to strengthen our ability to understand, monitor, and analyze the risks that are affecting community banks. A key aspect of consistency is ensuring the same supervisory approach and outcomes for similarly situated institutions, with the goal of ensuring, for example, that a \"one\" composite or component rating in a particular region would be the same for an institution with similar activities and practices in another region. This applies to all areas of our supervisory responsibility, whether safety and soundness, consumer compliance, or analyses of financial stability risk.\n\nI'd like to expand on one important area of focus, which is essential to the future success of the community banking sector: accessible innovation and technology integration. This subject is one that I speak about frequently with stakeholders and our staff at the Board. We are committed to developing a range of tools that will create pathways for banks to develop and pursue potential partnerships with fintech companies. This includes clearer guidance on third-party risk management, a guide on sound due diligence practices, and a paper on fintech-community bank partnerships and related considerations. These tools will serve as a resource for banks looking to innovate through fintech partnerships.\n\nTechnological developments and financial market evolution are quickly escalating competition in the banking industry, and our approach to analyzing the competitive effects of mergers and acquisitions needs to keep pace. The Board's framework for banking antitrust analysis hasn't changed substantially over the past couple of decades. I believe we should consider revisions to that framework that would better reflect the competition that smaller banks face in an industry quickly being transformed by technology and non-bank financial companies. As part of this effort, we have engaged in conversations and received feedback from community banks about the Board's competitive analysis framework and its impact on their business strategies and long-term growth plans. We are in the process of reviewing our approach, and we are specifically considering the unique market dynamics faced by small community banks in rural and underserved areas.\n\nSoon after the pandemic began early last year, the Federal Reserve took several actions to support community banks and their ability to help affected customers. We paused examinations and issued supervisory guidance that made it clear that we would not criticize or take public enforcement actions against a bank that was taking prudent steps to help customers and making good faith efforts to comply with regulations. This certainty of regulatory treatment created an environment that built trust between regulators and bankers. It enabled banks to continue to meet the needs of their customers who were struggling with circumstances through no fault of their own.\n\nLet me conclude by again commending the important role that community banks have played in providing financial services during these challenging times. You responded quickly to the needs of your customers and communities to provide financial services with limited, if any, interruption. You persevered to implement the largest proportion of Paycheck Protection Program funds to small businesses, whether they were your existing customers or new customers. These relationships are the hallmark of community banking, and as we look toward the future, community banks will continue to play an essential role in supporting customers, delivering financial services, and providing resources to their communities and customers.\n\nLet me stop here and thank the organizers for another opportunity to speak to you at this important conference. I look forward to your questions, Rob.\n\nGovernor Bowman on the Outlook for Community Banking",

    "text": "December 04, 2020\n\nGovernor Michelle W. Bowman\n\nAt Independent Community Bankers of America ThinkTECH Policy Summit (virtual event)\n\nThank you to the Independent Community Bankers of America (ICBA) for inviting me to address this year's policy summit. I am delighted to be speaking with you and especially pleased to see the summit's focus on innovation. The ThinkTech accelerator represents the type of resourcefulness necessary to help community banks tackle their greatest challenges, among them ensuring that banking services and credit support are available to customers in all communities, regardless of where they are located. Today, I will share my perspective that technological innovation is essential to the future of community banking in America, and reiterate my intent to elevate those issues related to innovation to the top of the regulatory agenda.\n\nThere are certain points in history when an event can fundamentally change how society and entire industries function. In addition to the other ways that COVID-19 has affected us, this could be one of those moments. The pandemic has demonstrated the importance and unique role of technology in responding effectively to new challenges. In this case, the challenge has been an unprecedented disruption in our lives. One year ago, it would have been difficult to imagine the extent to which we are now working and conducting routine aspects of our lives from home and online.\n\nTake health care as an example. One recent report on telemedicine trends notes that the number of patients treated through video-enabled physician visits has increased between 50 percent and 175 percent compared to before the pandemic. 1 While virtual consultations with a health care professional haven't replaced physical examinations and medical procedures, they are serving a vital role in the industry's response to the pandemic and they will likely play a significant role in how the health-care industry serves its customers in the future. When this health emergency has come to an end, I expect that telehealth, home grocery delivery, and a variety of online services and communications will continue at a higher frequency than before our recent experience.\n\nIn the financial sector, I believe we may be seeing a quantum leap in the use of digital deposit, digital payments and online lending. One large financial service provider reported a 200 percent increase in new mobile banking registrations during the early phases of the pandemic. 2 Customers who reacted to the physical limitation on visiting a bank branch or ATM are learning to bank using online banking or through an app on their smartphone may not be as willing to stand in line or wait for in-person service at their bank branch in the future. Recent surveys show that consumers with access to digital and mobile banking are more likely to continue using those convenience products and services in a post-pandemic world. 3\n\nThe adoption of digital banking services can also be essential for historically underserved and disadvantaged communities, assuming they have bank accounts and access to internet-based tools like smartphones. In some cases, fintech can lower costs and improve services, particularly for small businesses or lower-income consumers who are less likely to have access to credit. While electronic banking certainly didn't start with the pandemic, acceleration of its adoption has undoubtedly led banks of all sizes to rethink how they will meet their customers' needs in the long term.\n\nI have noted on many occasions how vital community banks are to those they serve and to a strong and stable financial system. Successful innovation is not just about adopting the latest technologies. It involves aligning a bank's strategy with its innovation plans to clearly map a purpose and desired outcome for the adoption of new technology. The continued success of many community banks depends on their willingness to engage in strategy-based innovation-led growth. We have seen and are encouraged by many examples of entrepreneurial community banks embracing technological innovation. Developments such as digital deposit and lending products, regulatory technology solutions, and application program interfaces (APIs) have increasingly become more popular in the banking industry. When implemented effectively, they can result in greater efficiencies and effectiveness.\n\nA number of community banks have already taken advantage of these opportunities. Still, perspectives on the need for change vary across the industry. I recognize that while it seems clear that the industry is changing, there remains a wide distance between fintech's promise of a future driven by technology and what many community bankers experience today. From my perspective, it is unlikely that fintech will ever completely eliminate what is the hallmark of community bankingâpersonal interaction and building relationships with customers and communities.\n\nOne trend is clear, however: more and more community banks are expressing interest in fintech partners to help them open new lines of business, help with customer acquisition, enhance customer service, and improve operational functions. Through the Fed's engagement with fintech companies and small banks during our Innovation Office Hours, we learned that a wide range of partnership models are emerging, with varying benefits and challenges. Some banks are engaged in customer-oriented partnerships, where a bank selects a fintech partner to improve the customer experience, develop new products or services, or acquire new customers. In one case, a bank partnered with a fintech company to centralize each customer's financial data and provide personal financial management tools. Other banks are engaging fintech partners to automate or improve the efficiency and effectiveness of compliance and regulatory processes, which is often referred to as \"regtech.\" For example, a fintech partner automating the Bank Secrecy Act/anti-money-laundering process may be able to provide notable cost savings and enhance compliance, while freeing up resources for other areas. We have also seen instances where a bank offers its financial services to a fintech partner that, in turn, offers financial products or services to its customers. In this type of relationship, a bank plays an important part in the delivery of products and services. The list goes on. My point is there is great possibility and a wide variety of options for engagement. And everyone, from the banks to customers to the regulators, needs to be thinking about these changes and their implications.\n\nWith the emergence of additional core-service providers, we are also seeing more opportunities for community banks to access the technology infrastructure they need to improve basic banking activities. These basic banking activities include tasks like reconciling transactions to the general ledger or simply offering expanded digital services. Furthermore, there are new opportunities for integration of cloud-based platforms and APIs. Community banks should take advantage of the new technologies that make sense for their business and the communities they serve.\n\nStill, even as community banks prepare for the future, there is the very real challenge of finding partners and knowing how to navigate the regulatory environment once an institution has identified a potential partnership arrangement. We certainly understand this concern. From the fintech perspective, one provider noted the challenges they face during the onboarding process with financial institutions, including struggles to navigate siloed compliance and risk-management functions. Participants in the Fed's Innovation Office Hours told us that they would benefit from the Fed broadly sharing information on the current landscape of such partnerships, on a range of practices, and on relevant guidance for banks to consider.\n\nIn response, early next year we plan to publish a white paper that documents examples of community bank partnerships with fintech companies and outlines effective practices for managing those arrangements. This white paper would describe a range of distinct options for such partnerships and seek to identify benefits and challenges of the different approaches. We are also continuing to pursue a range of community bank projects to provide pathways to innovation that I mentioned earlier this year.\n\nWhile it is essential to safety and soundness that banks understand, monitor, and mitigate risks associated with their third parties, I am sensitive to the burden that due diligence can pose. Being unsure of the questions to ask a third-party vendor, or whether a response is sufficient, should not keep community banks from accessing innovation, yet we continue to hear that these are real challenges. To address this problem, I have directed Federal Reserve staff to work with their interagency colleagues to develop a vendor due diligence guide, aligned with existing supervisory expectations, which would include sample questions for vendors and guidance on appropriate responses. This guide would also be specific about the documents and information that community banks need in order to successfully complete their due diligence.\n\nIn addition to the due diligence guide, I expect that Federal Reserve staff will work with our colleagues at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to enhance and align interagency guidance for third-party risk management. The guidance would eliminate the need for community banks to navigate multiple supervisory guidance documents on the same issue. It is my expectation that the combination of refreshed and aligned interagency guidance and the community bank due diligence guide will meaningfully enhance clarity on supervisory expectations for community bank partnerships with fintech companies.\n\nThere are also opportunities within our existing supervisory program to improve our regulatory response to innovation, without creating additional burden for community banks. The federal banking agencies' service provider supervision program plays an important role in assessing the rigor of risk management and controls at key service providers. It is important that reports of supervisory assessments be readily available to banks that rely on service providers so that banks can use the reports to support their third-party risk management. Since I last spoke about the program in February, the federal regulatory agencies have made notable progress in creating a process to automatically distribute those reports to all client banks. Proactively sending reports to community banks removes the inefficient step of each bank hunting for reports on their own. For banks supervised by the Fed, the aim is to begin automatic distribution in the first quarter of 2021.\n\nFinally, I would note that as we consider the types of financial services technology that may be useful to the banks we supervise, our rules and guidance need to keep pace. The Federal Reserve is also considering whether the rise of artificial intelligence and machine learning in banking might require an adjustment in regulation and supervision. AI is becoming more prevalent in customer service and machine learning can offer real opportunities to assess risk and find new customers.\n\nCommunity banks face limits on the resources they can dedicate to researching and evaluating third party providers of these new services. Regulators and supervisors should consider ways to encourage innovation by simplifying the process of third party selection, due diligence and monitoring. 4 To that end, staff from the Federal Reserve and other agencies have been jointly conducting significant outreach to industry and other stakeholders over the past several months. We want to hear from you. In addition to this outreach, a conference planned for January, 2021 will include views from academic researchers on the potential benefits and risks posed by artificial intelligence for banks of all sizes.\n\nTechnological innovation holds great promise to help community banks compete and succeed in the evolving financial services landscape. I look forward to continuing to engage on these issues in 2021 and to work with the ICBA and other stakeholders to foster an environment where communities and the banks that serve them continue to thrive.\n\n1.

    "text": "May 05, 2021\n\nGovernor Michelle W. Bowman\n\nAt The Colorado Forum, Denver, Colorado (via webcast)\n\nThank you for this opportunity to address the members of the Colorado Forum, which has been an arena for thoughtful discussion and debate for more than 40 years. Today I would like to discuss a subject that I expect is of great interest to Coloradans and others: the outlook for the U.S. economy in 2021. I believe that the economy has gained momentum in the past several months and is well positioned to grow strongly in 2021. Nevertheless, we have further to go to recover from the economic damage inflicted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and risks remain.\n\nAs we all know, starting in late February or March of last year, widespread economic and social lockdowns and other effects of the pandemic caused the swiftest and deepest contraction in employment and economic activity since the Great Depression. Money markets, the Treasury market, and other parts of the financial system seized up, and there were fears of another severe financial crisis. The Federal Reserve stepped in quickly to assist, reviving several lending facilities used in the previous crisis and creating several new facilities. We also cut short-term interest rates to near zero and began purchasing large quantities of Treasury and agency securities to help sustain the flow of credit to households and businesses. Congress and the Administration also worked together to provide effective and timely support. Calm was restored in financial markets, and employment and output began growing in May, but it was a very deep hole to fill. Since that time, progress in controlling the pandemic has been a dominant force driving the economic recovery. Rapid progress last summer gave way to slower economic growth over the turn of the year, as infection rates once again surged. But after a substantial pickup in vaccinations and steep declines in virus-related hospitalizations and deaths, the economic outlook has brightened. Job creation had stalled over the winter months but improved again starting in February. Over the past year, we've seen a return of nearly 14 million jobs.\n\nAnother significant factor contributing to the recovery is the resilience of private-sector businesses. Our economic recovery has been more rapid and stronger than many forecasters expected, partly due to the ability of businesses to adapt to conditions that none of them had planned for, and few even imagined could be possible. Initially, government assistance was important, but millions of businesses were at risk of closure. Instead, many are open and growing today due to the resourcefulness and determination of entrepreneurs and workers and their ability to adjust business plans and operations to deal with the effects of social-distancing and operating restrictions. Of course, technology helped a great deal, but businesses were able to find many other ways to maintain operations and sustain their connections to customers. In writing the history of these eventful times, I hope that the efforts of these businesses and the strength of America's market-based economy get the considerable credit they deserve.\n\nRecently, the incoming data indicate that economic activity is on an upswing, and the risks of more negative outcomesâespecially those from COVID-19âappear to be easing. Vaccinations and the easing of operating and social-distancing restrictions are boosting consumer and business confidence, with the results clear to see in the data on spending. Retail sales surged nearly 10 percent in March and are actually above the trendline that was interrupted by the pandemic a year ago. One particularly encouraging signal in that report was a sharp expansion in spending on food services. I hope this is an indication that consumers are finally returning to in-person dining as spring arrives and local authorities allow restaurants to accommodate more diners. If so, and my fingers are crossed, it is a very good sign of further progress in one of the sectors hardest hit by the pandemic.\n\nIn the job market, job gains rebounded to 916,000 in March. At our March meeting, my view was broadly in line with the median of projections of other members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which anticipated the economy would grow between 5.8 percent and 6.6 percent in 2021. But the outlook has improved since then, and it now appears that real gross domestic product may increase close to or even above the higher end of that range. This annual increase would be the largest in 36 years.\n\nLikewise, the FOMC median in March was for unemployment to fall to 4.5 percent at the end of 2021, and now it seems possible that it may fall even further. With the economy continuing to reopen, I expect the pace of job creation to remain unusually strong over the spring and summer. Over the past few months many schools have resumed some form of in-person learning, which should translate into a rebound in labor force participation as more parents overseeing virtual education and child care are able to increase hours or return to the workforce.\n\nThe biggest risk to the outlook continues to be the course of the pandemic. I see good reasons to be optimistic. Vaccinations are proceeding at a rapid pace, and this progress is supporting decisions by state and local leaders to relax economic restrictions. Most importantly, deaths related to the virus have continued to fall steadily and are at roughly the rate as in early October of last year. I remain hopeful that progress in the economic recovery can stay ahead of new challenges that might emerge, like the spread of new virus variants. That would allow states and localities to continue easing economic and social distancing restrictions and encourage consumers and businesses to return to normal activities. I understand that in Colorado, for example, officials are considering lifting social-distancing restrictions on individuals and businesses. I would be interested to hear from this group about how businesses in Colorado have been faring and whether they have seen an improvement in demand as the pandemic conditions are easing.\n\nWhile I am optimistic about the ongoing recovery, one lesson of the past year is the significant degree of uncertainty about the course of the virus and its effect on the economy. We experienced periods of considerable progress last year, but we saw some of that progress overtaken by waves of the infection late in the year. Likewise, economic growth rebounded much more quickly than many had expected, but then slowed late in 2020 before regaining speed following the availability of the vaccine. Even with recent encouraging reports on food services, activity in the travel, leisure, and hospitality sectors is still severely compromised, but is showing glimmers of activity. It may be some time before we know whether old habits will resume or new habits have developed that may define a post-pandemic new normal. As I noted in a recent speech, I am particularly concerned about the longer-term effect on small businesses, many of which have held on with government aid and loan forbearance programs that will soon expire. 1 It will be several months before we know the final count of permanent small business closures from 2020, but it could be more than we expect.\n\nI will now turn to how the Federal Reserve is proceeding in light of the strong signals of momentum building in the economy. The economic recovery is not yet complete, and the uncertain course of the pandemic still presents risks in the near term, which is why my colleagues and I on the FOMC decided last week to maintain our highly accommodative stance of monetary policy. Despite the progress to date and the signs of acceleration in the recovery, employment is still considerably short of where it was when the pandemic disrupted the economy and it is well below where it should be, considering the pre-pandemic trend. In particular, our maximum employment mandate is intended as a broad and inclusive goal increasing employment and opportunity, but I remain concerned that employment gains for some minority groups have lagged behind those of others. While job creation has been and is expected to remain strong, the pace will eventually slow as the share of those who have been unemployed for the longer-term increases among those who are looking for work. We are making good progress toward our full employment goal, but we still have a long way to go, and risks remain.\n\nThis brings me to the other side of our policy mandate. Over the next several months, I expect that headline inflation measures will move above our long-run target of 2 percent. A main reason I expect this outcome is simply the fact that the very low inflation readings during last spring's deep economic contraction will drop from the usual calculation of 12-month price changes. But in addition, the unusually rapid rebound in economic activity that we've seen, along with the pandemic-driven shift towards goods purchases, has led to supply-chain bottlenecks in a number of areas, which in turn have pushed up prices for many goods. One prominent example is with semiconductor producers and their need to dramatically alter the mix of production to meet demands of the high-tech and automotive industries. Although I expect these upward price pressures to ease after the temporary supply bottlenecks are resolved, the exact timing of that dynamic is uncertain. If the supply bottlenecks prove to be more long-lasting than currently expected, I will adjust my views on the inflation outlook accordingly. At this point, the risk that inflation remains persistently above our long-run target of 2 percent still appears small.\n\nIn summary, let me say that I am encouraged by the recent pace of the economic recovery, and I remain optimistic that this strength will continue in the coming months. One reason for my optimism is that businesses have been effective in responding to the challenges posed by the pandemic and by economic restrictions implemented in efforts to contain it. We really can't know how the pandemic will proceed and how that will affect the U.S. economy, but I think we are currently on a good path, and our policy is in a good place. Thank you again for inviting me to speak to you today, and I would be happy to respond to your questions.\n\n1. See Michelle W.
